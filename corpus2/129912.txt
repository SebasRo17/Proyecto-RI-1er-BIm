I have some experience with Perforce, SVN, and TFS. For SVN, The source files were by default writable after synchronization. However, they were readonly for Perforce, as well as TFS if memory served me.   Meanwhile, 'checkout' means source sync for SVN but its meaning is quite different for other popular tools. I'm wondering which is more 'correct' behavior and why these tools behave differently.   Thanks.
