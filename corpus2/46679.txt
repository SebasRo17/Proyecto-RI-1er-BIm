I am using NDSolve for a Langevin dynamics problem. I want to the know long term behaviour of my system ($t>1$) but it has to be simulated with very small time steps ($dt\sim 10^{-9}$). An example code:               R[t_Real]:= RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[0,1]]          NDSolve[       {(-x''[t] - k1*x'[t] + k2*R[t])==0, x[0]==0, x'[0]==0} //.values,       x,       {t, 0, 10},       StartingStepSize-> 10^-9,       Method->{"FixedStep",Method->"ExplicitEuler"},       MaxSteps->\[Infinity]     ]      **The Problem:** My computer runs out memory when trying to store $10^{10}$ data points necessary for this computation. Is there a way to sample and store only a small subset of all the integration points?
