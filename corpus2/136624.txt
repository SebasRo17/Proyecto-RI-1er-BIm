What is the proper terminology for a small (2-4) set of tightly coupled classes? These classes can't work independently. I was thinking _system_ , but after googling for a bit, I've determined that the word is typically used to describe the software as a whole. Then, I thought of _subsystem_ , but I don't know if the term applies if the number of classes in the subsystem is small. What do you guys think? This is for a presentation for a professor who wants me to provide definitions for everything. **Edit:** Essentially, I am describing various ways to architect game object _systems_ , found in game engines. I'm using the term _system_ as a way to include all the classes involved in the game object apparatus. Calling it a _game object system_ feels right to me, but I'm not sure if it is the right terminology. I don't view game objects as a _layer_ , since it doesn't really work as a layer in a game engine. A _module_ or _package_ , to me, seem more suitable for a bunch of purely functional or stateless classes. If I am not making sense, please let me know!
