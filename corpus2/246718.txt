**_Abstract:_** So, as I understand it (although I have a very limited understanding), there are three dimensions that we (usually) work with physically: The 1st would be represented by a line.   The 2nd would be represented by a square.   The 3rd would be represented by a cube. Simple enough until we get to the 4th -- It is kinda hard to draw in a 3D space, if you know what I mean... Some people say that it has something to do with time. **_The Question:_** Now, though that doesn't all make much sense, that is all great with me. My question isn't about this, or I'd be asking it on MathSO or PhysicsSO. My question is: **How does the computer handle this with arrays?** I know that you can create 4D, 5D, 6D, etc... arrays in many different programming languages, but I want to know how that works.
