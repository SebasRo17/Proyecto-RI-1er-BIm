What is the benefit of using functional program for large scale software projects? I have heard it is pretty performance equivalent to regular OOP. I also have heard that it is more "mathematically elegant." Either way what are the benefits of doing large scale applications functionally? In particular why would the switch from C# to scala make sense in order to take advantage of scala's functional capabilities?
