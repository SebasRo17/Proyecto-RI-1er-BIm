For political reasons, management seems intent on keeping a project progressing, but stripping away the most senior developers to perform other higher-priority tasks. Instead one more junior developer will be working on the project while consulting periodically with senior devs. Ostensibly the project will keep progressing, but at a much slower pace on the back burner. This seemingly satisfies both those that need the senior devs to fight fires and those that want to see the project continue to be worked on. In theory the senior devs will come back full time 6 mos from now to finish off the project. Is this a good idea? What problems could this cause? Would it be better to completely staff or completely halt the project and finish other stuff?
