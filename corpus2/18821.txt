Say I want to do the following:               Reduce[ x+y+z==1, {x,y,z}, Modulus -> 7 ]      then I get a solution with parameters, `C[1]` : > >     x == 1 + 6 C[1] + 6 C[2] && y == C[2] && z == C[1] >   Now, for non-linear equations, such as               Reduce[x + y^2 + z == 1, {x, y, z}, Modulus -> 7]      I get a complete list of solutions, here are the first `5` of them :               %[[ ;; 5]]      > >     (x == 0 && y == 0 && z == 1) || (x == 0 && y == 1 && z == 0) || >     (x == 0 && y == 2 && z == 4) || (x == 0 && y == 3 && z == 6) || >     (x == 0 && y == 4 && z == 6) >   Is there a way to make the system yield this type of output also in the first case ? (Of course, I can just loop over all possibilities of the parameter and get a complete list, but I'd prefer to make _Mathematica_ do it for me if it is possible.)
