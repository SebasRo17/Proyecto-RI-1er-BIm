I have read an article with following example:               void func()     {     if (condition1)     a = a + 1;     if (condition2)     a = a - 1;     }      It says the CC is 3 as there are three possible paths. How come? Why not 4? I Would expect TRUE,TRUE; FALSE,FALSE; TRUE, FALSE and FALSE, TRUE. Does not matter what the statements are. CC=Ifs-EndPoints+2. It is always 3 for 2 IFs and one ending..
