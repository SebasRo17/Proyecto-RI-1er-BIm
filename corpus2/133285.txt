I wonder if there is any reason - or if it is just an accident of history - that there are no `!>` and `!<` operators in _most_ programming languages? `a >= b` _(a greater OR equals b)_ could be written as `!(a < b)` _(a NOT lesser b)_ , that equals `a !< b`. This question struck me when I was in the middle of coding my own expression tree builder. Most programming languages have `a != b` operator for `!(a=b)`, so why no `!>` and `!<` ? _UPDATE:_   * `!<` (not lesser) is **easier to pronounce** than `>=` (greater or equals)   * `!<` (not lesser) is **shorter to type** than `>=` (greater or equals)   * `!<` (not lesser) is **easier to understand*** than `>=` (greater or equals) *because `OR` is binary operator you brain need to operate two operands (grater, equals), while `NOT` is unary operator and you brain need to operate only with one operand (lesser).
