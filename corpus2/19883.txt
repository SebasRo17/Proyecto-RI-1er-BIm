I would like to transform rules algebraically. A very simple example would be: -               k^2 - 2 k x + x^2 /. {2*k -> 1}      This transforms to: - $$k^2-2 k x+x^2$$ However, I would like it to return something more like: - $$\frac{1}{4}- x+x^2$$ In fact, I am more interested in solving quadratic, cubic and quartic polynomials. For example, I am able to set the discriminant of a quadratic to zero as a rule since the solution of a quadratic is already in an expanded form: -               quadratic = a*x^2 + b*x + c     Solve[quadratic == 0, x]  /. { Discriminant[quadratic, x] -> 0 }      This yields the correct results: - $$\left\{\left\{x\to -\frac{b}{2 a}\right\},\left\{x\to -\frac{b}{2 a}\right\}\right\}$$ To achieve something similar for the cubic one must expand the solution while also transforming the discriminant.               cubic := a*x^3 + b*x^2 + c*x + d;     ExpandAll[Solve[cubic == 0 , x]] /. { Expand[-27*a^2*Discriminant[cubic, x]] -> 0 }      This process requires some forward thinking and doesn't easily apply to a quartic. I am hoping Mathematica has some built in transformation rules for substituting expressions algebraically (obviously assuming certain criteria, i.e field/ring etc..) Does anyone have any suggestions?
