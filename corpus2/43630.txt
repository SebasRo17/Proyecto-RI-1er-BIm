I'm developing a code where I get graphs with over 10K nodes. These graphs have a particular relationship between clustering and degree that I need to save for future analysis. The problem is when I use `EdgeList` and then save the list in a _Mathematica_ file (.nb), when I recall it, the size of some communities are different to the ones showed by the graph. The following sizes are obtained after change the graph by the `EdgeList`               Community = FindGraphCommunities[g];     aux = Length[#] & /@ FindGraphCommunities[g]      > >     {1845, 1656, 1536, 1419, 1206, 441, 349, 342, 210, 205, 168, 126, >               113, 103, 73, 58, 57, 45, 40, 8} >   Then I use `EdgeList[g]`, click on Show full Output and copy the entire cell and save it into the file.nb. When I call again the graph `g3` from the file.nb it gives me the following sizes               g = g3;     Community = FindGraphCommunities[g];     aux = Length[#] & /@ FindGraphCommunities[g]      > >      {1884, 1766, 1720, 1364, 643, 420, 420, 394, 266, 218, 211, 159, 117, >             101, 93, 76, 29, 28, 24, 21, 20, 16, 10} >   I don't know what happen there, could be the command `EdgeList` or something behind...Then I try to save the graph by Exporting it as a `gml` file and after 10 minutes it was still running... So, do you have any suggestion for this, how can I export efficiently this information or do I have to wait for the exportation in `gml` format?
