Consider an application that stores a set of records that contain:   * Description   * Cost   * Purchase Date I'd like to be able to allow users to utilize natural language to search the dataset. For example, the search expression: > blue from last month less than $20 would translate into (Linq as an example only - correctness of the query is not in question):               _db.Widgets.Where(w => w.Description.Contains('blue') && w.PurchaseDate >= DateTime.Now.AddMonths(-1) && w.Cost < 20)      I'm struggling to find a starting point. Any resources to get me in the right direction would be appreciated (I am working in .NET).
