I want to plot values of a table for example:               table = {0.456, 0.7899, 1.3456, 9.8908}      But I want to Plot points (x,y) like:               (0,0.456), (1,0.7899),(2,1.3456),(3,9.8908)      And the ListPlot commend generates the plot for vaues of x from range `{1,10}`, so points like: `(1,0.456),(2,0.7899),(3,1.3456)...` How can I change to plot from $0$ points which I described?
