I'm creating a few closed-source applications on my own (no big company behind me) and am wondering exactly how to protect them. At the top of all the source code files I have this pretty basic copyright notice:               /*******************************************************      * Copyright (C) 2010-2011 {name} <{email}>      *       * This file is part of {project}.      *       * {project} can not be copied and/or distributed without the express      * permission of {name}      *******************************************************/      However I'm really starting to think that's not enough. Without the money to get a lawyer, I'm interested in any closed-source license that essentially says "You can use it, and that's it". Finding one has been extremely difficult as I can only find open source license comparisons or "Find a lawyer" answers. Is there any closed-source license _that I can use_ that says something similar to this?
