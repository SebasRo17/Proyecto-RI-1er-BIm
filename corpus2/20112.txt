When multiple curves appear in a single plot, it is useful to interactively turn certain curves on or off to visually compare smaller numbers of curves. It is trivial to put a quick dynamic together, as in this toy example               funcs = {Sin[x], Cos[x], Tanh[x]};      checked = ltexts = {"sin", "cos", "tanh"};      Column[{TogglerBar[Dynamic[checked], ltexts],         Dynamic[Block[{sel},           sel = Sort[checked /. Thread[ltexts -> Range[Length[ltexts]]]];            Plot[funcs[[sel]], {x, 0, 3*Pi}, PlotLegends -> ltexts[[sel]]]]]}]      ![Trivial example of curve toggling, output from the code above](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7rDLo.png) This approach, is a one-off solution. I am looking for a more elegant solution that can be applied to any plot, with a user interface that is a natural to the problem. The buttonbar above the plot is not a natural interface. Clicking on the curve or legend would be a natural action to toggle a curve's visibility. I intend to answer my own question, which I humbly propose as a reusable solution, but I would like to ask the community for improvements or enhancements.
