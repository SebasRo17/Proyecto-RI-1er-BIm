I would like to know if people have already asked back some technical questions to your interviewer. Saying something like "Well, you asked me a bunch of technical questions, and now, do you mind if I ask you some? If I am going to join your company, we will work closely together and I want to make sure my I respect the skills of my coworkers like they respect mine...". Doesn't it sound arrogant? I am curious to have your opinion or experience (as the interviewee or the interviewer, of course). P.S: throwaway account as I dont want that people who know me know I am preparing interviews.
