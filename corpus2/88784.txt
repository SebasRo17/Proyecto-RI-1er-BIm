You can often hear that programmers should learn many different languages to improve themselves. I still go to school and don't have big programming experience (a little more than year). But what was noble intention to improve programming skills turned into some kind of OCD: I feel that **I won't calm down until I learn all relatively known programming languages.** And here is question itself: Will being programming languages polyglot actually help you (And I don't mean usual "Programmer should know at least all paradigms", I mean really **all** languages you usually hear about)? Does anybody have similar experience? Does it help with job/skills/career? How often are you able to apply those skills?
