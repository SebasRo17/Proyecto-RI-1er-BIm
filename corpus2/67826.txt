I've recently switched from being an employee to self-employment. However, on lots of days I spend a lot of time being unproductive and procrastinating. Many of my days look like once described by Joel Spolsky, it takes some time till I can start working. When I was still an employee in a company, this was part of my working hours. Now, I have the problem that I feel bad about billing my customers the time I'm not really working, but waiting to start working. On the other hand, I wouldn't be procrastinating if I would not work for the customers. How do you deal with this issue? Do you charge your customers for that time?
