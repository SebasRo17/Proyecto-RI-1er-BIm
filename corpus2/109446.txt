So I recently came across this question - Make a function that converts a in- level-order binary tree into a doubly linked list. Apparently, it's a common interview question. This is the strategy I had - Simply do a pre-order traversal of the tree, and instead of returning a node, return a list of nodes, in the order in which you traverse them. i.e return a list, and append the current node to the list at each point. For the base case, return the node itself when you are at a leaf. so you would say               left = recursive_function(node.left)     right = recursive_function(node.right)     return(left.append(node.data)).append(right);`      Is this the right approach?
