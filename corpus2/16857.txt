I can't decide what is a best color for the background for a Manipulate I am writing. So, I thought since this is Manipulate, why not make this part configurable as well, so one can change the RGB color (using something like 3 sliders, one for each channel), so depending on the mood at that moment, one can choose different background color until they find one that they prefer. But I am not sure how this can be done since `BaseStyle` is set when Manipulate itself is created. BaseStyle is an option and not a command. Here is a small example of a Manipulate. I did not show the sliders for selecting the RGB color, since I do not know if it is even possible to modify the BaseStyle yet. This is just a toy Manipulate that just plots a sin function with greenish color for background of the Manipulate.               Manipulate[      {},      {m, 1, 10},           Grid[{{Dynamic[          Plot[Sin[x], {x, -m, m}, ImageSize -> 200, Frame -> True,ImagePadding -> 30]]}}       ],           Paneled -> False,      ContentSize -> {0},      Frame -> False,      Alignment -> Center,      AppearanceElements -> "ManipulateMenu",      BaseStyle -> {Background -> RGBColor[.80, .80, .90]}      ]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nT0JU.png) **The question is** : How to modify the Background color dynamically using an input from the user (via sliders, not shown). Is it possible? I just like to know the syntax if possible, and I can do the rest. http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/BaseStyle.html http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Background.html I am using V9. Please note that any solution can't use global variables. This is for a demo for WRI web site, and one of the rules is that no global variables are allowed (since they will interact with other copies of the Manipulate). **update** Using the official demonstration style sheet, when using `ContentSize -> {0}` and `Paneled -> False`, , Manipulate background is white by default. I thought that giving it little color might be nice. Here is an example               Manipulate[      {},      {m, 1, 10},           Grid[{{Dynamic[          Plot[Sin[x], {x, -m, m}, ImageSize -> 200, Frame -> True,            ImagePadding -> 30]]}}       ],      Paneled -> False,      ContentSize -> {0},      Alignment -> Center,      AppearanceElements -> "ManipulateMenu"      ]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/g8ads.png) You might ask, well, this is because I set `Paneled->False` and this is true. But this was the only way to get rid of the small mark that remain there as result of doing `ContentSize -> {0}`. And there is no way to remove this mark. Here is an example               Manipulate[      {},      {m, 1, 10},           Grid[{{Dynamic[          Plot[Sin[x], {x, -m, m}, ImageSize -> 200, Frame -> True,            ImagePadding -> 30]]}}       ],      Paneled -> True,      ContentSize -> {0},      Alignment -> Center,      AppearanceElements -> "ManipulateMenu"      ]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/x14yY.png) That little square there at the corner, is impossible to get rid off. Only way is to do `Paneled->False`. That marker is a big problem, and here is a related question I asked about it before. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8556234/how-to-not-show-the-scrollbars- when-contentsize-does-not-fit-the-content-in-mani If I can figure a way to remove this tiny white spot, then I can leave `Paneled->True`. ps. I have to use `ContentSize -> {0}`. This is how I did the whole demo. Everything in the control area. No way to change this. Looking now at the demo I have, this white spot is very small, may be no one will notice it. At least this way I do not have to change the 'official' background color. I will check on this and see. It is just annoying one can't get rid of it. Here is a screen shot, where I set `Paneled->True` again. I put small circle around it. If the demo editor says it is ok, then I am all set, do not need to change background color. Will ask. **Update 12/23/12** Ok, figured how remove last piece of code from the Manipulate expression and replaced it with `None`. So finally the white line marker is gone. Problem resolved. Using `None` was the trick that was needed thanks to Michael E2. Here it is (it is 2 panels, and one can select full screen or not using a checkbox). One of the hardest things, is getting the sizes of the different plots correct and to fill the whole space in the grid. I spend half the time trying different values (aspect ratio, image sizes, padding, margins, etc.. for many things until I find the right combination. There got to be better way to do this but if there is, I do not know what it is). But this one is now finally done. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Adrzn.png) thanks,
