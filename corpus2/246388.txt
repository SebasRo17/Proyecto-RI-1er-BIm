In my nodejs project, I have functions like this for socketio.               socket.on('draw', function (data) {         socket.broadcast.to(socket.room).emit('draw', data);         addEvent(socket, ["draw", data]);     });      I'd like to rewrite them to something like this:               function onDraw(socket, config) {         return function (data) {             socket.broadcast.to(socket.room).emit('draw', data);             addEvent(socket, ["draw", data]);         }     }          socket.on('draw', onDraw(socket, config));      The idea is that by placing all of my functions in simple closures like this, I can put them in different modules and it will make it easier to test by passing mockup objects to the function that construct the callback. **I was wondering if it was overkill or if there is a better way to make my code testable?**
