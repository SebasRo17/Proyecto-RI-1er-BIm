My company needs to hire a PHP developer, but nobody has PHP knowledge in my company and we find difficult to test for PHP skills. If it were a C/Java developer I would ask him to write a quick implementation of the Game of Life, but PHP is a completely different language. I saw this test with interest: http://vladalexa.com/scripts/php/test/test_php_skill.html Anyone else has more suggestions?
