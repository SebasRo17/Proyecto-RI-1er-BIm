I'm trying to install RLink here.               Needs["RLink`"]     InstallR[]      After downloading it throws an error:               InstallR::fail: Failed to install R. The following error was     encountered: Unable to load dynamic libraries >>      And then:               RSet["myVar",10]     JLink`Java::excptn: A Java exception occurred: com.wolfram.links.rlink.exceptions.RLinkException: Unable to load dynamic libraries         at com.wolfram.links.rlink.RLinkInit.<init>(Unknown Source)         at com.wolfram.links.rlink.RLinkInit.getInstance(Unknown Source)         at com.wolfram.links.rlink.RLinkInit.getRExecutor(Unknown Source).

The last error message issued by R was StringReplace[StringTrim[First[$Failed]],RLinkFunctionHash12345[[~~DigitCharacter..~~]]:><function>] >>     $Failed      It isn't java's fault. I've tried pointing `JRELocation` option of `InstallR` to different JREs, error stays the same. I'm on Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit.
