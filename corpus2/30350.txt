Dear users I am a new member here and I would like to ask a question about `PlotLegends`. I have multiple curves and want to make their legends bit more _visible_. Here is a sample code:               Plot[{Sin[h], Cos[h], Tan[h]}, {h, 5, 10},        PlotStyle -> {{GrayLevel[0], Dashing[None],Thickness[0.005]},                      {GrayLevel[0], Dashing[0.01],Thickness[0.005]},                      {GrayLevel[0], Dashing[0.02],Thickness[0.005]},                      {GrayLevel[0], Dashing[0.03],Thickness[0.005]}},        Axes -> False, Frame -> True,       PlotLegends -> Placed[{"sin", "cos", "tan"}, Top]]      I assume that the problem comes from the `Dashing[]` specifications making the legends line not _visible_ enough.I may have up to 7 curves so i need and alternative to `Dashing[]` or any other way to increase lengths of legends and make them more _visible_.
