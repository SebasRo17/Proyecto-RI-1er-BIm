I read an article online which I give the reference to below which compare between Native apps and web apps, in addition to standard website. It seems from that article that native apps are faster than web apps and websites. However, that was not clear for me. > ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Pym4H.png) Could a native app be built to be used exactly as a website? meaning could the functions in a social website, for example, be programmed as a native app? In this case isn't that going to use a server-side language? Then what make it faster if even the website and the web app use the same thing? http://www.mobi-cart.com/native-vs-web.jsp
