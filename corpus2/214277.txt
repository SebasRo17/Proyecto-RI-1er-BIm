**As a user:** When I have good instructions to follow I'm sure I could do just about anything. With poor instructions I end up frustrated, wasting time and probably giving up. The type of instruction I see most is the procedure. I use multiple operating systems with different tools, so the type of procedure I usually see I call multi-goal procedures. Please let me know if there is a more correct or better term for these! I'm sure you have encountered multi-goal procedures like this before:               How to install MegaWidget for Linux      1. Download and install foo library      2. Read note below about foo      3. Download bar source      4. Compile and install bar      5. Download MegaWidget source      6. Compile and install MegaWidget          Windows installation      1. Follow steps 1, 2 and 3 above      2. Download yet_another_cross_platform_build_system and install it      3. Edit the configuration file for bar and change X to Y      4. See step 4 above. Make sure to use yet_another_cross_platform_build_system though.      5. See step 5 above.          Windows 64bit installation      Follow the 32bit Windows instructions, but you also have to install Super64Library before you install bar.          About foo:      The foo library exists only to cause you pain and suffering.          Report from users:       MegaWidget doesn't work with Super64Library version 3.x. Use version 2.x instead.      (See here for a real example of what I want to avoid) I see this all the time. Instructions that reference other instructions or items outside of the procedure. Required information that isn't referenced where it's needed. Procedures that don't end at the target/goal. ARGH! In my contrived example the Linux procedure is clear enough but the Windows instructions are progressively awful. As a user I want ONE clear procedure to accomplish my goal. If I wanted to follow the Windows 64bit instructions then they should look like this:               How to install MegaWidget for Windows 64bit      1. Download and install foo library.         NOTE: The foo library exists only to cause you pain and suffering.      2. Download and install the Super64Library         NOTE: You need Super64Library 2.x, not the newer 3.x version.      3. Download yet_another_cross_platform_build_system and install it      4. Download bar source      5. Edit the configuration file for bar and change X to Y      6. Use yet_another_cross_platform_build_system to compile and install bar      7. Download MegaWidget source.      8. Use yet_another_cross_platform_build_system to compile and install MegaWidget      The procedure that will lead me to the desired goal has everything contained within that procedure. * * * **TL;DR** : Most mutli-goal procedures are rubbish and hard to follow. **As a developer:** I am guilty of writing crap like this too. I no longer want to be someone who provides terrible instructions to my users. However writing, updating and maintaining mutil-goal procedures in a flat text file is difficult and prone to error. I need a tool that can generate the procedures for me. Perhaps I could create a flowchart like this... ![Gliffy mockup](http://i.stack.imgur.com/STemz.png) ... and the tool would export the complete procedures for the three goals. **Does such a thing exist?**
