I'm developing software in VB.NET and C#.NET and planning to release their source codes as fully open source. Are these projects "open-source" safe? **My doubts are:**   1. VB.NET and C#.NET are using the .NET framework which is not open source.   2. The source codes depends on the compiler and the IDE, although there's 100% open source and compatible alternatives provided, it is confirmed to be buggy and incompatible with my project.   3. My projects were using the Jet 4.0 OLE DB, which is not open source either.    4. Files like .Designer.vb, Microsoft ResX Schema, the Solution file, or the .vbproj etc that are generated by the Visual Studio Maybe I didn't have enough knowledge on open-source in the field where the codes released can be mixed with non open-source, or the codes can be released as open source even though developed and generated on a non open-source IDE. Am I still eligible to hold the "open-source project" title? Can the codes be released as open-source? If so, what kind of open source license that are compatible based on the criteria above?
