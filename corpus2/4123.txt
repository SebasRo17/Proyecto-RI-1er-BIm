I'm trying to `Print` the variable `a` inside the Dynamic wrapper. Seems like such a simple question, but I haven't been able to get it to work. Here's what I tried.               Dynamic[      mQ[n_] :=        75.63510582933174 - 35.87130621205199 n + 86.18343750838301 n^2 -         55.324190072519976 n^3;      mV[t_] := -29.619999999999976 + 5.499999999999998 t +         18.333333333333325 t^2;      a = xVariable + 2 - yVariable;      {Slider[Dynamic[n, Automatic]],         Dynamic[{n, xVariable = mQ[n]},          ContinuousAction -> False]} {Slider[Dynamic[t, Automatic]],         Dynamic[{t, yVariable = mV[t]}, ContinuousAction -> False]}]      I need to print the results of "a" I've updated the example code minus the plot to try and better explain the problem. I have tried the usual Print["a= ", Dynamic[a]] only to find it returns NULL or nothing at all. The variable is being calculated because it plots. So I believe the problem is more complex than I have explained above, and the issue now comes from the fact that the print statement must be closed with a ";" for the rest of the code in the Dynamic wrapper to run. That effectually keeps the print statement from writing to the nb. The code is long and complex but is many calculated variables that take input from dynamic sliders and then create a 3D plot. Debugging this has proved impossible when the variables that take input from the sliders are wrapped in Dynamic[]. Remove that and the variables do not get input from the sliders and their output can not be checked. I hope that helps to explain the problem better. Thanks for your help!
