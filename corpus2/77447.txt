So, working with NDA's prevent you from mentioning the projects in your portfolio.   * What is the way to deal with it?    * How would one showcase his experience in this scenario?  For example, I've worked on several complex iphone applications, since 2 years, and I cannot even mention the app store url's in my resume/online profile to those apps due to NDA? Does my experience go waste?
