I'm a graduate in the electronic & telecommunication field, but working in a software company. I want to continue in this field and going for Masters in it. Can you recommend me some of the best books on software engineering, which cover almost all the topics in software engineering. I am not looking for books about coding practices such as Code Complete, Pragmatic Programmer, but rather general software engineering references.
