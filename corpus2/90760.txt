I consider myself a well-rounded developer. I read books, delve into technologies at home, go to developer meet-ups, frequent Stack Overflow, and so forth. But how do I show this to the prospective employer? If I read a book on Hibernate but we don't use it at work, how do I show it on my resume that I know Hibernate? Would having a side project that uses it and putting it on GitHub help? How do you all tackle this problem?
