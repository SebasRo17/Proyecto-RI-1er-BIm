I have a symbolic function and I used `FullSimplify` command to simplify the equation given below. I am calculating it by hand but I couldn't reach the same solution. I used `Trace` command to observe the intermediate steps but trace only gives the expression before `FullSimplify`. Are there any possible methods that I can observe the steps of simplification?                   Trace[FullSimplify[2 b (-(1/(1 - fd)) + 1/fd) +         (2 a (1 - (b (1 - 1/fd + 1/(fd t)))/(a + b)) t)/        (1 - (1 - fd) t - (b fd (1 - 1/fd + 1/(fd t)) t)/(a + b)) == 0]]
