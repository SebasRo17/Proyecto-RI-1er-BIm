Yesterday, I read couple of chapters on ASP.NET Ajax and jQuery from my ASP.NET 4 book and I found those frameworks pretty interesting and decide to learn more about them. Today, I borrowed some books from library on Ajax and JavaScript. It seems ASP.NET Ajax is different from Ajax and jQuery seems like the "new" JavaScript. Does it mean that I can skip JavaScript and learn jQuery directly? On the other hand, the non-ASP.NET Ajax book I borrowed seems to apply to the client side web programming only and looks quite different from what I learned from ASP.NET Ajax. If I'm an ASP.NET developer, I guess I should stick with ASP.NET Ajax instead of client side Ajax right? What about PHP? Is there a "PHP Ajax" similar to ASP.NET Ajax? It's not that I'm lazy to learn other tools, but I just want to focus on the right ones.
