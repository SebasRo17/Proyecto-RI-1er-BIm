In my company, we're working on adopting the Microsoft Secure Development Lifecycle, and part of the MSDL process involves establishing security and privacy bug bars at the onset of a project. I've heard the concept of a bug bar prior to MSDL, and I understand that it's essentially a definition of what level/amount of bugs you're willing to accept in a final product, but I've never understood how to creating a bug bar for a project. Are there any well documented processes for establishing bug bars that I can learn from? I've tried doing some Googling for examples or real world scenarios of projects defining bug bars at the onset of a project, but I can't seem to get any good results or tips on the process of establishing a bug bar. There are MSDL examples of what appear to be completed bug bars, but I'm interested in learning about the process of defining something like this. For example, for those that have done something like this before, have you defined bugs bars in a very specific way (e.g. saying "There shall be no unauthorized file system access: reading from the file system"), or have you taken a deferred approach of saying when we find bugs we'll rate them on a 1 to 5 scale (5 being the most severe), establish now that no bugs above a 3 shall be shipped, and leave your ranking of bugs until they're discovered? I feel like the trying to do the former is a foolish and impossible activity, but the later is prone to bias towards leniency when a project is coming down to the wire. Again, to wrap all of that up into a succinct question, can anyone provide me with a well documented approach for defining/creating bug bars?
