I am working on some problem which requires generating a list of random matrices. So I used the code (actually a shortened version of the code, but it does not matter)               L={};     For[n = 1, n <= 10, n++,      R = RandomComplex[{-1 - 1 I, 1 + 1 I}, {2,2}];     ApppendTo[L,R]     ]     Export["list.dat",L]      So far so good, but when I try to import them by               Import["list.dat"]      it imports the list but pus a ',' after each and every string. In particular, after each +, -, I, }, and after each ',' as well! Some variations (like importing as table and so on) are not giving anything better. I tried to export it as .mat format which gives the following error               Export::type: {{{-0.0542175+0.284324 I,-<<21>>-<<19>> I},{<<1>>}},<<9>>} cannot be exported to the MAT format. >>      I am using mathematica 6 and 7 both. Advanced thanks for any hint/ suggestions.
