I have a first project has a feature to viewing, inserting and updating an employee record, with this possibly I will create a java class for the UI and another for the database connection with commands for viewing, inserting and updating a record. Then I have a second project that will compute the salary of employee. How can I re-use object from the first project? Should I get the Java or the class file or both of the first project and saved it to the project folder of the second project? How can add a feature of object from the first class?
