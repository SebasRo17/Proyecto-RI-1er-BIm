I'd like to ask how to protect my code that is running on a client server from being altered and/or copied.   It's running on Ubuntu Server with the standard Apache Php Mysql stack.   Any software needed would preferably be open-source. I'd also like to terminate the application when there is a license problem.   Doing this using my code is possible but since it's php the client could alter the code to prevent this from happening. Thanks in advance.
