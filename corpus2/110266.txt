My organization finally upgraded to MS Visual Studio 2010 this year. One of the big new features that Visual Studio 2010 offers is the F# programming language. I understand that F# offers a functional programming paradigm, similar to Lisp. Unlike Lisp though, F# is compiled into managed code for the .net framework. Right now, I work in database-driven web application development. Right now, I'm working with an n-tier application with SQL code on the back end and a C#.net AJAX web application on the front-end. I would like to know if F# offers anything that would be particularly useful for this type of development.
