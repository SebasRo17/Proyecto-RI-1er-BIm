I code a lot in both C and C++, but did not expect C to be the second most popular language, slightly behind Java. TIOBE Programming Community Index I'm curious as to why, in this age of OOP, C is still so popular? Note that 4 out of the top 5 popular programming languages are "modern", object-oriented capable languages. Now, I agree that you can use OOP in C to some extent, but it's sort of painful and inelegant (well at least compared to C++ I guess). So, what makes C so popular? Is it efficiency; being low-level; the vast majority of libraries that already exist or something else?
