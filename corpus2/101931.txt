I am sure this question has been asked many times. However, I like to ask it again with the intention of what is the future of these languages. I was first introduced to Groovy and really liked it. I felt the syntax was simpler and it was much closer to Java and I was able to quickly learn Grails. Then there was Scala, and the web frame work Lift. I am still learning Scala and I find the syntax very difficult at times. However, I still wonder what is the future of Groovy. When the author of Groovy says he would have never created groovy if he knew about Scala, then it makes me wonder if there is a future at all. Of course Groovy has came a long way and Grails is used today by many large companies. If one was to look at Grails vs Lift today, then Grails would be clear winner. More companies are using it. But given everything I have said so far, I am interested to know if one should invest in Groovy? Is Groovy going away and Scala the better choice? If the CEO of BMW says he drives a Mercedes then one would wonder why shouldn't we all drive Mercedes too, right? (I understand if this question is really broad and might be closed. I hope to make it an open Wiki for others though.)
