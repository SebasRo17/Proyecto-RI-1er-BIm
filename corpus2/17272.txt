I am experiencing some rather large performance decreases in _Mathematica_ version 9.0 using the _xkcd-styled_ plotting routines. I had used the `xkcdConvert` code from Simon Woods as seen here (also described/annotated by Vitaliy Kaurov, as seen here) a few months back under version 8.0.4. This code worked great under version 8.0.4 and ran the following sample code in about **1.68 seconds** :               f1[x_] := 5 + 50 (1 + Erf[x - 5]);     f2[x_] := 20 + 30 (1 - Erf[x - 5]);     xkcdConvert[       Plot[{f1[x], f2[x]}, {x, 0, 10},         Epilog ->          xkcdLabel /@ {{"Label 1", {1, f1[1]}, {1, 30}}, {"Label 2", {8,              f2[8]}, {0, 30}}},         Ticks -> {{{3.5, "1st Event"}, {7, "2nd Event"}},           Automatic}]] // AbsoluteTiming      This code will produce a simple xkcd-styled plot as given by Simon Woods example. When I run the same code under version 9.0, the output takes **~17.0 seconds** to produce!? I'm not sure why the performance degradation is happening in version 9.0. I was hoping to produce a number of comic styled plots for a meeting. I have produced the desired plots, but all the plot-rendering took a really long time (one plot took ~8 minutes to render). I welcome insight on how to improve the rendering performance under version 9.0 for future rendering efforts!
