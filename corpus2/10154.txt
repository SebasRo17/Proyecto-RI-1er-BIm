_(Hopefully this is deemed suitable for Programmers, not StackOverflow - I could imagine it getting closed at SO because there's no obvious 'right' answer.)_ We have a large Delphi 2007 VCL project that uses things like DBXpress, Report Builder, DevExpress and TMS components (both visual and non-visual) etc. For reasons I won't bore you with, the company would like to start adding new modules to the program using .Net (via C# in particular). Rewriting from scratch isn't an option and given the heavy use of Report Builder and various other bits of Delphi-specific 3rd party code, I suspect that using something like TurnSharp to regenerate a C# project wouldn't work well either. **Ideally we want to keep our Win32 VCL Delphi code but add new modules (plug- ins, sections of contained functionality like wizards etc) via C#.** So we're considering RemObjects' Hydra, and in the next few weeks will probably have a go at evaluating it on a smaller-but-representative project first. I wondered if anyone had experience of doing this kind of thing with Hydra...?
