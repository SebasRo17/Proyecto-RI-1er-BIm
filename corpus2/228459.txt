Part of code review feedback is suggesting better names for methods and classes. How can I address feedback about class and method names which does not suggest an alternative? For example, I might create the class > public class FooBar { } My reviewer would then say, "Try to think of a better name than this." or "This name isn't helpful." without suggesting an alternative name. I have already thought through the class name and `FooBar` is really the best I can come up with. How can I actually address the feedback from this review?
