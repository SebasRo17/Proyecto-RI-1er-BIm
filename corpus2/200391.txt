**Preamble:**   * If I say "BSD" I mean the 3-Clause BSD license   * If I say "GPL" I mean the GPLv3 license   * I am NOT the author of the GPL project   * I am the author of the BSD project **Simple Task:** I wan't to use a 3rd party software (GPL) in (or better 'with') my open source project (BSD) **Situation:**   * I won't change any of the GPL project code (using it AS IS)   * I want to use it as kind of a library (i know about LGPL but it's not available)   * I will use the GPL software as bulk, NOT only parts of the code   * I will indicate the use of the GPL project with license, homepage and where and why it is used in my BSD project (in readme file)   * I will not take the credits for the functionality of the GPL project   * I will take the credits for my project and the "Adapter" connecting my BSD project to the GPL project   * I don't want to re-license the GPL project as BSD (!)   * I won't charge any fees or something like that to gain insight you can find the BSD project at GitHub: MOC-Framework (see /Extension/FlowPlayer and /Module/Office/Video) and the GPL project here: Flowplayer (free flash-version) **Simple Question:** Is this possible? **Closing Words** I found some discussions, stating: "it is possible", others say "no". Most of the "no" was for commercial projects. Most of the "yes" are referring to: "include BSD in GPLv3", but that's not what I mean. I want GPLv3 along with BSD.. I simply can't figure it out.
