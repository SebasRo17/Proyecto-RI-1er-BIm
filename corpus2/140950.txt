We have program( written in VB ) using a call to a winzip program or 7zip command line tool to zip some files. Once I accidentally uninstall the winzip on my computer and making one of our program( created by the programmer already left ) crashed. So we cannot uninstall the winzip program. Now we am writing another program with java + windows batch file. And I've come to a point which I need to make a decision between 1) using a call to external tool ( for example 7z ) for gzip in windows batch file, 2) or I make a java program to gzip the file. Obviously a external tool such as 7z is convenient and we can avoid some extra coding with java. On the contrary, if 7z is uninstalled accidentally, our program will crash. What do you think?
