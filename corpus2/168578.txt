I'm working on a PHP project where some object (class member) may contain different data type. For example :               class Property {         private $_id;     // (PK)         private $_ref_id; // the object reference id (FK)         private $_name;   // the name of the property         private $_type;   // 'string', 'int', 'float(n,m)', 'datetime', etc.         private $_data;   // ...              // ..snip.. public getters/setters     }      Now, I need to perform some persistence on these objects. Some properties may be a text data type, but nothing bigger than what a `varchar` may hold. Also, later on, I need to be able to perform searches and sorting. Is it a good practice to use a single database table for this (ie. is there a non negligible performance impact)? If it's "acceptable", then what could be the data type for the `data` column?
