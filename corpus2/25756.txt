Since I'm already piping a _MathLink_ connection in a ssh tunnel (connect back is a pain!), I wonder if it makes sense to compress the data in the stream (`ssh -C`). As with any optimization matter, one should measure, but unfortunately it seems there's no way to get statistics out of `ssh` on the connection so I cannot just test and measure the gain or loss. My question is then, is it known whether this _MathLink_ type is already compressed?
