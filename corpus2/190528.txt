I'm writing a simple little program to transmit MIDI over a network. I know that the program will encounter transmission problems and / or other exception situations that I won't be able to predict. For the exception handling, I see two approaches. Should I write the program so that it:   * fails with a bang when something goes wrong **_or_**   * should it just ignore the error and continue, at the expense of data integrity? Which approach would a user reasonably expect?   Is there a better way of handling exceptions? Additionally, should my decision about handling exceptions be affected by whether or not I am dealing with a network connection (ie. something where I can reasonably expect to have problems come up)?
