I am thinking about creating a data access API on top of Spring JDBC. The API will be able to automatically create objects from resultset, given we follow naming conventions for fields in the sql. We have lots of entities like: Patient, Disease etc. What I am thinking about is:               Patient p = (Patient)bean.fetchObject(resultSet,Patient.class);      Disease d = (Disease)bean.fetchObject(resultSet,Disease.class);      where `fetchObject()` uses reflection to read property names of entities and it generates field names and then it assigns those values to those properties. The rule I am thinking about is:   1. Give each entity a unique prefix   2. Generate column names automatically from variable names   3. Follow strict naming conventions on all sql queries Is this a good way to go about things? What are the possible pitfalls? Are there similar solutions already out there? (We are not using Hibernate)
