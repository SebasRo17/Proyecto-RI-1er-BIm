Based on the example of the Documentation of MousePosition, Properties and Relations, here is my test code using "MouseDragged" instead of "MouseClicked":               DynamicModule[{list = {}},      EventHandler[       Dynamic[        Framed@Graphics[{Red, Point[list]}, PlotRange -> 2]        ]       , {"MouseDragged" :> AppendTo[list, MousePosition["Graphics"]]}       ]      ]      Using this, one can drag lines of dots as follows: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nTlQc.jpg) The top line was drawn while moving the mouse very slowly, the bottom line was drawn with a faster mouse movement. I would now like to add even more points in the bottom line, to be able to have an almost full line, even with fast mouse movements. I have checked out `Refresh`, and `UpdateInterval`, but that didn't change everything. So: is it possible to track **all** pixel movements of the mouse inside a certain region, to be able to plot **all** points? As always, thanks for all help!
