So, I was in charge of filtering down job applicants at our company. We wanted to develop symbian app. But, there are no one here that know how to develop it. Therefore, we create job ads. Several applicant coming in. The question is, how do I test this candidate? I'm thinking to give some sort of test app. Something trivial and simple but required to have fundamental understanding of symbian. This will **be build at home** question. If they are able to create it Any recommended test question / application?
