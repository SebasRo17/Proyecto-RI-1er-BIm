I use the following code to find out the number of consecutive prime numbers using a formula $n^2+n+i$ found out by Euler (starting from n=0):               Nbs = {};     Do[Nbs = Union[Nbs,      Select[Range[5000], (PrimeQ[#^2 + # + i] == False &), 1]], {i, 1,      5000}];     Nbs       How can I also get in the output list the value of the `Do` iterator where $i$ is corresponding to each number of consecutive primes? I would like to get something like that:               ({1,2},...,{40,41}}
