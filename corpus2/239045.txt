I have been searching for a good online course in data structures but have found that Google also returns results for algorithms courses, which say stuff like: > In this course you will learn several fundamental principles of algorithm > design: divide-and-conquer methods, graph algorithms, **practical data > structures (heaps, hash tables, search trees)** , randomized algorithms, and > more. [source] and > By the end of this class you will understand key concepts needed to devise > new algorithms for graphs **and other important data structures** and to > evaluate the efficiency of these algorithms. [source] and > This course provides an introduction to mathematical modeling of > computational problems. It covers the common algorithms, algorithmic > paradigms, **and data structures used to solve these problems**. [source] My question is: are algorithms and data structures intimately linked, meaning that they must be understood together or is one topic more foundational than the other? _EDIT: For those voting to close this question, can you please tell me why and maybe how to improve this one? Learning to ask the right questions is part of the educational process._
