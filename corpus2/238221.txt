This question is about what methodology to follow when evaluating one or more PHP frameworks to see which one would suit the needs of my project best. In other words, given the time pressures that every developer faces, what concrete steps can I take to assess one or more PHP frameworks without having to go to the extent of getting to know each framework in intimate detail? I know that some of the considerations would be subjective such as, which is my preferred language or my style of coding, but assessing your preferred language and style of coding would be a concrete step towards defining your chosen framework. I'm narrowing this down to PHP just to assume that the choice of language has already been made.
