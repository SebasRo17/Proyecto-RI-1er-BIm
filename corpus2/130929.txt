We just deployed a large software that affects the way the user work-day looks like in many aspects. It changes a lot of things in the way they interact between eachothers. The developers of the team are taking rounds and spending one day at the customer's site to understand better what is a typical day for our user, and the learning process they go through. In this context, what How would you approach that day, what kind of questions do you ask, how do you observe the user. Are there defined practices that exist? Also what wouldn't you do? Did you have some bad experience out of this?
