I started to create a php application I'd like to make open source in the near future. However I do not know, if it's needed to follow any kind of code/documentation convention, to make it more usable and acceptable when released. Is there any model, to follow, to develop a good open source application? Do you think it is necessary(or better) to develop it entirely, or for the most, object oriented?
