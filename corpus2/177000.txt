I'm coming from a python CGI background and was wanting to move into something more contemporary and think I have decided upon `web.py` as the framework I would like to use. In regards to templating, previously I used formatted strings and the `string.Template` module to effect most of my templating needs. After reading through a few of the templating options I have heard mentioned, I began wondering what the main benefits of using something like the `Django` or `jinja` templating options over "native" Python templating options were? Am I just going to be replacing `$tmpl_var` with `{{ tmpl_var }}` and `s.substitute(tmpl_var=value)` with `t.render(s)`, i.e., alternate syntax? or will I gain additional advantages from using these templating systems?
