I'm working on a software project where so far I'm the sole developer. As of right now the code is unlicensed, but the copyright of whatever I've written belongs to me (this is true at least in North America AFAIK). Before I release the software to the public, I'm going to license its distribution, probably under something like MPL or GPL. Question 1: As the original copyright holder, does this effect me in anyway? Or do I still have unrestricted distribution rights? Question 2: After some time, more developers join the project. Now much of source code copyright belongs to me+contributors. How do distribution rights work for the authors now? Regards, kfl
