The thing is that I read a lot of things over a period of time because it is interesting and I like to know it and secondly it will be helpful in my future job interviews. For example I read about data structures: association, aggregation and composition; about 2 months ago with great interest and I thought I had it all but struggled big time recalling the information at a recent job interview. How do you people handle these things? How can I make my reading meaningful without worrying about forgetting about it in the future.
