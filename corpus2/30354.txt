My problem is: I want two `Locator`s to simulate a vector in the following sense: The first `Locator` is the base and the second the tip of the vector. When I move the tip, the base does not move (hence the vector changes). When I move the base, the vector is unchanged, and therefore the tip (and the `Locator`) moves. How can I achieve that? I have tried storing the previous value of the base and then test if the current value is different. And if so updated the position of the tip. I can however not make that work, when using 'Module'. I suspect that there is a more elegant solution.
