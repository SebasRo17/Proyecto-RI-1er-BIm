I can use `PolarPlot` to generate a plot; however, I would like to rotate the plot by 90 degrees and then output the result using Show. Here is the code               Y20 =        PolarPlot[          Abs[Sqrt[5/(16*Pi)]*(3*Cos[Theta]^2 - 1)],           {Theta, 0, 2*Pi},           Ticks -> None       ]     Show[Rotate[Y20, Pi/2]]      > ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IyEMk.png) and the error > >     Show::gtype: Rotate is not a type of graphics. >   If I wrap `Rotate` with `Graphics` the error message I get is > >     Graphics is not a Graphics primitive or directive. >   Any comments will be welcomed.
