This is a follow-up question to this one on visualizing vector-spherical harmonics. This time, I would like to visualize the vector spherical waves (including the radial dependence). The functions that I would like to plot, `VectorSphericalWaveE[J, M, kr, θ, ϕ]` and `VectorSphericalWaveM[J, M, kr, θ, ϕ]` are defined below. **Please note there was a typo in`ϵ[λ_]`, in the linked question, which I have corrected**.               Clear[ϵ]; (*Polarization vector*)     ϵ[λ_] = Switch[λ,        -1, {1, -I, 0}/Sqrt[2],         0, {0, 0, 1},         1, -{1, I, 0}/Sqrt[2]   ];          Clear[VectorSphericalHarmonicV];     VectorSphericalHarmonicV[ℓ_, J_, M_, θ_, ϕ_] /;        J >= 0 && ℓ >= 0 && Abs[J - ℓ] <= 1 && Abs[M] <= J :=        Sum[         If[Abs[M - λ] <= ℓ, ClebschGordan[{ℓ, M - λ}, {1, λ}, {J, M}], 0]*         SphericalHarmonicY[ℓ, M - λ, θ, ϕ]*ϵ[λ], {λ, -1, 1}   ]          Clear[RadialR, VectorSphericalWaveE,VectorSphericalWaveM];     RadialR[kr_, ℓ_] = I^ℓ SphericalBesselJ[ℓ, kr];     VectorSphericalWaveE[J_, M_, kr_, θ_, ϕ_] /;  J >= 0 && Abs[M] <= J :=        If[J > 0, -Sqrt[((J + 1)/(2 J + 1))] SphericalBesselJ[J - 1, kr] VectorSphericalHarmonicV[J - 1, J, M, θ, ϕ],  0]      + Sqrt[J/(2 J + 1)] SphericalBesselJ[J + 1, kr] VectorSphericalHarmonicV[J + 1, J, M, θ, ϕ];     VectorSphericalWaveM[J_, M_, kr_, θ_, ϕ_] /; J >= 0 && Abs[M] <= J :=        I SphericalBesselJ[J, kr] VectorSphericalHarmonicV[J, J,          M, θ, ϕ];      The functions `VectorSphericalWaveE` and `VectorSphericalWaveM` takes two integer arguments $J\geq 1$ and $-J\leq M \leq J$, and three continuous arguments: the radial coordinate $kr>0$, and the angular coordinates $\theta$ and $\phi$. The output is a _real_ vector. Because these functions give out real-valued vectors, I would like to visualize them using vector plot. I tried the following:               VectorPlot3D[      Re[VectorSphericalWaveM[2, 1,       Sequence @@ CoordinateTransform["Cartesian" -> "Spherical", {x, y, z}]]],          {x, -5, 5}, {y, -5, 5}, {z, -5, 5},          RegionFunction -> ((#1^2 + #2^2 + #3^2 <= 5^2) &)]      But got a crummy output (see below). I can hardly tell what's going on. I know these vector fields are supposed to be circulatory only, so it would be nice if that aspect can be emphasized in the plot. Also, is there a way to include some kind of _distance fog_ , so that arrows in the back, are greyed out? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3RjjB.jpg)
