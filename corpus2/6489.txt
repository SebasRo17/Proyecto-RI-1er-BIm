I have the following problem, when I am trying to optimize function with pre- defined assumptions. I am using Mathematica 8 and I wrote the following simple code               $Assumptions = (m > 0)     Minimize[{x^m, x >= 1}, x]      It is clear, that the answer is 1, since $x^m\ge 1$ if $x\ge 1$ for all positive $m$. However, Mathematica fails to calculate this simple problem. What do I do wrong? Should I use another function for minimization?
