How to visualize a set of vectors with 3 coordinates $(x,y,z)$, e.g.,$(1,1,1), (1,-1,-1),(-1,1,-1),(-1,-1,1)$? In fact there are many of them. I try the function "Graphic3D" with the following code               Graphics3D[{Arrow[{{0, 0, 0}, {1, 1, 1}}], Arrow[{{0, 0, 0}, {1, -1, -1}}]},      {Arrow[{{0, 0, 0}, {-1, 1, -1}}], Arrow[{{0, 0, 0}, {1, -1, -1}}]},     Axes -> True, Boxed -> True]      However, it seems it can only give me the first two vectors in the plot. How can I visualize all of them at the same time? And is there any other way to visualize them? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/L0Bb1.jpg)
