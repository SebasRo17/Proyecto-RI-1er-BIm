I'd like to have some suggestions about using code repository. I don't need to know how to check out or how to check in or how to create a branch. What I need to know is, how to maintain the repository tree or how to structure it for optimal usage. For example, for a given project, when to create a branch? Where to create a branch with respect to the project's location? What should be done when one or more than one developer are working on same project but different features? When to merge? Where goes the bug fix? How the QA team should checkout a specific version? Etc.
