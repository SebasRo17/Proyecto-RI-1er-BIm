We write a complete functional specification for our development team of two. We do not have professional testers however we have drafted in the help of our available helpdesk personnel to perform 'QA testing'. We have had problems in the past where complete chunks of functionality do not work, or the code is delivered is simply not according to the spec. My questions are: at what stage should developers stop coding at hand over to the QA team? Is it too much to ask the developers to review their code against the spec before handing over to the QA team?
