I'm building a little interface, which consists only of a button, as you can see here:               Button["File Input",        file = Import[SystemDialogInput["FileOpen"]];                  Print[principalFunction[file]]]      Now I'd like to insert the produced graphic and the button inside a `Manipulate`. Note that I'm not using Plot, Plot3D, etc. -- the graphics are produced by `principalFunction` as the final result of evaluating many other functions.
