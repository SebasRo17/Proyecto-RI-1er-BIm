I was looking at the answer of Leonid of Faster alternatives for DayOfWeek and wanted to see how hard it would be to do something similar in C++ using an external library like Boost. I tried to include a Boost header in the example of the CreateLibrary help located here http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/CCompilerDriver/ref/CreateLibrary.html specifying also the path for the Boost files to include and Boost compiled libraries, like I would do in VisualStudio that I use, but the example didn't compile. So before trying harder, has anyone already succesfully used Boost with the CreateLibrary function ? (new in Mathematica 8). Thanks
