I am learning LINQ to SQL (and planning to learn Entity Framework). Initially I used a abstraction layer to convert LINQ to SQL entities into a domain objects. Later I discovered the “Inheritance Mapping” option and removed the abstraction layer and started to use ORM entities directly as domain objects. After some time, I got a road block when I don’t use abstraction layer. Please read it here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11470037/get-all-associate- composite-objects-inside-an-object-in-abstract-way   1. Is it possible to achieve all tasks without using Abstraction layer over ORM?    2. What are the rationale to decide have/not have abstraction layer? **REFERENCE** :   1. http://martinfowler.com/bliki/OrmHate.html
