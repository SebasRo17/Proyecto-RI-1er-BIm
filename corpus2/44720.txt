I developed a big package that does quite a bit of numerics. Is there a way to enforce that all numerical computations are done with a pre-defined accuracy? For example, can one use something like SetAccuracy[...] in the beginning of the package and then all functions automatically use that accuracy. Of course, one can wrap all functions with N[], but I wonder if that can be avoided. EDIT: As an example, I tried changing               BeginPackage["packageName`"];     ...      into               BeginPackage["packageName`"];     $MaxPrecision=10;     ...      but I noticed that the computations are still done with unlimited precision (unless N[] is used to wrap expressions).
