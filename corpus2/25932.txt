I have my own stylesheet that I like using so much I change all my documents to it almost immediately, but as I demo Mathematica to people I cannot use `DefaultStyleDefinitions` as it unnecessarily confuses people. I therefore have a function (typed verbatim, not loaded) in my init.m file that pastes the definitions from a stylesheet into the `EvaluationNotebook[]`               BeginPackage["PasteStyles`"]     pasteStyleSheet::usage="pasteStyleSheet[stylesheet, \"Admin\"] pastes the style definitions provided by stylesheet located in $BaseDirectory (etc)"; Begin["`Private`"]     pasteStyleSheet[stylesheet_String,"Admin"]:=SetOptions[EvaluationNotebook[],StyleDefinitions->Get[FileNameJoin[{$BaseDirectory,"FrontEnd","StyleSheets",stylesheet<>".nb"}]]]     pasteStyleSheet[stylesheet_String,"User"]:=SetOptions[EvaluationNotebook[],StyleDefinitions->Get[FileNameJoin[{$UserBaseDirectory,"FrontEnd","StyleSheets",stylesheet<>".nb"}]]]     pasteStyleSheet[stylesheet_String,"System"]:=SetOptions[EvaluationNotebook[],StyleDefinitions->Get[FileNameJoin[{$InstallationDirectory,"SystemFiles","FrontEnd","StyleSheets",stylesheet<>".nb"}]]]     End[]     EndPackage[]      I have an issue in that I use options for cells such as `WholeCellGroupOpener` and `ReturnCreatesNewCell` that Mathematica doesn't seem to know anything about when my function is evaluated. I found this out because I used to find `$CellContext` throughout my pasted style definitions. Currently, I have shoved the following lines into the package to make sure it works.               System`WholeCellGroupOpener;     System`ReturnCreatesNewCell;      My questions are:   * Why do I get `$CellContext` for some functions that should be on ``System`?   * How do I ensure my function works as intended? Does it need to live somewhere else? Justifications:   * I need to paste the styles, as I email the notebooks out.   * I spend most of my time making fun things in the front end, I'm expecting this stylesheet to eventually become something that no one else will ever want to use.
