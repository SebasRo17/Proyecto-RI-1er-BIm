According to the Mathematica, the integral below                   NIntegrate[ Log[Log[1/(x y )]]  Log[1/(x y )]^(-0.5 - 1), {x, 0, 1}, {y, 0,1}]      might possibly evaluate to "Overflow, Indeterminate, or Infinity" for $t=-0.5 - 1$, although my calculations show that there should be no problem for all the cases with $t>-2$. More exactly, Mathematica yields this result: **NIntegrate::inumri: "The integrand Log[Log[1/(x y)]]/Log[1/(x y)]^1.5 has evaluated to Overflow, Indeterminate, or Infinity for all sampling points in the region with boundaries {{0.,3.97545*10^-31},{0,1}}"** So, is it a problem with my code or it's just another problem related to the Mathematica?
