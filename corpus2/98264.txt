Can you be a technical manager of a development team, without knowing the technology they work with? I'm very technical, having been a tech lead for a while, now I'm a manager, and the new team reports to me now, administratively and technically. Problem is, a big part of the technology being used is old and archaic (delphi). Is it possible for someone with 'zero' experience in that to lead that team? What are some of your experiences?
