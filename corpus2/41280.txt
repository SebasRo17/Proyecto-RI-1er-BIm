While an earlier question Cut and paste data from a spreadsheet  nominally addresses the issue, a year has past since its OP asked it and I hope that others have come across simpler or more direct ways to do this. I think a new solution might interest the community. I often want to get values (numbers, dates, ...) from a spreadsheet someone has sent me into Mathematica. `Import[...]` works fine, but seems a bit cumbersome, when I just want to grab something like a single column or row of values and work with them immediately. "Copy/Paste" can give one odd results. Set up a short list of numbers in a spreadsheet ... ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/p5Ltl.png) and copy them into Mathematica: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/o8wWv.png) This seems a bit inconsistent and neither of these gives one a list of the data elements like `Import[...]`. Note: I use Mac OS X if it makes any difference. * * * Mr. Wizard supplies a pretty good solution in the original question, which references code for a palette that Szabolcs posted at see page, see _Pasting tabular data into notebooks_. I've added a title and minor formatting to the palette:               CreatePalette[      Column[{Button["TSV",          Module[{data, strip},           data = NotebookGet[ClipboardNotebook[]][[1, 1, 1]];          strip[s_String] :=            StringReplace[s, RegularExpression["^\\s*(.*?)\\s*$"] -> "$1"];          strip[e_] := e;          If[Head[data] === String,            NotebookWrite[InputNotebook[],             ToBoxes@Map[strip, ImportString[data, "TSV"], {2}]]]],          ImageSize -> 85],         Button["CSV",          Module[{data, strip},           data = NotebookGet[ClipboardNotebook[]][[1, 1, 1]];          strip[s_String] :=            StringReplace[s, RegularExpression["^\\s*(.*?)\\s*$"] -> "$1"];          strip[e_] := e;          If[Head[data] === String,            NotebookWrite[InputNotebook[],             ToBoxes@Map[strip, ImportString[data, "CSV"], {2}]]]],          ImageSize -> 85],         Button["Table",          Module[{data},           data = NotebookGet[ClipboardNotebook[]][[1, 1, 1]];          If[Head[data] === String,            NotebookWrite[InputNotebook[],             ToBoxes@ImportString[data, "Table"]]]], ImageSize -> 85]},        Alignment -> {Center, Center}], WindowTitle -> "Paste Data",       WindowSize -> {85, Fit}]      One can install this by choosing **Palettes > Install Palette** (from the file menu) then provide the source file, palette name, and installation directory to the Install Mathematica Item dialog, and click **Finish**. * * * This works, but it does not have the immediacy that one gets used to when working with Mathematica, so... Does a simple way exist to assign the contents of a "Copy" operation (from a spread sheet or csv file) programmatically to a variable as a list of elements, which one could immediately press into service? Given that a clipboard appears to hold copies of content in different formats, an elegant solution might involve a right click to select how one wanted it pasted. Maybe a feature request to Wolfram would do it (eventually:-).
