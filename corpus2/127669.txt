What are some characteristics of Python that makes it unique as its own language? I'm looking for any sort of characteristics ranging from good to bad, useful to hindrance, syntax to real-world usage, but non-obscure observations would be the most useful for the average developer. I'm a newb here, so intuitive things may need to be explained.....
