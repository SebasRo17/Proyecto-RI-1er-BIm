I'm looking to develop a one page app, and will likely be using node.js for my server side coding. I'm trying to get some advice regards the client-side coding. While i realise that something like backbone.js would really help me, since im very new to development the learning curve is very high for me. So i'm going to be using something like dust.js for my client side templating. Currently i'm creating some mockup screens (there are 4 in total) that are being built in just plain html/css. When i come to doing the client side and server coding, is it better for me to combine all my presentation code into one html file, or into multiple files and then call them separately, considering it's a one page app that i am creating?
