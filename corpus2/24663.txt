As programmers, many (most?) of us have an inner creative "spark". We love thinking of new, useful ways to accomplish tasks. Many of us have even dreamed a few ideas we thought could be viable businesses, or even change the way people go about their daily routine. However, many of us also work in a corporate environment where we are told which projects to work on and when to work on them. Personally, this can feel suffocating at times. If you have an idea you think could be world changing (or at least effect a lot of people), how do you get passionate about work that is dictated to you? Even if you don't have the next "big idea", many of us still want to unleash some inner creativity. How do you do this in an environment that seems to be counter-productive to that creativity?
