Ok, I understand the normal conventions of using verbs with functions and nouns with classes. What about interfaces? Is there any methodology when coming up with interface names that may not be that obvious? Just to make it clear, I'm not talking about whether to put an "I" in front of the name or if to use camelCase or PascalCase. I'm wondering about the method of figuring out a clear, semantic name for an interface. **EDIT** I'm obsessing on how to name an interface in the clearest way. I guess it just needs to be a noun too because when I think of naming classes I think of the closest "real" world object it can relate to. I suppose real world interfaces are things like a keyboard, mouse, remote control, ATM screen. Those are all nouns. Anyhow, any additional insight on a good way to formulate interface names would be appreciated.
