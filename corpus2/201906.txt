Is there a db which maps the words from the english dictionary to the UNSPSC codes?(http://www.unspsc.org/) My problem is the following: I am building a search system. And the customer searches for 'pencil' and 'pencil sharpeners' are also returned. Each of the returned item has a UNSPSC code associated with it. So one possible solution would be to search only for those items in the categories the search word belongs to. But this solution would require a mapping from english words to the UNSPSC codes...
