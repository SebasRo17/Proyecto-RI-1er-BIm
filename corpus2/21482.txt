**Context** I would like to represent large images with a given colour table. Now, if I use `Image`               dat = RandomReal[{0, 1}, {1024, 1024}];     dat // Image; // Timing          (* ==> {0.000027, Null} *)      its fast, but in grayscales; on the other hand if I use, say `MatrixPlot`               dat // MatrixPlot[#, ColorFunction -> "Temperature"] &     dat // MatrixPlot[#, ColorFunction -> "Temperature"] &; // Timing          (* ==> {1.5748, Null} *)      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BS1jb.png) its in colour, but its slow. **Question** Is there a method to get the best of both worlds? (i.e. Speed and chosen colour table). Thank you for your help.
