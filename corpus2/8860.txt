I am puzzled because this toy example (in Mathematica 8)               dist = KernelMixtureDistribution[{{0, 1}, {0.0, 0}, {0, -1}},"Silverman",                                       MaxMixtureKernels -> All];     DensityPlot[PDF[dist, {x1, x2}], {x1, -3, 3}, {x2, -3, 3}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xrcCl.gif) produces a density estimate with quite a large extent in x-direction although it has zero standard deviation. I would not have been surprised if that had produced an error because it should be a delta impulse in x-direction and I don't know if that can be represented by Mathematica. But this result does not make sense. If I change it to               dist = KernelMixtureDistribution[{{0, 1}, {0.01, 0}, {0, -1}},"Silverman",                                      MaxMixtureKernels -> All];     DensityPlot[PDF[dist, {x1, x2}], {x1, -3, 3}, {x2, -3, 3}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0t2Oz.gif) the result is a very thin distribution as expected. The behaviour is similar for Silverman's and Scott's rules of thumb. **Can someone shed some light on how the standard deviations are interpreted here? Is this a bug maybe ?**
