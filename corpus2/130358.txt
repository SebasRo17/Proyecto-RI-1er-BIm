I'm green at programming but not entirely noobish. I taught myself some Java about five years ago, and I learnt me some Objective-C recently. I was talking with a Unix guy a while back, and he said that if you do your object architecture and design very completely and correctly, cross-platform development becomes really easy. All you have to do is take the description of each element and implement it. Since your design is so complete, each individual element is composed of relatively simple tasks. I'd like to get some feedback on that concept. In theory it makes sense, but programming is about execution. And if you agree with the concept, can you point me to some material that would help me understand how to build those kind of complete, specific designs?
