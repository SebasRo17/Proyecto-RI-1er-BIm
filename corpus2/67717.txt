I've finished a project in PHP of 13000+ lines in Procedural Style [because I'm very familiar with that, though I know OOP], and the project is running perfectly. But should I convert it to OOP? [ _because the world is busy with OOP_ ] My code doesn't need any of the feature of OOP [encapsulation, inheritance basically...]! So what should I do? And what kind of help I will get if I convert it to OOP ?
