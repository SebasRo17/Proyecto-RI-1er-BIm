Sorry for the fact that I ask actually the same question on three different stackexchange sites (stackoverflow, mathematics and now here), but I need to find an answer to my problem as quickly as possible. The question is how to draw a 3D plot of functions: $$ y + 5 = 0 \\ x + 2y = 0 $$ The first one is a plane parallel to the $oxz$ plane. If anyone has an answer to this, please provide some explanation, not just `Plot3d[y + 5, {x, -20, 20}, ...]`. Thank you.
