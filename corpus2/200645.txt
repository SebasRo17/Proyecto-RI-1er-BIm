Let me explain our situation. We are small company with about 20+ staff and all the while we have been practicing the standard waterfall model with not much success (due to frequent changes of requirements and lack of direction). So one day our CTO came in and he briefed us about SCRUM and all of us were convinced that this model will work great for a small team like us. Unfortunately all of us do not have any experience practicing SCRUM and we have been relying mostly on online resources and books. Then we come to a new project that we are about to get started and we are doing something like:   1. Gather requirements from business domain user   2. Prepare a requirement spec with UI and features (this already took us like weeks)   3. Meet up again business domain user to see if there is any changes required   4. Once the business user agrees to the specs we will key in those feature in to product catalog   5. Break those features into tasks and assign to sprint Should we instead take the more agile approach? like   1. Gather requirements from stakeholders   2. Start to create epic user stories and run through with stake holders   3. Break those epic stories into smaller stories (supported with some ui) and assign to a short sprint(2 weeks)   4. We show them what we have done for the 2 weeks, get their feedback and plan for the next sprint Given the nature of our projects where we are constantly faced with the challenges of volatile requirements and a lack of direction, where will the above Scrum/Agile points benefit us and why are the above Waterfall methods failing us?
