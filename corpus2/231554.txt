My understanding is that Goto statements are generally frowned up. But the publish-subscribe pattern seems to be conceptually similar in that when a piece of code publishes a message, it performs a one-way transfer of control. The programmer may have no idea what parts of the program are subscribing to this message. I have see something similar in a lot of JavaScript programs in which events are used to conveniently "hop" across modules. Am I missing something about the publish-subscribe or event-driven patterns?
