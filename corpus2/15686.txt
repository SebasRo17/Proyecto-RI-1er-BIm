I am using the Mma9 `AngularGauge` function to develop a controll for a rotating stage. I am experiencing several problems:   1. I am unable to get the values {0°, 90°, 180°, 270°}.   2. I am unable to align those values at arbitrary locations, e.g. 0° at the top.   3. I cannot make the needle roll over the 0° / 360° boundary, i.e. to get from 10° to 350° I have to "roll back". In particular the function `ScaleDivisions` drives me nuts. In the figure below the 0 in 360 is drawn twice, not clearly visible here but obvious on my screen. I am not concerned about the "°" right now and my Mma9 installed without any error messages (unitil now). `AngularGauge[Dynamic[x], {0, 360}, ScaleDivisions -> {20, 2}, ScaleOrigin -> {0, 2 \\[Pi]}, ImageSize -> {256, 256}, GaugeLabels -> "Value", GaugeMarkers -> "InsideScale"]` ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Nwzex.png)
