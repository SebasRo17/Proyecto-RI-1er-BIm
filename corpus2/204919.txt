I was told to create two lists concerning most frequently used words from a plain text (10 Mb arbitrary texts) as monograms (for single worded expressions such as human, water, is) and bigrams (for two-worded expressions such as basketball team, united states and etc) I am stuck here and don't know how I can go about it! And how I can distinguish between these two? My domain is not English, I only gave those examples to make my intention and meaning more clear.
