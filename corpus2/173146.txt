I'm working on some static libraries using visual studio 2012, and after building I copy .lib and .h files to respective directories to match a desired hierarchy such as:               drive:/libraries/libname/includes/libname/framework          drive:/libraries/libname/includes/libname/utitlies          drive:/libraries/libname/lib/...      etc I'm thinking something similar to the boost folder layout. I have been doing this manually so far. My library solution contains projects, and when I update and recompile I simply recopy files where they need to be. Is there a simpler way to do this? Perhaps a way to compile the project with certain rules per project as to where the projects .h and .lib files should go?
