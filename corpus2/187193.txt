I'm wondering if there is some license which I could put on my website on which I could publish an open-source application that potentially could be used for purposes of cheating in one game for smartphones. Now, I have to stress that the goal of the application is in no way cheating, so with this license I want to eliminate the possibility that the authors of the smartphone game (in which my bot could be used) could sue me if someone else starts using the application to get better at their game. I may be too paranoid, but with all the weird laws you just never know. I did a little research and came up with Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 (CC BY 3.0), but was wondering whether any of you guys were ever in a similar situation, and what you did in that case? By the way, I did read and consider the moral implications of the possible app appearing on my site, so now I just need some license as stated in the question.
