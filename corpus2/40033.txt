I'm trying to use Mathematica to make some work on binary data, and I'm missing something. Consider the string `"111"`. I want to flip the last bit to become `"110"`. My guess would be to use `StringReplacePart`, but I'm struggling to achieve this:               StringReplacePart["111", "0", 3]  (* returns "0" *)      What is the function for replacing a single character at a given position?
