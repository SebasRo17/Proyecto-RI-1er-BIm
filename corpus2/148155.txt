This is my first question here so I hope it is not off topic. Although I am using the Linux `inotify` library to listen for changes to files, and I compare use of that against the `Subversion` program, I am specifically looking for the algorithm used. To a human it is very easy to tell if a file has been created or modified. Clicking the `New` button constitutes the former, and clicking the `Save` button constitutes the latter. To Linux, both those actions have serious overlap. In text editors, for example, generally a swap file is created and then copied/moved. This makes it difficult to distinguish via `inotify` between a minor edit to a file and a deliberate overwrite of a file. What I am trying to understand is how a program such as `Subversion` recognizes the difference between a user having modified a file with a text editor, and a user having actually deleted the file and opened a new file with the same name. **Edit:** It has been pointed out that subversion does not do what I want it to do, so it was a blunder on my part to use it as an example. Instead allow me to rephrase the question: "Is there any known program or programming approach to match high level actions such as creating new files and saving them to low level actions such as modifying, moving, copying, etc. such that I can log all the files in the system and changes to them"?
