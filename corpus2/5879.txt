Does anyone know how to do a higher order SVD in Mathematica ? A good reference seems to be here http://www.sandia.gov/~tgkolda/pubs/pubfiles/SAND2007-6702.pdf but I don't understand their formalism yet, maybe someone has already some experience with this in Mathematica and this could speed up the understanding. Thanks Another interesting reference is here ftp://ftp.cs.sjtu.edu.cn:990/zhang- lq/Papers/TensorFactorization/2004icpr_tensorRepresentaion_Wang.pdf
