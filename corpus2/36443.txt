I'm a pragmatic person (I think I am. But then again, Jon here has an interesting point ). Sometimes, the most simple solution to a problem to get the job done is the one that fits best for me, if it's not an utter blasphemy and reproach to any design principles. Check out my answer to this question on Stack Overflow. Simple. Works. Was accepted. Could be improved. Is clearly not perfect and not very elaborate. And along comes this guy. He downvotes me, comments on the question how his answer is better, more accurate etc and when I ask him why he downvoted me, he calls me _plain wrong_ in his comments. Reminds me of this comic strip. Just to get this straight: His answer is clearly better. But that's not the point! While on Stack Overflow I can laugh and not really care about these things because those people are far away, in the real world I'm suffering from ideologies every now and then. Heck, I'm not creating a miracle piece of software, I need to keep that huge legacy thing running, and it's an adventure to me every day. I'm good at some things and bad at other things. I'm eager to learn stuff. But I can accept one or two flaws in a system as what they are: flaws. Tomorrow, we're going to refactor all of them, but first let's do what the customer wants, and then have a beer. My questions are:   * How do you deal with ideologies / ideologists, when you're a pragmatic person?   * How do you deal with pragmatism / pragmatists, when you're an ideologic person? I'm interested in both point of views.
