I'm going to teach the basics of programming to a group of young kids (c.a. 10 year old) and was wondering if asking them to solve puzzles or play simple games with programming might be a clever thing to do? For example by asking them to write down the though process behind playing Tic-Tac-Toe. (1. Can I make a line? Then put a marker there 2. Can the enemy make a line? Then put a marker on that line. 3. Otherwise just put a marker anywhere.) Or something like that? If so are there any specific puzzles or simple games that are more suited to simple algorithms? Or should I just do it the traditional way by explaining variables, conditionals, etc. using examples and a console program?
