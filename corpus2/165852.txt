I am not clear on this one. No matter the terminology, in the end the software fault/bug causes (according to a lot of sources): > Deviation from requirements   >  Devation from expectations But if the expectations are not in requirements, then stakeholder could see a bug everywhere as he expected it to be like this or that..So how can I really know? I did read that specification can miss things and then of course its expected but not specified (by mistake).
