My question is about recognising soccer players in the pitch. Thanks to Bill S who wrote an excellent script to recognise parts of the players. I found this issue after testing his solution. I will describe his solution and then I will try to explain my 'new' problem.               img = Import["http://i.stack.imgur.com/K60Nl.gif"]      This shows you the following image: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/K60Nl.gif) I want to select all 'blue' soccer players               blue = PixelValuePositions[img, {0.580, 0.705, 0.796}];        {h, v} = ImageDimensions[img];         imgD = ConstantArray[0, {h, v}];         Length[Table[imgD[[Sequence @@ blue[[i]]]] = 1, {i, 1, Length[blue]}]];         bluePeople = ImageRotate[Dilation[Erosion[Image[imgD], 4], 8], Pi/2]     ComponentMeasurements[redPeople, "Centroid"];      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7KCXD.gif)               pixels = ComponentMeasurements[bluePeople, "Centroid"][[All, 2]];      This gives the values: `{{95.8636, 1120.96}, {1227.08, 1058.48}, {1598.58, 1049.69}, {1501.61, 919.903}, {1481.09, 854.259}, {83.0436, 740.669}, {61.3402, 662.205}, {786.63, 325.184}, {735.35, 250.843}, {790.906, 207.406}}`               Show[Image[img, ImageSize -> 600],       Graphics[{Black,         Table[Inset[ToString[i], pixels[[i]]], {i, 1, Length[pixels]}]}]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DarCt.gif) As you can see, the players below wear blue socks so the script recognises three 'centroids'. Why do I want this? I want to calculate the position of the 'blue' soccer players in the pitch. The 'best way' to do this is based on a central pixel position. So calculating the centroid is logical. But in this situation described, one soccer player has three centroids. How can I combine these three?
