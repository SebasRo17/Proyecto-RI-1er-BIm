### The question: Which is better, installing cygwin or one of its cousins on all my windows machines to have a consistent terminal experience across all my development machines, or becoming well trained in the skill of mentally switching from linux terminal to windows command prompt? ### Systems I use:   * OSX Lion on a Macbook Air   * Windows 8 on a desktop   * Windows 7 on the same desktop   * Fedora 16 on the same desktop ### What I'm trying to accomplish Configure an entirely consistent (or consistent _enough_ ) terminal experience across all my machines. "enough" in this context is clearly subjective. Please be clear in your answer **why** the configuration you suggest is consistent enough. ### One more thing to keep in mind: While I do write a lot of code intended to run on Windows (actually code that runs on Windows Phone which necessitates a windows machine), I also write a lot of Java code, and prefer to do so in vim. I test a local repo in Java on my windows machine, and push to another test machine running ubuntu later in the development stage. When I push to the ubuntu machine, I'm exclusively in terminal, since I'm accessing it via SSH. ### Summary, with more accurate question: Is there a good way to accomplish what I'm trying to do, or is it better to get accustomed to remembering different commands based on the system I'm on? Which (if either) is considered "best practice" by the development community? Alternatively, for a consistent development experience, would it be better to write **all** my code SSHed into another machine, and move things to windows for compile / build only when I needed to? That seems like too much work... but could be a solution. ### Update: While there are insightful responses below, I have yet to hear an answer that talks about _why_ any given solution is superior. Cygwin/GnuWin32 is certainly a way to accomplish a similar experience on all platforms, but since I'm just learning all things command line, I don't want to set myself up to do a lot of relearning/unlearning in the future. Cygwin/GnuWin32 has its peculiarities I would imagine, and being aware of how that set up works on Windows is a learning curve. Additionally, using Cygwin/GnuWin32 robs me of learning the benefits of PowerShell. As a newcomer to working in a command line, which path should I choose to minimize having to relearn/unlearn things in the future? or as my first paragraph poses: > [is it better to use Cygwin] ...or [become] well trained in the skill of > mentally switching from linux terminal to windows command prompt?
