Should the usage of Dependency Injection and an Inversion of Control container remove **all** occurrences of the "`new`" keyword from your code? In other words, should every object/dependency, no matter how simple or short- lived, be "registered" within your IoC container and injected into the method/class that needs to use them? If no, where do you draw the line between which dependencies/objects get registered in the IoC container, versus what gets created "in-line" as a concrete reference, via the `new` keyword ?
