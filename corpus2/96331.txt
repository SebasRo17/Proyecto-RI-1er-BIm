I am really confused with this. I believe that the more I am getting experience, the more I am becoming an expert at finding mistakes and fixing them quickly. Now my boss got website from a programmer who does very very bad coding. Now he sends the list of problems to fix. Suppose it's the stylesheet problem, and the old guy does not know how to fix it, but due to my experience I know straightaway what the problem is, and I can fix it in two minutes and many similar problems like that. But after fixing all that I realise that I fixed all problems in 15 minutes which other guy was not able to solve. I get 25$ per hour, so I feel very bad charging 6$ for that list of things which took many years of experience to learn. Is it OK to charge 6$ or should there be some way to charge things?
