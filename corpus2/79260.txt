I was reading the book Refactoring to patterns and was wondering how I can get chance to practice the skills, because without deliberate practice on new ways to refactor and use patterns, my skills won't improve. But office work requires me to finish each task as quickly as possible. Most of the time, the project's design and architecture isn't controlled by me, I can only follow the similar style as the existing code. Sometimes there is a project with a bad design, but there is also another developer whose design skill is better than me and he already has the whole plan to refactor the project, so that I'm just following his plan. How do I get opportunities to practice?
