I have a design that I've produced in Mathematica, consisting of two sets of `Rectangle` objects. The second set is a mirror image of the first and was produced with `array2 = Scale[#, -1, {0, 0}] & /@ array1`. I'm experiencing two issues when I `Export` the `Graphics` object to DXF:   1. The second set of `Rectangle`s doesn't get exported.   2. Each `Rectangle` gets exported as a pair of triangles. Mathematica's `Graphics` output: ![Mathematica output](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jvIG9.png) What AutoCAD displays: ![AutoCAD display](http://i.stack.imgur.com/l2PL7.png) `Import`ing the DXF file back into Mathematica also shows that the bottom half is missing. I'm at a loss here - what am I doing wrong? Are either of these weird behaviours deliberate? * * * Edit: Here is a snippet of my code. It generates the design for a surface acoustic wave resonator. This consists of two transducers next to two gratings, each made up of metal strips, separated by a certain number of wavelengths.               l = 2; (* wavelength in \[Mu]m *)          d = 25.5; (* cavity length in wavelengths *)     (* NB this is the distance between the fronts of the transducers *)     vRatio = 1; (* how much faster the speed of sound is in the centre \     section *)          nTransducer = 25; (* number of finger pairs in the transducers *)     nGrating = 370; (* number of fingers in the grating *)     (* NB 2 fingers == 1 wavelength *)          fingerLength = 25; (* finger length in wavelengths *)     (* NB finger length is measured from inside edge of the bus-bar *)          SetDirectory[NotebookDirectory[]];     filePath = "2um.dxf";          fingersT = Table[        Rectangle[         {-(fingerLength/2 - 1/2) l, y},         {(fingerLength/2 - 1/2) l, y + l/4}],        {y, (d*vRatio/2) l, (d*vRatio/2 + nTransducer -             1/2) l, l/2}];          (* -- the rest of the transducer is produced in a similar way -- *)          transducer =        Join[fingersT, lSquaresTOut, rSquaresTOut, lSquaresTIn,          rSquaresTIn] ~Append~ lBarT ~Append~ rBarT;          (* -- a grating is produced above the transducer in the same fashion -- *)          (* This line originally read: array1 = transducer ~Join~ grating; *)     array1 = fingersT;     array2 = Scale[#, -1, {0, 0}] & /@ array1;          diagram = Graphics[array1 ~Join~ array2]     Export[filePath, diagram, "DXF"];
