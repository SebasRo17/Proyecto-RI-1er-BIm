My company is getting PC refreshes with a choice of to have a desktop or laptop. Each one seems to have its pros and cons. Would you want the flexibility and freedom of the laptop but take the risk of working extra hours at home? Or a desktop limited to one place, but not having to worry about taking work home and disrupting home time? I'm not asking what would be better for coding, but more for convenience and productivity. I currently have a desktop and work about 8 to 9 hours a day, with only coming in on the weekends for when we get behind on major deadlines. I love developing but I also have quite a busy life after work. I feel that having a work laptop will only haze the line of work and home.
