In the following program, the `fec[x]` is a function depending on $x$ while `q3[t]` and `q5[t]` are functions depending on $t$. Now, I want to use `Integrate` for the polynomial which is composed by `fec[x]`, `q3[t]`, `q5[t]`, et al. for the independent variable $x$. I believe the result `c` is zero, but I don' t know why the software could not convert it to zero automatically. Could you help me?               inta = Cos[q3[t]] fec[x] q5[t]^2 D[q3[t], t]^2;     a = Integrate[inta, {x, 0, L1}];          b1 = Cos[q3[t]] q5[t]^2 D[q3[t], t]^2;     b = Integrate[fec[x], {x, 0, L1}] b1;          c = a - b;
