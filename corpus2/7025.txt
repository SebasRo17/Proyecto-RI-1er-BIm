I wanted to know how can I crop a `Manipulator` from a plot. the code for plot is                  a=  With[{z1 = .25, z2 = 1, x = 1},         Manipulate[       PopupWindow[     Graphics[      DiscretePlot[Sin[a t], {t, 0, 2 Pi, Pi/6}, ExtentSize -> Full,        ImageSize -> Scaled[x], AspectRatio -> z1/z2]], {a}],      OpenerView[{"Vertical", Control[{{a, 1, "Manipulator"}, 1, 30}]}],      ControlPlacement -> Bottom]]          I have tried using `Export` and `Import` functions and it is working fine                ImageCrop[Import[Export["test.gif", a, "Graphics"]], 90]      But, I wanted to know some other way to do this as I think `Export` and `Import` takes a lot of time in execution.
