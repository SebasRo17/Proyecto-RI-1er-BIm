I need to use a number of functions from the`Statistics`Library`` namespace. Since that is a bit of a mouthful I would like to import it, but I get errors:               In[42]:= Needs["Statistics`Library`"]          During evaluation of In[42]:= Get::noopen: Cannot open Statistics`Library`. >>          During evaluation of In[42]:= Needs::nocont: Context Statistics`Library` was not created when Needs was evaluated. >>          Out[42]= $Failed          In[43]:= << Statistics`Library`          During evaluation of In[43]:= Get::noopen: Cannot open Statistics`Library`. >>          Out[43]= $Failed      I can use individual functions from the namespace               In[44]:= Statistics`Library`DistributionDimensionality[      NormalDistribution[]]               Out[44]= 1      so the problem is not in the name. What is the problem then? What is the correct way to do the import?
