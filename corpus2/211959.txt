I have some difficulty understanding the concept of "fixture". I know what a test suite is, a test case, a test run, but what exactly is a "fixture"? A parameterized test case? It seems to me that the meaning or semantics of the term "fixture" can vary slightly by programming language or by testing framework? I think a _phpunit fixture_ > " _the code to set the world up in a known state and then return it to its > original state when the test is complete. This known state is called the > fixture of the test._ " is slightly different from a "fitnesse fixture", where > " _Fixtures are a bridge between the Wiki pages and the System Under Test > (SUT), which is the actual system to test_ ". Is there an expert in software testing around here who can answer this question? References to other programming languages are welcome. **Updates:** I'll add more definitions of _fixture_ here as when I encounter new ones. That'll be fun. Alternative definitions   * (anything that implements the ITestFixture interface) Source: sqa
