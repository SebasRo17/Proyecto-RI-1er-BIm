I am a Automation Engineer. I use QTP for Automation. I wanted to know couple of things.   1. In a scrum Project which has 2 weeks of work, how can complete automation be done in that time frame (talking only about the GUI Level)?   2. Similarly, how can API Level of automated testing be accomplished, especially inside a single sprint? And what exactly is API level testing?   3. How to begin with API Testing? I assume QTP is not the tool here certainly.
