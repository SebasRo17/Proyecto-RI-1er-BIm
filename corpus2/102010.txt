I have written a small front-end to the Festival TTS system using Python/Django. I wish to deploy it on the Google App Engine cloud. A few questions:   1. My application uses the Festival app 'text2wave'. Will is work on the cloud?   2. I have used Python primitives like subprocess.call() to invoke the aforementioned program. Will that work?   3. If your answer to any or both of (1) and (2) is no, is there a free api on the web that I can use (from the appengine)? I read somewhere about placing calls from Phono to a Voxeo backend, but I'm not sure what that means. I am aware of the Google Translate extension that allows translation using an HTTP GET (REST) request, but here the text is limited to 100 chars. Bad. Plus, they may take it down any point of time.
