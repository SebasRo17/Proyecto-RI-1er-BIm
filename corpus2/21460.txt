I would like to get a 3D visualization of a given matrix. Here is a figure which may come from _Mathematica_. I want to plot something like it. When I use `ListPlot3D` or `BarChart3D` to plot my matrix, it does not have the style of one shown below, which is what I'm look for. How can I do a nice 3D visualization of my matrix? ![visualization of a matrix](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XRlCG.png)               data = ( {         {1, 2, 3},         {5, 4, 8},         {2, 5, 7}        } );          data = ArrayPad[data, {0, 1}];     xTicks = {{1.5, "A"}, {2.5, "B"}, {3.5, "C"}};     yTicks = {{1.5, "X"}, {2.5, "Y"}, {3.5, "Z"}};     zTicks = {{0, "0"}, 0, {4, "4"}, {8, "8"}};          pic = ListPlot3D[data,        Mesh -> None,        InterpolationOrder -> 0,        ColorFunction -> "Rainbow",       Filling -> Bottom,       FillingStyle -> {Opacity[0.9]},       PlotRange -> {Min[data] - 0.5, Max[data] + 0.2},       BoxRatios -> {1, 1, 0.5},       Ticks -> {xTicks, yTicks, zTicks},       DataRange -> All,       Boxed -> False,       FaceGrids -> {Bottom, Back, Left},       ImageSize -> 400]      this is the code that I plot a matrix using `ListPlot3D`. The cuboids in it are not separate from each other, and the edges of the cuboid are fuzzy. ![my figure for matrix from the above code](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DkBUL.png)
