So I saw this picture on my book and it was left as an exercise to figure out. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vbtyD.png) This is what I have so far, but I'm not sure where I went wrong.                Plot[{t^3 - t}, {t, -1, 1}, PlotStyle -> Blue, Exclusions -> {t == 1},Exclusions -> {t == -1}, Exclusions -> {s == 2/(3*Sqrt[3])},Exclusions -> {s == -2/(3*Sqrt[3])}, ExclusionsStyle -> {Pink}]             I think somewhere I should use Epilog for that red dot, but with my original input incorrect, I cannot go any further.
