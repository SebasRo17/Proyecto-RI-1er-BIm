I am trying to distribute a small PC program, but have run into a few problems. I first tried to upload it to cNet, and then to softonic, but the problem with these sites, and all that I have seen like them is that they require a direct link(which I can't get, see below). After running into that problem, I simply uploaded my software to a file sharing site, but in reality, very few of my current users(from a mobile version)installed my software because once downloaded was listed as dangerous by the anti-virus due to the website that it was downloaded from. So then I set about trying to find a download website that would give me a direct link, but unsurprisingly, I can't find that. I can't host the file myself, because I don't have a webpage. Even though I haven't found any, I would be fine with a site that hosts my software and doesn't require a direct download link to use. Or I would be fine with a site that would give me a direct download link. I'm interested in an answer to the general problem - distributing software without a website. I assume that not everyone who has ever released software has their own webpage, what is the best way to get around this?
