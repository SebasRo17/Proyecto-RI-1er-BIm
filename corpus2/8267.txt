## Background My math background is strong by CS standards, probably normal by mathematica standards. (i.e. familiarity with real analysis, linear algebra, managed to read the proof of the prime number theorem :-) ) The goal here is NOT to start a hedge fund of sorts; it's mainly to pick up the basics of financial / stock market background (but it's much more fun when I'm playing with real data / writing programs rather than just reading a textbook.) I want to play around with learning the basics of finance (and writing some serious code in Mathematica). Ideally, I want to "learn by doing" -- i.e. rather than just read textbook formulas, I would like to:   * play with real world stock data   * implement the various definitions / algorithms / functions and see how they work Looking around, the best I have found is this book: Computational Financial Mathematics using MATHEMATICAÂ®: Optimal Trading in Stocks and Options Seems like the most highly recommended However, since I'm clueless, I would like to get some feedback (and suggestions for other resources to use for learning.) Thanks!
