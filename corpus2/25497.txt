`Graphics`Mesh`SimplePolygonQ` is an undocumented function. I'm using Mathematica 7, and when I try:               Graphics`Mesh`SimplePolygonQ[{{1, 0}, {0, Sqrt[3]}, {-1, 0}}]       I just get: > Graphics`Mesh`SimplePolygonQ[{{1, 0}, {0, $\sqrt{3}$, {-1, 0}}] I posted a question and a respondent successfully used this function in the code of her answer. Does anyone else have trouble using this function? Any ideas why it won't work for me?
