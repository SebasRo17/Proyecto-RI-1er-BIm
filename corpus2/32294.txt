I have several variables in my `DynamicModule` and some parts of my computation depend only on subset of them. I am trying to use Refresh to "cache" values but can't make it work. Example of the problem:               verySlowFunction[x_] := Module[{}, Print["SLOW"]; x * x];          DynamicModule[      {a = 1, b = 1},      Dynamic[       Module[        { x = Refresh[verySlowFunction[a], TrackedSymbols :> {a}] },        Column[{          Slider[Dynamic[a]],          Slider[Dynamic[b]],          {a, b , x + x + b}           }]]]]      I expect "SLOW" to be printed only when I drag "a" slider, but it is printed when I'm dragging "b" slider as well. I know that Dynamic clones whole expression tree on its evaluation, that's why `x` is always different, but this one doesn't work as well:               Module[      {x},      DynamicModule[       {a = 1, b = 1},       Dynamic[         x = Refresh[verySlowFunction[a], TrackedSymbols :> {a}] ;        Column[{          Slider[Dynamic[a]],          Slider[Dynamic[b]],          {a, b , x + x + b}           }]]]]
