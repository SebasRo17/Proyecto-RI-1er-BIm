I'm a Mathematica beginner and can't find out a solution to my problem. I have a list of pairs of numbers, for example something like this, but much longer: list={{2., 3.}, {3., 2.}, {5., 4.}, {4., 0.}, {5., 0.}, {5., 0.}, {4., 0.}, {5., 4.}}. And now I need to get only pairs for which some rule is true. For example, I'd like Mathematica to give me pairs {x,y} from the aforementioned list, where x=5 and y is any. So in this case I'd get pairs {5., 4.},{5., 0.},{5., 0.} and {5., 4.}. Is there any way to do this? Thanks :))
