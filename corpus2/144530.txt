I'm in the middle of a project and I was asked to write UML diagrams (use cases,class diagram,etc). The project isn't very complex. I was wondering if this be a waste of my time? Should I just be doing other fun stuff like writing code? And when is it not ok to build something without going through all of the conceptual phase? Is it all about complexity? And if so, how to measure it?
