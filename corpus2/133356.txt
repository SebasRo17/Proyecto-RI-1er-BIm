For 3 tables that are in 3NF, a many-to-many relationship, is there a standard name or term to describe the 3rd table, the one that associates the other tables? Basically, I'm looking for a semantic way to name the 3rd table. **Example** You have two tables: _users_ and _widgets_. A user can have multiple widgets and a widget can be owned by multiple users. What is the most semantic name for the 3rd table? In the past, I've used the following at one time or another:   * userWidgets   * userWidgetAssn (association)   * userWidgetXref (cross-reference) In my example, userWidgets is probably my top choice, but it doesn't always work as cleanly depending on the table names. Is there an industry standard?
