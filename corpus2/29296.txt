I picked up the following leaf today while going for a walk. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cnvC4.jpg) And wanted then to run the same analysis that @Vitaly Kaurov did for rivers under this posting Measuring Fractal Dimensions of natural objects from digital images and then also proceed to measure the length of branches and angles of the ribs and veins of the leaf as shown in this other posting. how-to-measure-segment-length-and-branch-angle The final objective would be to collect different leaves from different species and prepare some sort of visualization of the different species. I played around with different ImageProcessing functions, the best I could do was the following.               leaf = ImageRotate[Import["http://i.stack.imgur.com/cnvC4.jpg"], \[Pi]/2];     leafBW = ColorSeparate[leaf, "RGB"][[3]];     ribs = ImageAdd[MinDetect[leafBW, 0.27], MaxDetect[leafBW, 0.27]]      ![Processed Leaf](http://i.stack.imgur.com/S4khO.png) The questions are:   1. Is there a better way to process the image to maximize the details of ribs and secondary veins?   2. How can we eliminate the edge of the leaf from the image?
