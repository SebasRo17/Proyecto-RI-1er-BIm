Is it bad software design to have JDBC/raw SQL and also use an ORM? I don't mind using an ORM for boilerplate CRUD, but some queries are better in SQL (for me). I'm not arguing for or against ORMs. I've read about them until I'm blue in the face. I used JDBC in my question, but it could have been DBI, or some other database interface. ORM can be any of them. How about maintainability? Would mixing the strategies complicate it? To me the maintainability of an application efficiently becomes even more blurrier, if it is a compiled language vs. a scripting language. I have to recompile Java. I don't have to recompile Python or PHP. If my SQL is in a model layer, does that change anything? EDIT: If I use find a point where I need to use SQL in my ORM, in my model, what kind of data is sent back? I won't be able to use something like person.save('somevalue'), for example, will I?
