Consider the following linear system $$\dot{x}=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{m}{{{\alpha }_{i}}}\left( t \right)\cdot {{A}_{i}}\cdot x \quad (1) $$   where, $x\in {{\mathbb{R}}^{n}}$ represents the state vector, $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{m}{{{\alpha }_{i}}}\left( t \right)=1$, ${{\alpha }_{i}}\left( t \right)$are functions and ${{\alpha }_{i}}\left( t \right)>0$, ${{A}_{i}}\in {{\mathbb{R}}^{n\times n}}$ are constant matrices, $i=1,\cdots ,m$. Once system (1) is stable , then the Euclidean norm of vector $x$ is bounded. Now, the questions are as the following: 1) what’s the upper bound for $\left\| x \right\|$ when system (1) is stable; 2) what’s the stability condition for system (1)? (Lyapunov function may be an appropriate and conventional method to derive the conditions for the stability of system (1).)
