When I programmed in python, I believe I interfaced with the transport layer using sockets. If python was programmed by humans, they must have used an interface that was "lower" than sockets, to provide _us_ with the interface to sockets. I assume firewalls, also programmed by humans, use interfaces of lower layers in the same manner, so is there a way to access such lower layers, in terms of programming?
