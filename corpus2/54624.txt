I have 4 data points. t is in minutes, and y is radioactive counts per minute. When I input the following lines:               data = {{90., 140075.}, {120., 96018.}, {150., 73003.}, {180., 36980.}};     model = a*Exp[-k*t];     fit = FindFit[data, model, {a, k}, t]      the output given is:               {a -> 64.6435, k -> 0.29285}      This is clearly not correct. The parameter 'a' should be somewhere around 530000 (as per Excel's fitted equation). What's happening here, and how can I fix this? I'm surprised a bit. This is a simple exponential fit. What am I doing wrong?
