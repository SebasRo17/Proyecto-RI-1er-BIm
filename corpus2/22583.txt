I'm talking about something like this:               echo $form->input('general_addresss', array(                 'label' => 'Where will you go today?'                 'format' => array('before', 'input', 'after', 'label', 'after', 'error')                 ));      Do you start with one array parameter, then break a line? If it can't fit on a line, do you immediately break a line? After of which, do you do a set number of tabs over? What happens if an array within an array has lots of properties? Is there any particular guide you follow?
