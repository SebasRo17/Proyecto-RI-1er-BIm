I'm currently working on some closed-source proprietary software that makes use of a library ( **SharpAVI** ) distributed with the MIT License. The SharpAVI source _isn't_ being used directly anywhere in my project, only the unchanged .dll provided for download on the codeplex site linked above. The .dll is referenced in one very small distinct project inside a much larger solution (consisting of a single wrapper class around the functionality provided by SharpAVI). I'm particularly concerned about this wording: > The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in > all copies or substantial portions of the Software. Does the license need to be included in a file with _my_ code, which is linked to the licensed code by .dll, and includes none of the original source? Would this make my wrapper code an MIT-licensed product (that would seem to go against the non-viral nature of the license)? If my wrapper needs to become licensed under the MIT License, wouldn't that propagate to any other code that references it as well? **How do I properly attribute the license information for a linked MIT- Licensed .dll without releasing my own code under the MIT License?**
