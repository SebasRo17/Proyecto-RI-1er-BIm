Once in a while I encounter a C function in my colleagues' code. Mostly it is in some helpful objective categories, and those functions are mostly an internal calculation of something or a comparison of values. Since those guys are not part of the company anymore, I can't ask them why they decided to go with a C function instead of a proper objective C method. So the question is: Why implement certain algorithms as a C function instead of objective C method? What are the considerations?
