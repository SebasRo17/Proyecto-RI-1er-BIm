We are part of a software company which was just acquired by a larger one. This company has a large development center in India; we are based in Europe. We don't yet know what will happen with our projects, maybe they will be outsourced, maybe not but I want to know if we can rival an indian programmer as what salary is concerned. I know there are a lot of factors involved here, not just the salary issue, but I just want to get an ideea of the difference. Can someone mention salaries (in euros or dollars) and associated years of experience. I found some info on the web but it is not that recent. Thanks in advance!
