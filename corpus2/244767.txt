I often make the mistake of inverting my truth values in my code (e.g. in my if clauses). It gives me the same feeling as when making an OBOE (Off By One Error), even though it's technically not. Would you call it an OBOE, or better yet, is there a specific term for "off by truth value"-errors? My reasoning is that all possible values of a boolean are `true` and `false`. In other words, the possible values are contained in the array: `[true, false]`. If you access this array by index, you'll always be off by one… when selecting the wrong one. This becomes especially obvious when you calculate your index as: `index = someInt % 2`.   Now I understand that this usually not the case, but in my mind, it always feels like this. Almost got it, just off by one…
