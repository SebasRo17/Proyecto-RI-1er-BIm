![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Jhbqb.jpg) I'm trying to write a program where it will shoot out the triangle node numbers. For example, in the picture, if we choose to divide this triangle by 5 points, then the program will return out the following:               dat1 = {{0, 1, 6}, {1, 2, 7}, {2, 3, 8}, {3,4, 9}, {4, 5, 10}, {6, 7, 11}, {7, 8, 12}, {8, 9, 13}, {9, 10, 14}, {11, 12, 15}, {12, 13, 16}, {13, 14, 17}, {15, 16, 18}, {16, 17, 19}, {18, 19, 20}}          dat2 = {{1, 7, 6}, {2, 8, 7},{3, 9, 8}, {4, 10, 9}, {7, 12, 11}, {8, 13, 12}, {9, 14, 13}, {12, 16, 15}, {13, 17, 16}, {16, 19, 18}}      So dat1 is the list of the bottom triangles, while dat 2 is the list of the top triangles. So depending on how many points we divide the triangle by (in picture it is 5), then it will return out dat1 and dat2. Any suggestions or help on this?
