First of all, sorry for my English. We've developed a Web Application using ASP.NET and Sql Server. We've started selling it and of course are still continually improving and developing it. The question is, how do we go about updating each client's version of the site? We have, maybe, 50 customers. 50 different folders and 50 different db's sounds like a bad idea. Is there any known method for solving this kind of scenario? `For Explain:` We are developing a Crm, for 50 companies. They will have 10 users maybe. It makes 500 users and their customers and products.
