How exactly is portability of a language like C is determined? I've learned that compilers are ISA specific. If this is true, how is C portable? Or is it that just the source code written in C is portable but not the executables? Aren't the executables ISA specific for examples applications for x86 are separate from the applications for Apple (assuming Apple uses Motorola/PowerPC microprocessor)?
