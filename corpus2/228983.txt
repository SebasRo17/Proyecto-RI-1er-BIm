To always have a potentially shippable product at the end of each 2-week Sprint, we need to rerun a lot of regression tests at the end of each Sprint. This is very repetitive and time consuming, so eventually it will probably be cost-effective to automate these tests. However if we don't require a potentially shippable product, but plan for a few stabilization/hardening Sprints, we don't need to rerun all our manual tests each Sprint. In such case automating our tests will not be cost- effective. So which approach do you prefer, to automate tests, to forgo the shippability advantage, or do you think that this trade-off doesn't actually exist?
