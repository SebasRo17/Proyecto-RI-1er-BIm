Thank you for looking and answering this question. I am trying to create a new matrix from an old one. Meaning, I have a original matrix that's 20x20. I want to keep the first five lines of the matrix, then from line 6-10 I want to take every other line, meaning line 7 and 9 would be deleted, but also column 7 and 9 need to be deleted. Then from line 11-20, I want to take every 3 lines, so the rows and columns need to be deleted accordingly.
