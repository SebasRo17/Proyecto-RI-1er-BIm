So I read a post on here asking about college vs. university and the consensus seemed to be that University was worth it. My question is, does that by extension make college worthless? \---the details-- I'm at a point in my life where I want a change of careers, I've always done web-dev on the side and now I want to program as a career. My 2 options are a computer programming diploma at humber, seneca (or similar) or computer science at UofT. I can get into both courses (as I was formerly a student at UofT) but the University route is far more costly and will take 4 years instead of 2. I realize that in a perfect world the university option would be better (the general concensus in the other threads I read), but the extra money and time would be very difficult to reconcile since during this time we will need to rely solely on my wife's income. If university is the only possible option there is a chance I might need to scrap this dream all together since it might not be doable. If taking the 4 years in university isn't possible for me, is there any point in getting the college diploma? The college diploma has some Java and even Android specific courses so I could see the potential career path, but the previous threads have me discouraged on that option. I don't want to spend two years to end up with nothing.
