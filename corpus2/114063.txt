I am currently a student with the intention of pursuing a career as a programmer. All of my assignments are functional and complete to the letter but I feel as though there is plenty more work that could be done on these applications beyond the scope of the assessment. Will putting in the extra hours into these assignments help me land a job? Also, I was thinking of showcasing my programming skills with a video demonstration of my work. Do you think potential employers would respond well to this kind of visual resume?
