My development team is in the process of 'going agile' and lot of people are looking at each other blankly, not really too sure what it means. All management are saying is 'start working agile' without suggesting any particular methodology so they're waiting to see if we can come up with something ourselves. Has anyone been in this situation before and how did you handle it? Any do's and don'ts? I'm one of the senior members of the team so there's an expectation to show some initiative. I know that what works for one won't necessarily work for another so I'm more interested in the approach not so much the end result because I think the result will come naturally with the right approach.
