I am an economic research student with no previous experience with _Mathematica_ , so please pardon me if my questions sounds really stupid. I am hoping to solve a system of nonlinear ODEs symbolically. I heard that the `DSolve` utility is very handy for this sort of problem, but before I invest my time in it, I hope to make sure that _Mathematica_ is the answer I want. Specifically, my system contains some function coefficients, but I do not know their explicit expression as of now, and they are just expressed as $\phi(t), \;\psi(t)$ etc. It also contains some unspecified constant coefficient as well. Can `DSolve` handle this situation? If not, I'd very much appreciate it if someone could suggest any alternative methods. Thank you!! * * * **Edit:** My system looks something like this: $\beta\phi(t)\lambda(t)x(t)^{\alpha}y(t)^{\beta-1}-\psi(t)=0\\\ \frac{dx}{dt}=\phi(t)x(t)^{\alpha}y(t)^{\beta}-\gamma{}x(t)\\\ \frac{d\lambda}{dt}=k\psi(t)-\lambda(t)[\alpha\phi(t)x(t)^{\alpha-1}y(t)^{\beta}-\gamma]$ where $\lambda(t)\text{, }x(t)\text{ and }y(t)$ are the functions I want to solve for, and $\phi(t)$ and $\psi(t)$ are function coefficients without explicit expressions, $\alpha,\;\beta,\;\gamma$ and $k$ are unspecified coefficients. I hope the solutions can be expressed in terms of integrals of $\phi(t)$ and $\psi(t)$. Is that possible?
