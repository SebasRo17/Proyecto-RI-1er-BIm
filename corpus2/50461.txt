I have a vector (3D) valued function of two variables. I want to visualize it as a density plot, using R,G,B color values to display the value at the point (x,y). I've come up with a couple of attempts, neither satisfactory. One is to use a Raster, but that doesn't adapt to the function and so needs too many function evaluations. My other solution is to make three contour plots and combine them, but to do that I needed to use Opacity and then the range of colors is muted. Here's an example, with a simple function:               f[x_, y_] := {x, y, x + y}     Table[        DensityPlot[f[x, y][[i]], {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1},                    ColorFunction -> (ReplacePart[RGBColor[0,0,0], i -> #] &)],        {i, 3}]     Show[Table[        DensityPlot[f[x, y][[i]], {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1},              ColorFunction -> ({Opacity[1/3], ReplacePart[RGBColor[0,0,0], i -> #]} &)],        {i, 3}]]      The first table shows three DensityPlots with the RGB components I want, which look like this: ![rgb component images](http://imgur.com/kGOnj5m.png) The Show combines them into one. But what I really want to do is **add** the color values in the three plots, and Show with Opacity averages them, giving a murky image. In this example, I want white in the upper right, black in the lower left.
