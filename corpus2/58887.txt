I have a series of data and Ive ploted them by mathematica.how can I change the x-axis scale?for example instead of "x" being between 0-300, I want to plot my data between 0-2 scale. this is my code:               data = Import["Desktop/kmc final result.txt", "List"];     bb = SmoothKernelDistribution[data];     cc = SmoothKernelDistribution[data];     h[y_] = ((1/207) PDF[bb, y])*(PDF[cc, y]);     time = 100;     J[y_] := -1/time Log[h[y]];     plt1 = Plot[J[y], {y, 0, 300}, Frame -> True,        PlotStyle -> {Blue, PointSize[0.004]}, PlotRange -> All]
