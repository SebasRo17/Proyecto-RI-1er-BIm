My group has recently grown in size with the addition of several teams from different projects. We work using an Agile programming methodology: 2 week sprints, deliverable every sprint, 2-3 pushes to production every sprint for each team. How do I "convert" the newly added teams to this methodology and way of thinking with as little trauma and resistance from the members of these teams?         Note: I'm not asking if they want to change their methodology, they will have to operate this way to be in sync with the rest of the group. This is a different question than this one as all other teams already work using Agile programming.
