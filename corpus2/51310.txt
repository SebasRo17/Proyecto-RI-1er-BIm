I'm trying to perform a numerical integral with an integrand that should not be manipulated with any symbolic preprocessing whatsoever. Consider the following simple test :               test[a_]:=If[NumericQ[a],a*a,Abort[] (*Meaning the parameter a is not numerical*)]      So if the parameter of `test` is numerical, this function should only return `a*a`. Now if I try to integrate this as follows:               NIntegrate[test[a],{a,-0.5,0.5},Method -> {Automatic, "SymbolicProcessing" -> 0}]      this does not work (it will be aborted). **Is there any way around this ? I.e. some option I haven't considered for NIntegrate ?** Note that an easy way to fix this would be to use:               test[a_?NumericQ]:=If[NumericQ[a],a*a,Abort[]]      But **I want to avoid using** `?NumericQ`since this slows down your numerical integration by a lot...
