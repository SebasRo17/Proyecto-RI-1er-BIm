Android and mobile development is an exciting area of development. As it is a new discipline, what would be expected of an android developer to build commercially robust applications in terms of skills ? The problem that I and, i think, many other "noobs" into the technology would like to know are the areas of technical skills and the progression to the required advanced topics that goes beyond the the very basics provided by Google. There is _a lot_ of information that's quite useful but its not organised into categories of discipline nor order. **Update** : Look at it this way. If you're a senior dev, and needed to get a fellow colleague upto speed on Android for a particular project, (at your discretion for this question), what would you do ?
