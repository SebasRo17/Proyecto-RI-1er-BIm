I would like to draw an undirected graph by specifying the nodes and the edges among them. This is currently done by, for example:               GraphPlot[{1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 4, 4 -> 5, 5 -> 6, 6 -> 7, 7 -> 8, 8 -> 1}]      In addition, I would like to lay out the graph within a specified region of x-y coordinate system. Imagine this specified region as the 'canvas' in which the above circle is drawn. For instance, such a canvas can be specified by four points such as `(0, 0), (100, 0), (100, 100), (0, 100)`. Lastly, I would like to get the coordinates for each of the nodes of the graph drawn within the specified 'canvas'. What is the right workflow in Mathematica to accomplish each of the steps above?
