Mathematica has some predefined CUDA functions, like CUDAMap, CUDAFourier, etc. My question is how can one call functions which are part of CUDA library but not part of predefined Mathematica functions? For example, CUDA 6.0 has a large Math library; so if I am to call cuFFT from that library instead of using CUDAFourier, how would I go about doing this? Do I have to write a C code which calls the cuda library function and then call the c function from Mathematica. That seems too round about way of doing something. I could not quite find it in the documentation. Thanks very much!
