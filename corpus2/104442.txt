I'm in a long debugging task, I need to figure out where to hook up some extra functionality I need. It's cumbersome work, and I've been debugging 2 whole days, and I'm on my third, but I work in multiple projects, and I'm returning to this after almost a week, and it's been hard to get back to the point I left at, and remember what was all this about, and what conclusions had I already arrived at. How do you keep track of what you were doing/thinking in this kind of scenario where comments aren't actually the "right thing" to do? I do some comments in my testing code, plus some informative git/hg commit messages but that's kind of dirty.. written paper might be the answer...
