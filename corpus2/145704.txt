What would be the best approach to achieving private communication between my iOS app and its server component? Is having a single unchanging “secret key” baked into the app source enough, or do I need to set up generations of such “handshake” keys dynamically somehow? The server by itself doesn’t have access to any sensitive data, so even if the user hits some private endpoints, it won’t get them anywhere, but I just want those to be hidden from the public. Basically, I want to ignore all requests hitting particular routes, unless they are coming from my iOS app. The server component runs on RoR, if that’s important.
