When creating websites, is it better to have a lot of images in one folder, or have them separated? It's something that has always been in my mind but I never researched enough about it, and googling didn't give me many answers. So I have been building mostly sites for real estate agencies since I started, and I always liked to organize the images by folders, lets say in webroot/photos/$propertyId/ but sometimes I've seen websites storing all the images in a folder, and differencing them mainly by the name. I never had to build a huge website, so this has been in my mind but didn't concern me too much, but I would like to know, generally which of the 2 ways is a better approach. Is there really a human noticeable performance difference when performing different action like searching/deleting those files? Keep in mind that sometimes there's not a images limit on the galleries, so having one column per image path/name in the property's row is not often an option for me, I would have to use another table to relate them. Also I would like to mention that for example in my last project I had to manage tens of GB's of images, we had like 300000 properties and they had lets say an average of 10 pictures per property.
