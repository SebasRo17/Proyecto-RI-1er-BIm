Suppose I have a list of symbols like:               {a,b,c,d}      I would like to enumerate all possible binary associations (combining symbols and/or sublists pairwise):               {{{a,b},c},d}     {{a,b},{c,d}}     {a,{b,{c,d}}}     {{a,{b,c}},d}     {a,{{b,c},d}}      There should be altogether 5 solutions for this example. My question is how can I enumerate all such associations for a generic list? I have tried               ReplaceList[{a,b,c,d},{u___,v_,w_,x___}:>{u,{v,w},x}]      But this only works for the first layer.
