Consider the following question. I have a long selection of files (some 5,000), arranged linearly, and I want to view to what degree the files have changed between each other. For a small example, here are some (nonsensical) strings:               string1 = "i am a cheese ball";     string2 = "i am a cheese bull";     string3 = "i am a cheese frog";     string4 = "i am a cheesy frog";     string5 = "i am a cheesy frog";     string6 = "i am a cheesy curd";     stringlist = {string1, string2, string3, string4, string5, string6};      Here is how to manually get my answer, which is `{1,4,1,0,4}`:               list = {EditDistance[string1, string2],        EditDistance[string2, string3], EditDistance[string3, string4],        EditDistance[string4, string5], EditDistance[string5, string6]}      There must be an automated solution, however, that moves through the list and gets the `EditDistance[]` between each set of things (i.e. 1 to 2, then 2 to 3, then 3 to 4, then 5 to 6, etc.). Outside of a convoluted set of `Do[]` loops, however, I can't find the proper command. I suspect the issue is that I'm having trouble expressing mathematically what I want to do here.
