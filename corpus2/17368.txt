Excel serial dates are not straightforward to convert since they include non- existent dates, e.g.               {DatePlus[{1990, 1, 0}, 59], DatePlus[{1990, 1, 0}, 60]}      > {{1990, 2, 28}, {1990, 3, 1}} ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KcKuw.png) As shown, Mathematica finds date 60 is March 1st while Excel converts it to Feb 29th. To do the conversion I would like to use .NETLink with               DateTime dt = DateTime.FromOADate(60);      as given here. Can anyone help? I imagine something of the following form would work:               Needs["NETLink`"];          convertDate[serialdate_] :=      NETBlock[       InstallNET[];       (Mathematica form of DateTime.FromOADate (serialdate))       ]      **Edit** As Sjoerd pointed out, the problem is caused by an Excel bug, but only for year 1900. Conversion can be done using this:               convertDate[serialdate_] :=       If[serialdate < 61, "N/A", DatePlus[{1901, 1, 0}, serialdate - 366]]      I would still be interested to see how it would be implemented in NETLink, for future reference for applications making quick calls to .NET.
