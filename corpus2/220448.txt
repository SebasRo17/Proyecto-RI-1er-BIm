My application has user controls within user controls. Please see a screen shot of one of the most beautiful applications of all time (UC = user control): ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/EEvpd.png) All the properties live in the MainWindow code behind, there are none in my UserControls. To bind to my properties I use               DataContext="{Binding RelativeSource={RelativeSource Mode=FindAncestor, AncestorLevel=1,AncestorType=Window}}"      This works fine but, it does mean all binding properties are in my MainWindow code behind (or the MainWindow ViewModel). Is this desired in a MVVM (or should I say WPF) approach, in that all the children share the same ViewModel?
