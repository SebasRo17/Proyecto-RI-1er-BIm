I have three `InputField`-s which have no initial value. I would like all `InputFields` to have a value in descending order and for each `InputField`, a "right" and "wrong" symbol should be displayed as soon as some value is entered in any of these `InputFields`. The user can enter his first value, say 89 in any of the `InputField` between 100 and 0. It will always show "right" symbol as all other `InputField`-s are empty. If he choose the next `InputField` to be filled in the right hand side of the previous `InputField`, then that value should be between 89 and 0 else it should show wrong dynamically. And If he chooses some other `InputField` to be filled in the left hand side of the first `InputField`, then that value should be between 100 and 89 else it is wrong. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SH8WJ.png) I faced the problem when I skipped the first `InputField` and entered 76 in the second `InputField`. It looked alright but as soon as I entered 89 in the third `InputField`, both were shown as wrong.               logicalInputField[i_, numberOfFields_, tx_, symbol_, upperLimit_,      lowerLimit_, noValue_, right_, wrong_] :=        (txtx = tx; sysy = symbol; upup = upperLimit;lolo = lowerLimit; nono = noValue; riri    = right; wrwr = wrong;      Column[{InputField[Dynamic[txtx[[i]]], Number, FieldSize -> 3,         Alignment -> {Center, Center}, ContinuousAction -> True],       ( Dynamic[(  If[txtx[[i]] == Null,    (txtx[[i]] = ""; sysy[[i]] = noValue), (sysy[[i]] = right)    ];                For[j = i - 1, j >= 1, j--, If[txtx[[j]] != "", (upup[[i]] = txtx[[j]]; Break[];),             ""]];           For[k = i + 1, k <= numberOfFields, k++,                      If[txtx[[k]] != "", (lolo[[i]] = txtx[[k]]; Break[];),             ""]];                                               If[txtx[[i]] >= lolo[[i]],                                                                (sysy[[i]] =               right;), (sysy[[i]] = wrong;)   ];             If[lolo < txtx[[i]] <= upup[[i]],                                                         (sysy[[i]] =               right;), (sysy[[i]] = wrong;) ];               sysy[[i]] )    ])   }]) ;                                                               DynamicModule[{s = {}, enterValue = "ENTER", correct = "RIGHT", incorrect = "WRONG"}, For[i = 1, i <= 3, i++,  DynamicModule[{i = i},       AppendTo[s, logicalInputField[i, 3, {"", "", ""}, {enterValue, enterValue, enterValue}, {100, 100,        100}, {0, 0, 0}, enterValue, correct, incorrect]]] ];           Panel[ Row[s, Spacer[0]]]]
