May be this question is a duplicate and I am a dumb to ask it here, but I searched a bit and none of the titles suggested to answer my question exactly . There are some very experienced folks on SO who always talk about the C standard. People seem to not like non-portable solutions, even if they work for me. Ok, I understand that the standard needs to be followed , but doesn't it put shackles on programmer's creativity? What are the concrete benefits that come from following a standard? Especially since compilers may implement the standard slightly differently.
