As a part of self-evalution, I bumped into this programmer competency matrix which collects many major aspects of being good/expert programmer. It really helped me a lot to understand what I know about programming, what I don't know and what I have never even thought about. Now, I would need same kind of matrix about 3D graphics programming skills - not so much about using software to build models but about general 3D stuff, mathematics, using shaders, performance/optimizations etc. Does anyone have an idea where I could find one? It does not have to be perfect (and not even matrix necessarily) but it would be nice to have at least some basic aspects covered.
