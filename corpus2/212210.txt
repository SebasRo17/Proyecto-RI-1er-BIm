When making mockups for _Responsive Web Design_ projects, should I separate them by **Page** or by **Screen Size**? Which one would be more helpful when I start writing the source code? What are the pros and cons of the following:   * Page based: All the home page mockups in all different screen sizes   * Screen-size based: All the pages for width <= 960px I'm using Balsamiq Mockups to make mockups and I prefer to store all related mockups in a file like `homepage, login` or `960px, 768px`.
