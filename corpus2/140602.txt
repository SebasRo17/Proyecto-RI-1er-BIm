I've been studying OO programming, primarily in C++, C# and Java. I thought I had a good grasp on it with my understanding of encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism (as well as reading a lot of questions on this site). One thing that seems to popup up here and there is the concept of "message passing". Apparently, this is something that is not used whilst OO programming in today's mainstream languages, but is supported by Smalltalk. My questions are:   * What is message passing? (Can someone give a practical example?)   * Is there any support for this "message passing" in C++, C# or Java?
