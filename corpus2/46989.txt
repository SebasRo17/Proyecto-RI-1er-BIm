Given the following joint density: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3TnJI.png) for 10 < x < 20, x/2 < y < x. To find the marginal density for X we do:               PDF[MarginalDistribution[ProbabilityDistribution[1/25 ((20 - x)/ x),                                                       {x, 10, 20}, {y, x/2, x}], 1], x]      But this does nothing because the range of values for `y` is dependent on `x` and non-numeric. But the marginal density w.r.t `x` is just the value of the following integral:               Integrate[1/25 ((20 - x)/x ), {y, x/2, x}]      Which correctly gives               (20 - x)/50      If we now change the same for a different distribution with a numerical range:               PDF[MarginalDistribution[ProbabilityDistribution[2/3 (x + 2 y),                                                       {x, 0, 1}, {y, 0, 1}], 1], x]      we get ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tp0TV.png) Which is correct since:               Integrate[2/3 (x + 2 y), {y, 0, 1}]      gives:               2/3 + (2 x)/3      So my question is why doesn't the symbolic range work, if internally _Mathematica_ is just doing the same integration I did above.?
