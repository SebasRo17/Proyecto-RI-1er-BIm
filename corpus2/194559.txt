What would be the best approach to reset a mobile app's content/settings? Lets say the app is cross platform: apple/android using javascript/phonegap. The current way this is designed is to have an admin area that can see mobile devices (users which have logged in). The admin has the ability to flag a device for reset. The app regularly polls the server to see if it should be reset. Resetting will be rare, but the polling is not. The polling doesn't cause any performance issues but it seems off to constantly be asking the server whether or not to blow up the app. A push rather than a pull method would be nice but I'm not sure what this would look like. Does anyone have any alternative design suggestions? Are there any drawbacks to the current design?
