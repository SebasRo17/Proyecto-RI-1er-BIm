I have an instance of a class `UntouchableClass` of which I need to access the member variables to use in my DotLiquid template. Problem is, `UntouchableClass` has to inherit from `Drop` if I want to use it in my template, but I can't change it since it is from an existing library. I've read about the Adapter pattern, but `UntouchableClass` does not have an interface from which to inherit the Adapter. Also, I can't use multiple inheritance (I would create a class which inherits from both `UntouchableClass` and `Drop` but this is C# and from what I know this isn't possible). Is there a design pattern that would suit this situation? Or is there a particular way to do this using DotLiquid?
