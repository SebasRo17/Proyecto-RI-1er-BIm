I am fairly new to _Mathematica_ (version 7), so please bear with me... I have duplicated, in _Mathematica_ , a program that I originally wrote in C (it generates OEIS sequence A191837). The problem is that each time I make a change to the function `nCk` the first evaluation doesn't print. I have to stop the evaluation and then start it again to see the result of my change. What am I missing? Also, does anyone have any tips on how to make the code more compact?               For[smnds = 4; m = 6, smnds <= 60, m += 6,       s = {};       sum = smndct = pct = 0;       For[p = 5, p < m/2, p += 2,        If[PrimeQ[p] && PrimeQ[m - p],         If[sum + p > m, Break[]];         If[smndct++ < smnds - 1, sum += p];         AppendTo[s, p];         pct++]];       If[pct >= smnds, sdf = Range[smnds];        While[nCk[Length[s], smnds]]]       ];     (* Subsets[] uses too much memory, so process each         combination one at a time. *)      nCk[vy_, vz_] :=       Block[{indx = ns = vy, i = rs = vz, ct = tot = 0},        If[(sdf[[1]] - 1) == (ns - rs),         For[ct = 1, ct <= rs, ct++, tot += s[[sdf[[ct]]]]];         If[tot == m, Print["a(", smnds/2, ") = ", tot];          smnds += 2; m -= 6; Return[False], Return[False]]];        While[sdf[[i]] == indx && i > 1, --i; --indx];        sdf[[i]] += 1;        i++;        While[i <= rs, sdf[[i]] = sdf[[i - 1]] + 1; ++i;];        For[ct = 1, ct <= rs, ct++, tot += s[[sdf[[ct]]]];         If[tot > m, Break[]]];        If[tot == m, Print["a(", smnds/2, ") = ", tot];         smnds += 2; m -= 6; Return[False]];        Return[True]        ];
