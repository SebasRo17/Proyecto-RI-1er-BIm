Today I got yelled at for developing an application on a production server. Quote, " _developing on a production server is not acceptable - ever!_ " Here is the situation.   1. I set up a development instance: `http://example.com:3000`   2. The production instance is: `http://example.com`   3. I complete all my development work on `http://example.com:3000` and when the client is pleased with the changes, I move them over to `http://example.com`. The application I am working with is an old Ruby on Rails application, and I have to say that initially, I did try to set up an development environment locally, but I could never get it running. After trying for a while, I gave up and decided to develop on the production server. Again, am I an idiot? Probably so, but I've been doing web development for a couple of years now, and I have never encountered a situation like this. Who is right and why?
