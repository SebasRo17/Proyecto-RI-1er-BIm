Is there a way to export graphics as EPS so that _LaTeX_ can perform style substitutions or modifications on them? I know that it is possible to replace simple text elements in imported EPS files using _LaTeX's_ `psfrag`; but if this is all that is possible, it is not sufficient to enforce a consistent appearance for graphics. That requires the ability to make substitutions to things like line weights and colors. Is there a way to use Mathematica to export EPS files in such a way that style elements are represented as simple text tags that can be easily replaced using `psfrag` (or a similar technique) in _LaTeX_?
