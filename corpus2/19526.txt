I want my `EventHandler` to respond only to left mouse clicks and pass the right mouse click to the built in event handler. I have tried               DynamicModule[{pt = {0, 0}},       EventHandler[       Graphics[{Disk[Dynamic[pt], .1]},         PlotRange -> 1], {"MouseDown", 1} :> (pt = MousePosition["Graphics"]), PassEventsDown -> True]]      But the problem is that the point moves even on right clicks. Is this a bug? **How can I make the point move only on left clicks and display the graphics pop up menu on right clicks (without moving)?**               DynamicModule[{pt = {0, 0}},       EventHandler[       Graphics[{Disk[Dynamic[pt], .1]},         PlotRange -> 1], {"MouseDown", 1} :> (pt = MousePosition["Graphics"]), PassEventsDown -> False]]      Responds only to left clicks as expected. So to clarify: I want to have this menu, but without the point going to the position of the right click. The point should respond to left clicks only. ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mBqGq.png) I'm running MMA 9.0.0 on Win 7 64 bit.
