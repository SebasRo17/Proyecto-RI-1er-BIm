I have a code that I'd like to share, but I'd like to publish it using an open source license. But I don't know how you have to use that licenses. How do you have to activate an open source license? Just including the text of the license in all files? What else do I have to do? Do I need to buy some right? Include a readme.txt in all the directories? I mean, what do I have to do if I want my code is protected by the legal test of a license? The second question is what it is the better license for this conditions:   * I don't care what people do with my code, educational purposes, to make money, I don't mind whatever they want to do with it.   * But I want people don't delete my name from the code, and If they use my code force them to mention me. If they change my code and someone ask for those modifications, they give the code with the modifications.   * But I don't want to force people to publish the code of they applications, even if they are using my code. What is the best license to that purposes?
