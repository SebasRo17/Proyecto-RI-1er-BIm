I'm interested in **what algorithms or rules I can programmatically implement to generate RGB or HSV colors for plotlines** to keep them visually distinct from the neighbors. I know that in professional mapmaking, there are algorithms or rules that make sure that no two adjacent countries on a map are the same color. I can also think of Microsoft office Excel as picking good tints/shades for plot lines (red, then blue, then purple/orange). Here's an example of what I'm talking about - I need to generate colors for 12 lines on a black background. The colors here I've hardcoded by hand using web- safe RGB color codes. The problem arises when these lines overlap - it's hard to tell if one is looking at purple, slighly darker purple or violet. **I'm looking for a better algorithm to produce colors for plotlines like these.** ![Multiple plot lines color example](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5zi6d.png) Here's an example using Flot plotting library for jQuery, it has nice succession of colors for graphs: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pv2c7.png)
