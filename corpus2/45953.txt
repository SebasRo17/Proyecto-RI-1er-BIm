I'm defining branch cut functions, and I'm using $arg(z)$ as a building block. So I just spent an hour at the whiteboard assuming that $arg(z)$ goes from $0$ to $2\pi$, and then I implement the code, and everything goes horribly wrong. I just realized that the problem is that the the `Arg` function built into _Mathematica_ goes from $-\pi$ to $\pi$. Is there anyway I can redefine `Arg` so that my code will work?
