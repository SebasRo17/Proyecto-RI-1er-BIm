I am trying out Mathematica 10 on https://programming.wolframcloud.com. `$PlotTheme` interested me a lot because it finally produces nice plots (probably) without the need of fine tuning of every plot. However, the options are conflicting each other and there seems to be some hiding options. For example (figures available at https://www.wolframcloud.com/objects/0caeabc9-81ba-4c6c-a51d-64f06c644a40),               (* This get thick lines *)     LogPlot[{1/x, x,2x, E^x},{x,1,10},PlotTheme->{"ThickLines"}]          (* This get monochrome *)     LogPlot[{1/x, x,2x, E^x},{x,1,10},PlotTheme->{"Monochrome"}]          (* There is no monochrome or thick lines here *)     LogPlot[{1/x, x,2x, E^x},{x,1,10},PlotTheme->{"Monochrome","ThickLines"}]      As another example,               (* Didn't get open markers or monochrome, but at least get thick *)     ListPlot[{{{1,2},{2,4},{3,7},{4,9}},{{1,3},{2,4}}},PlotTheme->{"Monochrome","OpenMarkersThick"}]          (* After adding frame, markers completely changed *)     ListPlot[{{{1,2},{2,4},{3,7},{4,9}},{{1,3},{2,4}}},PlotTheme->{"Monochrome","Frame","OpenMarkersThick"}]      Is it possible to make those themes non-conflicting with each other? The theme seems perfect for me is as follows: (1) The lines are solid, dashed, dotted, ... ("Monochrome") (2) The lines are colored. (e.g. "VibrantColor") (3) Framed ("Frame"). (4) Larger labels ("LargeLabels"). At best thicker lines ("ThickLines"). (5) Setting apply both to `Plot` and `ListPlot` (to put in $PlotTheme instead of tuning every plot). But I am not able to get all of them satisfied -- once `Plot` looks fine, `ListPlot` looks ugly. Is it possible to get some non-conflicting fine tunings once and apply everywhere?
