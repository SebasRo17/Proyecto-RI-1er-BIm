I've learned a fair amount about the various different software licensing models and what those models mean for my own software project. However, I'd like to make sure I understand as many of them as possible for making decisions on how to license my own software and in what scenarios I can safely use software under a licensing model. Do you have a good recommendation for a book/site etc.. that has this information in one location?
