In chapter 13, when talking about pointers, there is a paragraph: > Sometimes, however, you would like to have the semantics of pass by > reference—that is, that the passed object should not be altered—with the > implementation of pass by value—that is, passing the actual object rather > than a copy. It seems like the author made a mistake and mixed the two up. Is this true, or am I not understanding what he's saying correctly?
