I have this graph: ![http://i.stack.imgur.com/nag9x.png](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nag9x.png) But it doesn't have a function so I can't just plugin in a function into wolfram or mathematica to plot it. I have these coordinates to make it however:               (1, 0, 1)  (2, 0, 1)  (1, 0, 2)  (2, 0, 2)  (1, Pi/6, 1)  (2, Pi/6, 1)  (1, Pi/6, 2)  (2, Pi/6, 2)      How would I enter this in wolfram or mathematica to plot it? I am trying to download the STL file for it to print it in 3D.
