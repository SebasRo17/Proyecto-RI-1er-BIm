I was curious about GUI design patterns, so I searched and got some information, including a list of UI patterns for the web. This UI patterns website says that: > UI Patterns is a growing collection of User Interface Design Principles and > User Interface Usability Patterns present on web applications and sites > today. Are there any other design patterns for constructing websites or other user interfaces? Are there any books that describe these patterns? I'm particularly interested in patterns for Windows desktop development and web development in the .NET platform.
