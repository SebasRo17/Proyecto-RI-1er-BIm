I'm looking to draw only one half of an axis in `ContourPlot3D`, mainly because I don't wan't the axis lines to be where the interesting stuff happens (intersection of two surfaces), but I do want to show where the axes are. This is my code so far:               ContourPlot3D[{y == x^2, z == x^3}, {x, -3, 3}, {y, -5, 5}, {z, -10, 10},        AxesLabel -> Automatic, Boxed -> False, AxesOrigin -> {0, 0, 0},        Mesh -> None, ContourStyle -> Opacity[0.3]]      This is the result it produces: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Mynnv.jpg) I would like only half of each axis to appear on the graph. I already dug through the documentation, but it seems I can only turn the axes on or off completely, no partial option. Thanks in advance for any help.
