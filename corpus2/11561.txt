Consider the following code:               g=Graphics[{EdgeForm[{Black, Thick}],                 {Green,Opacity[0.5],Rectangle[{0,0.5},{1,1}]},                 Red, Polygon[{{0, 0}, {1, 0}, {1/2, Sqrt[3]/2}}],                 White, Disk[{1/2, 1/(2Sqrt[3])}, 1/(2Sqrt[3])]},                Background->None];     Graphics3D[{{Texture[g],                  Polygon[{{0,0,0},{0,1,0},{1,1,0},{1,0,0}},                          VertexTextureCoordinates->{{0,0},{1,0},{1,1},{0,1}}]},                 {Texture[g],                  Polygon[{{0,0,1},{0,1,1},{1,1,1},{1,0,1}},                          VertexTextureCoordinates->{{0,0},{1,0},{1,1},{0,1}}]}},                Lighting->{{"Ambient", White}},                ViewPoint->{1,4,7}]      This gives the following graphics: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/EObbv.png) As you can easily see, the part outside of the figures is opaque white, despite of the `Background->None` option. Also `Background->RGBColor[1,1,1,0]` didn't help, nor did passing the Graphics through `Rasterize` with the option `Background->None` Here's roughly what I'd want to get (any inaccuracies are caused by my lacking GIMP-fu :-)): ![What I would want it to look like](http://i.stack.imgur.com/s8HwY.png) Looking for a solution I found this code but couldn't get it work for my case. Also, if I understand it correctly, it doesn't derive the transparency from the graphics but just replaces a certain colour with fully transparent, which wouldn't work with the semi-transparent green rectangle. Combining the 2D graphics with another one using `Show` does respect `Background->None` and `Opacity` on the green rectangle, so it's not a problem with the graphics itself. Therefore my question: Is it possible to embed 2D graphics into 3D while keeping the transparency of the 2D image, and if so, how?
