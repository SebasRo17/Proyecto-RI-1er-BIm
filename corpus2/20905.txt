When I want to `Export["text.xlsx", data]` where `data` is a matrix with 500 columns and 10000 rows, I get the error message: > Export::toomany3: "Cannot export to !(\"XLSX\"). The number of columns > exceeds the limit of this format." However, if I write the data as csv and load it into excel, everything works. Is there a way to write the data of this size to xlsx directly? Test sample:               data = RandomReal[{-1, 1}, {10000, 500}];     Export["test.xlsx", data]      This happens with Mathematica 8 and 9.
