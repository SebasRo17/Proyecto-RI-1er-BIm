Guess I'm not the only one here coding on laptop + external keyboard + external screen. I can't really decide. **Figure 1** : Putting screen directly in front of (upright) my eyes and move laptop to the side. That feels like more comfortable but I can't really see so good to 15" laptop which is now quite away. Feels unused. **Figure 2:** Putting laptop in front of me and move external monitor on side. Feels like more efficient space usage, but I am afraid that my neck/back might start hurting since I need to turn my head often. What do you prefer? Some good advice? Sacrificing health is definitely no option here so that's why I'm worried and asking this silly question. Thanks
