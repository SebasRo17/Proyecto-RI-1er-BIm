I have been a professional developer for just over half a year and have been amazed at how big the world really is out of college. I have continued to learn in my free time but I am wondering where should I focus? FOCUS 1) The development stack used by my company. Quickest payoff in my day to day development. #Deepest FOCUS 2) A different language with the same paradigm. See if I can generalize my knowledge and way of thinking. FOCUS 3) Different language, different paradigm. Expand my borders and learn new ways to do things. #Broadest If anyone has a different focus feel free to put that out there.
