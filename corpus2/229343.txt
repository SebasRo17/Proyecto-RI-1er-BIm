I am a big picture thinker (visual spatial) and enjoy abstract maths. However I struggle with sequential tasks and am struggling with programming. My bad working memory isn't helping either. I heard that good picture thinkers are good at programming in general. I just cannot figure out how to start writing a code etc. I am extremely frustrated. Have you seen any visual spatial person who are bad at programming? Or is it just me? I feel very devastated and feel like I don't fit in anywhere. Any tips on how I can improve? Or does my brain just not work in a logical way? My brain is always jumbled up. If you are a programmer and are dyslexic: What are your weaknesses caused by dyslexia? Are you good at sequential tasks?
