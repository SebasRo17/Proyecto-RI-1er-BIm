Current situation: About five months ago I got a degree in something that has nothing to do with programming. Since then I have been intensively studying/working on programming projects the last five months. **(A) Do I continue working full time on projects progressing at a fast rate likely having finished decent enough projects to land a starter position/payed internship in 3 months** or **(B) do I get a job, almost surely one that has nothing to do with programming, merely so employers can see on my resumé that I did a job in between and significantly reduce my progress in programming?** I assume that HR interviewers from large companies would see my unemployment as a bad thing but on the other hand it's very unlikely I would even apply for a job for such company anyway because they almost always seem to require a related degree. But I am not sure how other employers would interpret the situation. Btw, I am talking about the western european job market, not the american job market. Also, I have learned WAY more in those 5 months on my own than in those three years altogether in university college. ## EDIT I am actually convinced that the best step is to continue working full time on those projects because I think that there is a significant number of employers of small companies who can look past unemployment on my resumé as long as I can present them with projects I have worked on. But my father fears no employer will be able to look past the fact I have not done an actual job in that period, regardless if it programming related. **I want to show my father this SO thread to convince him otherwise**. So can any employers or employees of such employers please state if my father's suspicion is correct or not. This has a great influence in my current living situation so it is important for him to understand that.
