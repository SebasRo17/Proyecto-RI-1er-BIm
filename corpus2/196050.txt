Creating an HTML5 page using canvas and javascript to draw a set number of musical staves on the page, spaced a pre-determined amount in between. What I have is re-drawn on top of the canvas 10 times, and what I really need is something that's spaced out apart every time the loop is drawn. I tried to create a JSFiddle, but it doesn't draw anything (which I'm sure is user-error), so here's the js file:               window.onload = function(){          var canvas = document.getElementById('sheetmusic');         c = canvas.getContext('2d');          c.fillStyle = 'white';     c.fillRect(0,0, canvas.width, canvas.height);          //  Draw staves     for (var i=0; i<10; i++){         c.strokeStyle = 'black';         c.beginPath();         c.moveTo(0,10);         c.lineTo(canvas.width,10);         c.stroke();         c.moveTo(0,20);         c.lineTo(canvas.width,20);         c.stroke();         c.moveTo(0,30);         c.lineTo(canvas.width,30);         c.stroke();         c.moveTo(0,40);         c.lineTo(canvas.width,40);         c.stroke();         c.moveTo(0,50);         c.lineTo(canvas.width,50);         c.stroke();         // staff whitespace         c.fillStyle = 'white';         c.fillRect(0,52, canvas.width, 50);         }     };      I'm just not certain how to append `i` from my `loop` into the `height` attribute of my `stroke`.
