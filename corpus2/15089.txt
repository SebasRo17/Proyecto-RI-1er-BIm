I have a set of variables which are used in various places in my calculations (solving a system, initial conditions, etc.). In order to make this easier to deal with, I want to make a control-like thing which makes them easier to manipulate, rather than just using long lists of unlabeled values such as               calculateValues[{0, 0, Ï€, 0.5, 3}]      So far I have something like this: ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FyYmo.png) This clearly doesn't work, and I expect in order to get it working properly I'll need to use `Interpretation` or more `Dynamic` incantations, but I can't figure out exactly what needs to happen. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!
