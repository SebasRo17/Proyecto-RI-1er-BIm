Suppose that I use `Grid` to display a table `tab`. I did the following, which frames all cells:               tab = {{"a", "b"}, {"1", SpanFromLeft}, {"2", SpanFromLeft}, {"3", SpanFromLeft}};     Grid[tab, Frame -> All]      and gives this output: ![gridall](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QgwCY.gif) But, how do I programatically generate a table in which only the header cells are framed? ![gridsome](http://i.stack.imgur.com/VBLrk.gif) (I created the above by erasing cell dividers manually, using Paint, but for larger tables, I would like to do this programatically.) Thanks.
