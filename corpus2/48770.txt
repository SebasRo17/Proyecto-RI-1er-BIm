What are the canonical responsibilities of such a specialized role? Normally, I expected this to be part of the tasks of a normal developer, but in large companies I know this role is to be fulfilled by an engineer in his own. In my current company, there is a possibility for a new opening in a SCM position, so I could apply, but first I would like to hear about what, in your experience, characterizes this role best.
