I'm working with a local file which I always extract from a password protected archive (RAR), do some modifications/additions to it and overwrite the old file inside the archive with the new file (I don't overwrite the archive. I overwrite the file inside it). The RAR is password protected for certain confidentiality reasons, and I need it to be that way. I considered using Git for version control, but from my first use of Git, it appears to be meant for files that are not archived. I wanted to version control my RAR file. But what if I decide to add more files to the RAR and then commit the RAR? Doesn't that ruin the point of having version control where you can also do a diff to compare versions etc.? Does it make sense to use a version control when I'm extracting files from the RAR to do modifications and then putting them back in the RAR and committing the RAR? Is version control the right way to do this or is there something better?
