One can easily factor a polynomial over finite fields of prime order, using `Factor` command:               Factor[1 + x^2, Modulus -> 2]     ===>  (1 + x)^2      Now, is it possible to do this over finite fields of non-prime order? As an example, $ x^2 + x + 1$ is reducible over GF(4), and can be decomposed as $(x-a)(x-a^2)$, where $a\not\in \\{0,1\\} $ is a field member. Problem is, members of non-prime order finite fields are not denoted by ordinary numbers; rather, they use either polynomial or vector notation.
