It is easy for me to add arrows to the axes of the a figure by taking advantage of `AxesStyle -> Arrowheads[]` when the differences between the horizontal and vertical coordinates is small. For instance, by using               Plot[1/x, {x, -20, 20}, AxesStyle -> Arrowheads[{0.0, 0.03}]]      the arrows appear at both the horizontal and vertical axis. However, I don't know how to add arrows to the ones whose differences are big. For example, when the following program is run               Plot[1/x^5, {x, -20, 20}, AxesStyle -> Arrowheads[{0.0, 0.00003}]]      the arrows cannot be seen obviously? I want to know how I can make the arrows to be found evidently just as the previous one?
