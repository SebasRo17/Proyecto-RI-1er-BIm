I have 2 differential equations with 2 variables, x and y,which are a function of t and I have the parameters k1, k2 y k3.                                      dx/dt=-k1 x2+ k2 x y                           dy/dt=k1 x2-k2 x y- k3 y      I have to adjust the equations to the following experimental data                                      xo=70.26, x(t=720)=45.78                            xo=71.04, x(t=720)=46.32                            xo=37.23, x(t=720)=24.67                            xo=37.91, x(t=720)=28.78      I tried FindFit and NMinimize. The problem with FindFit is that I have multiple initial conditions. Then I used NMinimize, I tried to create a function error only with the first data (eventually, I will use the rest of the data) but NMinimize gives me the following error This is the funtion.               Remove["Global`*"]      f[k1_?NumericQ,k2_?NumericQ,k3_?NumericQ]:=          Module[{x,y,out},out=Abs[45.78-x[720] /.                NDSolve[{x'[t]==-k1 x[t]^2+k2 x[t]y[t],y'[t]==k1 x[t]^2-k2 x[t]y[t]-k3 y[t],                         x[0]==70.26,y[0]==0},{x,y},{t,0,800}]]]     res=NMinimize[{f},{k1,k2,k3}]      And this is the error > NMinimize::nnum: The function value f is not a number at {k1,k2,k3} = > {8.17269,8.09533,4.9417}. >> If anybody can help
