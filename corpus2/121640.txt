I want to know the approach in developing big complex application regardless of which programming language to use. I want to know how developers make such big applications such as internet banking, API's and big database management application. How should one approach to make such applications. I have only 1 year programming experience so far and I work as a freelancer so when I saw such applications lots of questions came in my mind. How to understand the basic need of information technology. What actually it is? How it can be useful for common people of small towns. I want everyone to make use of technology no matter they are educated or not, rich or not. Please post some suggestions.
