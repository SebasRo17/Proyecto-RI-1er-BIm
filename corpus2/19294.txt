I am trying to **query SQL data with MATHEMATICA** - however, the **MySQL database contains zerodates** and that leads to the following error message: e.g. (1) *SQLSelect[conn, "orders", {"time_created"}, MaxRows -> 5]* --> **JDBC::error:** "!(\"Cannot convert value '0000-00-00 00:00:00' from column 1 to TIMESTAMP.\")" e.g. (2) *SQLExecute[conn, "SELECT * FROM orders", MaxRows -> 5]* --> **JDBC::error:** "!(\"Cannot convert value '0000-00-00 00:00:00' from column 6 to TIMESTAMP.\")" I found out that this is a typical issue with a JDBC connection and that this can be solved by allowing **zerodatetimes** as true with examples from other systems. What I didn't find out is: How to apply this **specifically in Mathematica?** Can you advise me? It would help me a lot - so thank you very much for any help!
