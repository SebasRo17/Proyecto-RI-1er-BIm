I have painstakingly derived the vector-spherical harmonics $\mathbf{V}_{J,\,M}^\ell(\theta, \phi)$, which are the generalization of ordinary spherical harmonics $Y_\ell^m(\theta, \phi)$ to vector fields. But now, I would like to visualize them. The vector-spherical harmonics takes three integers ($\ell$, $J$, $M$), and yields a 3D vector field on the surface of a sphere ($\theta$, $\phi$). The integers are subject to the constraints: $J\geq0$, $\ell\geq0$, $|J-\ell|\leq 1$, $|M|\leq J$. The function `VectorSphericalHarmonicV` below generates a 3-component _complex_ vector.               Clear[ϵ]; (*Polarization vector*)     ϵ[λ_] = Switch[λ,        -1, {1, -I, 0}/Sqrt[2],         0, {0, 0, 1},         1, {1, I, 0}/Sqrt[2]   ];          Clear[VectorSphericalHarmonicV];     VectorSphericalHarmonicV[ℓ_, J_, M_, θ_, ϕ_] /;        J >= 0 && ℓ >= 0 && Abs[J - ℓ] <= 1 && Abs[M] <= J :=        Sum[         If[Abs[M - λ] <= ℓ, ClebschGordan[{ℓ, M - λ}, {1, λ}, {J, M}], 0]*         SphericalHarmonicY[ℓ, M - λ, θ, ϕ]*ϵ[λ], {λ, -1, 1}   ]          (*Examples*)     VectorSphericalHarmonicV[1, 1, -1, θ, ϕ]     VectorSphericalHarmonicV[1, 1, 0, θ, ϕ]     VectorSphericalHarmonicV[1, 1, 1, θ, ϕ]      Honestly, not sure what the best visual representation is. But, I am thinking a good one is to display a bunch of vectors on the surface of a sphere in the spirit of this one: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/e0U38.png) A sticking point for me is how do I tell _Mathematica_ to display vectors ONLY an the surface? Also, because these vectors are complex, maybe the vectors can be colored to indicate the phases? Perhaps you have a better way to represent these functions?
