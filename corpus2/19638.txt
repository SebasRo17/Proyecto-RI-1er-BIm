I am doing some calculation with summation and the Kronecker symbol. Here are my steps :               $Assumptions =        k1 ∈ Reals &&  k2 ∈ Reals &&  k3 ∈ Reals &&  p1 ∈ Reals &&  p2 ∈ Reals &&  p3 ∈ Reals     k = {k1, k2, k3};     p = {p1, p2, p3};     d[i_, j_] := KroneckerDelta[i, j]     proj[i_, j_, k1_, k2_, k3_] :=        d[i, j] -         (d[i, 1]*k1 + d[i, 2]*k2 + d[i, 3]*k3)*        (d[j, 1]*k1 + d[j, 2]*k2 + d[j, 3]*k3)/        (k1^2 + k2^2 + k3^2)     test1 = proj[i, j, k1, k2, k3]*proj[i, j, p1, p2, p3];     test2 = Sum[Sum[test1, {i, 1, 3}], {j, 1, 3}]     test2 // Expand      To explain the steps: 1) I define $\vec{k}$ and $\vec{p}$ with real components.   2) I define a projector $P_{ij} \left( \vec{k} \right) = \delta_{ij} - \frac{k_i k_j}{k^2}$.   3) I compute a summation on the repeated subscript. After the last step, I have a relatively big expression, the product of k and p components. It looks like $$3-\frac{a}{a+b+c} - \frac{b}{a+b+c} - \frac{c}{a+b+c} +...-...$$ The a, b and c stands for k1, k2 and k3 (or p1, 2, 3). Now the question: why doesn't _Mathematica_ make the simplification because, as anyone can see, the preceding expression can be simplified to $2 +...-...$ Is the problem linked to the `Expand` operation? How can I make the simplification I want?. I thought of using `/.` to do it, but that doesn't work either. I hope someone will understand my question!
