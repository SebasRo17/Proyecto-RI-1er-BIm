A new colleague has mooted the idea of using **Resharper annotations** within our code base (we already are great fans and users of Resharper). My new colleague cites things like explicitly stating whether a parameter can be null or not null at coding time is a good thing so that consumers of that class can see warnings at coding time. My reservation is it adds noise to the code, is not runtime executed hence I favour Guard clauses. I am also concerned that like comments that they can go stale. I am also concerned about code readability and the overhead of writing them in the first place. Ultimately I am trying to keep development lean so don't want to add overhead for relatively little gain. Finally it feels wrong decorating code for one vendor's tooling support. What are your thoughts? Good/bad experiences?
