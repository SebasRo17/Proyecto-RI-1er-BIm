I don't know how to exactly search for this topic, so if there are a lot of answers to that, please just provide a link :) I'm getting a new laptop in a few weeks and am thinking about setting up a logical, easy-to-use and clean folder structure for coding from the beginning.(mixing everything coding related now)   My question is: Does your folder structure look like:   C:\grails   C:\Java\jre-...   C:\JAVA\jdk-...   C:\eclipse   ... etc   or do you always use the default directory?   or do you sort them, like: C:\ide\, C:\framewor and C:\CMS\   Do you put the frameworks and ide on a separate partition? Do you map your projects accordingly? How do you name your projects and how is the saving file structure? Is there a really good way that I've missed? I mean I just have a handful of projects to take care of and I mostly just do some light coding or minor changes, and still I'm confused every time I try to find anything or am often surprised to find several older versions still active... A few information:     * Dual boot to a second partition is out of the question, I do like convenience (#1 reason for me to try programming: make things easier for me.)   * I'll be getting a SSD, so the space is limited.   * Running Windows 7 Prof- 64bit   * I'll need: Eclipse, NetBeans, Grails, Groovy, VisualStudio, Ruby, Perl.  Hopefully anyone has a good idea about that. It really annoys me and since I do have the opportunity to change that it's a good time to think about it.
