I want to use NMaximize to find the maximum value of a function with multiple variables. The problem is I would like to set this up so the number of variables is only decided when the function sees the data. So I have:               NMaximize[{F[data,a1,a2],a1>0,a2>0},{a1,a2}]      when there are data from two genes. But would like the function to be               NMaximize[{F[data,a1,a2,a3],a1>0,a2>0,a3>0},{a1,a2,a3}]      if there are 3 genes...etc Any way to set this?
