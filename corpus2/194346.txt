I work on an ExtJS application with a Django backend, and we keep running into issues when we push new code. Our users seldom refresh their browsers, so after a code push we end up with users using the same (now outdated) version of our ExtJS application for days at a time instead of the new, updated version. How do other people deal with this issue? (I haven't found anything online about this, so I probably haven't found the right keywords yet.)
