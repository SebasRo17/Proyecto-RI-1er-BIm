I already posted this question over at stackoverflow, but they meant that this would be the better place to ask. So here i am :) I am new to Jquery and currently practicing. I wrote a little piece of code to show and hide a navigation on click and change the text of the button when the navigation is opened and close. Because i am fresh in this area i would love to get some feedback about the code, for example if there are any ways to do it better, with less code or any other area of the matter. Just a little code review for learning and practicing. (especially the second if is bothering me :)) Thank you And here the small line of code:               // Function Hide nav     function hideNav() {     $('nav').hide();     }          // Hide Nav     hideNav();          // Function Show Nav          function showNav() {     $('nav').show();     }          // Clickevent on Button     $('button').click(function() {     if($('nav').is(':hidden')){     // Show Nav on Clickevent     showNav();     // Change Text when Nav is showing     $(this).text('Close me');               }     else     hideNav();     // Change Text back when Nav is hiding     if($('nav').is(':hidden')){     $('button').text('Open me');     }     });
