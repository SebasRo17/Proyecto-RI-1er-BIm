I'm in the process of putting the final touches on an open-source framework that I hope to release in the next few months. It's something that I'd like to develop a community for and so I'm curious about what factors influence your decision to use a new framework or tool and why. Some of the specific things I'd like to know more about (feel free to add to this):   * Types of documentation/tutorials/instruction   * Community support (comments/forum)   * Updates (blog/social media/feeds)   * Look and feel of the project website design   * White papers/testimonials   * A big feature list   * Community size   * Tools   * Ability to contribute   * Project test coverage (stability/security)   * Level of buzz (recommended by friends or around the web)   * Convincing marketing copy Ideally, I'd like to have all of the above, but what specific features/qualities will carry greater weight in getting programmers to adopt something new? **What says, 'This is a professional-grade project,' and what are red flags that keep you from trying it out?**
