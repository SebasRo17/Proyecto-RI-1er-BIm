We started (just me and my friend) working on a website. As a part design phase we have finished the drawing a Site Map, decided on the content in each of the web page and the navigation. As we want to use the Spring MVC and Hibernate we want to start on Classes design (domain classes) first so that the database part is taken care by Hibernate (Except for some tables for static data). Does our approach correct? Is my understanding correct that when we use Hibernate the 80% of the database design can be forgotten?
