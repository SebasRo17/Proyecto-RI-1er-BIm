I was just wondering if there were some "standard" examples that everyone uses as a basis for explaining the nature of a problem that requires the use of a Hash table. What are some well-known problems in the real world that can see great benefits from using a Hash table? **Also, a little background or explanation as to why the problem benefits from using a Hash Table would be of help!**
