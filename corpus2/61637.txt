**Do you remember when you were learning JavaScript? What was the moment that you suddenly "got it"?** (For example, my CSS aha-moment was when I learnt about the box model...) The reason I´m asking is that I´m learning JS for 6 weeks, but I still find it quite confusing. Here´s a quote from something I read recently on SO: > "..functions act similar to values, as method is a property of the object > that has a value of a function (which is also an object)." I´m curious if you were confused as well in the beginning and what was it that made you understand it. (I´m reading the Sitepoints "Simply JavaScript", the book "Eloquent JavaScript" and following Lynda´s Essential JavaScript tutorial. I don´t have any programming expeirence and was terrible at math ;) Thanks!
