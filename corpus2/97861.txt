I found some functions that I want to get from WordPress source code and add want to add them into my project which is going to be open source. Do I simply get the functions that I want and add them to my project with a little comment saying that I got it from WP like:               /**       * Author: WordPress     **/      or is there anything else I have to consider before getting the code? Also, is there anything else apart from the above question that I have to consider if I want to sell to someone my project with these functions?
