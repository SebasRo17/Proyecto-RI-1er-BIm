I am studying for my MCPD certification from microsoft. There are plenty of resources for these certs. However I had someone reccomend CertMagic recently. With a little research I quickly discovered that there are quite a few sites like this. So i have two questions: 1) Will these sites really help ? I don't want to memorize exam answers. I want my certification to be a true representation of my skills in that subject. 2) If these sites really are helpful, which do you find to be most helpful ?
