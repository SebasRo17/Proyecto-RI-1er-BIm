I have an error table which includes three parameters(error, epsilon and step size) and the matrix is not square. Now, I want to plot my data in 3D, but didn't manage to do it. My table is as follows ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/eYHN7.png) or               Ïµ = {2^-4, 2^-5, 2^-6, 2^-7, 2^-8, 2^-9};     step = {2^-6, 2^-7, 2^-8, 2^-9};     error = {{9.06*10^9, 5.68*10^10, 3.55*10^11, 2.21*10^12}}      Any ideas how to tackle the problem ?
