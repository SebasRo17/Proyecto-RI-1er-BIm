I have an image that I want to place in the background of a plot and stretch it to cover the entire plot area. However, the aspect ratio of the image does not match the aspect ratio of the plot, and `Inset` refuses to stretch the image.               image = Image@Map[ColorData["SunsetColors"],         Table[(y - x^2 + 1)/2, {y, Reverse@Range[0, 1, 0.02]}, {x, 0, 1, 0.01}], {2}];     ContourPlot[y - x^2, {x, 0, 1}, {y, 0, 1}, ContourShading -> None,       Prolog -> Inset[image, {0, 0}, {0, 0}, {1, 1}]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/X3VNc.png) The `Inset` documentation states: >   * If size is given as $\{w,h\}$, then any object $\mathit{obj}$ whose > aspect ratio is not fixed will be horizontally or vertically stretched so as > to fit exactly in a $w\times h$ rectangle. > >   * If $\mathit{obj}$ is an object with fixed aspect ratio, then blank space > will be left equally on both sides if there is a direction where the object > would have to be stretched in order to fit exactly. > > Evidently `Inset` thinks the image is an object with fixed aspect ratio. How can I get around this?
