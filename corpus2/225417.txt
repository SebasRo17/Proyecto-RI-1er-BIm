I am a software Engineer in a Embedded domain. Here, we are using QT, C++, Sql, UPNP,LINUX and DBUS. However, I have never practiced all the IPC mechanism, C++, Sql, QT, and UPNP. For example, how socket works, etc? I am trying to clear up my fundamentals,but at the same time I need to learn new technologies. In my opinion, one can easily grasp new technology if there fundamentals are good. But, I am facing a problem here. How can I learn as well as work well? When I try to look at basics then I lose time. This effects in the productivity. But without basics also, I can work since one need generally logical skills. But, then you should be ready to burn yourself as you will do permutation and combination. How can I cope with it? How can I balance it?
