I just need to know is it safe to use jQuery and MooTools Together in one web framework? I am not trying create application using both of them, but I am in a situation where I need to modify mootool based application framework, so I am used to jquery, I don't want to waste my time learning mootools and I think jquery is better than the mootools in many contexts like number of applications, plugins etc. so questions are   1. is it safe to use mootools and jquery in one framework?   2. will there be cross browser issues?   3. how robust the application will be when using both?
