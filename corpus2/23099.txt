The code below seems to work for n<11\. But for n=11, and above, it outputs `newa` then just outputs "beep" sound. WhyTheBeep says "The kernel Local has quit (exited) during the course of an evaluation.". On two separate occasions, (after making trivial changes) it gave the correct output for n=11. I then increasing n and it failed again. After setting n=11 again, it it failed to output and gave the "beep" sound again. Nothing was altered other than n between success and failure in this instance. Why the inconsistency/problem with n>10? (I'm using Mathematica 8.0 on Windows7) Any help would be much appreciated.               n = 10     c = 1.     e = 5.          newa = Table[(2 - i) Subscript[p, m] + (i - 1)/n, {m, 2 n + 2}, {i, 2}]          FindMaximum[     {((Subscript[p, 2 n + 2] - c (1 - Subscript[p, 2 n + 1]))/(Subscript[p, 2 n + 1])),     Subscript[p, 2 n + 2] == Sum[((n + 1) - m) Subscript[p, m] Subscript[p, n + m], {m, 1, n}],     Subscript[p, 2 n + 1] == Sum[Subscript[p, m] Subscript[p, m + n], {m, 1, n}],     Table[Subscript[p,m] == (Subscript[p,2 n + 1] (1 - Subscript[p, m + n]))/(((e*n)/(1 +   e)) Subscript[p, n + m] - (1 - Subscript[p, n + m])^2), {m, n}],     Table[Subscript[p, m] >= 0, {m, 2 n}],     Table[Subscript[p, m] <= 1, {m, 2 n}],     Sum[Subscript[p, m], {m, 1, n}] == 1     }, newa, MaxIterations -> 10000]
