What is the single most important thing that you do to ensure career progression ? In other words what is it that you have to learn\unlearn\implement every day so that you do not stagnate at a level in a company and there is constant vertical growth. These strategies might be different at each role and might vary for different segments like Development Teams\ Sustaining Teams \ QA Team and Technical Pub teams. The question is independent on which team you are in. P.S : Vertical growth can also be on technical path.
