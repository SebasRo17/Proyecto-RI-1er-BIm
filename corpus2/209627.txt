I am also using Node - which I am not the most familiar with - if the articles/books/tutorials pertained to this also - that would help even more. I come from a mostly MySQL background - but in this api, all data is going to be served as JSON - so at first glance, using Mongo made a lot of sense (I could be wrong). One thign I have been unable to wrap my head around though, is relational models. e.b. `Object has many Assets`. To use some examples most people would be familiar with, let's assume I am trying to do something like:   * Select a blog post and all of its comments. **or**   * Select a photo gallery and all of its photos Is it as simple as storing a call back inside of my assets like this?:               Photo {         __id: 5,         content: '...',         gallery_id: 9      }      And performing a `.find({ gallery_id: 9 })`? I know this would _work_ , but is that best practice? I am **very** new to Document Databases, and have not seen much on this particular topic.
