I'm building and application that requires huge transactions/sec of data and I need to use IPC to for the mutithreaded mutliprocceses communication, I know that there are a lot of methods to be used but not sure which one to choose for this application. This is what the application is gonna have, 4 processes, each process has 4 threads, the data chunk that needs to be transferred between two or more threads is around 400KB. I found that fifo is good choice except that it's 64K which is not that big so i'll need to modify and recompile the kernel but not sure if this is the right thing to do? Anyway, I'm open to any suggestions and I'd like to squeeze your experience in this :) and I appreciate it in advance.
