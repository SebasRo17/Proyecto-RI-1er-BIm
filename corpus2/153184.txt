Let's say I have `{3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 2, 7}` set of numbers, I need to split the numbers such that sum of subset1 should be equal to sum of subset2 `{3,2,7} {1,1,2,1,5,2}`. First we should identify whether we can split number(one way might be dividable by 2 without any remainder) and if we can, we should write our algorithm two create s1 and s2 out of s. How to proceed with this approach? I read partition problem in wiki and even in some articles but I am not able to get anything. Can someone help me to find the right algorithm and its explanation in simple English?
