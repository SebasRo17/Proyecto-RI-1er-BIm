I've been discussing with my colleges about logging in by using your OpenID account, Google account etc. in our customers CMS and/or the internal systems we use, as we've had a few requests regarding this from both existing customers and new. What are your approaches on this? Is this a bad idea? Especially for our customers, in their customized content management systems? I really think it can be a major security issue, but would a normal login, provided by us, in the reality, be as much of a security risk?
