I have a list of numbers, e.g. `{{1.,0``27.698970004336022},{2.,0``27.698970004336015}}` but usually much longer, suitable for `ListPlot`. `ListPlot` however does not display anything, even if I reduce `PlotRange` manually. Obviously the numbers are too small for `ListPlot`. The numbers do indeed represent only noise, the relative deviation of two numerical computations at different precision. I do this because I want a visual ipression of the numerical error of a computation depending on one parameter. Can I give an argument to `ListPlot` or similar in order to force it to display the small numbers and, if not, how can I compactly multiply the second elements in the list by a suitable number to scale the plot range to `0...1`?
