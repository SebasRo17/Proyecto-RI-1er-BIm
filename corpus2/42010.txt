I used to to use MathPSFrag in Mathematica to export graphics to EPS for inclusion in LaTeX files. However, with recent versions of Mathematica this does not seem to work very well anymore, see for example mathematica 8.0 and psfrag or LATEX and Mathematica. In the latter thread it was suggested to use Mathematica's native `Export function and then replace text, labels etc. using the pstool package. How ever, when I create and export a simple plot via               plot = Plot[x, {x, 0, 1}, AxesLabel -> {"x", "y"}]     Export[NotebookDirectory[] <> "plot.eps", plot]      and then run pdflatex --shell-escape on the file               \documentclass{article}       \usepackage{pstool}     \begin{document}         \psfragfig{plot}         {         \psfrag{x}{$\xi$}         \psfrag{y}{$\phi$}         }         \end{document}       I obtain a two-page PDF document with the lower part of the plot on the top of the second page and the top part missing; the first page is completely empty. I'd be grateful if somebody could point out what's going on. Also, the restriction to one-letter labels can be quite problematic. Have there been any developments since the two quoted threads about the best way to export graphics from mathematica into LaTeX? **Edit** : What I described above applies to Mma 9.0 on a 64-bit Linux Mint 15. When I export the plot on a Windows 7 computer, the PDF is created correctly. From this I infer that the problem does not lie with my latex installation, but with the way Mathematica exports the plot to eps. Is this known to be platform-dependent?
