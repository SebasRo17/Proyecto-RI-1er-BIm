Hello Mathematica users, I have problem to set working directory, I want to calculate and save my data on D, but down you can see that mathematica shift automatically on old C. How to use D partition for calculating if mathematica is installed on C? If I do calculation as this, file is saved on D but first it is saved on C and on C I don't have enough space.                 In[7]:= ResetDirectory[]                  "C:\\Users\\user\\Documents"            In[8]:= DirectoryStack[]            Out[8]= {}            In[10]:= SetDirectory["D:\\"]            Out[10]= "D:\\"            A:=5;            Export["A.wdx", A];            In[13]:= DirectoryStack[]             {"C:\\Users\\user\\Documents"}
