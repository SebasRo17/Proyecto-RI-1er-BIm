Say we want to compute the largest common subset among a very large number of sets $Q_i$. One option would be to simply run the command:               Intersection[Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6, Q7, ...];      However, this seems to choke for very large numbers of input sets ($10^4$ or so with on-order $10^2$ elements each). Another option would be compute `Q12 = Intersection[Q1,Q2]`, then `Q123 = Intersection[Q12,Q3]`, then `Q1234 = Intersection[Q123,Q4]`, and so forth. Are these two procedures equivalent? Is there a better way?
