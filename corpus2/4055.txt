Background: The following snippet is what I (intend to) use in a `Manipulate` form where up to 12 different colors can be selected:                Manipulate[{sliderCol1},       Row[{"Kleur 1: ", ColorSlider[          Dynamic[sliderCol1] ,          AppearanceElements -> {"SwatchSpectrum"},          ImageSize -> {200, 40},          BaselinePosition -> Scaled[.25]]}        ]      ]      To make this work with fields `sliderCol1` to `sliderColn` (where $n$ = 2, â€¦, 12), I see no other option than copying the code in `Row` so many times. **Question: Is there a less verbose way of implenting a multiple (here 12) color selector using color sliders?**
