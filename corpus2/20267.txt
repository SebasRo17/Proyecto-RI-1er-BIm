I have a set of `n` vectors with an even length. Let us make an easy example with 3 vectors of length=4:                a={a1,a2,a3,a4}      b={b1,b2,b3,b4}      c={c1,c2,c3,c4}      I want to create the vectors:                d1={a1,a2}      d2={a3,a4}           e1={b1,b2}      e2={b3,b4}           f1={c1,c2}      f2={c3,c4}      I suppose I have to use `GatherBy`, but I have not found the way to get what I want.
