Builds are slow and take time. We can get MSBuild to parallelize them, but only on a single machine, not across a cluster. Why hasn't anyone come up with clustered build solutions in the .Net space? I know such solutions exist in the C++ space (e.g., IncrediBuild, Electric Cloud, etc.) but we .Net developers are forced to build huge solutions on individual machines. Anyone know if there's some unsolvable technical difficulty in this? Just curious.
