I want to learn to Design Hash table with simple hash function for better understanding. I understand that the hash table will work as long as the hash function maps each key to a non-negative integer less than the size of the hash table, but it will only perform well if it distributes different keys across different buckets. My question is : What's a alternative ways to implement hash function using ASCII code. I found ASCII code hash function implementation it's easy to build a hash function on the idea of treating each character of the string as a digit in a number. I try to represent a number is to use a radix-10 system with the Arabic numerals. For example, I could represent numbers using the letters "a" - "z" for the numbers 0 through 25 to obtain the Radix-26 system described in your text book. Characters in the computer are often stored using 7-bit ASCII codes (with values 0-127). So we can treat a string of ASCII characters as a Radix-128 number.
