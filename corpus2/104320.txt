I'm looking for a definitive answer to why extending built-in prototypes is so heavily chastised in the JS developer community. I've been using the Prototype JS framework for a while, and to me doing `[1,2,3].each(doStuff)` seems much more elegant than `$.each([1,2,3], doStuff)`. I know that it creates "namespace pollution," but I stil don't understand why it's considered to be a bad thing. Also is there any real performance degradation associated with extending built-in prototypes? Thanks!
