I have some data partitioned into three sublists:               data = {{2776.37, 2016.64, 1483.51, 1027.35, 500.878, 94.1385,          310.402, 282.548, 257.886, 224.359, 218.688, 209.312, 215.776,          198.78}, {40.5063, 24.633, 12.069, 8.3151, 6.35135, 15.0977,          8.74372, 15.5125, 9.34959, 9.70696, 11.125, 12.1457, 10.8075,          9.7561}, {113.08, 124.633, 75.9698, 59.5186, 55.9459, 7.81528,          57.4372, 69.5291, 80.4878, 88.2784, 105.563, 127.935, 148.571,          148.78}};      Each sublist can be represented by a label,               samp = {"x", "y", "z"};      I want to create a `ListLogPlot` with a `Tooltip` with the sample name that appears when the mouse hovers over each subset. I have tried,               ListLogPlot[Tooltip[data, samp], Joined -> True]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5HP75.png) but this flashes "{x,y,z}" for each subset. How do I achieve the desired effect?
