I have the following problem (I guess a very naive one): I work with some data and make a statistical analysis in _Mathematica_. I do it over several days and each time I open the file, I have to go through all previous lines of calculations, in order that all previously defined variables and data sets are uploaded into _Mathematica_ 's memory. My question is, does there exist a command so that each time I open the file, all defined previously variables are put into the working memory automatically.
