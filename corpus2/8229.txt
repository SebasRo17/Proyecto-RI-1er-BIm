Simplify[1/(1/a + 1/b)]      { (a b)/(a + b) } That doesn't look right. The given function has an infinite term for `a = 0` and one for `b = 0`, while the result has one for `(a + b) = 0`. So that's probably the reason why:               a b/(a + b) === 1/(1/a + 1/b)      { False } though only a minute ago it Simplified it that way! Also               Simplify[1/(1/x)]        { x } seems to disregard the `1/0` case. Can anybody get me out of my confusion?
