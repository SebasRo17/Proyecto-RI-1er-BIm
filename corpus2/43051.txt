The attributes of the `With` command are `HoldAll` which means it should not evaluate its arguments before its starts its business. For example, if I try               f[arg_]:=(Print["evaluating"]; arg)      and then               With[{s=f[x]}, s + 1]      it should not evaluate `f[x]`, right? But it does, i.e. it prints "evaluating", despite the fact that it should hold all its arguments. I understand that body is probably held, so that the lexical substitutions can be made, and that is in line with the `HoldAll` instruction (attribute). But, the part that specifies constants (in {...}), that puzzles me. It is actually reasonable to evaluate it, but that contradicts fully the use of the `HoldAll` argument. Would it not be better to use something like `HoldRest` as the attributes for `With`. Hmmm... I really do not understand this. Does anyone understands this?
