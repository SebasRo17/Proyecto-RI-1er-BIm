Suppose I have a controller class with a bunch of properties. Each time a property is changed, I would like to update the model. Now also suppose that I use the command pattern to perform model updates. Is it common to use command classes within property get and sets of the controller class or is there a better way? Here is an example of what I am currently using:               class MyController {       private int _myInt;       public int MyInt {         get { return _myInt; }         set {           MyCommand cmd = new MyCommand();           cmd.Argument = _myInt;           cmd.Execute();  // Command object updates the model         }       }      }
