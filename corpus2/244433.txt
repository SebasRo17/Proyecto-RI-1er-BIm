This isn't a serious problem or anything someone has asked me to do, just a seemingly simple thing that I came up with as a mental exercise but has stumped me and which I feel that I should know the answer to already. There may be a duplicate but I didn't manage to find one. Suppose that someone asked you to write a piece of code that asks the user to enter a number and, every time the number they entered is not zero, says "Error" and asks again. When they enter zero it stops. In other words, the code keeps asking for a number and repeats until zero is entered. In each iteration _except the first one_ it also prints "Error". The simplest way I can think of to do that would be something like the folloing pseudocode:               int number = 0;     do     {         if(number != 0)         {             print("Error");         }         print("Enter number");         number = getInput();     }while(number != 0);      While that does what it's supposed to, I personally don't like that there's repeating code (you test number != 0 twice) -something that should generally be avoided. One way to avoid this would be something like this:               int number = 0;     while(true)     {         print("Enter number");         number = getInput();         if(number == 0)         {             break;         }         else         {             print("Error");         }     }      But what I don't like in this one is "while(true)", another thing to avoid. The only other way I can think of includes one more thing to avoid: labels and `goto`s:                   int number = 0;         goto question;     error:         print("Error");     question:         print("Enter number");         number = getInput();         if(number != 0)         {             goto error;         }      Another solution would be to have an extra variable to test whether you should say "Error" or not but this is wasted memory. Is there a way to do this without doing something that's generally thought of as a bad practice (repeating code, a theoretically endless loop or the use of `goto`)? I understand that something like this would never be complex enough that the first way would be a problem (you'd generally call a function to validate input) but I'm curious to know if there's a way I haven't thought of.
