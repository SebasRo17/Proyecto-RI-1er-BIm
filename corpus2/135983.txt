I've been working on a medium sized web application that makes very heavy use of javascript. I tend to introduce common errors per 10 lines of code with either an unknown variable name or function name from another module\namespace or forgetting a return and other common errors. I'm noticing I'm getting quite a lot of feedback in fixing these errors as a side effect of my qunit testing. Is unit testing a typical way to make up for a compiler in dynamic languages?
