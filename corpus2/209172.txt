Consider the following typical scenario:               if(myObject == null) {         myObject = new myClass();     }      I'm wondering what is thought of the following replacement using the null- coalescing operator:               myObject = myObject ?? new myClass();      I'm not sure whether I should be using the second form. It seems like a nice shorthand, but the `myObject = myObject` construct at the beginning seems like it could be a bit of a code-smell. Is this a reasonable thing to do, or is there a better shorthand that I am missing? Or maybe, "It's three lines, get over it!"? Edit: As has been mentioned, perhaps calling this a typical scenario is something of an overstatement. I usually find that I encounter this situation when I'm retrieving an entity from a database that has a child reference type property that may or may not be populated yet:               myClass myObject = myClassService.getById(id);     myObject.myChildObject = myObject.myChildObject ?? new myChildClass();
