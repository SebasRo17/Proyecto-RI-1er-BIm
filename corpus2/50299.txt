I've read this question, but I think it doesn't really applies in my case. I have issues working with another developer in my company and I'm not sure how to fix them when there is no team lead to help mediate or buffer our relations. Two months ago I was hired as a senior web developer. It's small company ( about 30 people ). The programming team is consisted by me and another programmer. This programmer is in a junior role, although he does not report to me. Ever since my first day, we've been clashing in various points. For example, he's refused to use a test server and a project management tool that I proposed to everybody and to which my boss agreed. He has also refused to compromise during discussions of best practices and coding standards. He is convinced that his way is the only true way to do things and doesn't take my arguments into consideration. He is even insisting that we are not a team and that I should just work on my projects and not bother him. He's also complaining about me to our boss. I'm passionate about improving our work environment and workflows. I try not force my opinions on others and always ask everybody what they think about it. Every new idea that I bring to the table is discussed and generally everyone works together to come up with a good compromise, except him. He's always negative and rejecting my proposals outright. I criticized his code shortly after starting at this company and that's a way to kill of a healthy relation. How can I approach resolving our issues?
