I'm trying to solve a BVP using NDSolve and I want to impose the starting initial guess. I googled and looked at the help, but I couldn't find this option.               NDSolve[{       A[u[x]] u''[x] == F[x],       u[0] == u0,       u[1] == u1        },u[x],{x,0,1}]      where A[u] = u^2 + u^3 + u^4 or something like that. How can I set the starting guess? Thanks in advance for all your advices. Petrus
