I've managed to import a Wavefront (.obj) file and store it in a variable like so:               model = Import[         "/path_to_object/my.obj",          "Graphics3D",          Lighting -> {             {"Ambient", RGBColor[{0.212, 0.168, 0.2}]},             {"Directional", RGBColor[{0.8, 0., 0.}], ImageScaled[{2, 0, 2}]},             {"Directional", RGBColor[{0., 0.8, 0.}], ImageScaled[{2, 2, 2}]},             {"Directional", RGBColor[{0., 0., 0.8}], ImageScaled[{0, 2, 2}]}         }     ]      The output shows no black edges that you would normally see with `Graphics3D` objects, sort of like a "wireframe overlay". I've tried to call the `Graphics3D` function on `model` in this way:               Graphics3D[{AbsoluteThickness[2], AbsoluteDashing[{5, 5}], model}]      But I get the error:               Graphics is not a Graphics3D primitive or directive.      I've also tried adding more arguments to the `Import` function but I get the error:               Import::argt: Import called with 3 arguments; 1 or 2 arguments are expected.      Any ideas on how this can be accomplished? I saw that there is the command `Mesh->All`, but because I'm not that well versed with Mathematica yet, I don't know exactly how to apply a `Mesh` command to an imported `Graphics3D` object.
