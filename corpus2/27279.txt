I am trying to prove that a quintic polynomial, $p(x) = A5 x^5 + A4 x^4 + A3 x^3 + A2 x^2 + A1 x + A0$, which admits at most three real roots. Unfortunately Descartes' rule of signs does not help, since I have 5 sign changes. The polynomial's coefficients (the $An$ in the above expression) depend on a number of parameters, and after assigning numerical values to the parameters, _Mathematica_ factors the polynomial into the product of either   * three monic linear polynomials and a quadratic polynomial with negative discriminant   * one monic linear polynomial and two quadratic polynomials with negative discriminant which confirms what I think. Since _Mathematica_ can factor the quintic when the coefficients are numerical, I wonder if that implies it can also factor the quintic when expressed symbolically. If this is the case, how can I ask _Mathematica_ to do it?
