Let's say I have a boolean condition `a AND b OR c AND d` and I'm using a language where `AND` has a higher order of operation precedent than `OR`. I could write this line of code:               If (a AND b) OR (c AND d) Then ...      But really, that's equivalent to:               If a AND b OR c AND d Then ...      Are there any arguments in for or against including the extraneous parentheses? Does practical experience suggest that it is worth including them for readability? Or is it a sign that a developer needs to really sit down and become confident in the basics of their language?
