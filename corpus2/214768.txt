I'm curious if there's a series of tendencies or anti-patterns when programming whereby a developer will always locally re-wrap external dependencies when consuming them. A slightly less vague example might be say when consuming an implementation of an interface or abstract, and mapping every touch-point locally before interacting with them. Like an overcomplicated take on composition. Given my example, would the interface not be reliable enough and any change to it never be surmountable any any level of indirection? Is this a good or a bad practice? Can it ever go too far? Does it have a proper name?
