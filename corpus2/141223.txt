As I learn more about C and C++ I'm starting to wonder: How can a compiler use newer features of processors without limiting it just to people with, for example, Intel Core i7's? Think about it: new processors come out every year with lots of new technologies. However you can't just only target them since a significant portion of the market will not upgrade to the latest and greatest processors for a long time. I'm more or less wondering how this is handled in general by C and C++ devs and compilers. Do compilers make code similar to `if SSE is supported, do this using it, else do that using the slower way` or do developers have to implement their algorithm twice, or what? More or less how do you release software that takes advantage of newer processor technologies while still keeping a low common denominator?
