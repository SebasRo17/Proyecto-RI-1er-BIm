I have a 3Ã—3 error covariance in _Mathematica_ , but I don't know how to use it for plotting the error ellipsoid. It would be great if you can show me how I can do that for the below covariance matrix:               CovMat= {{88.5333, -33.6, -5.33333},               {-33.6, 15.4424, 2.66667},               {-5.33333, 2.66667, 0.484848}}          eigenvalues= {0.0098, 0.4046, 104.7}          eigenvectors= {{0.93, 0.36, -0.03}, {-0.36, 0.9, -0.23}, {-0.06, 0.23, 0.97}}      And as the last question, how can I project this ellipsoid onto 2D planes?
