When I open the new trial version (creation id 5099521; 10.0.30732.17750) I get these error messages ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ez2Ry.jpg) and only a partial view of the "About" box ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dUUP1.jpg) I haven't run into any particular problem, except that color of 3D plots are different from version 10 prerelease 13 (but now using PlotTheme -> {"Classic", "ClassicLights"} thanks to this web site!)
