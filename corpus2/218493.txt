I have a question about the efficiency of an algorithm: You have a list of x,y points Now I want to get all the points that are up to 5 units away from a reference x,y point How do you calculate it in the most efficient way? I just go over each point and calculate distance, and if that distance is less than 5, I add it to the answer If you know how this algorithm is called - I'd be happy if you post that too.
