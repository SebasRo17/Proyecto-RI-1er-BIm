I often correct homework by checking the calculations in Mathematica. Sometimes you would like to have two solutions open at once. However often defined symbols such as `f` or `phi` regularly overlap between the two notebooks.   * Is there a way to separate them other than using different symbols in every notebook?   * Is it possible to separate some variables yet share others between notebooks?
