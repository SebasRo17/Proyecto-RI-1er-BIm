When I attempt to insert a citation or specify a database to use as a bibliography, I get a message that I need to "start" the "reference system" "manually": ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8axyt.png) I have no idea what a references system is, let alone how to start one ("manually" or otherwise). I've followed all of the steps in the documentation, to no avail. * * * If it matters, I'm running OS 10.8.2, using a BibTeX file (which I've used without issues in other applications, e.g. LyX) for my references, and I have a fill MacTeX installation in the standard locations on my machine. * * * UPDATE: It matters.
