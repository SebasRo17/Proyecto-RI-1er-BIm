I would like to out who provides technical support (commercial) for two major DVCS's of today: Git and Mercurial. This is for a place where they've been using Subversion for some time and now they're renewing their software licences. Although they will be keeping Subversion as well, they would like to justify beginning of DVCS as an alternative system. Most people root for Mercurial since it seems simpler; mostly engineers and physicians there who are not that interested in checking Git repos for corruption and the finer workings of Git, but I believe any one of the two could "pass". The system has to have a price (can be zero; no problem there) and some sort of official technical support. It is a _pro forma_ matter, but it has to be specified. _**So, I'm asking you: do you know where could one go for commercial Git or Mercurial technical support?_** Technical forums and the like are out of the question. It has to work on the principle:   * _I have a problem._   * _I post a question with the details._   * _I get an answer in specified time. It can be "we cannot do that." but it has to be an official answer and given in agreed time._ I'm sure by now most of you understand what I'm asking, but if not â€” post a comment or similar. Also, if you think of any reasons which could decide justification of introducing Git/Hg from an technical and administrative viewpoint, feel free to write them down also.
