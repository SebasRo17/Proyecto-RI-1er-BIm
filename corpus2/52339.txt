`Limit[expr,x->Subscript[x, 0],Direction->1]` computes the limit as x approaches `Subscript[x, 0]` from smaller values. `Limit[expr,x->Subscript[x, 0],Direction->-1]` computes the limit as x approaches `Subscript[x, 0]` from larger values. This to me is confusing, I though x->4- that x are approaching xo from smaller values, in other words from the left hand side. Why would one therefore use 1 for left hand side and -1 for right hand side. Do not see the logic
