I made an application in extjs, and it was rejected by my technical architect, project manager, and team leader because it was a big JavaScript file. It feels very bad when you develop an application and it is rejected by your seniors. I don't want to feel bad and I want to concentrate on my work. I would like to restructure the code, as the coding structure in my company is very bad and I want to improve that. I want to work better and grow - how should I proceed?
