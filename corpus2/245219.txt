I work in C# and MSSQL and as you'd expect I store my passwords salted and hashed. When I look at the hash stored in an nvarchar column (for example the out the box aspnet membership provider). I've always been curious why the generated Salt and Hash values always seem to end in either one or two equals signs. I've seen similar things while working with encryption algorithms, is this coincidence or is there a reason for it?
