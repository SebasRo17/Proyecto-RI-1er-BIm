The following string can be converted easily into a list with `ToExpression`               string = "{{a},{b,c,d},{e,{f,{g}}}}";     ToExpression@string      However, if the string contains characters that can be misinterpreted as syntax errors, I run in to problems.               string = "{{a},{b,c,d},{e,{[f],{g}}}}"      `ToExpression` throws an error since "[f]" isn't valid Wolfram. (Side note, is that sentence grammatically correct? I would write "...isn't valid Java or C". Is it more appropriate to write "... isn't valid Wolfram Language?") I would like to convert a string into a nested list of strings. For reference (2242) starts with data whose `Head` is `List` and doesn't readily appear to work with nested lists, (43930) is a similar question focusing on `Graph` and looks promising except that the solution uses _levelspec_ in `Cases` which, to my understanding, is not available in `StringCases`.
