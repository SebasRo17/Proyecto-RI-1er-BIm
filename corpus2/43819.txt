What are some key ways of getting your team involved in using version control during development, web development or otherwise? I refuse to work without it, which means anyone involved in the project must also use it. It's just good practice. GUIs like Tower have helped, but the concept of it is either met with anger ('not my job!' kinda attitude), timidness, or just straight up not using it (using FTP instead, circumventing version control for say, dev or deployment). Edit: I should have clarified a little that I don't just mean images/PSDs.
