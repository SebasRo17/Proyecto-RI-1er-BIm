I have a project built with Gradle, which contains libraries which can be used freely outside the main project, like this: ![Project structure](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KwjNy.png) The folders with a square at the bottom right are project modules. I want to opensource this project (I mainly use Git and GitHub for tasks like this), but I have no idea how to organize it. Should I create separate repositories for each library (and if so, how can I link them to the main repository?), or should I put it all in one repo (I guess that's bad practice)? The main criteria is that when `git clone repo_url` is run, it should recreate project structure one-to-one, so it can still be built with `./gradlew build`.
