Alright I'm new to programming and I admit this is a fairly abstract question. The natural language we speak every day exist because people can understand each other. How can computers understand my code written in a certain language? Let's say Mr. A creates a new language. How is that accepted by machines? Must the creator communicate with the machine using machine language to create a new language? What guarantees that we can written in a language while getting understood by the machine properly?
