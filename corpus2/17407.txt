Is there a way to do this? What I am trying to do is allow a user to take a lineout averaged over the rows of a user defined ROI (Region of Interest) of an image. I have the bit of code that allows for the lineout but at present the only way I can get the indices of the ROI is to use the right click Get Indices function and then copy and pasting them into the function. I would like to eliminate the need for the copy and paste. I would like the user to click on the image in two locations with locators (or some sort of marker) appearing on the click, then have the lineout be plotted as an output. I need to have the image be full size (1000 x 2000) so that the user can see detail. I will also need to write the indices and the lineout to user defined variables so that multiple lineouts can be plotted together as the user needs them and the image reproduced with the markers overlay-ed on top. I have the code to do the lineouts and the plotting but I am hung up on a way to pass the indices cleanly out of a Module/DynamicModule structure. Would it be cleaner to do this all in 1 Manipulate structure? There will be 50 or so images each with there own lineout that my be compared to one another or all at once. Thanks
