From within the Kernel, it is possible to access a `Cell`'s options using `CurrentValue`. For instance, in a `Cell` tagged `{"Bob", "Frank"}`, executing this               CurrentValue[CellTags]     (* {"Bob", "Frank"} *)      But, how would one go about accessing the options of the parent cell in the hierarchy? One difficulty is that the `Cell` knows nothing about the `CellGroup` it finds itself in, so attacking the problem from that direction seems difficult. However, the current executing `Notebook` can be accessed via `EvaluationNotebook`, so traversing the tree from that direction seems plausible, if not efficient.
