I'm looking at a new chapter in my career. I'm a web developer, but now I'm starting to play around with C, compilers, and things I didn't have to work with before. It's all very intriguing! As I'm getting more and more into the "lower level" arena, I'm wondering how devices (mice, printers, webcams, microphones, etc...) are controlled, managed, detected, or used in general with software. I ask because I'm really having a hard time finding straightforward documentation online describing or giving examples of how hardware interacts with software. Does someone know of decent sites that can get me started learning this?
