I know this is kind of time-management question. I do well in short assignments, but fail miserably, when it comes to projects that require hours and hours of work to be done day after day. I cannot code more than 10 minutes, unless there is a deadline. I kinda wander and come back and code. It takes me ridiculously large amount of time even for simple project. I kinda lack persistence. I have my thesis coming up in December. The more time I spend, the better my publication will be. I was wondering, may be I could get some help on how to code persistently? I just get out of my chair and start doing other things, when I see a bug or when I have a module that requires thinking and it takes me long time to come back sit and put my thought back to the code. Any advice on how to improve my persistent coding skills?
