I've heard in several places "Don't make large commits" but I've never actually understood whats a "large" commit. Is it large if you work on a bunch of files even if there related? How many parts of a project should you be working on at once? To me, I have trouble trying to make "small commits" since I forget or create something that creates something else that creates something else. You then end up with stuff like this:               Made custom outgoing queue          Bot     -New field msgQueue which is nothing more than a SingleThreadExecutor     -sendMsg blocks until message is sent, and adds wait between when messages get     sent     -adminExist calls updated (see controller)     -Removed calles to sendMessage          Controller     -New field msgWait denotes time to wait between messages     -Starting of service plugins moved to reloadPlugins     -adminExists moved from Server because of Global admins. Checks at the channel,     server, and global level          Admin     -New methods getServer and getChannel that get the appropiate object Admin     belongs to          BotEvent     -toString() also show's extra and extra1          Channel     -channel field renamed to name     -Fixed typo in channel(int)          Server     -Moved adminExists to Controller          PluginExecutor     -Minor testing added, will be removed later          JS Plugins     -Updated to framework changes     -Replaced InstanceTracker.getController() with Controller.instance     -VLC talk now in own file          Various NB project updates and changes          ---          Affected files     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Core/dist/Quackbot-Core.jar     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Core/dist/README.TXT     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Core/nbproject/private/private.properties     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Core/nbproject/private/private.xml     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Core/src/Quackbot/Bot.java     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Core/src/Quackbot/Controller.java     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Core/src/Quackbot/PluginExecutor.java     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Core/src/Quackbot/info/Admin.java     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Core/src/Quackbot/info/BotEvent.java     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Core/src/Quackbot/info/Channel.java     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Core/src/Quackbot/info/Server.java     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-GUI/dist/Quackbot-GUI.jar     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-GUI/dist/README.TXT     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-GUI/dist/lib/Quackbot-Core.jar     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-GUI/nbproject/private/private.properties     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-GUI/nbproject/private/private.xml     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-GUI/src/Quackbot/GUI.java     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-GUI/src/Quackbot/log/ControlAppender.java     Delete  /trunk/Quackbot-GUI/src/Quackbot/log/WriteOutput.java     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Impl/dist/Quackbot-Impl.jar     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Impl/dist/README.TXT     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Impl/dist/lib/Quackbot-Core.jar     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Impl/dist/lib/Quackbot-GUI.jar     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Impl/dist/lib/Quackbot-Plugins.jar     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Impl/lib/javarebel.stats     Add /trunk/Quackbot-Impl/lib/jrebel.info     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Impl/nbproject/private/private.properties     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Impl/nbproject/private/private.xml     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Impl/nbproject/project.properties     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Impl/plugins/CMDs/Admin/reload.js     Add /trunk/Quackbot-Impl/plugins/CMDs/Operator/hostBan     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Impl/plugins/CMDs/Operator/mute.js     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Impl/plugins/CMDs/lyokofreak/curPlaying.js     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Impl/plugins/CMDs/lyokofreak/lfautomode.js     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Impl/plugins/listeners/onJoin.js     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Impl/plugins/listeners/onQuit.js     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Impl/plugins/testCase.js     Add /trunk/Quackbot-Impl/plugins/utils/whatsPlaying.js     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Impl/src/Quackbot/impl/SandBox.java     Add /trunk/Quackbot-Impl/vlc_http     Add /trunk/Quackbot-Impl/vlc_http/current.html     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Plugins/dist/Quackbot-Plugins.jar     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Plugins/dist/README.TXT     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Plugins/dist/lib/Quackbot-Core.jar     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Plugins/nbproject/private/private.properties     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Plugins/nbproject/private/private.xml     Modify  /trunk/Quackbot-Plugins/src/Quackbot/plugins/JSPlugin.java     Add /trunk/Quackbot-Plugins/vlc_http     Add /trunk/global-lib/jrebel.jar      Yea.... So for questions:   * What are some factors for when a commit becomes too large ( _non-obvious stuff_ )?    * How can you prevent such commits? Please give specifics   * What about when your in semi-early stages of development when things are moving quickly? Are huge commits still okay?
