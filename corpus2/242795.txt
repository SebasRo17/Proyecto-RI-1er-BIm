I've seen people talking about _Free Monad with Interpreter_ , particularly in the context of data-access. What is this pattern? When might I want to use it? How does it work, and how would I implement it? I understand (from posts such as this) that it's about separating model from data-access. How does it differ from the well-known Repository pattern? They appear to have the same motivation.
