I have a small project (3000 lines in Python) that I wrote myself; it has no known bugs and has some decent parts, but is largely a mess because of my lack of time. Unfortunately, I have to be the one who continues writing and maintaining the code. Is it a good idea to hire a highly experienced developer, explain to them the requirements (verbally, since I don't have them documented), and let them review the code and refactor it (in close discussion with me)? I am concerned that: (a) this work is so annoying that highly experienced developers wouldn't want to do it. (b) I would spend so much time explaining the requirements and what my current code does that it would be faster for me to do the actual work myself.
