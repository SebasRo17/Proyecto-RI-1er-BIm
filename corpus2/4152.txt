Regardless of `AspectRatio`, the `Text` boxes overlap.               TreeForm[#, AspectRatio -> 1/3, ImageSize -> 700]& @      Cases[        Import["http://www.weather.gov/data/current_obs/KOAK.xml", "XMLObject"],        XMLElement[tag:_, _, value:_] :> (tag -> value), Infinity     ]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mmbNF.png) More generally, I've asked Wolfram Research, Inc. about exposing bounding box coordinates for `Text` objects so that layout manager or engine can test overlap or compute tilings or disjoint positioning, but it appears to be complicated by the various `Text` options. Does anyone know how to at least conservatively approximate the `Text` bounding box?
