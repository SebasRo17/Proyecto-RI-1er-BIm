I used to believe the practicing "good" software development methods tends to yield a better product in the long run. However, I've seen quite a few cases where "quick-and-dirty" \ "brute-force" \ "copy-paste" programming appeared to give decent results quicker, and cheaper. This appears especially in cases where time to market is more critical then maintenance overhead. Is there a correlation between the quality of the development process and techniques and the quality of the product?
