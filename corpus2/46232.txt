I've got a folder with 500 newspaper articles. Each article is saved in a seperate file with a number in the title like "1.txt", "2.txt". Each article has a date but it is not clear in which line the date is printed. I would like to seperate the date from the article and put them in two columns. The purpose is that I can make selection of articles based on periods of time. A article looks like this: The Light of Truth ENORMOUS IPO MAKES THE BILLIONAIRE 2013/12/18 CENTRUM, Tethys - the president and PRESIDENT international Sten can add another description to its name:.......               fname = FileNameJoin[{"E:\\data\\MC1 Data\\MC1 Data\\articles\\",      "testfile3.txt"}];          s = OpenWrite[fname]     For[i = 1, i < 20, i++,     test1 = Import["E:\\data\\MC1 Data\\MC1 Data\\articles\\" <> ToString[i] <>".txt","Text"];          test2 = {       StringCases[test1, DatePattern[{"Year", "Month", "Day"}]],StringCases[ToLowerCase[test1], RegularExpression["\\w(?<!\\d)[\\w'-]*"]]};          WriteString[s, test2, "\n"];      ] When I open the file,               test1 = Import["E:\\data\\MC1 Data\\MC1 Data\\articles\\testfile3.txt"]      I will see this:               {{2013/12/18}, {the, light, of, truth, enormous, ipo, makes, the,      billionaire, of, sanjorge, centrum,}}     {2009/06/21}, {news, online, today, protest, turns, violent, in,      abila, abila, kronos, a, rally, of, hundreds, of, protestors, allied,      with, the, protectors, of, kronos, movement, turned, to, violence}      The structure of this file is like this :{{..},{..}} and I can't make a selection like               Select[file[All,{1,2}]], #[[1]]<"2009/06/21"&]      Anyone a suggestion how to solve this?
