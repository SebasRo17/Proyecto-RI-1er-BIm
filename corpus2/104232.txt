I am working on a project with a single developer (so far) and myself in a testing role. There are a bunch of new features being added. The project is .NET4.0 based, but some users need 3.5 compatibility, support for Silverlight and Windows Phone 7. These are all features wanted by users, but with the number of people participating in this project, it might get out of hand. What experiences do you have in controlling feature requests and scope creep?
