This is a very top level question with no code examples attached. I have an interest in using Mathematica to read raw files coming from a Canon camera, before they are converted into jpg's, where data is lost. Are there any existing non proprietary mathematica scripts, which can read a CR2 file from a Canon camera and display its image as it would if a jpeg were imported. At the very least a script that can display data about the image stored in the CR2 file to include intensity, size, pixel value, LRGB histograms, etc...
