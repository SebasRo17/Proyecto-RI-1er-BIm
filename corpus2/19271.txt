Whenever I make a 3D plot using the `Max` or `Min` functions, I get breaks in the plot when it switches from one expression in `Max` or `Min` to the other. How can I eliminate these breaks to get one continuous surface? The particular example I want to make work is this:               ParametricPlot3D[{r Cos[t], r Sin[t],       Max[r^2 Cos[t]^2 - 1.06^2, 0] + Max[r^2 Sin[t]^2 - 1.92^2, 0]},       {t, 0, 2 \[Pi]}, {r, 0, 3.4}, Mesh->None, Boxed->False, Axes->None]      which produces this: ![surface showing breaks in plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QTZ9H.png) but it is possible to reproduce the effect with simpler expressions like `Plot3D[Max[x, 1], {x, 0, 2}, {y, 0, 2}]`. * * * I've checked that occurs with Mathematica 7 and 8 on Windows and Linux.
