I have two lists, age and score, that I want to find correlation on for 50 people. For some people, the score is blank. Example data:               age={60., 21., 24., 63., 66., 62., 56., 54., 62.,...}     score={720., 880., 980., 820., , 820., 970., 950., 170.,...}      If I simply use DeleteCases to remove the " " from the score list, I change the length and cannot correlate the two lists of different lengths. Suggestions?
