I have the following equation:               2 a^2 k^2 Sin[b k] - 6 a (k Cos[b k] - Sin[b k]/b) == 0      I set the value of `b` to 1, and I want to plot the value of `k` as it ranges over 0.01 to 6.0 in increments of 0.01. When the above equation becomes zero for some value of `a`, I want to print the value of `k`. Later I will plot `k` as a function of ratio `a/b`. This is a general question, but I am struggling with the logic can to solve this. Do I put it in a loop?               xxx = 2 a^2 k^2 Sin[b k] - 6 a (k Cos[b k] - Sin[b k]/b)     b = 1;     Do[If[xxx == 0, {Print[k], Print[a]}, Continue[]], {a, 0.01, 6, 0.01}]      Thanks
