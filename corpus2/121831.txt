I want my scribbles of a program's design and behaviour to become more streamlined and have a common language with other developers. I looked at UML and _in principle_ it seems to be what I'm looking for, but it seems to be overkill. The information I found online also seems very bloated and academic. How can I understand UML in plain-English way, enough to be able to explain it to my colleagues? What are the canonical resources for understanding UML at a ground level?
