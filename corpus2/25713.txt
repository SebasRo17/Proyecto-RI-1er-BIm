How to extend the default dictionary.txt for `Dictionarylookup` to all words? For example, first I               wordsExtended=WordData[]~Join~DictionaryLookup["*"]//Union;     wordsExtended//Length      However, after reloading the dictionary.txt some words are omitted, for example:               In[73]:= DictionaryLookup["appals"]     Out[73]= {}     In[74]:= WordData["appals"]     Out[74]= {{appal,Verb,Frighten},{appal,Verb,Nauseate}}      How to add all such words like #appals# to dictionary.txt? One method: Tuples to create a word verified by WordData, which takes too much time. For               In[78]:= Binomial[26,7]     Out[78]= 657800      Second method:               listAlls = # <> "s" & /@ DictionaryLookup["*"];     wordsToExport = Select[listAlls, Length[WordData@#] > 1 &];     In[81]:= Complement[wordsToExport,DictionaryLookup["*"]]//Length     Out[81]= 2580      I get 2580 new words for dictionary.txt, but how to get all prefix and suffix such like `s` `pre` `es`... and so on.
