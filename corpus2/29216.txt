I know there has been a similar questions to this already but the solution did not work for me so here again: I have internet connection and I can execute such commands like:               Import["http://www.google.com"]      I am also able to use the functionality of Wolfram Alpha such as               == GDP of the USA      but when I do               CountryData["France", "Population"]      it tells me that there is no connection and that I should test the connectivity which I did via "Edit->Preferences->Internet Connectivity->Test Connectivity". When I tried testing it it returned:               "PacletSiteUpdate::err: An error occurred attempting to update paclet information from site http://pacletserver.wolfram.com. Failed writing received data to disk/application"      When I tried to ping the `pacletserver.wolfram.com` directly in the cmd it tried to ping `pacletserver2.wolfram.com` which failed. When I did the same with `pacletserver1.wolfram.com` and `pacletserver3.wolfram.com` it worked just fine. So I tried Nikita's Solution with the windows host file which did not work for me. After that I tried to change the server address within Mathematica with               $PacletSite = pacletserver1.wolfram.com      After that the Connectivity Test returned success. The CountryData-function did still not work, though. When I re-started Mathematica the `$PacletSite` contains the original value `(http://pacletserver.wolfram.com)` and the Connectivity Test fails again. Even though the CountryData-function did not work, I think that the problem is that Mathematica tries to connect to `pacletserver2.wolfram.com` and the `$PacletSite`-Value does not influence the CountryData-function. So is there a way to change the way Mathematica tries to connect to the pacletserver and tell it only to connect to `pacletserver1.wolfram.com` or `pacletserver3.wolfram.com`? Thank you very much for your help
