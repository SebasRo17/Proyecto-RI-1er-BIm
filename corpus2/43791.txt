**Context** In Astronomy the de facto standard for images and data is FITS. I would like to export heterogenous data sets into a single fits file. **Attempt** I am interested in exporting into a fits file some data, say.                dat = Table[i, {i, 5}]      (* {1,2,3,4,5} *) and additionally some metadata, say a range of $\nu$s:                rnus = ("nu" <> ToString[#] -> 0.5 + # & /@ ( Range[5]))      (* {nu1->1.5,nu2->2.5,nu3->3.5,nu4->4.5,nu5->5.5} *) Following closely the documentation I can write:                Export["image.fits", {"Data" -> dat,       "Metadata" -> Join[rnus, {"Object" -> "something"}]}, "Rules"]      (* image.fits *) and read back accordingly both the data:                Import["image.fits", "RawData"][[1]]      (* {1,2,3,4,5} *) and the metadata:                 "NU1" /. Import["image.fits", "Metadata"]       "OBJECT" /. Import["image.fits", "Metadata"]      (* 1.5 _) (_ Something *) BUT, what I would like to do is to write different (large) tables of different sizes into a single fits file. So using a single keyword for each element is unrealistic. If the table were of the same size I could join them into a single list, as in                  Export["image.fits", {"Data" -> {dat,dat}}, "Rules"]           but in my case the tables are not of the same size. In principle the documentation says _"For FITS files that contain multiple images or data extensions, the above elements are taken to be lists of the respective expressions."_ **Question** How can I write multiple images or data extensions into a unique fits file? Or in other words, what does the documentation mean? **Update** As requested, here is an example of fits with an extension containing {1,2,3,4,5} and {1,2,3,4,5,6} : > https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/659996/test.fits or it can be produced in python as               python     import pyfits     import numpy     data=numpy.array([1.,2.,3.,4.,5.])     pyfits.writeto("test.fits",data)     data=numpy.array([1.,2.,3.,4.,5.,6.])     pyfits.append("test.fits",data)     exit
