I want to compute the integral of the following integrand               ((0.000245587 + 0.0000651908 I) E^(-I kx)        kx ky (kz^2 - 4 \[Pi]^2))/((kx^2 + ky^2) kz) - ((4.00033*10^-17 -          3.51178*10^-18 I) E^(-I kx) (kx^3 kz + kx ky^2 kz + kx^2 kz^2 +          4 ky^2 \[Pi]^2))/((kx^2 + ky^2) kz)      Where $k = 2 \pi$. For this I have the following code:               SetAttributes[withTransforms, HoldAll];     withTransforms[code_] :=       Block[{kx = k*Sin[a]*Cos[b],         ky = k*Sin[a]*Sin[b], kz = k*Cos[a]},        code]      And the symbolic integration:               IntoS[int_] :=       withTransforms[       Integrate[        int*k^2*Sin[a]*Cos[a], {a, 0, Pi/4}, {b, 0, 2*Pi}]]      And finally, the numerical:               IntoN[int_] :=       withTransforms[       NIntegrate[        int*k^2*Sin[a]*Cos[a], {a, 0, Pi/4}, {b, 0, 2*Pi}]]      Now, `IntoS`, the symbolic integration doesn't give a result within 5 minutes (after which I have aborted the evaluation) on my core 2 duo. I need to compute many of these integrals for a plot and if it takes several minutes already to evaluate one point that won't be very useful. Furthermore, `IntoN` throws > NIntegrate::slwcon: Numerical integration converging too slowly; suspect one > of the following: singularity, value of the integration is 0, highly > oscillatory integrand, or WorkingPrecision too small. at me. How do I integrate this function? **Edit** Scaling coefficients does not really work. I always get that some coefficients are quite large and others very small. This way, the integration never works. I can delete the "small" terms manually but that it not really automatic. **Edit 2:** Mathematica is unable to compute the following integral numerically:               (E^(I kx) kx ky (-1 + kz^2))/(Sqrt[2] (kx^2 + ky^2) kz)      Symbolically this integral is $0$. However, I do need the numerical computation as the symbolic computation can take quite long and I need to plot the end-result. This is a special case of the term               (E^(I (kx x + ky y + kz z)) kx ky (-1 + kz^2))/(Sqrt[2] (kx^2 +         ky^2) kz)      And I want to plot in $x$ (with $y, z = 0$ for example) and this integral is sometimes impossible to compute symbolically. **Edit 3:** I have "fixed" it by writing my own numerical method:               Trapezoidal2D[f_, {x_, a0_, b0_}, {y_, c0_, d0_}, m0_] :=            Module[{h = (b0 - a0)/m0, k = (d0 - c0)/m0, a = N[a0], b = N[b0],          c = N[c0], d = N[d0], i, j, m = m0, X, Y},        Subscript[X, k_] = a + i h;        Subscript[Y, j_] = c + j k;        Return[         1/4 h k (Function[{x, y}, f][a, c] + Function[{x, y}, f][b, d] +             Function[{x, y}, f][a, d] + Function[{x, y}, f][b, d] +             2 Sum[Function[{x, y}, f][Subscript[X, i], c], {i, 1,                m - 1}] +             2 Sum[Function[{x, y}, f][Subscript[X, i], d], {i, 1,                m - 1}] +             2 Sum[Function[{x, y}, f][a, Subscript[Y, j]], {j, 1,                m - 1}] +             2 Sum[Function[{x, y}, f][b, Subscript[Y, j]], {j, 1,                m - 1}] +             4 Sum[Function[{x, y}, f][Subscript[X, i], Subscript[Y,                j]], {i, 1, m - 1}, {j, 1, m - 1}])];];
