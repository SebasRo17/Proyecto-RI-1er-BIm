I forked a project that hasn't been maintained for a while now. I have a lot of changes I'd like to implement and want to actively maintain the project and keep it open source. How does the licensing work for situations like this? The original project is licensed under MIT and I would like to keep it that way. Would I be able to change the licence's copyright holders or would it have to stay the same?
