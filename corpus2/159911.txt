I'm confused about the nature of the jQuery project. It can be licensed under either the GPL or the MIT license, according to the comments in the project. However, the jQuery web site provides a list of team members, as if this were a commercial product. I have written some code to improve jQuery to work around a nasty bug in Internet Explorer and I would like to know what is the best way to propose my idea to the project.
