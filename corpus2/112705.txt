I have a firm understanding of HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL (and to some extent apache/linux) and find that one of the things missing from my 'web development knowledge base' is javascript - creating richer user interfaces. I'd like to learn Javascript before I look at any frameworks (I've used light javascript/jquery before, but that's besides the point). Can anyone recommend a firm book or online documentation from 'absolute beginner' to 'expert' for javascript? I seem to be finding too many 'display the time' and 'hello world' tutorials...
