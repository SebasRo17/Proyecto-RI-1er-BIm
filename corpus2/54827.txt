In Mathematica 9 and 10 they added autocompletion. Out of the box this works great, but when I set the CellContext to "Notebook" instead of the default "Global" (following this) it no longer autocompletes the functions I define in my notebook. If I specify that the function is global, then the autocomplete mechanism works as you can see in the example below: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PoRBh.png) Is there a way of making Mathematica's autocompletion work with functions just defined within the notebook, and not just with global functions?
