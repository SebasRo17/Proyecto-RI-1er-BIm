I'm working on classes that cover software tools and languages. Obviously the classes are going to be more valuable if the students actually **do** some of what they're supposed to be learning, so I'm planning to incorporate lab work. Has anyone used automated functional testing tools to grade lab assignments? Lab 1 is to install Apache, so the testing server looks to see that your lab machine is listening on port 80, and responds with the default index page. Lab 2 is to create a page that takes `?name=MyName` and responds "Hello, MyName!", so the testing server GETs `?name=random` and expects "Hello, random!". If you haven't used them this way yourself, what tools **might** be a good candidate?
