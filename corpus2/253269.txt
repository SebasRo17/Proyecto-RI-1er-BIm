I understand the general Erlang conventions for functions are using snake case or camel case, but what about exported functions? For example, say I have a gen_server module that defines a check to see if a username is in use:   * I have a call along the lines of `handle_function(is_username_in_use, UserName)`.    * I also have an exported function named `is_username_in_use` that calls `gen_server:call/2`.  But internally I also define a method that checks a database. So I end up with something along the lines of `check_if_username_is_in_use_in_db` for internal use. It quickly gets out of hand, and I end up with uncomfortably long names. Is there a common convention used to name functions like these? I was thinking something along the lines of `is_username_in_use_internal`
