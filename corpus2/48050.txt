I am facing a problem concerning the SocialMediaData function built in Mathematica. I am trying to investigate the WallMostLikedPost over time, i.e I want get the most liked post for the last few years for various fan pages. The built in function               SocialMediaData[{"Facebook", "BMW"}, "WallMostLikedPost"]      does not give me the possibility to state a time interval which I want to analyze. Does anybody have an idea how I should tackle this problem. Thanks a lot!
