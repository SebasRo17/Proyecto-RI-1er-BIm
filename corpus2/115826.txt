My goal is to learn how to program a website with Python/Django in the next year. From what I've understood, I also have to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I understand in order to build a website, I will need to find a co-founder whose skills far exceed mine. But still, the situation will be way different if I'm a person who's closer to his/her level and has dedicated a lot of time teaching himself than every other "I have an idea, just need a tech co- founder" type of guy. I do plan to pursue a degree in computer science, but after finishing high school last May decided to take an year off, so I am free to learn programming in the next 10 months. For now, I have the chance to attend some college courses in a top institution. Which ones are a must for a web developer so that I don't have any gaps in my understanding of programming and write "sophisticated code"? EDIT:Thank you all for the help!From the courses suggested I may be able to attend some/none/all of OOP(with Java),Networks and Graphics,SE- Algorithms,Discrete Math for Comp.Scientists,Databases,Information Retrieval and Data Mining.Which of those are more important for Web development with Django? I've read a lot of times people saying that self-taught programmers had gaps in their knowledge, didn't write clear code.This is why I'm asking which CS courses can fill those gaps? Not only in practical skills,but in mindset,way of thinking.
