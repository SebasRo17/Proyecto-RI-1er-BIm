I draw a Graphics3D object of two tubes:               Graphics3D[{Tube[{{-0.2, -1, 0}, {-0.2, 1, 0}}, 0.05],          Tube[{{0, 0, -1}, {0, 0, 1}}, 0.05]}, Boxed -> False]      And I get this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rdTNI.jpg) Now I want to have some edge effect of the two tubes, so that more parts of the back tube are excluded by the front tube, with the desired result like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vZMe9.jpg) Replacing `Tube[a_]` by `{EdgeForm[{White,Thick}],Tube[a]}` does not work, is there a simple way to do?
