In recent months, our product (which went live probably 9 months ago) experience an increase in the number of users using it. We faced lots of queries, problems, and complaints from users. Sadly, it seems that a lot of the issues seem to be coming from a module that I have been working on. At times, I wonder if I am incompetent, or is this pretty normal in software development, that bugs are found especially during the initial stages of a software development livecycle after it goes live? I wonder why some issues we faced now are not foreseen by me or the team during development phase. I have been working as a software developer for close to 2 years now. Hope to get your opinions, feedback, advices! Thanks!
