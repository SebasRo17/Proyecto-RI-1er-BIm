As was discussed in the comments of another question (MathLink Graphical Output (Plots) to File), `Graphcis` objects produced by commands such as `Plot` could be used to plot graphics independent of the presence of a connection with the _Mathematica_ kernel which generated it; i.e., it could be displayed in a separate instance of _Mathematica_. This would be useful to realize the display of plots in custom front ends connected to _Mathematica_ with `MathLink`. The `Graphics` objects would in this case serve as exchange format between the kernel and the frond end. However, as was pointed out to me, `Graphics` can contain dynamic content which is evaluated by the native front end by calling the kernel. Consider the example               SetOptions["stdout", FormatType -> InputForm];     myf1[min_?NumericQ, max_?NumericQ] := Table[count, {count, min, max}];     Plot[x^2, {x, 1, 5}, Ticks -> myf1]      which generates the output > >     Graphics[{{{}, {}, {Hue[0.67, 0.6, 0.6], Line[{ ...}]}}}, >       {AspectRatio -> GoldenRatio^(-1), Axes -> True, >        AxesLabel -> {None, None}, AxesOrigin -> {1., 0}, Method -> {}, >        PlotRange -> {{1, 5}, {0., 25.}}, PlotRangeClipping -> True, >        PlotRangePadding -> {Scaled[0.02], Scaled[0.02]}, Ticks -> myf1}] >   Note the final `Ticks -> myf1`. Is it possible make the kernel evaluate this output such that it is rendered static? In this case the `Graphics` should be made a static list of tics, however the solution would need to be generic enough to produce static output for all possible commands which generate graphics.
