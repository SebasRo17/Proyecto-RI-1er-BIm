This question could be generalized to any language where the language development is open-source, potentially, but I'm most curious about Clojure specifically. If Clojure (as a language) is open-source, licensed by the Eclipse Public License, which per this GitHub side-project requires derivative works to disclose source, must any application written _in_ Clojure be distributed with source? Or must only derivative language projects (e.g. Continjuation or something) disclose the source? Or do I have a faulty major premise somewhere in there?
