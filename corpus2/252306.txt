In a license.txt file, this:                Part of this program uses the following clause           2. Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright       notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in       the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.      is definitely different from this:                2. Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright       notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in       the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.      When applying the second clause of a 3-clause BSD license without "Part of this program uses the following clause", does bundling the library mean that my created application has to be governed by the 3-clause BSD license also? E.g. my program should have no warranties, etc?
