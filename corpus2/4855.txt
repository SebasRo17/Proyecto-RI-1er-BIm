I'm calculating a bit of the power spectrum of a two color cellular automaton using:               Abs[Fourier[#, FourierParameters -> {-1, -1}][[All, 1 ;; 100]] & /@          Transpose[CellularAutomaton[...]]]^2 // Total      Since I'm new to Mathematica, some trivial questions:   * Does it automatically optimize for the type of input data (just integers 0 and 1) or should I manually use `Compile`? Can I give it some hints about the input?   * Is Mathematica lazy enough to see that I only care about the first 100 frequencies and won't calculate the others? (the ones I care about are significantly less than the length of the input data, is there a better way to do this?) * * * This is to match a paper, everybody else seems to use this form which would be more efficient because it doesn't have to thread the `Fourier` over all columns:               CellularAutomaton[...] // Transpose // Total // Fourier // Abs
