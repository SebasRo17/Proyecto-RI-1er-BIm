I am new to open source licenses and it seems very confusing, therefore need some suggestions. We are developing an application which utilities existing components with following license types:   * Apache License v2   * LGPL v2.1   * MIT License   * BSD style license   * Mozilla Public License v1.1 Now my concern is:   1. What kind of distribution limitations our application might have from commercial perspective?   2. What kind of license possibilities we have for our application? (e.g. Apache, proprietary, GPL, etc.) Thanks!
