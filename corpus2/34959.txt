I currently have Apache httpd running on a production Ubuntu VPS server. I write php scripts. I'm interested in learning Java and I was wondering how I would go about writing some server-side Java to work on my current set-up. How are _Apache Tomcat_ and _Apache HTTP Server_ related to each other? Can Tomcat be a module of httpd? Or are they simply just two very different projects that happen to be steered by the same organisation (Apache Software Foundation)?
