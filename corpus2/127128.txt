> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Elegant ways to handle if(if else) else In a function where there are multiple returns, what is the best style to use? This style, where there is no 'else' because it is frivolous and you think it is more concise?               f() {         if (condition) {             return value;         }              return other_value;     }      Or this, if you think that 'else' provides nice syntax sugar to make it more readable?               f() {         if (condition) {             return value;         } else {             return other_value;         }     }      Feel free to share whatever other reasons you may have for preferring one over another. EDIT: The above samples are hypothetical, if they were this simple, as Yannis Rizos noted below, the ternary operator ( condition ? value : other ) would be acceptable. However I'm also interested in cases like this:               f() {         if (condition1) {             return value;         } else if (condition2) {             return value2;         }         ...         else {             return other_value;         }     }
