I'm trying to convert an image with several overlapping dots into a `Graph`. The goal is to be able to derive the Kirchhoff matrix for the randomly created "network of resistors" a.k.a dots with the function `KirchhoffMatrix[]`. Any thoughts or ideas? Here's the image I'm trying to extract the graph from: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9HXZ5.png) Haha, sorry I suppose I have been pretty vague with this question. I am currently researching percolation simulations. The dots in the image represent metallic particles. The dots the overlap represent metallic particles connected via a resistor. We randomize the dots on the screen, group the ones that are touching with `MorphologicalComponents[] // Colorize` , and then we Isolate the 'BackBone Cluster' a.k.a the largest component with `DeleteSmallComponents[]`. We check to see if the cluster spans all the way from the top to the bottom and if it does, the sample percolated. We are then trying to find the conductance of the sample from the BackBone cluster. We have been using the Finite Element Method for this, which requires the `KirchhoffMatrix[]`. Your answer, Vitaliy Kaurov, looks like it will very thoroughly answer my question. I'm going to test things before I accept it but thank you for putting so much time into it!!
