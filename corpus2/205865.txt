Often times I read things like: "Intel stated that either the next generation or generation after that will likely fail Moore's Law." Why don't they just say Moore's Law will fail instead? I don't know why it's held as some sort of standard that must be upheld? Why not aim for the highest progress instead of limiting yourself with arbitrary expections?
