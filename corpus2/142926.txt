I don't work every day with big-endian and little-endian problems and thus I find very difficult to remember which one is what. Recently I got an interview asking the difference between the two; since I didn't remember I decided to "guess" (50% chance, after all) but I failed. So, is there any wide known pratical trick to remember what is the difference between big endian and little endian?
