I work for a gym. I am the programmer, its just me, nobody else! Gets really frustrating when there's nobody to bounce conceptual ideas off of. I'm getting rid of our archaic paper binder systems for tracking appointments and what not. I've made a lot of things successfully already, now I'm trying to tackle the personal training department. What I want:   * Trainer information and work schedule   * Appointment booking that can be done by time slot with all available trainers for that time, or by trainer with all available hours for that trainer What I've tried so far:   * I started with an 'appointments' database, a 'trainers' database, and a 'schedules' database. This became so complicated trying to fit the schedule in that I scrapped it. Does anyone know know the best way to structure the tables for this and how to sort of make them communicate correctly? I don't need specific code, I just need help understand _how_ to make this thing!
