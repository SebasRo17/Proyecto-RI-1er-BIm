The first three expressions evaluate as expected and the polynomial is displayed in what I would call "textbook" form. The last expression, however, switches the order of terms. Mathematica employs this change for two-term polynomials if it results in getting rid of the leading negative sign (at least that is the best I can deduce).               x^2 + x + 5 // TraditionalForm     (* x^2 + x + 5 *)          -x^2 + x + 5 // TraditionalForm     (* -x^2 + x + 5 *)          x^2 + x // TraditionalForm     (* x^2 + x *)          -x^2 + x // TraditionalForm     (* x - x^2 *)      These polynomials are the result of prior symbolic manipulation, so I cannot simply use `HoldForm` or the equivalent to maintain the desired order. Is there a way to change this behavior in general so that the last expression displays as `-x^2 + x`? I can think of substitution rules to fix this particular example, but would like to find a robust solution that applies as transparently as possible across the board. **Edit** Additionally, `PolynomialForm` produces the same results:               PolynomialForm[-x^2 + x , TraditionalOrder -> True]     (* x - x^2 *)          PolynomialForm[-x^2 - x , TraditionalOrder -> True]     (* -x^2 - x *)      It seems that Mathematica will produce the traditional order for polynomial terms except when there are only two terms and reversing the order eliminates the leading negative sign.
