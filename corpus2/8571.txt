Suppose that I use `Frame -> True` in `Plot`. Then I can use `FrameLabel -> {"x (nm)", "y (nm)"}` to label the frame (i.e., "pseudo-axes"). For example, I have done the following:               Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 2 Pi}, PlotRange -> All,       Frame -> True, FrameLabel -> {"x (nm)", "y (nm)"},       BaseStyle -> {FontFamily -> "Arial", 20}]      ![FrameLabel](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4yZLL.gif) Now, however, I would like the characters "x" and "y" to be italicized in `FrameLabel`. Is this possible? I would like my labels to look like this: _x_ (nm) _y_ (nm) where _x_ and _y_ are italicized, but (nm) is not. Do I need to use `Style`, or is there a simpler solution? Also, in the future, I may need to create `FrameLabel` directives that are more complicated, such as: Phi( _z_ ) (V) where, for example, _z_ is italicized, but Phi( and ) (V) are not.
