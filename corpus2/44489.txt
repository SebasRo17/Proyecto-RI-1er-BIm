The answer from this question helped me use Euler's method. It worked for a simple function, but when the function is more complicated, I get an empty plot. This is my function: > $y'=-\frac{3*(3*sin^2(t)-3*(y-1)^{1.5})*y^2}{pi*(1.6)^2}$ And this is the code:               Clear[x];     x = x /. First[         NDSolve[{x'[t] ==          -(3*(3*Sin[t]^2 - 3*((x[t] - 1)^1.5))*(x[t]^2))/(Pi*(1.6)^2), x[0] == 0.8},         x, {t, 0, 10}, StartingStepSize -> 0.5,          Method -> {"FixedStep", Method -> "ExplicitEuler"}]];     grid = Table[{t, x[t]}, {t, 0, 10, 0.5}]     ListLinePlot[grid]      What am I doing wrong?
