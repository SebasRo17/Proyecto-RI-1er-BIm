class A {       static int foo () {} // ok       static int x; // <--- needed to be defined separately in .cpp file     };      I don't see a need of having `A::x` defined separately in a .cpp file (or same file for templates). Why can't be `A::x` declared and defined at the same time? Has it been forbidden for historical reasons? My main question is, will it affect any functionality if `static` data members were declared/defined at the same time (same as **Java** ) ?
