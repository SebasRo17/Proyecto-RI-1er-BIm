It seems to me that programmers have an increasingly uphill task of staying up-to-date. In my efforts to improve my programming ability, I am in search of the essential design patterns that are commonly used in computing (more specifically around .net). For example, should I bother to memorise:   * Search algorithms?   * MVC? (is it bad to use this just for the smart url's? lol)   * MVVM? (seems no point, but haven't researched it) etc... What are your top 5 design patterns that you commonly use day to day (not just the ones you like)?
