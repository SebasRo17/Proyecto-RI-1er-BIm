I am trying to insert a (text) cell into a notebook that replicates the behaviour of tab stops in MS Word, for example. Put differently, I have two strings and I want the one string to align on the left side of a page and the other string to align on the right side of the page _but on the same line_. I thought it may perhaps be possible using some version of:               Cell[         TextData[{                 Cell["First String",TextAlignment->Left], " \t ",                 Cell["Second String",TextAlignment->Right]         }], "Text"]      Of course, this doesn't work. In fact, I have realised that I can't use regular menu formatting commands to create the effect I want in a cell (so that I could look at the raw expression and see how it is done). Perhaps it can't be done? **However** I do know, for example, that one can set the `PageFooters`/`PageHeaders` option in the stylesheet for a notebook and that this option is preset to accept a list like `{{ll,lc,lr},{rl,rc,rr}}` where the first list is for left-facing pages and the second for right-facing pages and the three elements in each list correspond to left alignment, center alignment and right alignment of text in the footer (essentially what I want to do in a regular cell). Any suggestions?
