I'm working on a web application that runs on node.js and uses MongoDB. It's important to mention that I plan to release the application as commercial software. The way I wrote the installer, it asks the user to confirm the location of the node and mongod binaries (after autodetecting first). I figured I could skip this step altogether by bundling said binaries together with my application or making the installer download them, but there are a few issues I need to address:   1. First and foremost, the licensing issue. The friendly folks at 10gen (the company that develops MongoDB) answered an email I sent them and told me their license allows this, and from what I can figure out, this is the case with node.js too. Are there any problems I should keep an eye out for?   2. Is it worth (from the user's point of view) fetching ~20MB of extra data during installation just for the convenience of not having to manually install node.js and mongod (the MongoDB server binary)?   3. Should I expect any problems if I bundle the 32-bit binaries and the user installs the application on a 64-bit machine?
