I'm starting to hear rumblings about this project called ASM.js. Currently their web site is terrible and confusing. Here's what I know from my research on the web.   * It is a subset of JavaScript that can be highly optimized. I'm guessing because it avoids the more dynamic parts of the language.   * Performance of code compiled to ASM.js runs at about half the speed of C (not light).   * The intention is for compilers to make their target language ASM.js.   * Firefox is going to be shipping with ASM.js optimization baked in.   * The Mozilla and Unreal teams ported the _Unreal Engine to the web with it_ and its running in a build of _Firefox_ at near-native speeds. There doesn't seem to be any concrete information on the web about what this really _is_ or the usefulness or ultimate purpose. Is it that I can compile my otherwise server-side code bases and have it run in the browser at close-to- native speeds? What are the ramifications for developers?
