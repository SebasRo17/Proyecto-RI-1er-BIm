What principles does your software engineering or development organization follow? I am very interested in seeing a list of principles from someone who works at a company where these principles are discussed, published, followed, etc. The closest I have seen to a principles-based engineering organization are companies which are agile and follow the agile principles. Here is a list of Marick's values/challenges: http://www.agilejourneyman.com/2010/02/4-challenges-and-5-guiding-values- of.html I am looking for pointers to more stuff like this. Ideally, I'd like to hear from people who have actually implemented a principles-based approach in their organization.
