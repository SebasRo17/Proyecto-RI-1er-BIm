I'm am about to commence redesigning my resume all over. What I'm stuck with is where should I draw the line between writing _everything_ down and writing too little. I don't want my resume to be a pack of buzzwords nor do I want to seem to not know any of the things I do know. Keep these thoughts in mind and wanting to write a _meaningful_ resume, how do I go about it. Someone reading my resume should be able to tell if I'm a hacker culture person or someone who went to computer school just for the heck of it. **Edit:** In view of answer majorly focusing on buzzwords I would like to point out I'm also looking for things that make my resume more meaningful - I want the reader to be able to tell the difference between a hacker person and just another guy who went to computer school.
