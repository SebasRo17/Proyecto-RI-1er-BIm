My company has problem A, lets say, face recognition. We find a nice algorithm like this one. We implement it and go home happy. Problem is, once home I cant sleep because I wonder if we should make the implementation public. After all the algorithm was public. Someone did intensive research and did half ( or more ) the work for us. I feel like we should help back and make our efforts public too. But then our commercial product would not be very _commercial_ , just image our banner: > Hey customer please buy our grunt master 6000 software, its only $1,000.00 ! > Oh by and by the way, you can download the main algorithms here for free ! Is there some sort of licence of derivative work from these academic research papers ? Is it my duty to make my implementations public ? Or is it up to me ? Can I make money from the algorithm ?
