First off, please note that this question is not about WPF vs. WinForms. What are the highest-ranking benefits that led Microsoft to invent XAML in favour of the “old” approach of generating compilable C# code? My impression is that other developers seem to find a lot of downsides to it, but Microsoft went with it regardless, which must mean that there is a benefit that I am not seeing. I would like you to explain to me what it is that I am missing.
