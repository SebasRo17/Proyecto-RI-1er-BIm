I'm writing an online game that has to run in a web browser and I'm worried about whether my server-side architecture will be able to handle the load. I'm designing for 1000-2000 simultaneous clients. Each client will need to query the server once every 2 seconds - so 500-1000 transactions per second is my design goal. My game server communicates with Apache via FastCGI. I'm actually running Apache on Windows for the moment. All this will run on a dedicated "dual-core" server. The game server application itself is written in C++ and the transactions are pretty simple and fairly low bandwidth (maybe 2k data per) so I'm not too worried about the game server piece. My client is written in Javascript and uses XMLHTTP to communicate with the server. So am I smoking something to think I can get 500 to 1000 transactions per second? If so, what number might I expect?
