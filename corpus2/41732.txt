My company has corporate offices around the country and I have been hired under contract to work in one office while the rest of my team works in another. We are in the same time zone, but definitely remote. I have not met the team yet, but will be flying up there soon. What is your best advice for integrating and developing with this team? What are the most important priorities? Standard versioning control, e-mail, phone, conference call and IM are all available resources, however Google apps, Skype and the like are not for security reasons.
