I want to combine two `ListLogPlot` plots. For example               p1 = ListLogPlot[Range@100, Frame -> True]     p2 = ListLogPlot[10^4*Range@100, Frame -> True]      I got               Show[p1, p2, PlotRange -> All]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Msnob.png) By using the ticks of p2, I got               Show[p1, p2, PlotRange -> All, FrameTicks -> (FrameTicks /. p2[[2]])]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6ujxe.png) Both of the results have ticks which only cover a part of the figure. By trying               Show[p1, p2, PlotRange -> All, FrameTicks -> Automatic]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0ZklM.png) I actually got a _wrong_ result with completely wrong ticks. So would there be a way to let `Show` combine the plots and redraw the ticks automatically? Thanks! Some notes: (1) There is a similar post: Scale label problem of multiple ListLogPlot graphs However, it doesn't solve my problem because the two plots here have different scales which are non-overlapping. Thus the problem is not solved simply by ordering the plots or choosing which ticks to use. (2) I could instead do `ListLogPlot[{Range@100, 10^4*Range@100}]`. However, actually each plot command in my realistic case is complicated enough thus it would be easier and more modular for me to draw them separately and combine them afterwards.
