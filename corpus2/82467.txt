Has anyone had experiences before in setting up a study group to empower individuals (employees) work towards a certification while still working. There are plenty of google hits out there on this subject, but I would be particularly interested in the anecdotal experiences of people in this forum. In particular:   1. What was the format?   2. What sort of commitment is required, both individual and employer   3. Optimal group sizes   4. Length and frequency of meetings   5. Absolutely anything else of relevance.
