One of my projects just changed the version number of a supporting third-party library. Specifically, we changed a J2EE app from JPA 1.x to JPA 2.0. Our CI system has had this change for a week and the tests are passing. In general, how can I do an effective code review and QA check when another developer changes the version of a third-party library? I have already done the following:   * reviewed the changelogs for the library, watching for things that would affect my application   * checked the dependency declarations (Maven POMs) for mistakes   * searched our ticketing system for prior attempts or upgrades of the same libraries, did we try this before and fail or find a blocker
