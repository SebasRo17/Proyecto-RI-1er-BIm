I am trying to find the eigenvalue/eigenfunction solution to: $$\tag 1 y''+3y + \lambda y=0 ; y'(0)=0, y'(\pi)=0$$ I used DSolve and Reduce and they seem to converge, however (embarrassingly) I am having a difficult time understanding the Reduce output (which seems to have an issue with a particular branch point). Ignoring that warning, how do you read the output below?                sol = DSolve[y''[x] + 3 y[x] + a y[x] == 0, y, x]           {{y -> Function[{x}, E^(Sqrt[-3 - a] x) C[1] + E^(-Sqrt[-3 - a] x) C[2]]}}            Reduce[        y'[0] == 0 && y'[Pi] == 0 && a != 0 && (C[1] != 0 || C[2] != 0) /.         sol, a] // FullSimplify      During evaluation of In[29]:= Reduce::useq: The answer found by Reduce contains unsolved equation(s) {0==(2 I [Pi] C[3]-2 [Pi] Sqrt[-Power[<<2>>]])/(2 [Pi])}. A likely reason for this is that the solution set depends on branch cuts of Mathematica functions. >>                 (C[1] !=          0 && ((C[3] \[Element] Integers && Abs[C[3]] == C[3] &&          3 + a == C[3]^2 && C[1] == C[2] && a != 0) ||          a == -3)) || (a == -3 && C[2] != 0)
