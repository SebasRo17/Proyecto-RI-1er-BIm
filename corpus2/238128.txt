I am using Android's internal storage to hold data for my application and I am trying to find a good way to handle reading data of an older schema. For example, let's say I have serialized and written several instances of class Data to a file               public class Data{         private String text;         public Data(text){             this.text = text;         }     }      and later I read that stringified data back out and cast to (Data). But then say I change Data to look like this               public class Data{         private String name;         public Data(name){             this.name = name;         }     }      now that the property is named differently, when I read out data that was saved in the original schema, it will not easily cast to the new type. What are some solutions to version the data so that I can read out old data and cast it to a new type?
