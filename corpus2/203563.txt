I need to fairly assign 2 experts from `x` experts (`x` is rather small - less than 50) for every `n` applications, so that:   * each expert has the same number of applications (+-1);   * each pair of experts (2-combination of `x`) has the same number of applications (+-1); It is simple to generate all 2-combinations:               for (i=0; i<n; i++) {       for (j=i+1; j<n; j++) {         combinations.append(tuple(i,j));       }     }      But to assign experts fairly I need to assign a combination to an application i correct order, for example:               experts: 0 1 2 3 4          fair combinations:          counts          01234          01   11000     23   11110     04   21111     12   22211     34   22222     02   32322     13   33332     14   34333     03   44343     24   44444      I'm unable to come up with a good algorithm for this (the best I came up with is rather complicated and with `O(x4)` complexity). Could you help me?
