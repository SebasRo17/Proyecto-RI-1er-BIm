As I am reviewing a BSD license for an open source library to use it in my commercial product, I found this paragraph: > Redistribution and use in source and binary forms are permitted provided > that the above copyright notice and this paragraph are duplicated in all > such forms and that any documentation, advertising materials, and other > materials related to such distribution and use acknowledge that the software > was developed by the organization. Its clear that I have to mention the copyright notice, but as for the next paragraph: > The name of the organization may not be used to endorse or promote products > derived from this software without specific prior written permission. If I just put the copyright notice of the used library, is that considered as I am promoting my product by mentioning the library copyrights notice? Shall I seek a written permission? or I just need to add the copyright notice only?
