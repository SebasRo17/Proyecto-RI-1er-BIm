I want to start messing around with Genetic Algorithm's in my spare time. I've been thinking of some ways to incorporate them either into personal projects or work projects. I work in financial software - so a lot of risk analysis and things like that using derivative markets. Not sure how GA's would fit into that. Was curious to see if anyone had any cool ideas about how I could use GA's to cure some boredom and do some really cool stuff!
