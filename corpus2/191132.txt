Let's say I want to develop an image editing program similar to Photoshop. Is it likely that certain interface patterns and approaches are patented and I can get sued if I use them in my program as well? Do I need to take active care to avoid doing things the same way as competing software? How will I manage to make features still seem familiar to people switching from existing programs? And how much of a difference does it make if it's non profit?
