`ProteinData["SERPINA1", "MoleculePlot"]` gives the detailed `Graphics3D` plot below. I'd like to make many small copies of this object and place them in a single `Graphics3D` scene, but I'm running into performance problems because the molecule graphics-object is a pretty complicated mesh. Are there general methods of reducing the quality/detail of graphics objects like the one below that would allow me to place many of these in a single scene? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XlvG4.png)
