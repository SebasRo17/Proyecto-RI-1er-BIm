How do you style complex compound AND / OR if statements for maximum readability? How do you indent and where do you place the line breaks? My particular situation is something like the following. It's definitely better than smashing everything into one line, but still looks messy.               if (         (             x == y             && a != b             && p.isGood()              && (                 i + u == b                 || q >= a             )         )         || k.isSomething()         || m > n     ) {         doSomething();     }
