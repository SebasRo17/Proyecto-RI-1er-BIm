I just read this quote online: > XML is a very useful technology for moving data between different databases > or between databases and other programs. However, it is not itself a > database. Which is quoted from the book 'Effective XML: 50 Specific Ways to Improve Your XML'. I don't understand what you would bother moving data between databases in an XML format. Databases usually contain a lot of data, so wouldn't it be verbose to transform it into an XML format? Is there no way, to just serialize the database data into something less verbose, somehow, instead of bothering with conversions?
