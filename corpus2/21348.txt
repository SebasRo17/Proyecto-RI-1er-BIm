Please don't answer this with "Just trash `PlotLegends`" or anything like that as I have tried homebrew solutions. I keep running into problems which I can't debug as I'm not super familiar with _Mathematica_. However, to my question: If I have a `ListPlot` with say 6 lists, I can use `PlotLegends -> {x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6}` to label each individual one as `x_1, ..., x_6`. However, `x_1` and `x_2` (though different plots) correspond to the same data set (in the experiment I'm doing) and I have them labeled with alternating filled and empty markers (filled triangle/open triangle) and the same color. So what I want is x_1, x_2 with filled/empty triangle and line all colored blue   x_3, x_4 with filled/empty square and line all colored red   x_5, x_6 with filled/empty diamond and line all colored green That is -ftri-etri- (in blue) Set 1   -fsq-esq- (in red) Set 2   -fdi-edi- (in green) Set 3 Is there a way to make a legend that has a line with the filled AND empty marker on it, which I can label TOGETHER giving only 3 entries in the legend? If that makes sense? Sorry if that's confusing.
