Technically not my first, but my new client wants to enter into negotiations regarding the cost of a website. It's fairly straight-forward, it's a little bit more than a portfolio page, and I should be able to finish it without much complications. However, I don't know how to make an estimate to enter negotiations. One that will not scare the client away, and will ensure that I'm making the best out of it as well.
