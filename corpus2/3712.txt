I would like to run MUnit tests inside TestSuite constructs from the command line or a notebook interface without loading the Workbench GUI. I tried               TestRun["suite.mt"]      where suite.mt contains:               TestSuite[{"file1.mt","file2.mt"}]      and each of the fileX.mt contain standard `Test[...]` constructs. However, this does not run the tests; I get the output that 0 tests were run. `TestRun["file1.mt"]` works. I cannot find documentation for `TestRun`, so maybe it does not support this, but in that case, how do I run testsuite files without loading the Workbench GUI?
