I want to be able to place a text title centered just inside the bounding box generated by Manipulate yet above the `GraphicsGrid` and run boxes you see when executing the code. My stripped down code is               Manipulate[       GraphicsGrid[{{Graphics[{Rectangle[]}]}}, ImageSize -> {400, 400}],      {{run, 0}},      ControlPlacement -> Left]      Thank you
