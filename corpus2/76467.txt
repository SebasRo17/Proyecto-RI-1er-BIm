I've been trying to understand how my compensation stacks up against the competition. I understand that this can be a bit of a localized question, so I'll do my best to avoid local issues. There are a number of web sites that provide salary survey data about different jobs. I've been looking at the data on careerbuilder.com in particular. I would like to use this data to understand how much salary I would be wise to ask for in negotiation, but it seems impossible to interpret. Let me start with job titles. I have a background in mathematics and computer programming. I am currently doing database-driven web development using mostly SQL, .net, and Javascript. I do much more programming than I do web design. In my current position, I was told that I would be a "Web Developer". I was told that I would be junior to the "Application Developers", but senior to "Junior Developers". That was fine with me. After several months lapsed, I received (with no prior notice) a new nameplate for my cube that bore the title "Application Developer". The developers who had been previously called "Application Developers" are now called "Sr. Systems Analysts". As far as I know, these new nameplates did not accompany any actual organizational change or pay differences. However, when I go to the salary surveys on careerbuilder.com and enter in "computer programmer", "application developer", "web developer" and other seemingly similar titles, I get wildly divergent results. Even more divergent are the results on Glassdoor.com, which reports survey results from individual companies. Consider this example: ( http://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/net-salary-SRCH_KO0,3.htm ) that has differences of over 100% salary between different companies for the same title!
