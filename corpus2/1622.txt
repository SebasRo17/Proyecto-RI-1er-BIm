I am trying to render the solution of the following partial differential equation: $$ u = u(x,y)~;\quad \frac1{x^{2/3}}\partial_xu \+ x^3\partial_yu \+ \partial_y^2u \+ \partial_x^3u = 0 $$ However, the kernel seems to not produce anything. I checked documentation for different ways of inputting in the equation, but nothing helps. I even tried the sample problems directly from the documentation and those still had no explicit solution. I also quit the local kernel and repeated the process twice. I used something of the following:               eqn2 = D[u[x, y], {x, 3}] + D[u[x, y], {y, 2}] + x^3 D[u[x, y], y] +      1/x^(2/3) D[u[x, y], {x, 1}] == 0;          DSolve[eqn2, u, {x, y}]      Any ideas of what is going on?
