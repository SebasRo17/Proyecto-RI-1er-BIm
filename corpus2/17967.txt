data = RandomReal[NormalDistribution[0.5, 0.1], {10000, 2}];     DensityHistogram[data, PlotRange -> 1, Method -> {"DistributionAxes" -> "Histogram"}]      The problem I have is that the histogram on the axes is not aligned with the density plot because of the PlotRange. I tried using Mathematica 8 and 9. Can someone please help me fix this? ![Problem Graph](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vCf2B.png)
