When I worked in Microsoft on MSE antivirus, we had several stages of pre- release: Alpha, Beta, RC. The biggest difference between these stages were bug fixes. Each time we fixed more bugs, and usually updated some minor features. Apple works in the same way. Look here: http://www.techrepublic.com/article/pro-tip-how-to-create-a-bootable-usb- installer-for-os-x-yosemite/ They released a beta of Yosemite OS, but the beta is full of bugs. Why do these big companies work like this? Isn't it better to release a beta version that was tested very thoroughly but one that just doesn't provide all the features that the final version will provide?
