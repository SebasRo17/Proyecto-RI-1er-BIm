I've evaluated RedGate SQL Source Control tool (http://www.red- gate.com/products/sql-development/sql-source-control/), and I believe that Team Foundation Server 2010 offers a way to do this as well (as touched on here http://blog.discountasp.net/using-team-foundation-server-2010-source- control-from-sql-server-management-studio/). Are there alternatives, or is one of these considered the preferred/standard solution?
