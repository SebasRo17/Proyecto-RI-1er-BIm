I am currently working on a system that will generate product recommendations like those on Amazon: _"People who bought this also bought this.."_ **This is how I plan to do it** :   * Process the data using Apache Mahout and generate recommendations(data is stored in MySQL), currently item based only.   * Apply a clustering algorithm to make cluster of users and then apply the association rules subjective to each cluster. **My questions are:**   * Will Mahout provide me enough flexibility to tweak the existing algorithms according to my needs. If yes, how?    * Is there a better alternative like R?
