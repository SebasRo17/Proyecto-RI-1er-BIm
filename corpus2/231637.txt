My new boss has been working on this project for many years. I've only been here a few weeks, but I am not sure it's possible. He would like to design a system that is "100% data driven". So if we put in enough data, we can define and generate any application. I've managed to at least get him to concede some things like users, or apps should have predefined values, but he likes the concept of the structure of the system, the user interface and the logic all being stored as data. There are some demos of simple things and he's basically rediscovered some simple ideas of object oriented programming and your basic template systems, but I think overall that this goal might be actually impossible. I don't know how you can define logic using data without the system becoming so complex that you are doing actual programming anyway. I think theoretically it isn't because the thing that interprets the data ends up needing to become turing complete to describe the application so you've just shifted the problem one level higher to no net benefit. Is such a 100% Data Driven Application possible?
