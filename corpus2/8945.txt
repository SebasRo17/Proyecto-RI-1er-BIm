It seems that `DeleteCases` is not compatible with string patterns, at least directly (see, for example, this question). Is this true? If so, why is this the case? It seems that the earlier question did not really address this. For example, suppose that I have a list of strings and I want to delete all strings which contain the letter `"X"`:               DeleteCases[{"ab", "aXb"}, ___ ~~ "X" ~~ ___]      gives undesired output:               {"ab", "aXb"}      One workaround is               Select[{"ab", "aXb"}, ! StringMatchQ[#, ___ ~~ "X" ~~ ___] &]      which gives the correct output:               {"ab"}      But _why_ doesn't `DeleteCases[{"ab", "aXb"}, ___ ~~ "X" ~~ ___]` work?
