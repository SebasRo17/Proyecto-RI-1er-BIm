I am preparing a figure for an article, and I would like very much to be able to fill a curve, but not under it, but to the vertical axis, i.e. to the left. Due to the meaning of the data I present, I cannot exchange the axes. Here is a minimal example:               Plot[ArcCot[x], {x, 0, 1}, PlotRange -> {{0, 1.1}, {0.5, 2}}, AxesLabel -> {x, y}]      Can anyone think of a way of filling the curve to the`y` axis? I find no mention of this kind of filling in the standard documentation.
