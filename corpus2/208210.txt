Apologies if this is too broad a question(or wrong SE to ask on), but something I've been wondering for a while. I enjoy WPF a lot, and think I'm fairly competent at work with it, and developing for it, and considering trying to advance my career further in that direction (currently on web, would like to move more towards a desktop/wpf focus). But I've never seen a WPF front-end designer position job advert, (or a FED designer position with WPF facets), is this down to in the industry that WPF devs are expected to handle both design & implementation of the UI, alongside the behind-code. Only asking this, as I'm terrible at design and if it's a crucial part of being a WPF developer, then it's going to be a fairly large hurdle to overcome. That's not to say I can't work with a given design. I know it could be a company dependant thing, some requiring WPF devs to have both sides, some companies just requiring them to have the behind C#/VB skills, but would like to hear from current developers in the industry, what their experience is. Thanks
