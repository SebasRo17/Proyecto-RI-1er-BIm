I'm a mid-to-senior level SDET, and I currently have no managerial experience (although I hope to pick some up in about 5 years). At some point in the distant future (say, 10â€“15 years from now), I'd like to start my own tech startup. Due to a number of personal commitments, I can't really spend my free time planning for this, which is why it's more of a long-term goal, for when I have more time, flexibility, and financial stability. How does one build skills to be a successful software entrepreneur? What types of education programs should I be looking into?
