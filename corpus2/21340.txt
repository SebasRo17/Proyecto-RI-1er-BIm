I know how to get the 'resulting image' (y) from the application of a certain function (f) (here represented as the coefficients of a polynomial) over a certain interval (x):               x = Range[27000]/27001.;          f = {25.62, -38.43, 21.81}/9;          y = Map[f[[1]]*#^3 + f[[2]]*#^2 + f[[3]]*# &, x];          ListPlot[y]      How do i get the 'resulting images' from the application of several polynomials (represented as its coefficients) over a certain interval (x)? Considering the representation of those several polynomials to be something like:               polynomials = Map[     {9 + #[[1]] - #[[2]], -#[[1]], #[[2]]} &,     Flatten[Outer[                 List,                 {23.75, 28.02, 32.29, 36.56, 40.83, 45.1, 49.37, 53.64, 57.91, 62.18},                 {13.48, 15.9, 18.33, 20.75, 23.17, 25.6, 28.02, 30.44, 32.87, 35.29}                 ],             1]     ]/9;
