I want to use `Filling` for `ListPolarPlot` in such a way that the points in the list are joined to the origin with a line colored same as in the `Filling -> Axis` of `ListPlot`. I could do it up to a certain stage, but I couldn't set the color of the lines. Here is what I have done. Suppose that               pl = Table[{k, Sin[k]}, {k, 0, 10}]      is the point list. I can connect them to the origin in a tricky way by               Show[Table[ListPolarPlot[{{0, 0}, pl[[k]]}, Joined->True], {k,1,Length[pl]}],          ListPolarPlot[pl]]      but I can not set the color of the joining lines as the following code would do.               ListPlot[pl, Filling -> Axis]      I would be very glad if someone would tell me how to color the lines.
