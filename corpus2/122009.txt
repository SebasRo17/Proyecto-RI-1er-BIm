What is the name of the pattern in which individual contributors (programmers/designers) developed an artifact for the sole purpose is to serve as a diversion so that **_management can remove that feature in the final product_**? This is a folklore I heard from an ex-colleague who used to work at a large game development company. At that company, it is well known that middle management is pressurized to "give inputs" and "make changes" to the product otherwise they risk being seen as not contributing to the project. This situation have delayed many projects because of these superfluous "management inputs". In one project at the above company, the artists and developers created a supernumerary animated character that appears in every cutscene and sticks out like a sore thumb. They designed it in such a way that it can be easily removed before the game is shipped (this was when games were still sold in physical media and not a downloadable product). Obviously the management then voted to remove the animation. On the positive side, _management didn't introduced any unnecessary changes that would have delayed the project_ because they have shown that they provided constructive inputs to the product. This **_process pattern_** has a name among game programmers that work in corporates, but I forgot what was the actual name. I believe it's duck- _something_. Anybody can help pointing out the name and perhaps some rather credible reference to how the pattern develops?.
