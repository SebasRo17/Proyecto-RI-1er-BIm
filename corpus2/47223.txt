I am trying to solve a matrix equation, with the matrix being tridiagonal. The problem I am having is that a message keeps appearing that I don't have enough memory. Here is the code:               n = 10109;(*matrix dimension*)          a = SparseArray[{Band[{1, 1}] -> -2, Band[{1, 2}] -> 1,Band[{2, 1}] -> 1}, {n, n}](*the tridiagonal matrix*)          f[x_] := Piecewise[{{x + 1, x <= 0}, {-x + 1, x > 0}}](*initial condition, just for constructing the right-hand side vector*)          g = Table[f[i], {i, -1 + 2/(n + 1), 1 - 2/(n + 1), 2/(n + 1)}];(*the vector*)          u = LinearSolve[a, g];(*the solution I need*)      Actualy what I need is only               Norm[u,1]      and               u[5055].      Any suggestions would be helpful. Thank you in advance.
