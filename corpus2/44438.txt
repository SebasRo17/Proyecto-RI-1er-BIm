I would like to plot a continuous function with `Plot` with plot markers as if it were a `ListPlot` plot. Simple example: I have               f[x_]:=x     Plot[f[x],{x,0,10}]      but for external reasons I need the figure to look like that of               ListPlot[Table[{x,f[x]},{x,0,10}]]      It works well. But imagine now my `f[x]` function contains several functions:               f[x_]:={x,x^2,x^3}      Plotting with plot is the same:               Plot[f[x],{x,0,10}]      However, the conversion to a set of points with `Table` is now complicated. The question is: what would be the easiest way (the shortest code) to produce a plot marker plot for such `f[x]`? Can it be done directly with Plot without using ListPlot and Table ?
