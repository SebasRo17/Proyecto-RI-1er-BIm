I've been searching for the use of ColorFunction as an Option for ListPlot, but haven't found anything about it in the documentation. When trying the code               ListPlot[      RandomReal[5, {10}]      , ColorFunction -> Hue[#1, #2, 1] &      ]      I get the error message               ListPlot::nonopt: "Options expected (instead of ColorFunction->Hue[#1,#2,1]&) beyond position 3 in ListPlot[{2.14801,2.18933,<<6>>,3.48,0.566812},ColorFunction-><<1>>&]. An option must be a rule or a list of rules."      Is it possible, and if so, how, to use ColorFunction with ListPlot? What are the arguments of the function, then? Thanks for all help, as always!
