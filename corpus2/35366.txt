**Context** In cosmology, a fairly accurate model to describe the gravitational potential, $\psi(r)$ of dark matter halos is given by $\psi( r)=\log(1+r)/r$.               Plot[Log[1 + r]/r, {r, 0.01, 4}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rsPBK.png) In this context it is of interest to find the radius at which the potential is equal to some energy. Now _Mathematica_ seems happy with solving this implicit equation:               r1 = Solve[y == Log[1 + r]/r, r][[1]]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xn0ME.png) The answer involves `ProductLog`. I can also be done numerically as:               r2[e_] := NSolve[e == Log[1 + r]/r, r][[1]]          r /. r2[1/2]          (* ~ 2.5 *)      **Question** But, then why does               r /. r1 /. y -> 1/2      return $0$? Why does the plot below returns complete non-sense?               Plot[r /. r1 // Evaluate, {y, 0, 1}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PLS6S.png) Finally, why do these two plots succeed and fail respectively?               Table[{e, r /. r2[e]}, {e, 1/10, 1 - 1/10, 1/30}] //        Quiet // ListLinePlot      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Epz5O.png)                Table[{e, r /. r2[e]}, {e, 1/10, 1 - 1/10, 1/50}]//Quiet // ListLinePlot      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/N0R4F.png)
