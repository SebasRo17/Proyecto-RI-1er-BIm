This is a very simple one-dimensional heat-conduct equation, the only special part of it is the piecewise initial condition:                   b = NDSolve[{D[tes[t, x], t] == D[tes[t, x], x, x] + Exp[-1/(tes[t, x])],                       tes[t, 0] == 1, tes[t, 1] == 1,                       tes[0, x] == Piecewise[{{-100 (x - 0.1)^2 + 2, 0 <= x <= 0.1},                                              {2, 0.1 <= x <= 0.9},                                              {-100 (x - 0.9)^2 + 2, 0.9 <= x <= 1}}]},                      {tes[t, x]}, {t, 0, 100}, {x, 0, 1}]      If you run the code, you will get this warning message: > NDSolve::mxsst: Using maximum number of grid points 10000 allowed by the > MaxPoints or MinStepSize options for independent variable x Why does this message come out? I read the help but I don't think my initial condition has that kind of fault: it's piecewise but smooth, right? * * * I'd like to add another sample here since its behavior makes a interesting contrast to the sample above:               c = NDSolve[{D[tes[t, x], t] == D[tes[t, x], x, x] + Exp[-1/(tes[t, x])],                  tes[t, 0] == 1, tes[t, 1] == 1,                   tes[0, x] == Piecewise[{{-Exp[-1000 x] + 2, 0 <= x <= 0.1},                                          {2, 0.1 <= x <= 0.9},                                           {-Exp[-1000 (1 - x)] + 2, 0.9 <= x <= 1}}]},                 {tes[t, x]}, {t, 0, 100}, {x, 0, 1}]      This example choose `Exp` as the transition between initial condition and boundary conditions, in fact this initial condition is not even continous at `x=0.1` and `x=0.9` in the view of math, and I think the change of `Exp` is more drastic than the polynomial function, but it gets no warning message. Well, I should say, after all this time (notice the time I posted this question) I've already treat this as some kind of bug, but I still expect an in-depth explain for it.
