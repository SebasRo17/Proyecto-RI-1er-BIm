I used to get PSD files and generate HTML prototypes from them which are supposed to be exact replica of these PSDs. The process I follow is simplest one generate **plain HTML pages** for each PSD.      But I have seen some of the prototypes being generated from **server-side includes** (like PHP pages). Benefit of using server side includes is that you don't have to repeat header, footers and side panels for each page. But in this case, anyone who want to run pages needs to setup the server and then execute these pages on server. I want to know, what are some recommended practices to generate prototypes? Or what are the steps followed generally in case of big projects?
