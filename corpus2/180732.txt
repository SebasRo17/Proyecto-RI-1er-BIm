Do NSURLConnection service objects and XML/JSON parser objects fall within the controller layer or the model layer? Why? Is it OK to have business logic in the controller? Or should it be in the model layer only? Can the model layer be represented by NSArray/NSDictionary objects or should it be strictly structured with custom objects to comply with the MVC pattern, given that my app doesn't require persistent storage.
