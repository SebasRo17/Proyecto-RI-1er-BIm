Today I found a GPLed project on SourceForge whose executables are spreading a virus. This fact has been pointed out several times in reviews of the project and the infected executable is still available for download. Apparently, older executables are not infected, so the project itself does not seem to be made with malicious purpose in mind. There is no preferred way to contact developers and forums for the project are dead. What should I do?
