I develop an open source Android application, which is licensed under GPL and freely available on Github.   It is currently under heavy development, therefore it isn't published in the Play Store yet.      What can I do, if someone decides to publish it in the Play Store,   * without modifying the code (just build it from my repo and upload it, same package name).   * with modifying the source code and publishing it on Github under same license.   * and modify the code but don't publish the code under the same license.
