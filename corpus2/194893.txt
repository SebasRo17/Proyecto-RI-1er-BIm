There seems to be two major ways to set up a web server backend. You can use a LAMP stack, with the server-side code in something like PHP or Python (or Ruby or JavaScript, which don't start with a P.) These scripting languages tend to be dynamically typed, with all of the disadvantages in performance, correctness and maintainabilty that dynamically typed languages bring, but it's easy to update the server because all the page generation logic is stored in external scripts. The other major architecture style in wide use is ASP.NET, where the page generation logic is written in compiled code. This tends to use statically typed languages, so you get code that's had the benefit of a compiler, but all of the page generation logic is compiled into the server, which means if you need to change something, you have to take the server down and replace it with a new build. So that makes me wonder. Are there any server-side scripting languages that use static typing, for the best of both worlds?
