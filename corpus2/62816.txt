I am currently trying to organize a small workshop for several people to generate interest in android. I intend to conduct a hands-on workshop, taking everyone through various components and features by building an app. One way I can think to do this is to write an app before hand, share it with everyone and then try to develop in group the same code again, understanding the nuances. However, I am not sure how well that'll work out. I am curious to hear other methodologies or ideas which will help me make this workshop fruitful and engaging for everyone. I am guessing some of you have experience with similar stuff, can you please suggest what would be a good way to go about it? PS - Using possibly irrelevant tags, as my reputation won't allow me to create new ones.
