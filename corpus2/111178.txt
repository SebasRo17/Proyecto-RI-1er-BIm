My project manager, when providing requirements for specific tasks, does not care about the implementation details. Although he has a programming background and has some knowledge of the MVC framework, he does not consider the perspective of the developer. For example, I was given a task to create a simple form in ASP.NET MVC. This form should be pluggable - that is, the customer should choose which fields do or do not exist and which fields are required. If this were a simple form with validation, I would easily be able to implement it using ASP.NET validations. However, the problem is not simple and requires design and architecture first. The time that I have to implement the solution, which is not well understood, is very restricted. Not having sufficient time will not let me come upwith a solution that meets the requirements, but also benefits myself and any future developers. What should I do in this situation? Do you feel that given requirements in the example can be expected from a single developer?
