I'm interested in transitioning my development environment onto the cloud. I currently use VirtualBox with Vagrant to manage separate virtual machines for each individual project. What would be the optimal setup for hosting these virtual machines in the cloud? Given than I have nearly a dozen VMs, setting up separate EC2 instance for each one is not economical. A cheaper option might be to snag a low-end VPS from one of the many cheap VPS providers out there. The downside, aside from reliability, is that I don't need all my VMs available to me at all times. For example, VMs that I use as my staging environments only need to be on a few times a week at best. As an alternative, I've thought about running VirtualBox and Vagrant on a powerful box with enough memory to support multiple machines running simultaneously. Is this a smart setup, or are there caveats I have not considered? As a side note to the aforementioned option, is there an alternative to VirtualBox that would be a wiser choice?
