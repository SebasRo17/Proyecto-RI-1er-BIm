So here recently, i've been using google to look up information for basically random programming things (i was just hired on a month or so ago). So here recently I was actually looking up some information about RAW_SOCKETS (but thats beside the point) Anyways some of the tutorials sites/explaining how to use them and explaining the protocol sites are actually blocked. (and our manager sent out an email saying that if u run into a site just to email her just in case). Now obviously...w/e sys admins probably see these 'blocked' sites in their reports. But should I be worried? I mean....I literally am not trying to be devious Im just trying to learn stuff. I guess programming websites are sometimes labeled as "hacking". sometimes blogs get labeled like that, but alot of the time blogs have USEFUL information. This apparently happens alot of my other co- workers and they don't even bother emailing our manager.....but should I be worried? Or has this happened to you guys before?
