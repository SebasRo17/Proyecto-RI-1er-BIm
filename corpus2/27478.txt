I want to choose three points $A$, $B$, $C$ has integer coordinates on the circle $$(x+2)^2 + (y+1)^2 = 25$$ so that the triangle is not a right triangle. But I can not. I tried               ClearAll[a, b, r];     a = -2;     b = -1;     r = 5;     Solve[{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 == r^2, x != a, y != b}, {x, y}, Integers]
