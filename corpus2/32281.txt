I'm trying to solve a simple system of differential equations.               dp = (D[#1, #2] + #2 #1) &;     dn = (D[#1, #2] - #2 #1) &;     DSolve[{dp[f1[x], x] == a f2[x], dn[f2[x], x] == b f1[x]}, {f1, f2},     x]      using DSolve. Unfortunately, Mathematica is not able to handle this task. Is there a way to force Mathematica to print a result? Of course, it's a simple problem one could do by hand but that's not the point:-).
