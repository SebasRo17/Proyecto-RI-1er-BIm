Suppose I have an array               p = {a,b,c,d}      and a function f that takes a variable number of arguments. I want to evaluate               f[a,b,c,d]      It won't do to type               f[p]      because this returns the array `{f[a],f[b],f[c],f[d]}` which is not at all the right thing. How do I get f to accept the elements of p (as opposed to p itself) as arguments? Edited to add: Per a request in comments, here is a concrete example. Suppose p={2,3,4}. I would like an expression that returns Multinomial[2,3,4], which is to say 1260. It doesn't work to type Multinomial[p], because this gives {Multinomial[2],Multinomial[3],Multinomial[4]}={1,1,1}, which is not at all the same as 1260.
