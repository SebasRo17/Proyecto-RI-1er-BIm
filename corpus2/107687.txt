I've been messing around with functional programming languages for a few years, and I keep encountering this phrase. For example, it is a chapter of "The Little Schemer, which certainly predates the blog by this name. (No, the chapter doesn't help answer my question.) I understand what lambda means, the idea of an anonymous function is both simple and powerful, but I fail to understand what "the ultimate" means in this context. Places that I've seen this phrase:   1. The title of chapter 8 of The Little Schemer   2. A blog: http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/   3. A series of "Lambda the ultimate X" papers: http://library.readscheme.org/page1.html I feel like I'm missing a reference here, can anyone help?
