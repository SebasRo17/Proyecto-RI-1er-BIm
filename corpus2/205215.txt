How do I go about designing this particular application example below? For example: I have client, who would like to embed my data feed into this GUI interface. The data is made of names and and descriptions fields. If a user comes along and searches a particular name of a products using the client's interface, then the name parameter will be passed down my data feed, and it will return a search for that query name, back to the clients interface, from my database. I assume the my real-time data feed will be constructed as an API service. What requirements would I need to gather from the client's system interface? Would I need to ask them for the list of parameters they require to query through my data feed?
