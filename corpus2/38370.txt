**Update: Try to reproduce this behaviour with`CellGrouping` set to manual**. To do that:   * either evaluate `SetOptions[$FrontEnd, CellGrouping -> Manual]`,   * or hit `CTRL`+`SHIFT`+`O` to bring up the **Option Inspector** window, **Lookup** (among **Global preferences** ) the option `CellGrouping` and set it to `Manual`.  Please test whether the phenomen is reproducible for you with the changed setting. You can reset cell grouping to its default behaviour by:               SetOptions[$FrontEnd, CellGrouping -> Automatic]      * * * Strangest bug ever. Copy the following piece of code to the same notebook **two times** , below each other, as two identical cells. Be sure to run a fresh kernel.               DynamicModule[{x}, Print[1]; Dynamic@x, Initialization :> Print[2]]      Now evaluate the **second cell**. Fine, it returns and prints stuff. ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/a3nBf.png) And now, without quitting the kernel, **evaluate the first cell**. It crashes _Mathematica_. Every time, and only when the first cell is evaluated. If (after a restart) I only evaluate the first cell, _Mathematica_ crashes again. **How come that the outcome of evaluating two identical cells depends on whether the cell is the last one or not?** Furthermore, this one causes a crash on its own:               DynamicModule[{x}, Dynamic@x, Initialization :> Print[2]]      * * * _Mathematica_ 9.0.1.0 Windows 7 (64-bit), no packages, problem persists after full reboot, suggestion bar is turned off.
