I have a custom file type **.mft** which is basically a zip that has video inside (mpg,mp4,etc) that is encrypted/protected. My ideia is to create a custom video player which will read those **.mft** files, for a private group of users (users provide user and password), and the custom player will not allow to save the video, so that no one can re-share it, and can only view it. I saw that VLC has this library http://vlcdotnet.codeplex.com/releases/view/121099, so my player would use it. My question is : Is it really possible to block users from not saving the video? I don't think so, because there are several software to record desktop activity. What do you think?
