Let there be two lists that have sublists:               a[] = {{1, 2}, {1, 2, 3}, {2, 3, 4, 4}, {3, 4, 4, 5}}      and               b[] = { {1, 2}, {4, 5, 6}}      I want to remove all those sublists in a[] that has elements contained in a sublist of b[]. So after removal I am expecting               a[] = {{2, 3, 4, 4}, {3, 4, 4, 5}}.      I am not able to reach specific elements in a sublist. I can use a For loop for this, but it will slow down my program, so I want suggestions on a better _Mathematica_ way of manipulating lists. ### Edit Sorry I guess my example was less than clear about what I am asking for. I want that any sublist in `a[]` that has all elements of any sublist from `b[]` shall be removed.
