could you please help me understand this ternary operator               public static <E> void replace(List<E> list, E val, E newVal) {         for (ListIterator<E> it = list.listIterator(); it.hasNext(); )             if (val == null ? it.next() == null : val.equals(it.next()))                 it.set(newVal);     }      i thought the part after ? is just a regular statement, so how is == being used here?
