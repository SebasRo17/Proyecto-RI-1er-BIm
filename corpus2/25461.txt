I really don't know why nobody's thought of this so far, but recruitment should be the other way round. Engineers should have some sort of a common platform where they register skills or domains they are interested in, demonstrate their capabilities and companies should take it up from there. I think this is way more effective since if you are paid well to do work that you love doing, you will generally make a fine job out of it. Does anybody know of some recruitment platform like this?
