I am currently developing a hosted solution in ASP.NET using MVC3 and Entity Framework. This product will then be made available to a number of clients as a hosted solution. As the data stored by each client will be critical to their business, we anticipate that many of them will insist that the data is stored in an encrypted form in the database. We are therefore designing the system with this in mind. Are there any recommended procedures for doing this? How would one go about encrypting the clients data in such a way that even us with root access to the database cannot possibly access their data? I believe there is no built in support in EF for encrypted data, is this true? And if so, how would one encrypt/decrypt the data?
