I'm trying to implement an algorithm of Jenkinson and Pollicott to calculate the Hausdorff dimension of a Julia set for the map $f_c : z\mapsto z^2 + c$. It's described on page 40 of their paper, _Calculating Hausdorff Dimension of Julia Sets and Kleinian Limit Sets_. I can't seem to get the part about finding the periodic points with period $n$ to work. The idea is to partition the line from $0$ to $c$ through the complex numbers and use Newton's method on each $c_i$ using the solution from one as the initial guess to the next. For $c=0$ we know the solution because they are roots of unity. We also take another precaution: to avoid the sensitivity to initial conditions that's prevalent in Newton's method, we find the roots of $F_{c,n} - I$ instead of finding the roots of $f^n_c - \operatorname{id}$, where $$F_{c,n}(z) = \langle f_c(z_n),f_c(z_1),\dots,f_c(z_{n-1})\rangle$$ I threw this together:               partitionSize = 10;     f[z_, c_] := z^2 + c;     fDim[z_, c_] := f[#, c] & /@ RotateLeft[z, -1];     findPeriodN[N_, c_] :=        Nest[{FindRoot[fDim[z, #[[1]]] - z, {z, #[[2]]}] &, #[[2]] +            c/partitionSize &}, {NestList[#^2 &, (-1)^(1/(2 N - 1)), N], 0},         partitionSize];     findPeriodN[3, 0.25];      And it doesn't work at all. Does anybody know a simple way to do this, or some other implementation that does the same thing?
