I'm trying to parse equations like the ones below, which only have two values or the square root of a certain value, from a text file:               100+100          -100-100          -(100)+(-100)          sqrt(100)      by the minus signs, parentheses and the operator symbol in the middle and the square root, and I have no idea how to start off... I've got the file part done and the simple calculation parts except that I couldnt get my program to solve the equations in the above.               #include <stdio.h>     #include <string.h>     #include <stdlib.h>     #include <math.h>          main(){         FILE *fp;         char buff[255], sym,sym2,del1,del2,del3,del4;         double num1, num2;         int ret;         fp = fopen("input.txt","r");              while(fgets(buff,sizeof(buff),fp)!=NULL){             char *tok = buff;             sscanf(tok,"%lf%c%lf",&num1,&sym,&num2);                  switch(sym){                 case '+': printf("%lf\n", num1+num2);                         break;                 case '-': printf("%lf\n", num1-num2);                         break;                 case '*': printf("%lf\n", num1*num2);                         break;                 case '/': printf("%lf\n", num1/num2);                         break;                 default: printf("The input value is not correct\n");                         break;             }         }         fclose(fp);     }      That is what I have written for the other basic operations without parentheses and the minus sign for the second value and it works great for the simple ones. I'm using a switch statement to calculate the add, sub, mul and div operations but I'm not sure how to properly use the `sscanf` function (if I am not using it properly) or if there is another way, such as using a function like `strtok` to properly parse the parentheses and the minus signs. Any kind help?
