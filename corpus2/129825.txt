I recall a methodology that emphasized making functions short and numerous. It said that if a section of code can be separated at all, it should be, even if the resultant functions are only used once. Some argue that it's DRY taken too far, and that this kind of obsessive refactoring is counterproductive. Does anyone know what it could be called? I don't think it actually had _refactoring_ in the name.
