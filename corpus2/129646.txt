I am looking to implement membership card functionality inside a mobile application for a local coffee shop. The idea is to make payments at the point of sale, and deduct the amount from the client's prepaid account. I was looking into NFC functionality, but only a few devices support them (and most are not available in Montreal yet). The other idea is to use the Bump API, which would work great for iOS and Android. The last resort would be to use Bluetooth somehow. Any thoughts on any of these approaches, or for those who have tried this, any pros and cons for these ideas.
