If this is not the right place to ask this question please inform where it would belong, to change it... I have a doubt for the correct word or concept in english language [not my native], about the relationship of > language to framework for example i work with > objective C, with the cocoa touch frame work || python with the django frame > work My comparison is between natural languages and formal languages, So would be in a natural language > english and the frame work a [computer, it]jargon? Does this make sense? Or what other concept would be the relationship between natural language - framework?
