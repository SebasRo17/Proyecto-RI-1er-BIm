I just got hired for my first programming job! I am 25 and have been using Java academically for 6 years. Now that I have been hired I am nervous that my skills will not be what the employer expects. I am afraid I will be assigned to a project and have to ask lots of questions that my coworkers will feel are amateur. Is this a rational fear? What were your first programming job experiences? What should I expect? What advice could you give me? Thanks.
