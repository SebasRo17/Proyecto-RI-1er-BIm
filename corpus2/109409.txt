I have notes about various methods of prototyping, and I found several definitions on the Internet, but I would like to confirm what I learned. I understand that **throwaway prototyping** is developed from an outline of a specification, an various prototypes are delivered and modified until the client is satisfied with its functionality. On the other and, **evolutionary prototypes** are built from basic requirements gathered from end-users. An initial prototype is presented to the users and evaluated. The prototype is modified based on the feedback until the client is satisfied. Is this correct? Are there better definitions of throwaway and evolutionary prototyping?
