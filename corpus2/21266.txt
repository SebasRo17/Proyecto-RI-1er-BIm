This is the code I have in my mathematica notebook. I want to find the eigenvalues of the matrix I created called Hmatrix as defined below. However when I type Eigenvalues[Hmatrix] I get the Hmatrix back with an extra set of brackets preceded by "Eigenvalues" again. Essentially, I am not getting the eigenvalues of this matrix and I wish to know what sort of syntax I have to use to find the eigenvalues of my Hmatrix.               ϵs = -13.6;     ϵso = -29.1;     ϵp = -14.1;     ssσ = -7.20;     spσ = 9.46;          θ = (π - β/2);          Hmatrix :=       MatrixForm[{{ϵs, 0, ssσ,          Cos[θ]*spσ, -Sin[θ]*spσ,      0}, {0, ϵs,      ssσ, -Cos[θ]*spσ, -Sin[θ]*spσ,      0}, {ssσ, ssσ, ϵso, 0, 0,      0}, {Cos[θ]*spσ, Cos[θ]*spσ,      0, ϵp, 0,      0}, {-Sin[θ]*spσ, -Sin[θ]*spσ, 0,      0, ϵp, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ϵp}}]
