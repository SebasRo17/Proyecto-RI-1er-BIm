How can I extract coordinates from a list density plot. Example plot of interest: ![1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/VAcSs.png) I need to place two points on either side of the center white circle and calculate the distance between them. My idea was to use two locators that gives their dynamic coordinates and connect a straight line between them. And calculate the different between them and output it to the user. How can I do this with? So far the only thing I figured out is to use a locators as a line to give me dynamic position.               Module[{v1 = {0, 0}, v2 = {2, 0}},       Graphics[{Locator[Dynamic[v1]], Line[{Dynamic[v1], Dynamic[v2]}],         Locator[Dynamic[v2]]}, PlotRange -> 3, Frame -> True]]      Screenshot of output: ![2](http://i.imgur.com/Ql0xoeF.png)
