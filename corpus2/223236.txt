I am developing an Android app in which I have to add chat functionality. Also, I have to save the chat history. I will accomplish this task using SQlite. But, I am not sure whether should I consider using an ORM like GreenDAO or ORMLite or I should use traditional way of persisting data in SQLite. Actually, I am not clear when should go for using an ORM and how do I get benefit from it.
