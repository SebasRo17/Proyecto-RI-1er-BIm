I want to understand the pros and cons in generating dynamic web application controls. The idea is to generate all the controls dynamically based on the database procedure output and populate the controls to a say a grid structure / independent controls. I know that creating user controls and populating to layout is one option. Say, if we don't know what is the structure of controls the procedure is going to generate based on complex logic; what all should be considered in generating a layout structure? Is what I am thinking of is not logical in web application sense? Do I need to tackle the issue in a top down approach than a bottom up approach?
