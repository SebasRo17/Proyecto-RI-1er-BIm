I was told that atomic operations are a dynamic language feature. I was too afraid to ask in that context what this actually means because I didn't want my coworkers to think I'm stupid. But I actually don't really understand this statement. My understanding of the term "atomic operations" is any operation that is either wholly executed or wholly not executed; you will definitely never be halfway through the operation when the thread context switches. What does this have to do with dynamic vs static typing?
