Question: Is there any standard model or industry defacto implementation for modeling and implementing Access Control in (i.e.) a Document Management System? Note: I studied a bit the security mechanism of Windows (which I do not want to use), and I saw Users and Groups and Policies. But I can't understand: 1 - How a single policy object can contain all information about allowed/denied actions on a subject for all users and groups, at a specific moment of time. 2 - How multiple policies on a specific subject, merge into one to provide least possible access. 3 - What is the mechanism (data structures, database, caching, implementation) of hierarchical resources like folders? Those king of queries are usually slow.
