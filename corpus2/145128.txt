I am an programmer with great eyesight who stares at multiple computer screens 8-10 hours a day, usually in deep concentration. A day would not go by that I my eyes did not burn and have redness in them. I knew it was from the daily exposure to lcd monitors that caused the issues because on the weekends I would not have the same experience. Does any one try computer glasses? Is that work?
