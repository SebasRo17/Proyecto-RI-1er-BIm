I have been writing code so far in conventional text editors that come with the OS so far or use an IDE in some cases. I know there are some advanced text editors like `Emacs` and `Vim` available solely for the purpose of coders. How important are they really? Should a programmer dealing with `PHP`, `Python` etc. learn these editors? What are the advantages that they provide over conventional editors like `Notepad++`, `Scribes` etc.?
