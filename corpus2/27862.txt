In our local city in the UK, there are as far as I am aware no developer conferences. I am confident that our region has many professional developers as well as many graduating students whom who really benefit from a conference. I would like to ask the following questions:   * What steps or advice would one take if the task was given to set up a local developers conference?   * What would the costing look like? (excluding building/hosting of website(s))   * How would one build interest and promote this?   * How would I approach, Local Companies & Universities to collaborate with them? I'm not just aiming this question to users who may have experience in setting up such conferences (but are highly welcome). Rather how would you attack this if you was tasked with this?
