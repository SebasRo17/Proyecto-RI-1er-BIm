What determines how a specific cell-style influences grouping of cells? For example `"Text"` following `"Subtitle"` is grouped but not following `"Text"`               nbtitle = CreateDocument[];     NotebookWrite[nbtitle, Cell["subtitle", "Subtitle"]]     NotebookWrite[nbtitle, Cell["this text gets grouped", "Text"]]          nbtext = CreateDocument[];     NotebookWrite[nbtext, Cell["some text", "Text"]];     NotebookWrite[nbtext, Cell["this text is not grouped", "Text"]];      ![title](http://i.stack.imgur.com/j9Rid.png) * * * ![text](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Orxmu.png) All I can find in the documentation is: > Within a given notebook, there is always a collection of styles that can be > used to determine the appearance and behavior of cells. Typically the styles > are named so as to reflect what role cells which have them will play in the > notebook.
