I've read many times on the web that if your language doesn't support some concept, for example, object orientation, or maybe function calls, and it's considered a good practice in this other context, you should do it. The only problem I can see now is that other programmers may find your code too different than the usual, making it hard for them to program. What other problems do you think may arise from this?
