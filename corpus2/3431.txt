Using Mark McClure's GPXToGoogleMap results in a HTML and Javascript code which can be viewed by any browser. Is it possible to load this map into the notebook, which obviously means for example that               <script src="http://maps.google.com/maps?file=api&amp;v=2.s&amp;key="         type="text/javascript">     </script>     <script src="/Users/meinmacbookpro/Desktop/Messprojekte/gps.js"          type="text/javascript">     </script>      should be implemented somehow into the Mathematica code?
