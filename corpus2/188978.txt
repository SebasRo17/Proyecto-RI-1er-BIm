If I am taking data from a website, for example status updates from Facebook and showing them on my website. What possible damage can be caused if I am not taking into account that the code written as status update would execute on my website? For example, Mr. Simon has putted his status update,               "<p style="color:red;">I love to code</p>"      Now, when I display this on my website, it transforms into the text **I love to code** written in red.
