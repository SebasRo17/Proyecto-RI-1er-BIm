When we call QApplication::exec() at the end of our main() function, the application enters Qt's event loop. Conceptually, the event loop looks like this:                  while (!exit_was_called) {         while (!posted_event_queue_is_empty) {             process_next_posted_event();         }         while (!spontaneous_event_queue_is_empty) {             process_next_spontaneous_event();         }         while (!posted_event_queue_is_empty) {             process_next_posted_event();         }     }      First, the event loop processes any posted events until the queue is empty. Then, it processes the spontaneous events until there are none left. Finally, it processes any posted events that were generated during the processing of the spontaneous events. So A single thread (main() thread in Single threaded GUI application) can not handle program as well as Event loop(With Event Queue functionality). Is there any threads other than main created for handling Events in QT?
