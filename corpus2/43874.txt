I've been developing **desktop applications** for about 4 years, using .NET, C++, C, and a little of Python. I've covered lots of topics while developing my applications, and even web technologies (cookies, GET/POST methods, when programming some scrapers/crawlers). I've been always waiting to start developing websites, preferably using **PHP** \+ **MySQL** , although other advises will be welcomed to make this question more useful and generic for others. I know I could use a **CMS** instead of starting from scratch, but sometimes I don't need an entire CMS to do minor things... **What steps should I follow to create a website?** Let's suppose I have a web designer. First of all, the designer designs the entire website (CSS, etc) and then I do the programming stuffs, like loading dynamically things from databases, doing some client-side stuffs with javascript, etc? Or how is the best way to do it? **Edit** :   I'm not looking for tools/frameworks/languages suggestions. What I want to know is how a team (or a developer with a designer) starts creating a website. The **steps** they do, what tasks they do first, how they integrate the work, etc. An example of an answer could be: 1) Design the entire website with good CSS practices, using containers instead of tables in some cases, etc. 2) Use that design and develop the logic or the functionalities of the website. Of course, that's just an example. I'm looking for a good way to approach it, because I've been wanting to start on it but don't really know how exactly to organize the job :/
