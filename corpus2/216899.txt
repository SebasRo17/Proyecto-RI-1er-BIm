In Python we have `yield` which is very similar to that one which is proposed in ES6 (in fact, pythonic co-routines were the main source of inspiration for implementing co-routines in I wonder what are the reasons for choosing a separate `function* ()` syntax for generators compared to just defining "regular" functions with yeilds - just like in python by the way? I'm talking strictly of technical issues and peculiarities. Why it had been decided that a separate form will be more appropriate?
