I am a junior software developer and I have been working for a company less than a year. While I always thought being a software developer means to develop software and CODE something, my tasks are more in administration type of work, such as setting up Jenkins, SQL Replication and etc. Are these type of jobs included in a Developer role, or a developer only develops software? Should I be talking to my manager about this? Is this a common way for companies to evaluate "developing" skills?
