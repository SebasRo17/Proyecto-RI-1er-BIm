Go and D provide garbage collection, and yet they claim to be system programming languages. What degree of low-level programming can be achieved with languages having garbage collection? For low-level programming, I mean close to the hardware or being able to:   1. Runs directly in limited memory, with no latency, and performs well. An example would be operating system kernels.    2. It runs on a software base, but still has to perform well. An example would be system utilities.
