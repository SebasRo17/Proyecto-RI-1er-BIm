I have some perl code that uses pack and unpack to transform the data in a way that I don't understand.               $unpacked_data = pack('b*', join('', unpack('(b7)*', $packed_data)))      Where $packed_data = a Byte Array of say, 2341 bytes, and with the above perl statement, unpacks to 2048 bytes of data. Can someone explain this statement to me in terms of C? So far, I know this:   * b = A bit string (ascending bit order inside each byte, like vec()).   * If the repeat count is * , the offset is relative to the start of the packed string.
