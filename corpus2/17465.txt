I need some tools to detect the fundamental frequency and pitch of a sound. I Googled for "pitch detect" and found some .nb files that do these tasks, but all the files are in _Mathematica_ 3.0 format. I downloaded and installed the Signal Processing package, but this did not help, because these files use some obsolete functions like `DiscreteWindow`, `ContinuousPiecewiseData`, etc. I also tested the Signals and Systems toolbox but for the same reason there was no output in most cases. Are there any newer replacements of these functions or some way to find their definitions in some old packages?
