I have a program using `Manipulate`. The program given certain values will compute some values. I want these values to appear in a 3D list plot but the problem I am facing is that when the user changes the parameter the previous plot will disappear. How can I keep the previous points plotted even after the user changes the values of x or y with the Manipulators? I want the user to see all the points. Here is an example:               Manipulate[ListPointPlot3D[{{0, 0, 0}, {x + y, x, y/2}}],        {x,  0, 10},        {y, 0, 5}]      I want the plot to show all the points where the user changes x and y not just the latest.
