Mathematica generates an expression sometimes using `\\[Formal]` symbols. This is causing a problem with the `TeXForm` code generated as Latex is not able to process it. **To clarify** The generated `TeXForm` should not include `unicode`. The problem is that these are causing problem. So the solution should be such that, the result of applying `TeXForm` to the expression, should not produce unicode. Is there a way to make these expressions use normal symbols (normal `x` and `y`) so that I can generate Latex code from them that will work in my latex document                f = DifferentialRoot[Function[{y, x}, {y''[x] + y[x] == 0, y[0] == 0, y'[0] == 1}]]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/X3YrK.png) If I do `TeXForm[f]` on the above, the latex code generated is not valid with texlive. I just need the expression `f` not to contain those dots above and below the symbols. Just normal symbols. One way is to use               f = DifferentialRoot[Function[{y, x}, {y''[x] + y[x] == 0, y[0] == 0, y'[0] == 1}]] // OutputForm      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OY6bk.png) which Latex can handle after `TeXForm` is applied to the above. But it will be nice to have `x` and `y` there instead.
