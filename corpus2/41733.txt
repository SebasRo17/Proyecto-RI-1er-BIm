I'm not sure, if this belongs more to the signal processing forum or if I can post it in here, but I want to solve it via mathematica and it's some kind of image-processing I guess. I have a noisy picture with a circle in it: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/POS2E.jpg) Now I want to detect the circle, by using so called invariance Kernels like a Fourier-Mellin transform. In short, I want to replicate what the authors of this paper (see Section 4) did in mathematica. So what they did, was using Fourier-Mellin transform to detect a noisy image with a circle in it. I have some troubles grasping the mathematics behind it and I hope someone could help me out in understanding and implementing it in a mathematica code.
