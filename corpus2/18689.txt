What rule can you think of to replace the first line by the second? ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9do96.png) ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gCt1h.png) I have a bunch of expression like these, which I would like to simplify. All dependent cross terms must be written in the same order, using $\epsilon^{i j} A_i \times B_j = \epsilon^{i j} B_i \times A_j $. The other expressions look like this, but there are a few differences:   * The names of the fields in the crossproduct differ; e.g. $e_{2 i}$ and $\omega_{2 i}$ instead of $e_{1 i}$ and $e_{2 i}$   * The sum can contain more terms. In particular it can contain more cross products   * Terms that are dependent may not appear right after each other in the sum Which rule would cover all such expressions? This is the input for the first line.               \[Epsilon]^ij*((\[Sigma]*Cross[Subscript[Subscript[e, 1], i], Subscript[Subscript[\[Omega], 1], j]]*Subscript[M, 1])/4 + (\[Sigma]*Cross[Subscript[Subscript[\[Omega], 1], i], Subscript[Subscript[e, 1], j]]*Subscript[M, 1])/4)
