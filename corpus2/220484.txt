I have multiple regexes matching an input in greedy-first mode. All regexes are already compiled and I don't see what I can do more to speed-up things. I mean using tools coming with .Net framework. Since I don't do any replace, or capturing, I wonder if it makes sense to built my own regex matching -- in result I would execute matching only once (per multi-regex) instead of multi matching (per each single regex). Am I thinking too far? Is there other way to speed it up?
