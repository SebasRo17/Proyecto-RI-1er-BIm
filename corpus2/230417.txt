I have decided to work as a freelancer. I have developed a software and have successfully given the presentation demo. The client liked it and has agreed to implement the project in his organisation. But the client has asked me make it sure that I wont run away with the money without completing the project. The cost of project is high and it is not possible to complete it without acquiring the advance from the client. What are the practice that is usually followed ? I myself somehow agree with the client query. I know I will be able to complete the project. I do not intend to cheat. But how to prove it to client? What to do in such situation?
