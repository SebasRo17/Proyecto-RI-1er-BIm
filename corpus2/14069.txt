I have graduated this year and got my first job involved with C programming, Linux administration and embedded systems development. I feel quite content with my job, but I'm afraid I won't become a successful programmer in this field. I'm a lone developer on my job now, with my teammates being hardware experts, there is no one to guide me or teach me in the ways of embedded programming, I have to study all on my own. So here are my questions. Is it possible to become a good embedded systems developer starting from an entry level position without any supervision by senior programmers? How could I become one (perhaps with the help of forums, IRC channels, good textbooks)? How long would it take? **UPDATE:** So far, I have received a handful of helpful answers, but I realized that I need some specific pointers on the subject. So, here are my particular questions:   1. What are some good textbooks one can use to learn embedded development?   2. What specialized online communities can be helpful for an aspiring embedded developer (not counting general stuff like Stack Overflow, Reddit and so on)?   3. What are the most interesting blogs dedicated to embedded development?
