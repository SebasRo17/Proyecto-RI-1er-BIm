Specifically, I have numerous buttons that will be changing color based on state information from operator input and input from various subcomponents and sensors. I would like to use UML or some other type of design diagrams to be able to capture the color transition. Some folks have suggested sequence diagrams, but I haven't been able to find any good examples that show how to incorporate this design artifact. I would really like to head in this direction to help developers. Are sequence designs in fact, appropriate, or is there a more appropriate design?
