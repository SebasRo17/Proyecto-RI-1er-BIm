I am trying to generate a list of cubefree numbers (i.e. numbers when prime factorized contain no tripled factors) within a given range. Of `DivisorSigma`, `PrimeOmega`, `Divisors`, `PrimeNu` and `FactorInteger`, `FactorInteger` seems to me to be the best suited to the task (please feel free to suggest more suitable methods). For example,               FactorInteger[630]      outputs               {{2, 1}, {3, 2}, {5, 1}, {7, 1}}      From this, I would like _Mathematica_ to focus on the second number in each pair (the exponent) and determine which has the highest value. In this case, it is `{3,2}`, indicating that `630` is a cubefree number (i.e. - having no prime factor with a greater exponent than `2`). Is it possible to do this with a range of numbers, so that _Mathematica_ evaluates each number in this way within a range, and then outputs that list of numbers?
