While researching some information regarding managing state and session in web applications, I stumbled across this nugget of information: > 67 is the first useful prime number after 60. (Yes, 61 is a prime, too, but > it's too close to 60 to be of use.)

At first glance, this seems to make perfect sense to me, and traditionally, I've never given a lot of thought to the variance of sessions timing out, but I wonder how much (if any) this strategy has been put into place in practice? Would making a change to timeouts ending on prime numbers really have that much of an effect long-term in a large scale application? Or would a change like this go mostly unnoticed? In other words, is this _really_ anecdotal? Or is it something that should be strongly considered as a best practice?
