Are centrality measures normalised in _Mathematica 9_? Only `ClosenessCentrality` is normalised. How I can normalise other centrality measures notably `DegreeCentrality` and `BetweennessCentrality`?               g = GridGraph[{5, 5}];     ClosenessCentrality[g] // Short     BetweennessCentrality[g] // Short     DegreeCentrality[g] // Short      > > {0.24,0.282353,0.3,0.282353,0.24,0.282353<14>>,0.24,0.282353,0.3,0.282353,0.24} > {2.6881,17.2071,21.5429,17.2071,<<18>>,21.5429,17.2071,2.6881} > {2,3,3,3,2,3,4,4,4,3,3,4,4,4,3,3,4,4,4,3,2,3,3,3,2}
