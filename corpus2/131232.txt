I am interviewing candidates for Java programmer positions. My colleague insists in filling more than half of the interview with java coding puzzles.His view is that, if candidates are able to navigate through the loops, then they must be good. One such example of coding puzzle is                       i=0;             for( i=1 ; i< 10 ;i++)             {                     if(i%3 ==0) i++; break;                     if(i%2 ==0) i++;                   }               print(i);      Follow up: what happens if break is removed ?
