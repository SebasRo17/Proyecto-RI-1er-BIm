Recently I create a fork from an "open source project GPLv2" with different name. I make a major changes in source code and I gave a new name to the modified open source. I kept in the header of each source file the origin author copyright. And then I publish my new open source in github. is this behavior is legal according to GPLv2 License statements ? do I have the right to change the name of the modified open source ? Could you please provide justification from licenses with the answer.
