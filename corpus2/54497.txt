I have a plot of data points using `ListPlot` and another plot using a function. I want the function to look like the data points. I am able to use `Manipulate` to change the variables in the function when plotting, but it's annoying to then have to compare this to a `ListPlot` each time.   Is there a way to combine a `Plot` and a `ListPlot` while still giving me the ability to manipulate variables in the plot? Here's an example that's similar but simplified:               function = x^2 + a + b + c          Manipulate[       Show[         Plot[function, {x, 0, 1}],          ListPlot[{{0, 0}, {1, 1}, {2, 2}}],         PlotRange -> All],       {a, -1, 1},       {b, -1, 1},       {c, -1, 1}]      It works if I plug in the function, but not by defining the function.
