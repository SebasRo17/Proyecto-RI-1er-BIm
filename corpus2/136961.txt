I am working with a history teacher on a history app. He has like 200 flowcharts that he wants to put into the app (among other things). The two likeliest-looking ways to do it:   1. HTML/CSS. The big minus here is that neither one of us is a big HTML/CSS person. Though I do know a bit about them.   2. Adobe Illustrator. The interface makes it easy to draw stuff, and we can make vector graphics files and work from those. The drawback is that the text of a box, the graphical box, and the corresponding hyperlink would be different entities, where as if the HTML/CSS is done right, they might all be a single thing. There are some flowchart-drawing websites out there. But the ones I have looked at have some problems:   1. In the ones I have looked at, the HTML is big and messy. We need ours to be short and simple.   2. Often a large amount of JavaScript is involved. We could do that, but it adds to the complexity of our mobile app, as well as the risk of failures. We are starting on iOS but may add other platforms later.
