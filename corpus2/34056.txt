**Background:** I had the same issue as described here, and I went to extend Mr.Wizard’s code such that `a[b][c]` would be shown as $a_b^c$. **Issue:** To my surprise, Mathematica evaluates `D[a[b][c],a[b]]` to `1[c]` instead of `0`. Here, `a[b]` and `a[b][c]` are meant to be unrelated variables. **Example:** I have an expression which contains a[b][c], which stands for (is printed as, thanks to the code linked in Background) $a^c_b$, where $c$ is an index, not a power. When I take partial derivatives with respect to a[b], which is supposed to stand for an _unrelated_ variable $a_b$, the term containing a[b][c] should be zero. I was expecting the result to be simply `0`, which would   * be consistent with `D[f[x],f]` evaluating to `0`, which I find sensible, given that f in the first argument is an identifier of a function (which involves only the variable x), while the right one is a variable   * make sense assuming that in general, e.g., `c` and `c[1]` and `c[2]` are completely distinct variables, even if they share the same `Head`.   * make sense given that the actually returned result `1[c]` seems to have no use case. **Questions:**   1. Why does Mathematica interpret it that way? I am a Mathematica Newbie and eager to learn, so don’t gloss over details, please. It seems as if `[c]` was a factor, while it isn’t, because this is evidently disallowed:              D[a[b]*[c],a[b]]     Syntax::sntxf: "a[b]*" cannot be followed by "[c]".     Syntax::tsntxi: "[c]" is incomplete; more input is needed.     Syntax::sntxi: Incomplete expression; more input is needed .        2. What can I do to make Mathematica interpret it such that this derivative is zero? I would like to continue to be able to define functions such as `a[t_][b] := f[t]`.
