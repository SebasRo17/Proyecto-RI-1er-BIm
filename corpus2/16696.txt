I get an incorrect vertical offset in 3D plots when using GraphicsRow in Mathematica 9 (Linux - Ubuntu 12.04). When displayed by itself, the plot is fine. Here's an example:               f[x_, y_] := Exp[-x^2 - y^2]      Showing the plot by itself works as expected:               a = Plot3D[f[x, y], {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2}]      ![Gaussian shown once](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KZHDM.png) However an incorrect vertical offset appears when showing the plot _multiple_ times with GraphicsRow:               GraphicsRow[{a, a}, ImageSize -> Large]      ![Gaussian shown twice](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BXBL0.png) Does anybody also have this problem? Any idea how to fix this?
