For example:               M={};      For[n = 0, n < 100, n = n + 1,       ... ...         M=Append[M, Resultmatrix ];       (*Resultmatrix is the intermediate reslut 4X4 matrix*)     ]     Export["data.mat", M]      But when loading data.mat in Matlab, I find that M splits into multiple variables with names like Expression1, Expression2, Expression3 .... I also tried XLS format, but each 4x4 matrix in the list of matrices appears in an individual worksheet. So my question is how can I put M in a single variable, thus I could manipulate it.
