I just installed GNUstep (following this post: http://www.jaysonjc.com/programming/objective-c-programming-in-windows- gnustep-projectcenter.html) It says to run this code:               gcc -o helloworld helloworld.m -I /GNUstep/System/Library/Headers -L /GNUstep/System/Library/Libraries -lobjc -lgnustep-base -fconstant-string-class=NSConstantString      every time I want to compile. It works just fine for me. However as I'm learning and will be compiling/running apps way often (making little changes and trying again), I'd like a simpler way to do this. Is there an easier way to compile and then run the app? Or am I just being lazy?
