Where I work developers are always telling me that "I added this just in case for the future" or "I think it's a good idea to do this because they'll probably want it some day". I think it's great that they're proactive in trying to anticipate future changes but I can't help thinking that it's unnecessary and risks writing code that may never be needed and therefore unproductive (I also think that some developers just want to try out something new for the sake of it). Are the arguments for future proofing invalid if you just write good, clean organised code?
