I have a txt file with space-delimited x, y, z coordinates of several points. The points are organized into groups of unequal size; the groups are delimited by skipping a line, like this:               2.3 3.4 5.5     2.4 3.3 5.6     2.5 3.5 5.6          1.2 4.3 3.3     0.7 4.0 3.5          -1.2 1.3 -0.7     -1.1 1.7 -0.5      I can't find a way to have _Mathematica_ just import these then plot the points! I've tried searching a little bit but didn't find a similar question. When plotting, it's not important to distinguish from which group each point came from. For example, I don't need different colours for each group or anything like that.
