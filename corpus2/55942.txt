I am trying to use `ListVectorPlot` in combination with `WeatherData` and `CountryData` to show wind velocity vectors over a given country. The problem I am having stems from "NotAvailable" and "NotApplicable" data from a function in which the wind's velocity vector is constructed. The function is               WindFoo[x_, y_] := -WeatherData[{y, x}, "WindSpeed"] {1/Cos[y °],         1} Through[{Sin, Cos}[WeatherData[{y, x}, "WindDirection"] °]]      Note: I am not able to display the degree symbol, so it is written out in the above code. How can the code above be modified to exclude the cases of "NotAvailable" and "NotApplicable" data to work in manner similar to the wind velocity vectors shown over Australia in the following tutorial: http://blog.wolfram.com/2009/01/13/visualizing-weather-patterns-in- mathematica-7/
