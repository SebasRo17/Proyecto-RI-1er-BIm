The LICENSE file of a GPLv2 application I am modifying contains a statement saying that certain resources used in the application were "used with permission" from 3rd parties - such as textual material from a published book and certain graphics. Question: in my derivative work based off of this application, am I required to seek permission from those 3rd parties to use those same resources? Or does the GPLv2 encompass the fact that the use of these resources was already permitted in the original work, and thus the 3rd-party permission "flows through" to my derivative work?
