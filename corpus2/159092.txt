We have a few hundred developers, and want to legally share eBooks in the same vein we used to share hard copy books (someone buys it and it ends up on the bookshelf). Has anyone solved this in a novel way? I understand there are subscription options available that license them to you but I want something that is as easy and cheap as our previous method.
