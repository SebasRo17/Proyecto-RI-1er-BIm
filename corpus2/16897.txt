I want to solve the equation $$ f(f(-1)) = \sqrt{2} + g(f(2)), $$ where $$f(x) = \dfrac{a}{x^2} - 3x + 2, \quad g(x) = a\cdot \sin 2x$$ $a$ is unknown. The solution is $a \approx{-5.81}$. I tried               Clear[f];     Clear[g];     f[x_] := a/x^2 - 3 x + 2;     g[x_] := a*Sin[2 x];     Solve[f[f[-1]] == Sqrt[2] + g[f[2]], a]      and               Clear[f];     Clear[g];     f[x_] := a/x^2 - 3 x + 2;     g[x_] := a*Sin[2 x];     Reduce[f[f[-1]] == Sqrt[2] + g[f[2]], a]      but, I got the following error: > "Reduce::nsmet: This system cannot be solved which the methods available to > Reduce." This is a picture of the desired solution that I drew in GeoGebra ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1Y2sS.png) How can I solve this?
