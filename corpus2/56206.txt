I'd like to start coding for medical techs such as 3D Echocardiograms and other imaging and sensor based technologies. I'm fine with the coding and design aspect but are there any resources on finding hospitals or organizations looking for this tech or do you just have to send out letter after letter to the business office of various hospitals?
