In various integrated development environments, such as Microsoft Visual Studio, there is an integrated debugger where you can step through code sections, examine the state of variables and figure out where things are going wrong. With more complex Mathematica programs a debugger would be an extremely valuable asset. I was wondering what people use to debug Mathematica programs? Is Wolfram Workbench the only/best solution?
