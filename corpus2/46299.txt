Since I have a long train ride to and from work I was wondering if there is a version of the Java API documentation floating around that I could put on my Kindle. It would be nice on the rare occasion I get something in my head that I want to think about some more. I know I can browse the web through the Kindle but coverage is spotty and slow. I know that the API docs are not really designed for a sequential reading format but I'm curious to see if anyone else has thought about this and given it a shot. Note I am not reading the Java API to learn how to program Java but to review classes I plan to use. The differences between things like FileReader and FileInputStream are subtle and best gained from reviewing the API and not reading a chapter in a book that will tell me a lot of stuff I already know.
