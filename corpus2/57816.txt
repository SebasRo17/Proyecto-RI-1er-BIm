I have a grayscale (one channel) image in Mathematica. How can I export it as a grayscale Bitmap? Every single option I tried so far does not have an influence on the Bitmap exported using `Export`. If I export the image as PNG, Mathematica exports the grayscale image as expected. **Simple Example** Let's create a simple grayscale image:               image = Image[RandomReal[{0, 1}, {100, 150}]];      Simple export via:               Export["test.bmp",image];      shows exactly the problem mentioned above. Additional options like setting `ColorSpace->"Grayscale"` does not seem to have any effect. Any kind of color- conversion before doing the export did not work either, which is not surprising to me because the image already clearly carries the information that it is a grayscale image and export via               Export["test.png",image];      does export a grayscale PNG. Verification can for example be done by simple reimporting the ColorSpace Element of the exported image:               Import["test.bmp","ColorSpace"];
