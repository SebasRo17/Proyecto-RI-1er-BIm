In Mathematica 8.04 I've created a histogram of returns on a stock using:               returns = FinancialData["SP500", "Return", {Date[] - {5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}, Date[]}, "Value"];     μ = Mean[returns];     h = Histogram[returns, 300, "PDF"];      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rJO3b.png) where "returns" is a list of the daily returns, and I want 300 bins in the probability density method. Next, I would like to draw a line that represents the mean of the returns so I use:               meanLine = Graphics[{Thick, Darker[Green], Line[{{μ, 0}, {μ, maxFreq + 2}}]}];      The problem is that I need to calculate the highest y-value for the line, which should be equal to the count of the data points in the bin with the most points (I've called this `maxFreq` above). I am currently setting this value manually because I don't know how to extract it from the histogram (h). Note that the x-coordinate of this line (`μ`) is simply the mean of the returns. I've tried looking at `FullForm[h]` to see if I could figure out how to extract the data. Buried within that output is the following:               List[List[Rectangle[List[-0.0015, 0.], List[-0.001, 54.0111]      which shows that I want to set maxFreq = 54.0111. So, I suppose that I want to use the `Max` function, but I don't know how to access the heights of each bin. I think that I need to use some variation of the `Part` function, but I can't figure out how. Any clues would be appreciated. Here is the code that will generate what I'm looking for, but maxFreq is manually entered:               returns = FinancialData["SP500", "Return", {Date[] - {5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}, Date[]}, "Value"];     μ = Mean[returns];     h = Histogram[returns, 300, "PDF"];     maxFreq = 54;     meanLine = Graphics[{Thick, Darker[Green],Line[{{μ, 0}, {μ, maxFreq + 2}}]}];     Show[h, meanLine]
