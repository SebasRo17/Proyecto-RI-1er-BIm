I'm new to PHP and MySQL and I've only seen posts related to this on Zend and ASP so I'm looking for some advice to point me in the right direction for a LAMP project. I'm putting together a webform for a project of mine that logged in users will access to upload a submission. Each user will reuse previously uploaded files for each submission. At the bottom of the form the user can upload multiple files. Images, spreadsheets, and pdf's, etc. but I would like to give them access to files they have uploaded before rather than having to resubmit all new files for each submission. My question is what is your advice on accomplishing this? I figure I could have each user create a library of files that they could access from the form in some way. Maybe a list of files with checkboxes to select previously uploaded files? I haven't found much here or on Google so I'm not sure if there is a standard way to handle something like this. Note that the users will only be reusing only their own images, not those of the community. If it makes a difference I'm storing the images in MySQL as BLOB's. Thanks for any advice and information.
