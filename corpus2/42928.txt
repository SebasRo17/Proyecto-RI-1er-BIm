I am trying to make a chart with labels, but I would like for the labels on the chart to be white for purposes of visibility. I am aware of the `Style[expression, White]` option, but when I apply it, my labels go away entirely. ![Bad Image](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IQ96A.png) Code is thus:               snp = Log10[Delete[data[[All, 4]], 1]];     BarChart[snp,        PlotLabel -> "Plot of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms",        ChartLabels -> Placed[names, Center, Rotate[#, 90 Degree] &],        ChartStyle -> "LightTemperatureMap",        ChartLegends -> names]
