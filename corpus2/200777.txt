I'm an experienced C# developer. I've created a couple Windows Phone apps and a Windows 8 app but have wanted to develop for iOS too. What I'm thinking is adding the following equipment and software to make this possible:   1. MacBook Air - necessary to compile/deploy to Apple's App Store and for some development tasks, as well as tools like PaintCode   2. iPad Mini - less expensive and able to do double duty testing for both iPhone and iPad screens (Ideally I'd have the budget for a phone too, but not in the cards)   3. Xamarin Studio Business Edition - pricier but integrates into Visual Studio, which is my primary dev environment and also home to Win8/WP8 app code Basically, I'm just looking for a reality check. Is this overkill? Not enough? I know I could save a few hundred getting a Mac Mini, but have other uses for a laptop. Can I get by with the Indie version of Xamarin or am I crippling productivity by constantly switching environments? (As soon as I get the hardware I'll start by testing the free version to help answer that question).
