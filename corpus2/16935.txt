I've been playing around with the new units capability in MMA9 and I'm becoming a bit frustrated with what I perceive as an incomplete implementation of this capability and I'm wondering if there are other similar examples. For example, `Histogram[]` can take a list of quantities and a `TargetUnits` specification and it will scale the plot appropriately:               data = Quantity[RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[0, 1], 100], "Meters"];     Histogram[data, AxesLabel -> Automatic, TargetUnits -> "Meters"]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/a43qZ.png)               Histogram[data, AxesLabel -> Automatic, TargetUnits -> "Centimeters"]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7DER5.png) But the options for `Histogram[]` do not appear to allow units specifications, which seems dangerous to me and can have some (obvious but) strange results if care is not taken. As an example, specifying `bspec = {-3, 3, 0.2}` assuming that the units are in meters results in a figure that looks something like this:               Histogram[data, {-3, 3, 0.2}, AxesLabel -> Automatic, TargetUnits -> "Meters"]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6rzen.png) If we then change the `TargetUnits` to centimeters, here's what happens:               Histogram[data, {-3, 3, 0.2}, AxesLabel -> Automatic, TargetUnits -> "Centimeters"]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wpPSO.png) Needless to say, one could readily draw a completely different conclusion about the nature of the data even though the only thing that's changed is the output units. To me this seems like an incomplete implementation and I'm wondering if anyone else has encountered a similar issue elsewhere? If so, I'm tempted to avoid the new units capability until it's more mature.
