Consider the formula for the area of a rectangle. I can write the formula as `area[length_, width_] := length*width` and plug in numbers for the dimensions and get the area. Also, I could write a formula for finding each specific dimension in terms of the remaining two. My question is this: Is there a way to write a single expression which will do the whole job, that is I can plug in any two of the components of the area formula and have _Mathematica_ return the third?
