I keep lots of files/editors open in Eclipse. I also love using `git stash` and other git commands that essentially change the contents of my open files. Is there an Eclipse feature or plugin that will always keep the contents of my open files up to date and live? Currently if I put focus in an out of sync editor, I get an awkwardly worded dialog that I have to parse carefully every time. I wish it would just keep me synced like Textmate does.
