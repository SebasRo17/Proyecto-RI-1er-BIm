I obtained a BSc CS & Applied Mathematics November last year and started working as a Software Developer in December. I'm currently working for a very solid company and I'm part of a small core development team, developing big software. I absolutely love software development and would someday like to become a (Senior) Software Engineer, Systems Analyst or Solutions Architect (not 100% sure about all the senior titles). My questions is - what experience do I need to obtain to achieve this? What is the necessary/desired career path? What type of courses do I need to attend to gain the needed knowledge?
