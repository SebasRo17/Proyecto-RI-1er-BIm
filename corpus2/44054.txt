I am doing:                 NIntegrate[Sin[Exp[(x^4)]], {x, 2, Infinity}, PrecisionGoal -> 12]      It prints out a host of warnings, but also shows the results as: $$-0.0113737$$ This is a highly oscillatory integral and weirdness happens to the numerical routines as they are doing their thing. For example:   * integration with LevinRule failed.   * converging too slowly; suspect one of the following: singularity, value of the integration is 0, highly oscillatory integrand, or WorkingPrecision too small   * "NIntegrate failed to converge to prescribed accuracy after 9 recursive bisections in x near {x} = {4.531228269745986`}"   * ... You can see a plot as:                Plot[Sin[Exp[(x^4)]], {x, 2, 5}]      As an aside, the same input (exactly) using WA, produces: $$-0.00644455$$ Are those warnings/errors telling me not to trust the result as it is suspect?
