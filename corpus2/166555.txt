A few days ago, I read an answer stating that writing queries within your c# code are long gone. I'm not sure what the specific person meant with the comment but, it got me thinking. At the company where i work, we maintain an assembly containing all the queries to the database (let's call it Queries). This assembly is reference by a QueryService (Retrieve the correct queries) assembly which in turn is referenced by a UnitOfWork assembly (The database connector classes, we have different connector classes for SQL, MySQL etc.). We use these three assemblies to perform operations on our database and all queries/commands are written by C# code. Is there a better way to communicate with the database and is there a better way to communicate with different database types?
