I've got a question concerning node.js performance. There is quite lot of "benchmarks" and a lot of fuss about great performance of node.js. But how does it stand in real world? Not just process empty request at high speed. If someone could try to compare this scenario: Java (or equivalent) server running an application with complex business logic between receiving request and sending response. How would node.js deal with it? If there was need for a lot of JavaScript processing on server side, is node.js really so fast that it can execute JavaScript, and stand a chance against more heavyveight competitors?
