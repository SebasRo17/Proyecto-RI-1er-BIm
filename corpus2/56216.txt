I'm working with a large number of historical image files and am playing around with extracting dominant colours, faces, etc. with _Mathematica 10_. Occasionally, however, I am running into files that just plain out break the language - i.e. even `Import[file,"Elements"]` leads me to have to quit the kernel to get things going again. Here's the workflow. Often `Import[file]` will return > > Import::fmterr : Cannot import data as GIF format.>> So far so good. But if you run it _again_ , the whole kernel comes crashing down. Even if I decide not to run it again, things become unstable and the program begins to hang. The same context happens with `Import[file,"Elements"]` so I'm at a loss of how to debug it. Is there any way to get _Mathematica_ to skip these files - or any clue of what might be happening?
