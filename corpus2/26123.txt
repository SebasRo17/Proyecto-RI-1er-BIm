Although there may be better ways to get data and definitions from another notebook (packages, read/write dumps, ...), sometimes it is convenient to just evaluate the initialization cells from another notebook to re-use the data and definitions. Normally I would open this notebook and manually `Evaluate Initialization Cells`, but I was wondering if there is a way to do this automatically, i.e. with some code. **Question: is there a way to evaluate the Initialization Cells of a certain notebook by filename?** Related questions:   * Evaluation of Notebook chosen by FileNameSetter   * How to select all initialization cells?
