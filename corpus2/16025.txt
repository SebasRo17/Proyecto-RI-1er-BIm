When I started using an object-oriented language (Java), I pretty much just went "Cool" and started coding. I've never really thought about it until only recently after having read lots of questions about OOP. The general impression I get is that people struggle with it. Since I haven't thought of it as hard, and I wouldn't say I'm any genius, I'm thinking that I must have missed something or misunderstood it. Why is OOP difficult to understand? _Is_ it difficult to understand?
