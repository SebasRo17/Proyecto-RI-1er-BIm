I tried to use the 'inspect element' of the firebug addon for Firefox but it doesn't give me any link to the javascript. For example I got this from the firebug add-on:               <a href="javascript:">         text of the link     </a>      But there is no link to the actual javascript or anything that I can use to directly go to the said link. How do I accomplish this? I need this as part of a personal data mining project that I am doing.
