If you had a generous, but not ridiculous budget (ie no yachts!), describe your ideal setup for programming. What hardware would you have? Desktop and a laptop or just one or the other? How many screens - two, three, four, more? Private office, work from home, cubicle? What operating system(s) would you be using? What tools would you have - IDE, other tools, databases, VCS, documentation? What local development and test servers and other services would you want - VCS server? Build server? database server?
