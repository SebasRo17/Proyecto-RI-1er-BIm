these are equations for some double oscillators: $x'(t)=p, p'(t)=-x-3y, y'(t)=q, q'(t)=-y-3x$ I would like to plot the Poincare section for collection of $(y,q)$ when $x=0$ and $x'(t)>0$ (or for $(x,p)$ when $y=0$ and $y'(t)>0$). I benefited from documentation and nice answer by Mr. belisarius here and I wrote:               abc = {x'[t] == p[t], p'[t] == -x[t] - y[t], y'[t] == q[t], q'[t] == -y[t] - x[t]};     psect[{x0_, p0_, y0_, q0_}] :=     Reap[NDSolve[{abc, x[0] == x0, p[0] == p0, y[0] == y0, q[0] == q0,     WhenEvent[x[t] + 0*y'[t] + 0*p[t] + 0*q[t] == 0,     If[p[t] >= 0, Sow[{y[t], q[t]}]]]}, {x, p, y, q}, {t, 0, 200},     MaxSteps -> \[Infinity], MaxStepSize -> .0005]][[2, 1]];     ps = psect /@ Table[{0.01, 0.005, 0.01, i}, {i, -.01, .01, .00125}];     ListLinePlot[#[[FindCurvePath[#][[2]]]] & /@ ps, Mesh -> All, PlotRange -> All]      But I don't receive anything. I expect to obtain something like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IbgaN.png) Many thanks for your attention.
