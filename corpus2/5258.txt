Packed arrays are very useful because they save memory and generally allow speedier and more efficient calculation times. If a list of data currently stored as a packed array is unpacked, it can slow things down considerably. It has been suggested that using certain built-in functions has the advantage that unpacking doesn't occur. Short of some trial-and-error spelunking using `PackedArrayQ` from the Developer Utilites package, **are there any guidelines or best practices for using functions and coding styles that avoid these performance hits from inadvertant unpacking?**
