I'm curious about how to test reports that seem rather straightforward. I'm supposed to create test cases for an Oracle report(XML Publisher/BI Publisher). So for example, a report is supposed to just return columns(say , 10 columns). Here is what I thought of so far:               Validate that the  report returns accurate output.     Validate that the all column headers and table values are correctly aligned and there are no run-ons/incorrect formatting     Validate that dates are in the MM/DD/YYYY format     Validate that all currencies are accurate, and contain 2 decimal places.      Here's a sample pic(of what the report produces) : ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/MfxvB.png) What would the edge/boundary cases be? If the report takes in parameters, does that make it more demanding of a report? Thanks
