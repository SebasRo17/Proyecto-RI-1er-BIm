I'm trying to solve a set of functions to determine the material properties from a set of measurement values. (To set up this method I just want to fit my model with some already calculated data). My equations look like this:               eqns = {        fres[L1] - f1,        fres[L2] - f2,        fres[L3] - f3,        fres[L4] - f4,        fres[L5] - f5        };      fres[L_] is defined earlier (very long equations which do not need to matter at the moment) - here is just a working example:               fres[L_] := C1^2 / (L^2)*Sqrt[Sum[Subscript[a, i] + Subscript[b, i], {i, 1, 5}]]      Now I wanted to solve this set of equations by the method of least squares fitting to determine the a_i (note: I'm not using subscript in my code but I'm using a vector with a[[i]]):               sol = FindMinimum[{Total[eqns^2], a1 >= 50*10^9, a2 >= 100*10^9, a3 >= 70*10^9, a4 >= 100*10^9}, {a1, a2, a3, a4}, Method -> "LevenbergMarquardt"]          eqns /. Last@sol (* for manual control *)      The problem is, that I cannot get any solution here, because the LevenbergMarquardt method do not allow constrainted problems. As far as I understoot, the least squares fitting method is best done by this method... My a1..a4 are only positive values in the range of 10^9 to 10^12... When I remove the method my input looks like this:               sol = FindMinimum[{Total[eqns^2], a1 >= 50*10^9, a2 >= 100*10^9, a3 >= 70*10^9, a4 >=100*10^9}, {a1, a2, a3, a4}]      And the output:               FindMinimum::eit: The algorithm does not converge to the tolerance of 4.806217383937354`*^-6 in 500 iterations. The best estimated solution, with feasibility residual, KKT residual, or complementary residual of {0.0157055,8.38758*10^-7,0.00491086}, is returned. >>      Increasing the iterations won't deliver good results either (i tried up to 10 000). It only results in a1..a4 which are very close to my starting values:               Out:     {1.12792, {a1-> 5.*10^10, a2-> 1.*10^11, a3 -> 1.03486*10^11, a4 -> 1.*10^11}}     {-0.908837, -0.252209, -0.100982, 0.361948, 0.311647}      Do you have any idea how I could get the a1..a4 (or even more)? Is there any elegant way of doing this? Your help would much be appreciated!
