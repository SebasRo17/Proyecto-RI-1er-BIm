Currently I'm a student, but I'm about to go look for a job next semester, and I'm a bit worried that the jobs I'll get will have me stuck with a table that is too high, screen that is too low, and a chair that barely supports my back. This is pretty important to me since I already experienced various computer use pains due to a bad setting, and I really don't want this to be an issue when I apply to jobs. So I was wondering, how much control can I expect to have in the work place over the furniture/equipment I use? I assume that it's not a big deal to plug in your own mouse/keyboard, but what about bringing your own chair, and maybe screen(s)? I'm guessing that the desk is usually hard/impossible to modify, but is it completely unheard of? And would the work environment ever be a deal breaker for you?
