I have               s = {2, 3, 5, 7, 1, 4, 6}  (* always with diffente elements in {1,2....7}*)     l = Length[s]     n = 3      and `n` tells us that we want to select 3 positions in the list `s`, and permute them within the full list. For example,               a = RandomSample[Range[l], n]      Suppose we obtain `a = {2, 6, 4}` and we apply a random permutation to these positions obtaining `{4, 6, 2}`. Then Position 2 goes to position 4   Position 6 goes to position 6   Position 4 goes to position 2 obtaining               s = {2, 7, 5, 3, 1, 4, 6}      WhatÂ´s a simple (and comprehensible) way without using an auxiliary list. ### Edit After reading MrWizard an Yi-Wang answers: (I like the `s[[a]] =s[[b]]` of MWizard, and the use of permutations and rule of Yi-Wang, but I think that a simpler an more comprehensible way is               s = {2, 3, 5, 7, 1, 4, 6}     n = 3     Print["BEFORE -> ", s]     choice = RandomSample[Range[Length[s]], n]     choicepermuted = RandomSample[choice, n]     s[[choice]] = s[[choicepermuted]]     Print["AFTER ->  ", s]
