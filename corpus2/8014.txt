I am hoping that this isn't a stupid question so feel free to vote it for closure. Google failed somehow. I want to define a custom function (more complicated than the usual `f[x_] := someExpression`) that performs several tasks (taking elements of a set, performing computations, etc.) before giving an output. I don't want to run the whole bunch of codes repeatedly. Is there a way of defining such a function? What I have in mind is, say a program in R, which goes like               function_name <- function(arg1, arg2, ..., argn){         routine 1         routine 2         routine 3         ...         Output to be returned     }      EDIT: In view of the comment that this question is somewhat vague, I am posting part of the code below:               Final = {{1}};     For[hn = 0, hn < 7, hn++;      rp = {0}; fn = hn;      For[fk = 0, fk < fn, fk++;        Clear[r, v, w, p, q, z, x, n, k, t, res, pt];        v[z_] := Sum[q^d, {d, 0, z - 1}];        n = fn; k = fk; t = {}; For[i = 0, i < (n - k), i++;          For[j = -1, j < k, j++; t = Join[t, {j}];]];        t = KSubsets[t, (n - k)];        For[i = 0, i < Length[t], i++;          t[[i]] = Sort[t[[i]]]];        t = Union[t];      The code is quite long (sloppy programming). I just want the whole thing to be given a name so that I can just type that name of that function and vary the arguments.
