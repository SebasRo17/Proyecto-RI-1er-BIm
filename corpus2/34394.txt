I'm looking for a nice one- or two-liner to randomly place some number, $N$, of `Graphics3D` polytopes on a plane with dimensions $X \times Y$, and to specify that $k \leq N$ of them should be one color (e.g. `Red`) and the remaining $N-k$ another color (e.g. `Blue`). If possible, I would also like the option to randomly reassign colors an arbitrary number of times (perhaps by clicking a mouse) without changing the coordinates of the polytopes. Is this possible? We can get started by placing a single red colored Dodecahedron at the coordinate $(0,0,0)$ with the following line of code:               Graphics3D[{Red, Scale[Translate[PolyhedronData["Dodecahedron", "Faces"], {0, 0, 0}], 3]},               Boxed -> False, Background -> Gray]      Perhaps we would want to use `Map` here?
