I see all the examples that demonstrate unit testing code and mocking the calls to the DB since you are not suppose to touch the DB. But it seems to me having a set up tasks that uses the actually schema, loads the lookup tables and then populates it with data using the methods to be tested... This way it is more real world testing and all the stored procedures are tested as well.. But I never have seen any examples like this... Is there some reason I do not understand why using this technique is not as useful as it seems ? EDIT1: Sorry.. I shouldn't have called it unit test.. yes. I will have unit tests as well that are for testing code.. But beyond that it seems like a good idea to bring up and tear down and DB and have code that modifies that DB and does assertions.. But I don't want this to be UI testing.. I just want to perform a lot of CRUD functions and a lot of assertions .. :My question is #1 does this make sense.. #2 how do I automate this all within visual studio ? How do I tell VS 2012 to run a SQL script before running the tests? is there some special API for this ?
