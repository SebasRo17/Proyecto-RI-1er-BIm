Manipulate[      SphericalPlot3D[{1, 2 - n}, {θ, 0, Pi}, {ϕ, 0, 1.5 Pi},        Mesh -> None, PlotPoints -> 15, PlotRange -> {-2.2, 2.2}], {n, 0,        1}]      I cant' seem to be able to make a filling between two spheres. I've already tried the obvious `Filling -> {1 -> {2}}` but _Mathematica_ doesn't seem to like that option. Is there any easy way around this or ...
