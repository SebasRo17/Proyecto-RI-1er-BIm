I have a project which involves re-writing pretty much all the back end of a legacy application. It uses XML for persistence and was originally written as a single user system. With one large XML file that could be accessed by multiple users and hence get corrupted, I was thinking about introducing a SQL database where a user could work on his resource and let the database worry about concurrency. With the short deadlines, I was wondering if we could keep the xml persistence (as well as all the business logic) and introduce locking in some other way. Is this possible?
