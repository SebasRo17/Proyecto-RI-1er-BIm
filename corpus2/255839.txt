I was told by a colleague that in Java, the performance may be worse if we create more methods, stacking many methods calling over them in JVM, specially in a Java EE environment. This seems to somewhat defeat the concept of object oriented programming. Like if we write long methods - what isn't good for code readability - we can achieve more performance due to less methods in JVM stack. This is a correct affirmation?
