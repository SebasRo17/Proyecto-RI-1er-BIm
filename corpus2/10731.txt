I just started doing PhD and we are supposed to do a project for a class, there are 14 people taking the class and we are supposed to develop a system all together. I was away from academia and working in the industry before, and I know it is very hard to manage even a couple of people towards the same goal. We are going to make the first meeting in a couple of weeks. First, I will suggest using a version control system like SVN. Second, I will try to take the lead for the architecture of the system, because I think I am more experienced. Since the class is about _computer vision_ and I anticipate that most of the people's background is research related so there is a big chance that I am more experienced. I will gladly hand architecture to someone else if he/she is more experienced. What else should we do to progress without much hassle? PS. You can assume every one of us is going to work remotely, and meet once in a week at it's best (not everyone will attend though). And the project needs to be finished in 2 months. It does not need to be a perfect, complete product, we just need to make a prototype. PPS. The aspects of the group reminds me of open source project groups, maybe the answers will be helpful for those groups as well.
