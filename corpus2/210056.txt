It's the first RESTful web service and I am concerned about security issues. Is it safe to transmit my access token via HTTP headers? For example:               POST /v1/i/resource HTTP/1.1     Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded     Api-key: 5cac3297f0d9f46e1gh3k83881ba0980215cd71e     Access_token: 080ab6bd49b138594ac9647dc929122adfb983c8          parameter1=foo&parameter2=bar      The connection made over `SSL`. Also, What is need to be defined as the `scope` attribute for every `access token`
