I am constructing a list for use in file operations. Say I want to create `list` which contains values from 01 to 87. The kicker is that the first nine integers need to keep a value of `01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11.. etc.` So if I create `list=Range[87]` I generate a list of integers. Whenever I'm trying to then replace values with '01', etc. they become strings. If they are integers, they revert back to the single value. Ideally, I need a list that I can feed through `Do[]`. Is there a quick way to create a list that uses the two digit form the whole time? FWIW, the specific application of this that I have a list of files i.e. `{1997-01-page100.jpeg, 1997-01-page101,jpeg, <<33 379>>, 1997-87-page9.jpeg, 1997-87-page10,jpeg}`. I'm using the following command to generate specific lists of the sub-file using `importlist=FileNames["1997-"<>ToString[x]<>"-*.jpeg"]` but am being thrown off by the zero in front of the single-digit file number.
