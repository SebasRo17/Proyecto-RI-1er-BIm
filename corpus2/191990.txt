I have gone through http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html What I understand from the article:   1. develop a hacker attitude.   2. learn programming language (eg. python)   3. solve interesting problems Point 3) is where I'm stuck. Where do I find these interesting problems? Sure, I can go to UVA Online and other sites which have good set of programming problems. But solving these problem I just like an exercise from which I can polish my python skills and learn how to go about solving a problem. I want to do something real/fun problems which the above programming problems lack. I need a bit of guidance on the issue.
