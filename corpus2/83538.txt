I love VB.NET very much. Coding VB.NET with Visual Studio is just like typing messages. Smooth, fast and simple. Any error will be notified instantly. The OO capability of VB.NET is good enough. But often in any .Net languages discussion, there is perception that VB.NET is good for small to medium size application and not for large scale project? Why there is such perception? Or am I missing anything regarding to VB.NET?
