I found that the detailed contour pattern will be altered if we `Rasterize` the original graphics using high `RasterSize` or `ImageResolution`. Here is an example:               g = ContourPlot[Sin[x] Sin[y], {x, -3, 3}, {y, -3, 3},            Contours -> Function[{min, max}, Range[min, max, 0.01]],            ContourStyle -> Directive[Black, Opacity[.3], Thickness[.002]],            ImageSize -> 500]      which looks like ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ud9tC.png) Now we `Rasterize` g using four times its original pixel size               dim = ImageDimensions@Rasterize[g];     Rasterize[g, RasterSize -> 4*dim]      and we obtain ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Rmq3j.png) So the patterns of the contour lines are different. I firstly think that this problem can be solved by increasing the `Thinckness` value in `ContourStyle`, but this will not make the result better. I wonder if we can improve it? * * * **Update** As a workaround, can we try to preserve the pattern by keeping the contour in vectot format (together with axis and ticks), and only `Rasterize` the background? In this case I think there might be problems with the thickness of contour lines.
