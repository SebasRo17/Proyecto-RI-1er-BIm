Is there a way in Mathematica to find the local maxima of a set of points? Suppose you have               points={{xa,ya},{xb,yb},{xc,yc}...}          peakQ[{{x1_,y1_},{x2_,y2_},{x3_,y3_}}] := Abs[y1] > Abs[y2] && Abs[y2] < Abs[y3];     peaks=Map[#[[2]]&, Select[Partition[points,3,1],peakQ[#]&]]      Is it correct because in this way I find points but from plots I can see that I have lost some points.
