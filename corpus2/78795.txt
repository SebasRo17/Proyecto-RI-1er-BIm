I use ISO 8601 to represent dates & durations and all is OK. But now I need to represent relative dates and durations like:   * The date for first day, at midnight, of the next week    * All the last month period. In fact I need to have a syntax for it, I prefer a standard one. I don't need code (I yet have all the code) but a syntax to store relatives date or durations just like ISO 8601 use "P1Y2M10DT2H30M" for a duration. Thanks...
