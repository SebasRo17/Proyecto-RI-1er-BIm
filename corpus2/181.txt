The instruction : `DisplayForm[RowBox[List[0,1,Superscript[2,3],Superscript[1,2],a]]]` displays a gap between the first two items of the list ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YKZkx.png) but if one is careful not to have two consecutive integers, there is no gap `DisplayForm[RowBox[List[0,a,1,Superscript[2,3],Superscript[1,2],a]]]` ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DQA6S.png) I would like to know if there is a way to disable (locally) the space inserted by Mathematica between two integers in this case to have something like that: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/VLFny.png) I would like the result to stay a TagBox or InterpretationBox, easy to copy/paste, if possible.
