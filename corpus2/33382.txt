Is there a way to draw a quadrangular surface in _Mathematica_ so that it shows the bilinear term (not two triangles)? The quadrangular polygon is given by the expression $$\phi = \sum_i^4 N_i U_i$$ where the $N_i$ are the Lagrangian shape functions (from finite element analysis), and the $U_i$ are the degrees of freedom. The shape functions are given by               N1[xi_, eta_] := (1 - eta) (1 - xi)/4;     N2[xi_, eta_] := (1 + eta) (1 - xi)/4;     N3[xi_, eta_] := (1 + eta) (1 + xi)/4;     N4[xi_, eta_] := (1 - eta) (1 + xi)/4;      So there is a bilinear term `xi*eta` that gives the curvature to the element.
