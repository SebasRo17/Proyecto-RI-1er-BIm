I have a list representing a 2D matrix, such as this 3 ⨉ 2 one:               {{2.1, 1.01}, {0.01, 7.2}, {7.8, 2.0}}      Does anyone know how to find the minimum of each row, ideally outputting a new list of 1's where the row minimums are in the original matrix and 0's for all other elements? i.e.               {{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, 1}}      The answer should work for any m ⨉ n list.
