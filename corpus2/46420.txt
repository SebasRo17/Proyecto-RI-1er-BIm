Myself and a friend are looking to launch a little forum site. I’m considering using the “Sign in with Facebook/Twitter” APIs, possibly exclusively (a la e.g. Lanyrd), for user login. I haven’t used either of these before, nor run a site with user logins at all. What are the pros (and cons) of these APIs? Specifically:   1. **What benefits do I get as a developer from using them?** What drawbacks are there?   2. Do end users actually like/dislike them?   3. Have you experienced any technical/logistical issues with these APIs specifically? Here are the pros and cons I’ve got so far: ### Pros   * More convenient for the user (“register” with two clicks, sign in with one)   * Possibly no need to maintain our own login system ###  Cons   * No control over our login process   * Exclude Facebook/Twitter users who are worried about us having some sort of access to their accounts   * Users’ accounts on our site are compromised if their Facebook/Twitter accounts are compromised.   * And if we don’t maintain our own alternative login system:      * Dependency on Facebook/Twitter for our login system     * Exclude non-Facebook/non-Twitter users from our site
