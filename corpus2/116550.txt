I've been given a relatively decent new laptop at Work. I really thought it would help speeding development up, especially build times and the like. The problem is that our company runs Mcafee antivirus and it is slowing my machine down to a halt. My harddrive is almost always active even when I'm doing nothing. It seems to be doing some kind of real time scan. I run no antivirus at home and haven't had any problems in years as I know not to do anything stupid like download attachments that I'm not expecting etc. Also, the corporate firewall is pretty strict so I believe that would make it even harder to obtain a virus. How would you convince the IT department to relax AV settings for you? edit: As many people have pointed out, the chance of getting them to turn it off is slim to non so I've changed the subject from disable to relaxing settings.
