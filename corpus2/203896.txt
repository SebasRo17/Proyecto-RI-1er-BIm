I am reading the book "Cracking the Sales Management Code", and the book says that sales people can be more or less managed ("measure") by measuring whether they are consistently improving on their Sales Objectives, such as the ability to get new sales, close sales cycle length, deal win/deal lost ratio, hitting sales quota and so on. And I wonder, whether is it possible to manage ( or to measure) software developers in this way? Now I am fully aware that managing people by numbers is a very tricky thing to do; it is very possible for the managers to set the wrong metric, and hence result in the mismanaging of the software developers. But still, I wonder whether this there any books/literature that explores this issue? **Note: When I say I want to "measure" my developers, I don't mean that I want to use the numbers to penalize them or I want to "rank" them. My purpose is simple, I want to have the numbers ( the meaningful numbers) so that I can help them improve their software development skills ( in whatever sense).**
