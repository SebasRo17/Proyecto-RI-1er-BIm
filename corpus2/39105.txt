I have the particle movement data in the following format:               {      {1., 1., 0., 0.},      {1., 2., 0.240727, 0.974106},      {1., 3., 0.0215366, 0.703085},      {1., 4., 0.437541, 1.19085},      {2., 1., 0., 0.},      {2., 2., -2.17808, 0.455328},      {2., 3., -2.97556, -0.668351},      {2., 4., -3.91848, -1.25396},      {3., 1., 0., 0.},      {3., 2., -0.523589, 0.136621},      {3., 3., -1.87956, 0.679403},      {3., 4., -2.36116, 0.749859}     }      The first number is the particle number, second is the frame number in the movie, third is the $x$ position, and the fourth is the $y$-position. So in the above data, the first 4 lists belong to particle 1, the next 4 to particle 2 and the last 4 to particle 3. I need to calculate the mean square displacement (MSD) $(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2$ for each of the particles separately. I can calculate MSD if I don't have to care about the above data having 3 particles, treat all as the same (but that's not what I want). I need to calculate MSD for each of these particles separately. Basically, somehow I have to tell the program where the the data for particle 1 end and where data for particle 2 starts. In MATLAB, I have used the `find` function to return the location index of the number "1" in the second column of the data and run the loop till that index to calculate MSD for each particle. I am new to _Mathematica_ and trying to learn it. It's taking me a while to find a answer to this problem. Can anyone help?
