Does it make sense to write default constructor when it has no arguments, empty body and no other constructors exist? The only benefit I can think of is reducing the risk of forgetting to add the default constructor when another one is created. But this error would show up anyway if the default constructor is actually being used (at least if the class is "internal" and not in a library), and if it isn't used it can be omitted (yagni). What benefit can this have?
