I have a bunch of 3D data (x, y coordinates and values) which is generated in Matlab and I need to render them in a 2D color map with certain axis ranges. Here are the Matlab code and the generated figure.               rho = linspace(0, 80, 100);     phi = linspace(0, 2*pi, 100);     [PHI,RHO] = meshgrid(phi, rho);     dat = rand(size(PHI)); % data was generated in cylindrical coordinate     [x, y] = pol2cart(PHI, RHO);     surf(x, y, data,'edgecolor','none'); shading interp;     view(0, 90);     axis equal; axis off;     xlim([-50, 50]); ylim([-50, 50])     save('data.mat', 'x', 'y', 'dat')      ![render 3d data into a 2d colormap](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6LerO.png) In **_Mathematica_** , I imported these data by evaluating               {x, y, dat} = Import["data.mat", "MAT"]      but I have no idea how to render them as shown above. I tried               ListPlot3D[{x, y, dat}]      It gave a 3D pattern but was extremely slow because I have a lot of data. Could anyone give me a hint to tackle this problem?
