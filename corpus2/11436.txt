I want to understand an existing project for improve myself more but i am not sure that project is overwhelming for me or not. I am not sure i am capable to understand it. I even think that i will be failed. When i look at projects, at a glance it makes me feel scary to see thousand line of codes . I don't even know where to start read codes.Do i have to follow by debugging or another else? Can you please guide me about this situation ? I am totally get confused for start. Edit : Few thing for specify about my question. I know C# language and I have learned some WEB technologies like ASP.NET MVC 2 and Web Forms but sure still there will be many thing which i still don't know. I call myself as beginner but it is just because lack of professional experience in this area. But my OOP understanding is enough good. I am thinking to improve myself on WEB so i am looking for WEB projects like blog engines which is simpler than others for starting.
