Was fascinated to read about the text adventure game The Hobbit which featured an incredibly robust parser called "Inglish": > ...Inglish allowed one to type advanced sentences such as "ask Gandalf about > the curious map then take sword and kill troll with it". The parser was > complex and intuitive, introducing pronouns, adverbs ("viciously attack the > goblin"), punctuation and prepositions and allowing the player to interact > with the game world in ways not previously possible. I'm wondering if anyone knows about the history and/or legacy of the Inglish parser engine and the programmer(s) who developed it.
