In Joel's blog on evidence based scheduling he suggests making estimates based on the smallest unit of work and logging extra work back to the original task. The problem I'm now experiencing is that I'll have create object A with subtask method A which creates object B and test all of the above. I create tasks for each of these that seems to be resulting in ok-ish estimates (need practice), but when I go to log work I find that I worked on 4 tasks at once because I tweak method A and find a bug in the test and refactor object B all while coding it. How should I go about logging this work? should I say I spent, for example, 2 hours on each of the 4 tasks I worked on in the 8 hour day?
