How can one convert a Mathematica expression into a string without the expression being evaluated first? I tried using `Hold`, but it returns `Hold[expr]`, instead of `expr`. Is there any way to get just the expression? For example, I have a variable `var = 5`, and I need to assign the _name_ of `var` to another variable, so that `var2 = "var"`. How can I do this? My actual use case is this: I am trying to synchronize my mathematica variables with certain fields in an external database. Every time the external database is updated, I call on a function that is supposed to update my corresponding Mathematica variables. It takes in a list of mappings like `{var1 -> "field1", var2 -> "field2"}`, and its role is to access the external database, look up the value in `"field1"`, and assign it to `var1`, then look up the value in `"field2"` and assign it to `var2`. The number of variables in the mapping (and their names) can be arbitrary. The problem is that I need those `var1` and `var2` variables to be passed as variable _names_ , not values, so that I can assign them inside the function. I do the assignment using ` `Do[ i[[1]]->i[[2]]/.remoteData, {i,mappings} ]` ` where `remoteData = {"field1"->"value of field 1", "field2" -> "value of field 2"}`. I need `i[[1]]` to stand for `var1`, not for its value. I tried setting the attribute `SetAttributes[fn,HoldAll]` but that didn't help. The result that I am looking for is `var1 = "value of field 1"`, `var 2 = "value of field 2"`.
