I have a list of lists from which I pick out the positions of the number 1 and then print out these positions for each list. I am having some trouble collecting what I am printing into a list / matrix / array though. Below is my list of lists and the commands by which I find the positions of the 1's and print them out. Thanks.               ZeroCrossings = {{0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 1, 1,        0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1,        0}, {0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0,        0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0}}          Do[Print[Flatten[Transpose[Position[ZeroCrossings[[t]], 1]]]], {t, 1,Length[ZeroCrossings]}]      > {3,9} > > {4,5,8,12,13} > > {4,12,13} > > {4,8,11,13} > > {4,9,12,13} > > {5,6,11}
