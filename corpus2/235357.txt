I am coding and found it's pretty hard to come up with an elegant design for my app at the first attempt.   * First time I'm only about 40% happy, then I refactor it to code the same app a second time (almost start from scratch).   * Second time coding, I'm only happy about 60% happy, so I refactor it once more to code the same app a third time (not start from scratch but I made a lot of changes).   * Third time coding, I'm only happy about 80%. Here I am quite happy but I think if I can start over I can do much better and it should be very solid. But I am running out of time now. So I just leave it like it is. 80% Happy.  So my key word is " **to keep re-factoring** ". But this is my point of view as an indie developer so I don't know how a design company would design an application. Suppose I give my idea to a professional designing company, will they keep refactoring like that many times to achieve an elegant design? Or because they are a big design company, are they able to design everything well at the first attempt? Do you work for a software design company? If you do then how does the professional designing company design applications elegantly?
