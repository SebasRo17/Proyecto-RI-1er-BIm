Forgive the newbie question... I am trying to create a table of the following system, following the Stirling example in the documentation, but Mathematica just echoes my input. What am I doing wrong?               RecurrenceTable[        {s1[n, k] == s1[n, k - 1] + s1[n - 1, k - 1],          s1[0, k] == 1, s1[n, 0] == Boole[n == 0], s1[n, 1] == Boole[n <= 2]},         s1, {n, 0, 6}, {k, 0, 4}     ] // Grid
