If I'm writing a web application that uses the model 2 architecture, is it possible to use the Google Guice framework (or really any IoC container)? The reason I ask this question is because everything I've researched about DI, IoC, et cetera always uses Spring, Hibernate or some other framework/container in their examples. I'm just using Java classes, controllers, and JSP's to build this application and I can't find any good documentation about the subject.
