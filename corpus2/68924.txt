I'm currently in a very stable, comfortable dev position where most of my growth as a developer is solo. My current team doesn't really discuss software development and not everyone is interested in it enough to grow as a group. Nevertheless, I love the people I work with and we have the opportunity to work on fun projects (most of the time). Through a recruiter, I've been offered a very exciting job with a bunch of super-smart devs that love to discuss, improve, grow. However, (and the employer doesn't know this), I'm planning on leaving the area in **just over a year**. These plans are pretty definite, so the mentality of _"Hey, anything could happen in a year,"_ while true, doesn't feel applicable. There are other factors to consider (a **much** longer commute, longer working hours, etc), but the one that is really bothering me is I don't know how I feel about starting something so life-changing, only to start making plans to leave in ~9 months. Personally, I want to feel like I'm settling into a job, not hopping around. Granted, I also can't help but consider the needs of the employer; I don't want to be the guy that stayed for just a year, forcing them to restart the hiring process. Especially in the field of software development, I feel there's an investment made in the employee that is hired. _(Training in the business domain, training in the specific practices of the organization, training in the tools, etc.)_ I'm the kind of developer that wants to give back on that investment -- otherwise I feel I have nothing to show for myself. So, do you think **a year is enough time to give back on that investment**? **Edit:** I appreciate all of the answers I've received, but I wanted to clarify that I wouldn't be leaving in 9 months, I'd be leaving in 12-13 months. 9 months was just an approximation of how long until I had to start _thinking_ about leaving.
