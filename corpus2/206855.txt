I'd like to create a program/application to iterate through all of a Tumblr user's posts and copy the content from each. In essence it'd be like Tumblripper, but download the text and video URLs in addition to the photos. I have the know how to strip the content, pictures, and video URLs from one Tumblr page using jQuery if I have access to it, but how can I have my javascript run using a different page's content that has no `<script>` referencing the js file? For example I have the code               var contentArray = []     var $content = $('.content');     for(var i = 0; i < $content.length; i++)     {         // Code to copy the content and put it in the array     }      But I can't just edit the HTML of the Tumblr page to add in a reference to my javascript page. What I am in need of is something like (in theory)               RUN getTumblrsContent.js ON exampleblog.tumblr.com      and have it make it's way through the HTML and find each div with class `content`. How might I accomplish this? How does Tumblripper and other applications like it get content from web pages? I'm open to using other languages and means to accomplish my goal
