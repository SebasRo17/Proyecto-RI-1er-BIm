I'm working on an internal company application(not built on Wordpress) that needs to have shortcode functionality similar to Wordpress (http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API). Wordpress has a bunch of functions relating to handling short codes but the ones I was looking at were just the ones that handled the regex portion of the process. Is there something wrong with just using the few functions I need from Wordpress in my application? If it is ok, how do I go about giving credit in those sections. I did a quick check and Wordpress is licensed under GPLv2. I'm using the Kohana Framework in my application which is licensed under BSD. I'm not sure if that changes anything but I thought I'd include it just in case.
