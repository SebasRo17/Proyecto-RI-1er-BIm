Are there any risks in giving out distribution certification/private key/provisioning profile to a freelancer? The freelancer needs to build the binary for me to submit (I am okay with this because I don't own the source code of the app), I just want to know if there is any risk involved in sending the distribution cert/private key/provisioning profile to him? p.s. They don't have the iTunes connect/portal login. Updated: The freelancer will build the binary for me, and I will upload for them.
