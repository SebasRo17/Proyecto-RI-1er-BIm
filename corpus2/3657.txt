I am working with an array of textfiles, trying to see how frequent certain terms are. However, I am running into some difficulty with my running counts of bigram frequency. Here is a snippet of my code that has been giving me trouble:               SetDirectory[       "/users/ianmilligan/desktop/project/blah/blah/"];          filelist = FileNames["*bigrams.txt"];     citizenCounter97 = {};          Do[       citizenchecker97 = Get[file];       Clear[bigramHash];       (bigramHash[Sequence @@ #1] = #2) & @@@ citizenchecker97;       count = bigramHash["ottawa", "citizen"];       Print[ToString[file] <> ":" <> ToString[count]];       AppendTo[citizenCounter97, count];       , {file, filelist}];      The file that is being checked looks like this `citizenchecker97`=                 {{{"owner", "further"}, 262}, {{"on", "the"}, 206}, {{"the",        "women"}, 204}, {{"women", "s"}, 197}, {{"maritime",        "baptist"}, 195}, {{"and", "the"}, 193}, {{"for",        "the"}, 189}, {{"the", "maritime"}, 186}, {{"by",        "the"}, 180}, {{"with", "the"}, 170}, {{"the",        "missionaries"}, 146}, {{"that", "the"}, 142}, {{"the",        "mission"}, 141}...}}      As it stands, my `bigramHash` (which stems from an earlier exceptionally helpful SO answer) generates a number if the file contains that bigram (if it appears twice, it generates '2', which I want to `AppendTo` `citizenCounter97`. If it _doesn't_ contain the bigram, however, it generates `bigramHash[ottawa, citizen]`. My plan was to just generate a list, subsequently just `Cases[citizenCounter97,_Integer];` the thing, and have a sense of how often the given term appeared. Problem is, the results did not make sense. When I went in and started de- bugging, I realized that the counts that come out of `Print` were completley different than the lists it was generating! The result for `citizenCounter97` would be like this:               {2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, \     1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, \     2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, \     2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2,       bigramHash["ottawa", "citizen"], bigramHash["ottawa", "citizen"],       bigramHash["ottawa", "citizen"]}      Whereas the real `Print` output would show that the first 12 results were nothing, the 13th was 2, and then nothing again until 27, when it became 1. So basically, I am confused as to what's happening, why my counter is completely divergent from the reality as I do it manually/debug with `Print`. Thanks in advance, and happy to clarify as best I can. **---- edited to add ----** I suspect one solution lies in an `If` statement - i.e. `If` count is an integer, then append that; if the 'If' ends up being not an integer, then return 0. I've tried a variety of calls using `Head` however, and am still hitting a brick wall.
