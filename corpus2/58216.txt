DSolve[{RCS'[s] == SNPH[s] - Sqrt[R2[s] - RCS[s]^2]/b,SNPH'[s] == RCS[s]/a^2, R2'[s] == 2 RCS[s] SNPH[s], RCS[0] == 0., SNPH[0] == snal, R2[0] == ri2}, {RCS, SNPH, R2}, s ]; Here {a,b,snal,r12} are constants.In NDSolve a small shift given in boundary value trick works fine, showing that it is a proper integral. However, what are standard procedures as a workaround in DSolve ( no limits of integration assigned) when the integrand is not improper ?
