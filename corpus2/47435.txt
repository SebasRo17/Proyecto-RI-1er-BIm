Suppose I want to plot a surface defined by equations involving redundant variables. Consider, for example, plotting the surface defined by the equations: $$ \left\\{ \begin{array}{l} \cos x + \sin y = z^2+\cos w \\\ \sin w=0 \end{array} \right.$$ for $-2 \pi \leq x \leq +2\pi$, $-2 \pi \leq x \leq +2\pi$, $-2 \leq z \leq +2$. I have used the following code for this:               eqs = Flatten[ Quiet @ Eliminate[{Cos[x] + Sin[y] == z^2 + Cos[w], Sin[w] == 0},                                       {w}]];     ContourPlot3D[ Evaluate[eqs], {x, -2 π, 2 π}, {y, -2 π, 2 π}, {z, -2, 2}]      It works quite well for simple examples like this, but it is not a good alternative for similar problems involving more complex equations (or more redundant variables).   Is there a more efficient algorithm for plotting surfaces defined this way?
