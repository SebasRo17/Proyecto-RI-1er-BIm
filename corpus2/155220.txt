I have been programming since some years and I won't say its a piece of cake but in this field, you know how to do things. You can always google up resources, tutorials. There are tons of already written code to help you with - frameworks, libraries but if you compare it to other innovation fields like "Electronics". Its not too easy to get started with, the community might not be too large on the internet, getting the things right plus lets not forget there is nothing to tell you where the error might be. I have wanted many times but not be able to get into, like, building some kind of robot because I don't know how to start. So my question is that, does programming tends to be easy compared rest of the fields or is it just my interest that makes it easy?
