I have a **very** basic question, so sorry if this is not the place for it. If I have a file "config.php" with some configurations in some variables and in some page I include this file, each time the variables will be loaded again in the memory of the server? I think the answer is yes, but I'm not sure, I don't know to much of the PHP lifecycle. I don't know if I made myself clear, so here is an example. Suppose, I have the config.php file as:               <?php          $databaseConfig = array();          /* Sets the configurations inside the array */     ?>      Then my index.php page includes the file config.php. Each time the index is loaded the $databaseConfig array will be loaded into memory or just the first time and so when the page is requested again it doens't need to load it again? I really think that since PHP is stateless it will load again each time. Thanks very much in advance!
