I have data that is basically made up of a set of sessions filled with events. For example:               Session1 - [Event1] [Event2] [Event3]...[Event64]     Session2 - [Event1] [Event3] [Event4]...[Event64]      The data itself currently lies in a MySQL database in the following 2 tables:               sessions: id, time     events: sessionId, sequence, event      What I need to create are funnels in percentages that show the movement from one event to the next. I need a tool to analyze the sessions and output a combined "tree" of sorts, to show where most users went. Example:               START -> Event1 -- 50% --> Event 2                |                |                ----- 50 % --> Event 3 -- 20% --> Event 23                                  |                                  ------- 30% --> Event 24                                  |                                  ------- 50% --> Event 25      I can also assume for simplicity that no cycles are needed in the analysis. If for instance we come across these sessions:               [Event 1] [Event 2] [Event 3] [Event 2]     [Event 1] [Event 2] [Event 2]      Then the processed tree would be ordered like this:               [Event 1] -- 100% --> Event 2 -- 50% --> [Event 3] -- 100% --> [Event 2]                              |                              ------- 50% --> [Event 2]      I can also safely assume that all sessions start with [Event 1]. Now, I can always write some code to arrange data in a certain way but the analysis and visualization seems a bit complex. Also, the amount of sessions is rather large (a few millions). Is there any existing tool or framework that can help me analyze this?
