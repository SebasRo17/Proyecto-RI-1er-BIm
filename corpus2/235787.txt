My question will be about how do you think it would be fit to name some methods in a fluent interface. Let me try to demonstrate the problem. Consider this relation tree: ![associations](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SgfFs.png) A person can have dogs and cats, and a dog can have bones. Pretty simple. What i'm trying to do is create a domain specific fluent interface for determining, which ones of these relations does the user need. It is able to handle any depth of relationships. **I designed the operation something like this** (It is building the assoicaiton tree, from which i can determine, what the user wants): ![association tree building](http://i.stack.imgur.com/R1UCs.png) As code (it may be more readable):               personAssoc = person.associate().withCats().and().withDogs().withBones().up().done();       But i'm trying to make this part as intuitive as possible, so i wan't the **method names** to **make sense after each other** , and **be as close to spoken language as possible**. My biggest concerns are the following 3 method names:   1. **`and()`** in my language of choice `and` is a reserved keyword, so i can't use it. I looked up synonyms (`together()`, `including()`, `also()`) but they don't sound/look right (`and` means, that we will add more children to the parent association).   2. **`up()`** it is obviously breaking any kind of flow. With this method name, the whole thing became a lot further away from spoken language, than i wanted to (`up` means, we are not necessary wan't to add more relations to the parent, but we are done with the current one. In code it is the same as `and`).   3. **`done()`** is only called once, at the end of the method calls, but still doesn't fit the picture (`done` means, that we are literally done, we won't add more associations). **What i'm looking for** is other, better names for the above 3, which:   1. Which make the usage of the fluent interface closer to spoken language.   2. For `and` a name, which is as far as possible from any language keywords. If you read this whole thing, feel free to drop by any ideas, it might help me out a great deal! **Thank you for any suggestion.**
