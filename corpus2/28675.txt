I want to check when the expression $$ \sqrt{\sqrt{\lambda^{2}\left(2E+\lambda^{2}\right)}+E+\lambda^{2}} $$ is real, when it is purely imaginary and when it is complex (with imaginary part not zero). Also I would like to know the sign of the imaginary part in the case it is non-zero. To check the last part, after some steps, I am using `Reduce` for inequalities like $\mathrm{Im}\left(\sqrt{\lambda^{2}\left(2E+\lambda^{2}\right)}\right)>0 $ but this is taking a lot of time on _Mathematica_. Is there a way to get the kind of results that I want more quickly? The variables are real and the code I ran is                 Reduce[ Im[ Sqrt[ e + 位^2  -Sqrt[ 位^2 (2 e + 位^2)]]] > 0, {e, 位}]
