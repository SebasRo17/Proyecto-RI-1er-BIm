I have a feeling that there is something wrong in general with _Mathematica_ 's way of dealing with margins and spaces among/around objects in `Graphics`, `Grid`-s, and alike. This is a constant problem for me, and for many others I assume. I usually end up to do some pixel-pushing or other workarounds, but this is getting more and more annoying with every year. Consider the following example:                Panel[          Graphics[{Circle[]},             ImageSize -> 300, ImageMargins -> 0, ImagePadding -> 0,              Frame -> True, FrameTicks -> None, PlotRange -> {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}},              PlotRangePadding -> 0, Background -> White,              Method -> {"ShrinkWrap" -> True}],          FrameMargins -> 0, ImageMargins -> 0, ImageSize -> All,           Background -> Lighter[Pink, .6]]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KwgIS.png) I have two questions related to the code above: **Q1** : How to get rid of the pink frame margin without setting `Panel`'s `FrameMargins` explicitly to a negative number? I would assume, a zero-width margin is ... zero-width. **Q2** : Why does the ~~left~~ right and bottom part of the `Frame` of the internal `Graphics` disappear and how can I prevent it? **Edit** Various workarounds can be used, e.g. `Pane` or `Framed`. The problem with these is that they don't have the look and feel `Panel` provides:               CreateDialog[Pane[{1, 2, 3}], WindowTitle -> "Pane"];     CreateDialog[Framed@Pane[{1, 2, 3}], WindowTitle -> "Framed Pane"];     CreateDialog[Panel[{1, 2, 3}], WindowTitle -> "Panel"];      While `Panel` looks good in a dialog window, the other two do not. ![Pane, Panel, Frame](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WJyh3.jpg)
