I would like to export a _Grid_ object to a .pdf document (preferably as part of a notebook). Here's an example:               data = Notebook[        {Cell[          BoxData[           ToBoxes[            Grid[             {              {11, 22},              {33, 44}              },             Frame -> All,             FrameStyle -> Directive[Thickness[.1], Orange]             ](* end of Grid *)            ]           ]          ](* end of Cell *)         }];          Export[NotebookDirectory[] <> "grid.pdf", data];     SystemOpen[NotebookDirectory[] <> "grid.pdf"];      However, setting thickness of a grid in _FrameStyle_ has little to do with the outcoming table (only the upper line is ok). I've encountered a similar problem concerning _Dividers_ here: How to fix a PDF line rendering problem in V9 They say it's a bug appearing in MMA9 only (MMA8 is free of this problem. Sadly, it's not the version I get to use). Possible solution would be to export a _Notebook_ to .eps first, and then convert it to .pdf, which works for simple examples, however there are two reasons I can't use it. First - as I try to export my _Notebook_ to .eps, Mathematica crashes and quits to Windows (i use XP 32bit SP3). Secondly - I'd very much appreciate, if using programs other than MMA could be avoided. Is there another way of exporting a _Notebook_ to .pdf? Or meybe there's some unknown global option which can prevent aliasing? I will be grateful for any help. PS The thickness is broken only in .pdf - the notebook looks ok.
