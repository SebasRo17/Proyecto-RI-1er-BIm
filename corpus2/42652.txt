I'm looking into ways of improving requirements management. Currently, we have a Word document published on a Web site. Unfortunately, we cannot (to my knowledge) look at changes from one revision to the next. I would greatly prefer to be able to do so, much like with a wiki or VCS (or both, like the wiki's on bitbucket!). Also, each document describes changes devs are expected to meet by a given deadline. There is no collection of accumulated app features documented anywhere, so it's sometimes hard to distinguish between a bug and a (poorly- designed) feature when trying to make quick fixes to legacy apps. So I had an idea I wanted to get feedback on. What about:   1. Using a wiki so that we can track who changed what when (mostly to even see _if_ any edits were made since the last time one looked).   2. Having one, say, wiki page per product rather than one per deadline, keeping up with all features of the product rather than the changes that should be implemented. This way, I can look at a particular revision of the page to see what the app should do at a given point in time, and I can look at _changes to the page since the last release_ for the requirements to be implemented by the next deadline.
