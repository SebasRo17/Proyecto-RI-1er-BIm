After reading and asking about how to deal with git, Github, branching, versioning and tagging, it looks like the best way to denote a new version of software, is by marking the last commit of a specific version with a specific tag. A structure like this can be assumed:   * Commit 1   * Commit 2: Tag 1.0.0   * Commit 3   * Commit 4   * Commit 5: Tag 1.1.0   * Commit 6: Tag 1.1.0 Where once version 2.0.0 is released, most likely a 1.1.x branch is created to maintain the 1.1 release for hotfixes, etc. Now I am wondering how it is possible to integrate this with a CI, like Travis for example. What I do know is that:   * A Continuous Integration system, like Travis CI, gets triggered on every _commit_ to any branch, and it is possible to enable/disable this per branch. I am struggling to figure out if it possible at all to start a build once you have _tagged_ a certain commit, can anyone explain me how this can work?
