This question has come up while writing a simple text adventure game where your character has an inventory, which can include containers that also have things in them. I want a clean way to style the inventory output, like so:               You are carrying:         a bag containing:             a ring         a backpack containing:             a loaf of bread      Currently I just include the formatting in the result returned by the query, all in one shot. For example,               DoInventoryCommand():         result = QueryInventory(...recursively checks inventory adding multiples of tabs depending on nesting level...)         print(result)      What I would like is a cleaner separation between content and presentation so that the query would just return a data structure that a separate pass could style. But how should the styling pass handle the n-levels deep data structure? Just for example, how would a styling tool like CSS handle it? Do you need to procedurally generate the CSS once you have the data structure?
