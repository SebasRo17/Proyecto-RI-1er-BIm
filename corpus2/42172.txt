I am trying to make my own package based on the code from this Question. The following is the code from that page:               BeginPackage["SelectData`"];     select::usage = "select[data,where,condition]";     Begin["`Private`"]              ClearAll[select, where];         SetAttributes[where, HoldAll];         select[table : {colNames_List, rows__List}, w : (where[condition_] | None) : None,              cols : (columns[varNames__] | All) : All] :=           With[{namingRules = Dispatch[Thread[colNames -> Thread[Slot[Range[Length[colNames]]]]]]},              With[{cl = {varNames} /. namingRules /. Verbatim[Slot][n_] :> n},               If[cols === All, #, #[[All, cl]]] &@                 If[w === None,                    {rows},                    (* else *)                    With[{selF = Apply[Function, Hold[condition] /. namingRules]},                       Select[{rows}, selF @@ # &]                    ]                 ]             ]           ];           End[]     EndPackage[]      Then, on my notebook, use the following data as input:               table = List[{"ID", "Variable 1", "Variable 2"}, {"Alpha", 1,         0}, {"Beta", 1, 1}, {"Alpha", 0, 0}]      Call the package, Needs["SelectData`"] Evaluating, `select[table, columns["Variable 1"]]` the output is as follows:               select[{{"ID", "Variable 1", "Variable 2"}, {"Alpha", 1, 0}, {"Beta",         1, 1}, {"Alpha", 0, 0}}, columns["Variable 1"]]      I think I have done something wrong when creating my package, but I can't find it. Could anyone give me suggestions?
