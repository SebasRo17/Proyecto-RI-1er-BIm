I don't know even how to attempt this, or if it's possible. I would like to be able to examine conditions, data, status of email server on my work desktop from the programming cloud. I recognize that these are three different things (is an application running? does a file xxx.xls have data for something? are processes connected to the desktop running?). One might be do-able and the others not, so to be specific, I would like to be able to check for data, and maybe start applications on my desktop from the cloud. I this even possible?
