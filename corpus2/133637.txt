So my team and I are quite new to Scrum and today moved from estimating in Ideal Hours to Story Points. All seems sound rationale, BUT with timeboxed activities. Here is the case, we have an extremelly complex User Story that needs a spike so to explore underlying technical unknowns. With Ideal Hours it would be easy: timebox it to one ideal day (8 ideal hours). Now we want to account the exploratory work towards our velocity. So, the pressing question is how do we give Story Points to a timeboxed activity? Constraint: we do not know how to translate this 1 ideal day into Story Points because our historical data is badly collected and does not reflect reality.
