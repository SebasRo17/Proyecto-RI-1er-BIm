There are similar questions to this on the forum but none fit the purpose here: I would like to extract certain elements of a matrix depending on whether a factor is present or not, and create another matrix of the same size with those elements and zeros everywhere else. For example, given \begin{equation} \left [ \begin{array}{c c} a x & b x^2 \\ c y & d y^2 \end{array} \right ] \end{equation} I would like to create a new matrix with just the elements that have $x^2$ as a member and zeros everywhere else. \begin{equation} \left [ \begin{array}{c c} 0 & b x^2 \\ 0 & 0 \end{array} \right ] \end{equation} I've tried variants of things like this but can't get it to work               SIGMA = {{ a x , b x^2},{c y , d y^2}};          SIGMAx2 = Select[SIGMA , MemberQ[#, x^2] &];
