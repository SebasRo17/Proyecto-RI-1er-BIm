I wrote a function and saved it in a package. I saved a copy of the package in the Autoload folder too. I deployed a CDF that contains this function. When I open the CDF later, this function (which represents modified input fields) is not evaluated. But when I do any operation that evaluates this function (like a button click), it gets evaluated and the cdf works just fine. I am using Mathematica 9 to deploy the cdf and also to run it to check it. Updated, the package's code down below -               BeginPackage["ModifiedInputFields`"] InputFieldsCreation[noOfrows_,       noOfInputFields_] :=     (          Module[         {inputvaluelist = Table[0, {noOfrows}, {noOfInputFields}]},         (                 If[             (noOfrows > 0),             (*If noOfrows value is greater than 0*)                  (                 {                     Table[                              (                                 With[{i = i, j = j}, (Row[{                                              Dynamic[InputField[                                                     Dynamic[inputvaluelist[[i, j]]],                                                     Number,                                                     ContinuousAction -> True,                                                     ImageSize -> {50, 20},                                                     Alignment -> Center                                                        ]]                                         }])]                                 (*with is closed*)                                ),                                 {i, 1, noOfrows},                                 {j, 1, Length[Part[inputvaluelist, i]]}                         ],(*Table closed*)                     Dynamic[inputvaluelist]                 }                  ),             ("")           ]             )       ]     (*Module closed*)     )     EndPackage[]       What I am looking at is to also be able to extract all the inputs that the user gives in the input fields into a list that we pass on to other functions. So that is a critical feature, which I am worried might also be a reason for the package giving trouble at cdf startup.
