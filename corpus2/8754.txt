I know that one can retrieve PlotRange of a plot by using               AbsoluteOptions[plot,PlotRange]      but that won't work on Histogram. Here an example:               In[1099]:=          data = {-1.2056, -1.46192, -1.30053, -2.52879, -0.99636, -1.73904, -1.164,     -1.83398,-0.97505, -0.503256, -0.63802, -0.785963, -0.711821, -0.820439, -1.8699,     -3.9659, -1.4456, -1.67021, -1.42009, -2.5644, -1.45002, -1.27806, -1.66529,     -1.67073, -3.31102, -3.38638};     Histogram[%, PlotRange -> Automatic];     AbsoluteOptions[%, PlotRange]      When running the code I get the following message.               PlotRange::prng: Value of option PlotRange -> {{All,All},{-4.,0.}} is not All,     Full, Automatic, a positive machine number, or an appropriate list of range     specifications. >>      As I understood the documentation, PlotRange need to be of a certain format (e.g. two numbers) and `{{All,All},{-4.,0.}}` apparently does not fit to that format, for which reason Mathematica won't give me back the PlotRange of my histogram. Does anybody know how I can get the PlotRange of a Histogram anyway? By the way: In the first place, it will only make sense to get hold of the second value of PlotRange (in my example: `{-4.,0.}`) since one can calculate the first one for instance through `{0,Length[data]}`. Many thanks! John
