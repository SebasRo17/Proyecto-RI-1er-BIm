I need to construct a symbolic Hermitian matrix like               m = {          {           n, a, b, b},          {Conjugate[a], n, b, b},          ...         }      but I am not able to set the variables `n, a, b` in order to obtain a Hermitian matrix. I tried with `$Assumptions` but after that `HermitianMatrixQ[m]` gives me `False` as a result. I need that for a Cholesky decomposition of the `m` matrix.
