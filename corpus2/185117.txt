I was recently given the following task, and failed, the reason given that I misunderstood the question               Create a 'LibraryItem' interface.     Create 3 concrete implementations of LibraryItem: 'Book', 'CD', 'DVD'.     Apply the visitor pattern to your data model.     Write a MaximumBorrowTimeVisitor that computes the maximum time you can borrow a LibraryItem.     Create an arbitrary instance of a data model and apply the MaximumBorrowTimeVisitor.      I thought this was simple, and yet I failed the task. How would you solve this task?
