I have a method to be tested which depends on the OS, what's the best approach for testing the method depending on the OS? Is it to test on every OS that I have I require? Is there a better approach for running the tests on only one system? Some more specific information is that I have a method which is dependent on the OS using Python's `platform.system` method in a if-else statement and I need to test that which all the possible outcomes from this method. This method looks like:               def updateString():         if platform.system() == 'Darwin':             return "http://download.com/to/OSX/version"         elif platform.system() == 'Linux':             return "http://download.com/to/Linux/version"         elif platform.system() == 'Windows':             return "http://download.com/to/Windows/version"         else:              return "Seek advice on how to update."
