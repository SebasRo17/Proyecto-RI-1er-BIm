It is MWE, only a `Disk[]` that should print `"Click"` when clicked. Also `"date... updating"` should be printed on the first evaluation and on each update of variable `enabled`. (which is **constant** in this MWE) In the `Column` there is another `Dynamic` object which shows current `MousePosition`. And this element is responsible for printing (flooding) `"date... updating"` even though `enabled` is not changing.               DynamicModule[{enabled = True, pos},      Column[{             Dynamic[Print[DateString[] <> " updating"];                     EventHandler[Graphics@Disk[], {"MouseClicked" :> Print["Click"]}],                     TrackedSymbols :> {enabled}]             ,             Dynamic[pos]             }]      , Initialization :> (pos := MousePosition["Graphics"])]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/sUOS5.png) I think I don't understand this and IMO it is not expected or desired behaviour. When one put another `Print` next to `Graphics` you will see that it is in face whole `Graphics` updating. **So the question is** : If it's not a bug (I missed something) then how to recreate this MWE so it behaves correctly. * * * I think it may be (but not necessarily) related to Why does a heavy background slow LocatorPane from updating, even if only the locators are Dynamic? p.s. `Dynamic[Refresh[..., TrackedSymbols:>{enabled}]]` behaves the same way. * * * **Edit** so at the end it seems to be more related to Button evaluation inside DynamicModule
