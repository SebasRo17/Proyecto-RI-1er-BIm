I have _no choice_ but to work on my own, and can't find an adequate solution for getting my work looked over, sanity checked, having someone to brainstorm ideas with, discussing best practices and so on. I thought I'd get an answer via Jeff Atwood's article: In Programming, One Is The Loneliest Number, the best I could find on the subject, but it turned out to just reiterate my question. I know stack exchange sites such as this, and Code Review are an obvious potential answer, but as many would appreciate, it's FAR from ideal: While I can't list all the pitfalls, often, formulating a question and boxing it up into a self-contained problem often takes so much work that by the time you've prepared it sufficiently, you've answered your own question in more time than it would have taken otherwise. Also, hiding away details to ask a well defined question eliminates the possibility of someone spotting problems you hadn't thought of. Also, while I can't quite put my finger on it, the responsiveness of free conversation can't be matched by the any form of textual internet discussion that I can think of. Last but not least, I don't want to post my whole project for the world to look at for the rest of eternity, for obvious reasons. Are there any answers other than paying a consultant to look over my code?
