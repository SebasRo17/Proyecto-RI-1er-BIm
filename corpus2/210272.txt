I really don't know where else to ask. So here it goes.   I'm working at a very tiny company that makes ERP software and websites.   1 developer with + 10 years experience.   2 developers with + 3years experience.   3 developers with + 1 year experience.      That's it.   No team, no DBA, no system admin.   There is no one around here who has expertise in web development, so I happened to be in charge of web development. But I've only got 3 years experience ! as a developer !.      I know in a small company, you are asked to do lots of different things but is it too much, if I have to do sysadmin, database architecture, software design and development ? Oh plus I'm asked to do all that across different platforms.   I am currently working with JSP, ASP, MSSQL, MySQL, Oracle, Windows Server, and Linux.   In database, I do from writing queries to backup & recovery.   Server setup, system crash recovery, DB & Server migration also.   Plush HTML, Javascript and CSS :)   Number of projects that I'm in charge of : 5   I'm not an expert at all of them !   I have to search the Internet, read tutorials and ask questions in StackOverflow to get all that done !      So I ask you, is this normal ?   Is this a normal practice ?   Will I face the same situation whichever small company I go ?   I'm working in South Korea.   How is it in your country ?      **P.S** Thank you all for your opinion. I was going to upvote all of you because all of you helped me see it in a different way, but apparently you need 15 reputation to upvote :(
