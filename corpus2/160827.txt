Basically I would like to know how apps such as hotmail receive emails in realtime, without making periodic checks on the server - I've sent an email to myself from outlook with hotmail open and saw this in the console a couple of seconds later - GET http://sn108w.snt108.mail.live.com/mail/messageshelper.mvc the contents of which is the html to update, but I'd like to know what listens for the get request which presumably fires some javascript to update the dom? My question isn't specific to hotmails methodolgy in fact far from it as they will be working on the .NET platform whereas my proficiencies (if you can call them that!) are in the LAMP stack but any reading material on the subject would be great, thanks!
