I have years of Java coding experience, but no apps or code samples of my own. 1)Will an Android/iOS app help me get into Enterprise Java work, or because the fields are so different will it be irrelevant? 2)If (1) is irrelevant, what else can I do to avoid becoming a front end(HTML/CSS) web developer/designer. Thank you
