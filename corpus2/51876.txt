I want to solve a system of differential equations and each time I want to change two parameters. To prevent wrong result I want to clear every assignment after solving the equations in each iteration. I have a `Do`-loop with two iterator. The problem is that if I use `Clear["Global`*"]` then the outer iterator will not be accessible to the code inside the loop. Here is an example:               Do[{Print[a]; Clear["Global`*"];}, {a, 1, 2}, {b, 1, 2}]      Result: > >     1 >   >     a >   >     2 >   >     a >   As you can see the iterator `a` is erased for the inner iterator `b`. How can I resolve this issue? I expect the outer iterator to be printed each time. There are 4 iteration in total, so I expect to get: > >     1 >     1 >     2 >     2 >   I want both iterators, a and b, in spite of using Clear command to be accessible to the code inside loop. I want to clear everything after each iteration except iterators a and b.
