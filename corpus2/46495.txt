I have the following code:               Module[{n = 300, p = 0.29},        RegionPlot[{y > (1/2)*(n - x) && y + x <= n && y > p/(1 - p)*x},          {x, 0, n}, {y, n, 0}, FrameLabel -> {"x", "y"},          PlotStyle -> {Directive[Yellow, Opacity[0.5]]}]]      which will give you the yellow region on the LHS in the figure below. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KTtZC.png) **Question** : I want to revert the y-axis of the RegionPlot so that the axis will look like the RHS in the figure above and the position and the shape of the region change accordingly. This would be the first step to make a ternary RegionPlot.
