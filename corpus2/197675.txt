I've just been told by my boss that I will receive a negative performance review on Monday. He wants to talk to me about why I am so slow and why my bug fix rate is so low. I love programming and solving problems but I actually do find my job really really hard. I've actually been a programmer for about 10 years. But this is my first multithreading embedded linux job - I've been here 2 years and it's obvious to everyone that I'm still struggling. And I think I've become so demoralised and feel so marginalised that I've lost a lot of the fire that I had at the start of the job. Has anyone ever been in a similar situation and how do you go about increasing your bug fix rate? * * * Update: I had the review. I have been put on a 3 month 'employee development program' (of the type mentioned by Dunk ). Not sure whether I can turn this around. But even if I do have to move on, I've learned a lot from this experience. ## Another Update It's now about 6 weeks since the first review. My advice to anyone facing the same situation is to be humble enough to take criticism and learn from your mistakes. And to not be afraid to look dumb. Ask loads and loads of questions. Let people know you're trying to learn and keep asking until you understand. But be prepared for it not to work out. I'm constructing a portfolio of code ... as well as giving it my best shot. ## Yet another update I am hesitant to put this on here, since I'm concerned that I will not be able to refer future employers to my stackoverflow profile... But anyway, it might be of interest for someone reading this question, but I actually lost my job a few weeks ago. I'm in the midst of brushing up on all the skills I need to - I've taken a lot from the advice given here.
