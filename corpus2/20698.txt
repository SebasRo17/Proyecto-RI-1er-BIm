I have the following two lists (each containing over 500,000 elements). Here is a sample:               lis1 = { {1.86582, 1.70162, 1.25256}, {1.82707, 1.29901, 1.10659},        {1.76547, 1.21544, 1.09433}, {1.18306, 1.28322, 1.75524},        {1.12555, 1.98011, 1.53359}, {1.10584, 1.12299, 1.88411},        {1.83799, 1.5275, 1.76179}, {1.42352, 1.45163, 1.45318},        {1.63669, 1.78145, 1.60307}, {1.61749, 1.44287, 1.57405}      };      and               lis2 = {0.826095, 0.73286, 0.918137, 0.937434, 0.506525,              0.562795, 0.664915, 0.789321, 0.6559, 0.398447}      They both have equal `Length`s. I want to combine both Lists to obtain a new list that looks like this               { {1.86582, 1.70162, 1.25256, 0.826095},      {1.82707, 1.29901, 1.10659, 0.73286},      {1.76547, 1.21544, 1.09433, 0.918137},      {1.18306, 1.28322, 1.75524, 0.937434},      {1.12555, 1.98011, 1.53359, 0.506525},      {1.10584,1.12299, 1.88411, 0.562795},      {1.83799, 1.5275, 1.76179, 0.664915},      {1.42352, 1.45163, 1.45318, 0.789321},      {1.63669, 1.78145,1.60307, 0.6559},      {1.61749, 1.44287, 1.57405, 0.398447} }      That is, each element of the combined list contains the corresponding elements of `lis1` and `lis2`, with the first three elements being from `lis1` and the fourth element from `lis2`. Here is what I did to combine them in this fashion:               Transpose[{lis1, lis2}] //. {{a_, b_, c_}, d_} :> {a, b, c, d}      Is there a faster way to achieve this as my lists are huge ?
