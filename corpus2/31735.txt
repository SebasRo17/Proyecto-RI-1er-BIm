How can I find the _default_ font parameters (family, size, etc.) for the text that appears in `Graphics` produced by `Plot`, `ListPlot`, `LogPlot`, etc.? I'm interested not only in the font specs used for axis and plot labels, but also (and importantly) in those for the numbers displayed next to tick marks. EDIT: At the moment there appears to be two entirely different ways to set these parameters, and it is not clear to me which one takes precedence. One, suggested by ybeltukov, is through `Format->EditStylesheet...`. The other one, described in the post linked to by Kuba, is through `SetOptions[Graphics, BaseStyle -> {...}]`.
