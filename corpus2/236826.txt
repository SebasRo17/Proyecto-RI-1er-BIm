New technologies can accomplish existing tasks in more efficient and powerful way. But sometimes old technologies cannot be discarded unfortunately, so more numbers of technologies in one system make maintain difficult. Is it worth to introduce new technologies? For instance, a legacy system uses SOAP internally and JSON is new technology to replace the SOAP. The problem is JSON can only replace **some** of SOAP, because the rest of SOAP is too complex to replace. As a result, the system will use both SOAP and JSON at same time. The maintain is even more difficult than before. Is it reasonable to introduce new technologies to replace **part** of old ones?
