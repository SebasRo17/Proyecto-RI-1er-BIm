I want to make Private functions. From my point of view, being a Private function means that the function is not accessible from other packages. For that purpose I wrote the following code. But my private function can be called in another package. I don't want that.               (*Package 1*)     BeginPackage["Test1`"];     Begin["`Private`"];     Test1`Private`function1[x_] := x     End[];     EndPackage[];     (*Package 2*)     BeginPackage["Test2`"]     function2[x_] := Test1`Private`function1[x]     EndPackage[]      As you can see from the above code, `function1` is a private function in `Test1`. That same function when called in `Test2` is still accessible, but I don't want that. How can I resolve this. Can anyone help me?
