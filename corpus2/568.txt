Managed OSes like Microsoft Singularity and JNode are quite an interesting concept. Essentially, the OS is bootstrapped with code written in a low-level language (C/C++/Assembly), which essentially implements a virtual machine. The rest of the OS (and all userland apps) run on the virtual machine. There are some great things about this. For example, you suddenly make arbitrary pointers obsolete. And if well written, you get rid of a ton of legacy crud that most modern OSes currently have. However, as a disadvantage, you're that much farther away from the hardware, and as a developer, you lose the ability to drop down to a lower level of abstraction and get your hands dirty. What are your opinions on this?
