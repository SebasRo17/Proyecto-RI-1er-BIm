The `Graph` command displays edge labels in `TraditionalForm`. I instead want to use `StandardForm`. I tried `EdgeLabelStyle -> Directive[StandardForm, Background -> White]`, but of course it does not work. So how to do it, acting on `EdgeLabelStyle`? Edit: Comment to @Sjoerd examples Your Binomial example is somewhat misleading, since Binomial has an intrinsic TraditionalForm version. What we are seeing in the graph is a sort of hybrid of Standardform (for n and k) and TraditionalForm for the parenthesis (I think). This is the proof: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mXV9D.png) As you see, even though I used braces in the notation, I still get the parenthesis in the graph (from the internal TraditionalForm), but the n, k are indeed in StandardForm. This shows that the "StandardForm" in EdgelabelStyle does something, but it is not enough. Perhaps it is possible to play with BaseStyle? The same thing happens if you use MakeBoxes (without ToString).
