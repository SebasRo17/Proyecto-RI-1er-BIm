About 600 customers use our application. We have very detailed logs for everything that happens in the application, from changes in the data model, memory and CPU/GPU usage to clicks on the UI elements. We want to be able to parse the logs coming from these customers and analyze them to understand how users use our application and what happens internally in the application. Is there a log analyzer that can produce such reports automatically?
