Say I have a function $f$ of $n$ complex variables, $\{ z_i \}_{i=1}^{i=Nc}$. And then I want to contour integrate the expression such that for each $z_i$ its an integration on an unit circle about the origin in the complex plane: $$\oint_{\cal C}\cdots \oint_{\cal C} f(z_1,\cdots, z_n) d z_1 .. d z_n$$ I would guess that in some sense this should pick out the "residue" of the n-dimensional complex function $f$. (...I am not exactly sure of a residue interpretaton for such contour integrations on the complex plane...) I would like to know how to set this up in Mathematica (..hopefully as a residue finding problem..)
