I am wondering why I am receiving the message "The integrand ... has evaluated to non-numerical values for all sampling points in the region ..." for a particular calculation I am running. How can I change my code so that this is not an issue? A simple example is copied below.               a = 1/20; b = 1/5;     FF[y_] := Exp[I a y - 1/2 b^2 y^2];     f[x_] := NIntegrate[E^(-I x y) FF[y], {y, 0.0, 100}];     NIntegrate[f[x], {x, -100, 100}]      Thanks...
