I keep hearing from people that if I don't become a programmer soon after graduation my degree will be a useless piece of paper, they claim it will become outdated. I kind of find this hard to believe considering what I was taught at a fairly good school has been standard practice for some time. So is this a true belief in industry? That somehow I become less desirable after a year or two, even though the graduates who comes after me pretty much get the same identical education.
