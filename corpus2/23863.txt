I am finding a local maximum of a curve and I want to make the plot easier to read. I added a point to where the maximum is but I would also like to: 1) add a tick with text below it where the x value of the maximum is (saying "Xmax" or " X* ") 2) a dotted line from the point down to the x-axis. Here is a simpler version of the plot I'm making:               maxi = FindMaximum[Cos[x], {x, 4, 8}];     coordin = {x /. maxi[[2]], First[maxi]};     Plot[Cos[x], {x, 0, 4 \[Pi]}, Epilog -> {PointSize[Large], Point[coordin]}]      I have pictures to better explain this but I'm not allowed to post images.
