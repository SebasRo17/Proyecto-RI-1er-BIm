I have dataset that is contain 150 data that is actually divided into 3 group. Each group has itâ€™s own label. I do clustering process with K-means algorithm to group the data. I need to assign the label of each group that is created by K-means process. So I could compare the result of K-means with the data training. Anybody could help to explain how to determine the label of each group?
