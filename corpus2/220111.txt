I want to find the playback position of a known audio track by listening with another device. Ideally the listening device wouldn't need a full copy of the audio, but some kind of hash of it, as the target audio might be long (this is for displaying the position while watching a film). I've had a small look into acoustic fingerprinting tools - though I'm searching for the position rather than from a set of songs and I'd like the recognition to be active so would rather not be polling a service. My initial thoughts are to sample a few frequencies (so that the entire audio track isn't required), and use Dynamic Time Warping to search for a matching region of the track. I've not got huge experience with audio processing, so I was wondering if there was a more efficient/robust approach to this.
