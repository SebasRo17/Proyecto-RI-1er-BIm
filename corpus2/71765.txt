My box is configured: Ubuntu, Code::Blocks IDE, GNU gcc compiler. I'm not very experienced in C. I am having some difficulty seperating what functions are available to me. Evidently there's a few different compiler versions and they have different libraries available. Is there an official GNU gcc compiler reference for C? I've considered buying K&R, but I think that is too much for someone at my skill level. Do you have any other tips for free C references considering my setup?
