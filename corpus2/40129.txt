I am a statistician who is very new to Mathematica. Ultimately I would like to be able to graph convolutions of arbitrary user defined functions. But I can't as yet obtain values of such convolutions even at single points, unless the convolution can be expressed in terms of builtin functions.               f[x_] := x^0.5 (1 - x)^0.4 UnitBox[x - 0.5]     g[y_] := Convolve[f[x], f[x], x, y]     g[0.2]          (* Out: Convolve[(1 - x)^0.4 x^0.5 UnitBox[-0.5 + x], (1 -          x)^0.4 x^0.5 UnitBox[-0.5 + x], x, 0.2] *)
