I ran across this question on SO: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7373066/webpage-source-code-incomplete- hidden-code Without trying to infer too much or start a side-discussion of the sort that SO discourages, I think it's fair to conclude that the OP is someone who is familiar with HTML, Javascript, CSS and the basic architecture of the Web. Yet this question suggests that they have never worked with code that used a traditional `form` post. Is it really the case that people starting to work in the Web nowadays don't learn about that crufty old stuff any more? I don't even mean this question to be as crotchety as it probably sounds. I'm not suggesting people learn about `<marquee>`, implement all UI layout in tables, dynamic content with `document.write` etc. But form posts seem like one of those critical pieces a person should understand, specifically before getting into Ajax. Did I stumble on an anomaly or a trend here? Am I wrong?
