So I can create a 2D image that looks like               contourplot =       ContourPlot[       Sin[ x/2] Cos[y], {x, -4 \[Pi], 4 \[Pi]}, {y, -4 \[Pi], 4 \[Pi]},        PlotRange -> All, BaseStyle -> 30]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/o3Bx2.jpg) Notice there is no frame around the image as a whole. Now I want to use this in a 3D plot using the following command               backgroundimage =        Graphics3D[{Texture[contourplot],          Style[Polygon[{{-1000, -500, -500}, {-1000, 500, -500}, {-1000,              500, 500}, {-1000, -500, 500}},            VertexTextureCoordinates -> {{0, 0}, {1, 0}, {1, 1}, {0, 1}}],           Lighting -> {{"Ambient", White}}]}];               Show[backgroundimage, Boxed -> False, ImageSize -> 800,       ViewPoint -> {2, -2, .3}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KfMpt.jpg) A black border has been added around the 3D object. How can I remove this border? Or is there some way to just make it white? Thanks
