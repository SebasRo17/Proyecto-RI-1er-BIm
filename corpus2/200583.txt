I am learning Android programming and right now and i'm reading about fragments. I understand what fragments are, but either the tutorial is missing some steps or i'm missing something. So my question is when developing an Android UI, what are the benefits, if any, to using fragments as apposed to single page layouts? Are fragments more common than single page layouts or is it more based on the situation. Also, if fragments are more common, do you try to structure most situations so that fragments work?
