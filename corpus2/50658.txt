Is there a possible way to clear the arguments passed to a module to release some memory. I believe that arguments passed to modules are passed by value rather than pass by reference. e.g. I have the following module               DoSomething[arglist_,arglist2_]:=Module[{localvar},     Some long computations...     (*Clear arglist here*)     Some further long computations...     (*Is it possible to reassign some other value to arglist here? e.g. arglist={1,2}*)     ];      I've tried to use Clear[arglist] but i've got the following Clear::ssym error, however Clear[localvar] was fine. All I wan't is to release some memory because my arglist_ is a list of million sublists and tens of elements in each sublist. Secondly Is it possible to reassign some other value to arglist here? e.g. arglist={1,2} within a module. Thanks in advance for the help.
