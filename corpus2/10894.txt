Is it possible to calculate segment length, segment diameter and branch angles for three dimensional geometry. Geometry contains vertex points and polygon surfaces as                 file = "http://i.stack.imgur.com/N6RYT.png";       Import[file, "Graphics3D"]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/N6RYT.png)                 data = Import[file, "VertexData"];       polysurface = Import[file, "PolygonData"];       Graphics3D[Point@data]
