If you consider the following `Polygon`:               coor = {{6, 0}, {6, 1}, {4, 0}, {5, 2}};     (* and coor = {{7, 2}, {7, 1}, {5, 2}, {6, 1}} *)     pol = Polygon@coor;     Graphics@pol      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BQWUW.png) I would like to know if there is any way to rebuild it _automatically_ in order to remove the self intersection. Self intersection can be check thanks to J.M.'s comment by:               interPolQ = Not@Graphics`Mesh`SimplePolygonQ[#]&;     interPolQ@pol      > True Knowing that `Graphics`Mesh`SimplePolygonQ[]` is undocumented I'm wondering if there is a hidden built-in function for that purpose as well. * * * The output should look like the following and have for coordinates `desiredcoor`:               coor = {{6, 0}, {6, 1}, {4, 0}, {5, 2}};     desiredcoor = {{4, 0}, {6, 0}, {6, 1}, {5, 2}};     Graphics[{EdgeForm[Dashed], FaceForm@Opacity@.2, Polygon@{coor, desiredcoor}}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TWkJd.png)
