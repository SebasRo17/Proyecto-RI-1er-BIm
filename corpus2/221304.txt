In the higher order function fold/reduce what is the name, if any, of the functional argument? I am working on a monadic tabular processing library where rows are folded to produce simple analyses (like finding the minimum, maximum, average of a column). I am therefore looking for a sound name for the argument of the `fold` function and any name which is well-established in the ML community (or Haskell or Common Lisp as second and third candidates) would be interesting. A name like `f` is common in the description of `fold` functions, it is however undescriptive and a noun would be better suited.
