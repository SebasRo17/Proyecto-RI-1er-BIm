As I understand, the idea with Agile methodologies is that you deliver something functional and you deliver it often. The application gets into its final shape increment after increment. But in the early iterations you might build the framework or foundations on which the application will stand so it's something important but not visible to users. What gets delivered to the client in these first iterations? How do you show progress in the right direction when you build scaffolding code?
