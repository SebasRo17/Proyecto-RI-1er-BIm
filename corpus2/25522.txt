If you evaluate a `DocumentNotebook[]` expression in the front-end, it nicely displays inline, inside of an output cell in the current notebook: ![DocumentNotebook displayed](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pjdQb.png) For my purposes, `TextCell` and `ExpressionCell` expressions are insufficiently flexible. So (as in the question Combination of CellPrint and PrintTemporary, or DisplayForm for Cells), I'm programmatically generating some formatted output that generates raw `Cell[]` box expressions. For instance, the output might be               cell = Cell[TextData[{"Function ",         Cell[BoxData[FormBox[RowBox[{"f","(","x",")"}],             TraditionalForm]], FormatType->"TraditionalForm"]}],        "Subsection"];      (where $f(x)$ will actually be some complicated expression). Unfortunately, `DocumentNotebook[]` seems to require `TextCell`/`ExpressionCell` and doesn't work when given `Cell[]`s: ![DocumentNotebook with Cell](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6acGn.png) So I tried using `Notebook[]` instead, which does work with `Cell[]`s. However, evaluating a `Notebook` expression doesn't display in the front-end: ![Notebook](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YKO1U.png) It displays correctly when I run `NotebookPut@Notebook@{cell}`, but in a new window. **How can I get it to display inline in the current notebook, like how`DocumentNotebook` displays?** I tried wrapping it in `CellPrint` and in `DisplayForm`, but those don't work for `Notebook[]`s. Relatedly, what's the difference between `DocumentNotebook` (and friends) and `Notebook`? Both appear to be intended to represent a notebook as an expression, but as I discovered they behave slightly differently.
