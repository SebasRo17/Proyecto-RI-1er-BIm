I have to programmatically distribute a set of items to some entities, but there are rules both on the items and on the entities like so:               Item one: 100 units, only entities from Foo     Item two: 200 units, no restrictions     Item three: 100 units, only entities that have Bar          Entity one: Only items that have Baz     Entity one hundred: No items that have Fubar      I only need to be pointed in the right direction, I'll research and learn the suggested methods.
