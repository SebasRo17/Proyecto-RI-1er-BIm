Suppose you have to rewrite an entire application using Agile methodologies, how would you do it? I guess you could write a big bunch of user stories based in the behavior of your current system. And then implement them in small iterations. But this wouldn't mean that we have the requirements **UP FRONT**?? Also, when would you start releasing? Agile says we should release early and often, but it doesn't make much sense to release before the complete rewrite has been completed.
