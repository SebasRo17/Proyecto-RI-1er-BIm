I am new to this and also a new 19 year old PHP developer that just got hired so I am unsure as to how this works. Many companies when developing their websites keep their sites hidden from being indexed. What are some ways html5/css and then php/mysql work is hidden from search engines? If I am not wrong, these are the techniques:   1. Offline development: using local storage to render html/css; not sure how PHP/mysql would work with that.    2. Using .htaccess to prevent access   3. Using VPN to prevent access.
