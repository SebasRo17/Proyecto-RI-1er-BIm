Consider the following minimal example package:               BeginPackage["Test`"];          DuplicateNotebook::usage = "Makes a copy of the notebook";          Begin["`Private`"];          DuplicateNotebook[] :=        NotebookPut @ NotebookGet[EvaluationNotebook[]];       ex2 =          Grid[{{Item[ButtonBar[{             Style["Duplicate", 10] :> DuplicateNotebook[],             Style["Quit Kernel", 10] :> FrontEndTokenExecute["EvaluatorQuit"]}],            Alignment -> {Right, Top}]}}];       SetOptions[EvaluationNotebook[],          DockedCells -> Cell[BoxData[ToBoxes[ex2]], "SystemDockedCell"]];          End[];          EndPackage[];      **So what's happening?** The function `DuplicateNotebook[]` defined in the package doesn't get called when the button is clicked, but calls of type `FrontEndTokenExecute["EvaluatorQuit"]` work. What's more, this code was working perfectely well in _Mathematica_ V9, but now in _Mathematica_ V10, I can't get it working without putting the function body directly into `DockedCells`, which of course is a very messy solution. Therefore I'm looking for better workarounds. This seems to be a problem with `DockedCells` context, because putting the cell in the notebook (not in `DockedCells`) works. However adding context information to the call didn't work (I've tried `Test`DuplicateNotebook[]`) Zipped version of the test package http://cl.ly/2C3U2O2n0y21
