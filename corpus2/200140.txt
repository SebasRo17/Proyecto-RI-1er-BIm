Currently, I am using Android/Java. I am looking for the most efficient means to determine the average of the highest 100 pixel values taken from a greyscale preview. The preview part I am more or less okay with; however, it determining which sorting methodology is the most efficient. The other option is to apply a threshold, which will eliminate most of the data. Which sorting algorithm would be most efficient for an unsorted data set of over 3 million values?
