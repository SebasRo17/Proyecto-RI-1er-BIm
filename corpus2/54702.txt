I would like to analyze close-up images of human hair. My goal is to detect and count the number of hair strands and determine their width, but I am having a hard time binarizing the image. Seems like there is too much noise. Any suggestions ? Image is below: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Oq8j2.jpg) I used the following code and got a result that does not detect all the hairs:               arm2 = ColorNegate[DeleteSmallComponents[Binarize[arm, 0.42]]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/NYMyW.jpg)
