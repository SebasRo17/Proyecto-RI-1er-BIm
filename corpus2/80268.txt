I have seen many job posting with normal technical skills required but there are few thing mentioned in them , which i have no idea actually how can i go about improving them or how should i prove them that i know this   1. Software development lifecycle quality control   2. Setting up version control in a traditional dev/test/stage/production environment with firewalls between stage and production.Note: setting up not just using version control.   3. Automating and optimising software release processes   4. Simultaneous database updates and code revisions   5. Releases to distributed server farms in multiple locations   6. Setting up error checking, error reporting processes and alert systems   7. Knowledge of search technologies is highly desirable.   8. Agile Programming Methodology and Unit testing Experience Now i want to know from experienced programmers or job interviewers how much deeply they ask for these things. The reason i am asking this is that if someone can guide how can i learn those so that at least i can have those thing in resume so that i can get an edge over those who have not written anything about it. I don't want to tell lie but what i want to do is apply those small to some websites so that at least i can tell them i covered this here. I have 6 months free time before i go to my country to start applying for jobs, so i am just searching for jobs requirements so that i am capable of write them in my resume.
