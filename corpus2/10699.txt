When solving transcendental equations, `Solve` frequently warns us that inverse functions are being used so that some solutions may not be found. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZfqAV.png) We also see that `Reduce` might provide a more complete solution and, indeed, simply changing `Solve` to `Reduce` provides a complete, quantified result. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/NIQ6q.png) Somtimes, however, this same message is produced by `DSolve`. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7Mhfz.png) My guess is that `DSolve` calls `Solve` which in turn generates the message. Is it possible, though, to access `Reduce` through `DSolve`? For this particular equation, it would be easy enough to separate variables, `Integrate` and then apply `Reduce`. I'm wondering about a more general solution, though.
