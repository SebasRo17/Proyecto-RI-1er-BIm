I am author of growing framework, which is focused around User Interface building in PHP. Essential requirements for the up-coming website redesign is ability to **run code examples**. I am willing to extend this option to add-on authors which would mean **other people** will be able to execute code on my server. Please suggest how to securely set up the environment which would allow me execute 3rd party PHP code built on my framework. I'd like to hear ideas from someone who have had experience with building sandboxed solutions.
