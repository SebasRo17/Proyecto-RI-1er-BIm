I have a lot of points like $\\{\\{x_1,y_1,z_1\\},\\{x_2,y_2,z_2\\},...,\\{x_n,y_n,z_n\\}\\}$ which obtained by a function $z=f[x,y]$, and I want to find the max point of $z$, say $z_i$, and return the point coordinents $\\{x_i,y_i,z_i\\}$. How do I do? I have checked the help, but find there is no function can return the point coordinents from a list.
