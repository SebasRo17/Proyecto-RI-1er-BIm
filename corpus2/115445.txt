I am a Junior Web Programmer who is tasked with redesigning our website. Right now the website is made in ActionScript using the FLEX API(so its Flash based). **I am looking for advice on what technologies I can use to create interactive websites.** The website requirements I have been given are:   \- must work & look the same on iOS browsers   \- should include animation, element movement & show detailed graphics   \- look exactly the same across browsers _What technologies are available to me to create a website with these features?_ I know of so far:   \- Flash based websites can achieve this (ActionScript)   \- JQuery can create rich dialogs (not sure if it does graphic animation or has cross browser compatibility, does it?)   \- Can I use .NET for this? Would that mean I write the website in ASP .NET? \- Raphael.js - can rotate & animate images, is it cross browser?   \- Any others that you know of? What other technologies are out there that I dont know of?
