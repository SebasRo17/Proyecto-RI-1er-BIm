While looking in the help manual of Mathematica concerning the ItoProcess function I found the following: ItoProcess[{a,b,c},x,t]: represents an Ito Process **y(t)=c(t,x(t))** , where **dx(t)=a(t,x(t))dt+b(t,x(t)).dw(t)** In order to replicate and Plot this, I entered the following code:               (*Defining a process y(t)=c((xt)), where \[DifferentialD]x(t)=μ\     \[DifferentialD]t+σ\[DifferentialD]w(t)*)          ItoProcess[\[DifferentialD]x[         t] == μ \[DifferentialD]t + σ \[DifferentialD]w[t],       c[x[t]], {x, 0}, t, w \[Distributed] WienerProcess[]]      Then I wanted to Plot one process by implementing drift and volatility.               (*Simulation of one Ito Process with μ=0.1 and σ=0.2, \     starting value x=0*)          testprocess5 =       ItoProcess[\[DifferentialD]x[t] ==         0.1 *\[DifferentialD]t + 0.2 *\[DifferentialD]w[t],     c[x[t]], {x, 0}, t, w \[Distributed] WienerProcess[]]       Concerning this code I got the same output like in the Mathematica help manual just the drift and the volatility were substituted by 0.1 and 0.2 respectively. However, when I tried to plot the process it did not work out.               ListLinePlot[      Table[RandomFunction[         testprocess5, {0 (*startis from t=0*), 5 (*ends at t=5*),           0.01 (*Δt*)}] ["Path"], {1(*number of paths*)}],       Joined -> True, AxesLabel -> {"time", "value"}, ImageSize -> 400,       PlotRange -> All]      I am not sure, why it is not workling, maybe it could be due to y (t) = c ((xt)). Does anyone of you have a solution for this problem or a suggestion how to change the code? thanks
