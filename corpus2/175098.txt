In objective C, I have a situation where I would like to have an abstract protocol (interface) with 5 methods and 4 properties, but at the same time, I'd like to have a common implementation of 3 of those 5 methods. So my question is, is it ok to 1) have just an interface declaration with all the method and property declarations, 2) have a base class that adheres to that protocol (implements that interface) but also provides a common implementation of some of those classes, and only has empty stub method implementations for the rest of the methods, and then finally, 3) have a bunch of subclasses (from that base class), that will conform to that protocol - but - also inherit common method implementations -and - implement on their own those stub methods?
