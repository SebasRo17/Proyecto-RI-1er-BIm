I'm building an application which fetches large amount of items with ajax requests via other application API. It returns me 6k - 30k js objects which are used multiple times across various application views (sorting, filtering etc.). I would like to avoid querying API every time for such big list so I decided to cache this data somehow. I was thinking about various solutions:   * saving it to localstorage,   * using some caching library (e.g. locachejs),   * storing in js var. I'm not an expert so I would like to hear Your suggestions about each (or one of these) solution, about its pros and cons. Every help will be very appreciated.
