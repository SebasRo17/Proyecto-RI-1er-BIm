I'm writing an article for my blog about undocumented functions which exist in the _dwmapi.dll_ library. I want to post the result of the disassembled code to explain how the names and parameters of these functions are obtained, something like the article from this blog. **This is only for educational purposes** to show a couple of samples using these undocumented functions. So the question is: _Can I post the disassembled code of this library on my blog?_ **UPDATE :** There exist a couple of applications like Aura which uses these undocumented functions (DwmGetColorizationParameters, DwmSetColorizationParameters), obviously the authors in some point disassembled the _dwmapi.dll_ file in order to get the parameters and functions names. But they (the authors) only publish the final source code to access to these functions. This makes me think that _I can disassemble in private a Microsoft dll and then publish an application or source code based in this research_. Is this correct?
