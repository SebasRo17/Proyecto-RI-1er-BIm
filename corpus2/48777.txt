Probably a very easy question, but I could not find the answer, so it would be very nice if you can help me: Let us say I have 10 files, all with the extension `.dat`. Using               data = Import[#, "Table"] & /@ FileNames["*.dat"];       I can import all .dat files in a folder. However, I want _Mathematica_ to order these .dat files by their alteration date just like I can do it under Windows with a right click > Sort by > alteration date. I want _Mathematica_ to import the files in exactly this order. How might I do this?
