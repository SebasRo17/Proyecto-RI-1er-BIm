This question is related to data analysis introduced here Why do some flag images from the `CountryData` dataset render at very low resolution both in Front End and when exported in PDF? (Here Philippines and UnitedKingdom as examples: flag images were not searched exhaustively). ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/x3eia.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/C2gxv.png) To reproduce the flag images, use the following code:               # -> Image[CountryData[#, "Flag"], ImageSize -> 20] & /@ CountryData[]      I observe this in MMA 8.0.4 on OSX 10.7.3
