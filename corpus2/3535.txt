Is there a way to copy and paste code snippets from SE to _Mathematica_ if these snippets are interspersed with text? Like e.g. in Morphing Graphics, color and location in both the question and answer, there are code blocks separated by text and graphics. Pasting this into _Mathematica_ in `n` steps is tiresome. Perhaps there is some nice way to make pasting as comfortable as the other way round with the code and graphics palettes?
