What is `NDSolve`'s mode of operation? I use it to solve partial differential equations and never gave it too much thought. Recently, I came across this question. Accordingly, I used `Trace[...]` and realized that my 4th order, non linear partial differential equation was solved using an `LSODA` method. Further digging revealed that `LSODA` is a method for ORDINARY DIFF EQS which chooses between `Adams` and `BDF` methods to solve the problem. So... how in the first place did `NDSolve` convert my **PDE** to an **ODE**? Any references would be useful.
