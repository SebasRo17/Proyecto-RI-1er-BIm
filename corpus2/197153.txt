I usually feel reluctant to use any third party or open source controls while coding in Objective-C iPhone due to following reasons. Open source controls are developed in incremental manner. So once integrated I have to keep looking for update and will have to update my code. Will increase effort. Open source controls may likely add memory leaks and thus make application incompetent in terms of memory. Third party libraries are difficult to manage, as well as they keep conflicting with your classes. Please correct me on these points, so that I may feel comfortable with open source codes.
