We had an assignment for our class where we had to create a _Tic-tac-toe_ game. People like to complicate themselves, so they wrote complex games which included menus. At the end of the game, you had to have the option to play again or quit the program. I used an `int` variable for that, but I noticed some classmates using BOOLs. Is it more efficient? What's the difference, between storing an answer that should only store two values in an `int` rather than storing it in a bool? What is the exact purpose of these variables?
