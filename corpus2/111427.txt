I have found this lines below about the advantages of BDD (Behavior Driven Development) > The domain experts define what they need in the program in a way that the > developers can not misinterpret (or at least not as much as in most other > approaches). Are there any more advantages apart from that?   If I'm working alone (I'm not in contact with managers that could write BDD features),   do I need to use BDD?
