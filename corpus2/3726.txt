When using `ListLogLinearPlot` the abscissa labels every other decade. Is there a way to tell Mathematica to label each decade? I need to use this inside `Manipulate` where the axes will scale according to the chosen variable. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/hVtf4.jpg) Here is some example code of the kind I am using:               s[x_] := (10^-9) x^2; t[x_] := (10^-3) x^2;      Manipulate[ ListLogLinearPlot[{ Table[{a s[T], T}, {T, 0, 1000}],       Table[{a t[T], T}, {T, 0, 1000}] },       GridLines -> None, PlotStyle -> {Thickness[0.005]}, Joined -> True,       PlotRange -> Automatic], {a, 10^-8, 10^8}]
