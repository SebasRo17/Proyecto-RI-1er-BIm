I am a new programmer at my office. I just entered this workplace for about 2 months. I've been working with another senior programmer which is essentially my "mentor" during the introductory period. I've been studying a lot for the past 2 months and I believe I have a good grasp of the system already. And I feel that one of the design decision that this senior programmer made is not very good and I have a better solution. So how do I go about telling him this? I'm not a junior programmer by any means I've been programming for some time. But they are using a custom 4thGL. So I can't say that "I have 5 years experience in .net and this is bad in my experience" or something like that. And we are working on different parts of the system and his part doesn't actually falls under my "jurisdiction" really... But I will eventually end up diving some parts of it sooner or later, and it is a major part of the system and I feel that a lot can be improved by doing things my way. But I don't want to be the snobbish little kid that just joined the company, and I do want an ongoing good relationship with my colleague especially since he helped me so much during the first week or 2 when i was there. But i feel strongly about this. So what is your opinion?
