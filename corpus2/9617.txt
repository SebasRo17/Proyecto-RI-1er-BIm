Suppose we have an expression of the form: $j=\frac{A\left(t\right)}{B\left(t\right)}=\frac{C\left(s\right)}{D\left(s\right)}$ That is, $j$ can be expressed either as a function of $t$, or as a function of $s$. Is it possible to use Mathematica to find the substitution $t\rightarrow h\left(s\right)$ which takes us from the first of these forms for $j$ to the second, assuming both are known? Actually, my own problem is slightly more complicated than this. Suppose again that we have: $j=\frac{A\left(t\right)}{B\left(t\right)}$ And that we know this form of $j$ exactly (specifically, I am looking at the Index 36 $j$-invariants on page 5 here: http://mysite.science.uottawa.ca/asebbar/publi/mcse.pdf). This time, we want to find a substitution $t\rightarrow h\left(z_{1},z_{2}\right)$ which puts $j$ into the form: $j=\frac{4f\left(z_{1},z_{2}\right)^{3}}{4f\left(z_{1},z_{2}\right)^{3}-27g\left(z_{1},z_{2}\right)^{2}}$ Where $f$ is a homogenous polynomial of degree 8 in each of the $z_i$, and $g$ is a homogenous polynomial of degree 12 in each of the $z_i$. Is it possible to write a Mathematica script to identify these kinds of substitutions? Many thanks! **Edit:** Here is the first $j$ from the linked document, in Mathematica input form:               j1:={(t^3+4)^3(t^3+6t^2+4)^3(t^6-6t^5+36t^4+8t^3-24t^2+16)^3}/     {t^6(t+1)^3(t^2-t+1)^3(t-2)^6(t^2+2t+4)^6}      **Edit 2:** Here are some explicit $j$ for the first part of my question:               j2s:={16(1+14s^4+s^8)^3}/{s^4(s^4-1)^4}          j2t:={(t^4-4t^3+8t^2+16t+16)^3(t^4+4t^3+8t^2-16t+16)^3}/     {t^4(t-2)^4(t+2)^4(t^2+4)^4}      According to page 21 here, the subsitution in this case is $s\rightarrow t/2$.
