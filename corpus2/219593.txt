I was just thinking how much easier it would be to read code if, when calling a function, you could write:               doFunction(param1=something, param2=somethingElse);      I can't think of any drawbacks and it would make code a lot more readable. I know you could pass an array as the only argument and have the array keys as the parameter names, however that would still not be as readable. Is there a disadvantage of this that I'm missing? If not, why do many languages not allow this?
