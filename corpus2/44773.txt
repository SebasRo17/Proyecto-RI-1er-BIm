Taking a look at this question and this one, I checked to see if _Mathematica_ really does not have a `Prism` primitive. To my surprise the function `Prism` was black but hitting the `F1` key didn't bring up anything useful. I also stumbled upon `Tetrahedron` and `Hexahedron` as being undocumented too. So how can one properly use these functions? If these functions have already been unearthed please forgive me as I could not find any usage of them here.
