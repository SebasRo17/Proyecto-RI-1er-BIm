I want to find all the values of $m$ such that the equation $$-m^3 + 2 m^2 x + (-2 m - 1) x^2 + m + x^3=0$$ has three different positive solutions. I tried               Clear[f];     f[x_] := -m^3 + 2 m^2 x + (-2 m - 1) x^2 + m + x^3;     sol = Solve[D[f[x], x] == 0, x];     d = Discriminant[D[f[x], x], x];     x1 = x /. sol[[1]];     x2 = x /. sol[[2]];     Reduce[{d > 0, x1 > 0, f[x1] f[x2] < 0, f[0] < 0}, m]      and               Clear[f];     f[x_] := -m^3 + 2 m^2 x + (-2 m - 1) x^2 + m + x^3;     sol = Solve[f[x] == 0, x];     x1 = x /. sol[[1]];     x2 = x /. sol[[2]];     x3 = x /. sol[[3]];     Reduce[{x1 > 0, x2 > 0, x3 > 0, x1 != x2, x1 != x3, x2 != x3}, m]      How can I solve this problem with _Mathematica_?
