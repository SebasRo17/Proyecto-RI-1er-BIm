I want to distribute my software under license like Creative Commons Attribution - Non commercial - Share Alike license, i.e.   * Redistribution of source code and binaries is freely.   * Modified version of program have to be distributed under the same license. Attribution to original project should be supplied to.   * Restrict any kind of commercial usage. However CC does not recommend to use their licenses for software. Is there this kind of software license I could apply? Better if public license, but as far as I know US laws says that only EULA could restrict usage of received copy?
