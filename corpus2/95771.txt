I've recently started using jasmine to do javascript unit testing. loving it so far. one of the projects i'm working on is a plugin for backbone.js. since backbone is an mvc style framework for javascript, a lot of what it does is view manipulation - typically through jquery. my plugin is no exception to this. i have several things being manipulated in html elements, through backbone views. right now, i am doing what might be some awful stuff to make this worth with jasmine. here's an example of how i'm laying out my tests:               describe("conventionBindings", function(){       beforeEach(function(){         this.model = new AModel({name: "Some Name"});         this.view = new AView({model: this.model});         this.view.render();       });            afterEach(function(){         this.view.close();       });            describe("... that thing it does ... ", function(){         it("... stuff .... ", function(){         });       });     });      The important bits here, are the beforeEach and afterEach. notice that i'm calling my view's render method, and then my view's close method. here's what those methods do:               AView = Backbone.View.extend({       render: function(){         this.html = $("");         $("body").append(this.html);       },            close: function(){         this.html.remove();       }     });      i'm specifically adding this "close" method to my view for the tests, because if i don't, then the jasmine page that i'm viewing when i run the jasmine test server would show the inputs that i've appended to the body of the page. so... here's my questions: is this a horrible thing to be doing? should i be testing my views and html element manipulations in some way other than appending elements to the body of the page? right now i don't have a need to run these tests in any kind of CI server, but if i do, what kind of problems will i run into? how can i write better jasmine tests, so that i can test my backbone plugin in a CI server, knowing that the plugin has to manipulate html elements during the test?
