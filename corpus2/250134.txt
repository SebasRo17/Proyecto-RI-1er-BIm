I'm beginning my journey into graphics programming and want to learn OpenGL. Because I'm green to graphics programming but not to C and C++, a familiar question came up when I looked at OpenGL and ES... Is OpenGL a superset of OpenGL ES? I read in an ES 3.0 guide that it uses shader-based implementations that exist as part of OpenGL's embedded libraries, and that ES avoids using similar/redundant libraries provided by big 'ol OpenGL due to mobile hardware limitations... Are shader-based implementations which are a huge part of OpenGL ES less efficient solutions when programming on the desktop? OR should I look at the two APIs as different beasts altogether? thx in advance.
