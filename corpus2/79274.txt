I have been doing web developmwnt for 3 years in php/joomla/jquery/mysql. I am now learning python/django/sysadmin/j2ee just to expand my knowledge. I am 28 and I can find jobs, but I was thinking if I go beyond 40 or 45 then there is every chance that companies will look for younger people, because you can always find young people with similar skills if not experience. So I was thinking, do I need to keep the same role as a web developer or do I need to seek a career path where age does not matter and experience is the key. I have a relative who worked for 15 years as a programmer, and is now 38. He became the recruiter for an agency which provides IT candidates to other companies. I think that sort of position is not linked to age. I may be wrong. The other option I was thinking of is to keep in mind that by the time I get to 40 or above, I should have enough links with clients so that I can get enough freelance work to make my living. Because then I don't have to be at the mercy of jobs, and age won't matter. So I just want to know: as programmer what is the future after 40 or 50? Because if we have that kind of goal, we need at least 10-15 years to get to that point.
