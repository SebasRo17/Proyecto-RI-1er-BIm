We started off using Scrum, but recently changed to Kanban because fixed iterations didn't work in our situation. Kanban isn't working either, because team members are not updating the Kanban board. **Everyone understands what it is for** and why we have it. **Everyone agrees we should keep it up to date** , but somehow it never actually happens. The reason given is that it takes too long to write out a new card and pin it to the board. One developer said they wanted an all-electronic board to avoid this overhead, but I don't believe that this would solve the problem. (The board is right next to the cubicle where the developers sit.) I'm not the team leader (in fact I'm not even on the team). I cannot impose sanctions or offer rewards - nor would I want to anyway because I think it's bad for team morale. In any case, the team needs to completely self-administer whatever solution is found. I've run out of ideas. Any suggestions?
