Does _Mathematica_ have a built-in function to convert ISO 8601 formatted date strings (e.g. `2012-01-04T00:00:00`) to a date list? ISO 8601 strings come in a variety of formats:               Date alone: 2012-12-03     Combined date and time: 2012-12-03T22:02     Combined date and time with time zone: 2012-12-03T22:02:47.23+01      On top of that individual components can be omitted (see the Wiki page). I am looking for a solution that covers the whole ISO 8601 standard.
