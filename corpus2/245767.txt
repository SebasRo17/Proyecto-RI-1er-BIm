I am programming in Java, and I always make converters sort of like this:               public OtherObject MyObject2OtherObject(MyObject mo){         ... Do the conversion         return otherObject;     }      At the new workplace the pattern is:               public void MyObject2OtherObject(MyObject mo, OtherObject oo){         ... Do the conversion     }      For me it is a little bit smelly, as I got used to not to change the incoming parameters. Is this incoming parameter alteration an antipattern or is it OK? Does it have some serious drawbacks?
