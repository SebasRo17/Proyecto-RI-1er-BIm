I'm reading "Effective Java" by Josh Bloch and in there is Item 16 where he tells how to use inheritance in a correct way and by inheritance he means only class inheritance, not implementing interfaces or extend interfaces by other interfaces. I didn't find any mention of interface inheritance in the entire book. Does this mean that interface inheritance is always safe? Or there are guidlines for interface inheritance?
