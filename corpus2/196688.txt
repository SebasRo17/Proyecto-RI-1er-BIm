I have become interested in creating a unified search for a corporate asset management database. My goal is to allow users to submit queries like:   * `stuff in building 3210`   * `stuff in building 3210 owned by Jim`   * `stuff in building 3210 owned by org 2`   * `people in org 2 who own stuff`   * `stuff owned by people in org 2`   * `people in building 3210`   * `people in building 3210 who own stuff` While the application is written in C# I have no real issue with building a search layer in a different language if it is more appropriate to the task. Working with .NET I could see utilizing F#, Lucene or ANTLR to accomplish my goals, but was hoping for some sage advice before starting down any one path. What are some considerations when working with language recognition? What questions am I not asking that I should be?
