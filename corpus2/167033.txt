Often, my colleagues and I run into specific problems, for example what's the best way to deploy this, or would this or that technique be a good one to use, or just "hey, have you seen that new thing". However at the moment this communication goes via mail, or skype, or twitter, and a lot of information becomes hard to find very quickly. Is there a service or methodology to keep this kind of information ordered and traceable?
