![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2yAIc.png) I'm kind of new to using Mathematica, so any help is great. I'm trying to write a program that will create a list or matrix that will give each small triangle's point numbers. For example if given an isosceles right triangle, the example below gives the sides as 4 and the numbering of the points is just like below, then it should give a list or table such as               dat= {{1,2,6},{2,3,7},{3,4,8},{4,5,9},{6,7,10},{7,8,11},{8,9,12},{10,11,13},        {11,12,14},{13,14,15},{2,6,7},{3,7,8},{4,8,9},{7,10,11},{8,11,12},{11,13,14}}.       I've tried writing a few loops, but am not getting anywhere. I know that the starting number on the diagonal of the big triangle will add whatever the side is and start decreasing that value as u go up. For example, the first point always starts at 1, and as u move up the rows of triangle, you add `1+(x+1)` to get 6. Then going up the next row of triangles, it is `6+(x)`, to get 10. And so on. So I see two iterators? once increasing? one decreasing? Any help or ideas will be helpful. Thanks!
