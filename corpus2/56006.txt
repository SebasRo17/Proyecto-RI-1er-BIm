![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vR9WO.png) So I am encountering this situation, in which mathematica doesn't give me the answer, but in a form of "Root". How do I interpret this ? what is the number after the "&" represent? How should I ask mathematica to evaluate this Root for me? Please don't tell me to use `N[%]`. I have an equation of 4 variables and I don't have numerical value for them. I would like it in symbolic form.
