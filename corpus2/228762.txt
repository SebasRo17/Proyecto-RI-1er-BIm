I am a DBA / Report Writer in client support for a software company. Starting in my spare time, I wrote a reporting web application with live reports. The ca 2001 IE only site was horrific. My application eventually became a huge success with clients and was subsequently swallowed by dev. I think it was assumed that I would fail and I was told it would never be part of dev; it will always be a support project. Naturally, after such success, they wanted it. They assumed control, demanded I stop working on improvements, and started giving me tasks to "stabilize" it. I went from architect / designer / sole developer to code monkey. I have zero input anymore. It was fun to do, but that fun has left the building. I want to continue working on it, but my way. My way is why they have it in the first place, so it must work. Now I'm stuck in an AGILE loop. I don't see them giving back control so I want to stop. I'm not a developer or even work in that department. Can they force me to continue?
