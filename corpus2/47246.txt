I got some text scraps with this _structure_               "Focal Plane: 198'  Active Aid to Navigation: Yes  *Latitude: 35.250 N  *Longitude: -75.529 W"      But some of them lack of parts like this               "Focal Plane: 198'  Active Aid to Navigation: Yes  *Longitude: -75.529 W"      Using regular expression matching, I want to extract all the info available, included getting a tag "NotAvailable" for missing data., I wrote this code, but it can't tell when a pattern does not match -- should the pattern in the middle not match, my code just skips it and goes on to the next pattern:               ptrFocal = "(?<=\\Focal Plane: )(.*?)(?=\\')";     ptrLat = "(?<=\\*Latitude: )(.*?)(?=[a-zA-Z])";     ptrLon = "(?<=\\*Longitude: )(.*?)(?=[a-zA-Z])";          r =        StringTrim /@ StringCases[text,          RegularExpression[ptrFocal <> "|" <> ptrLat <> "|" <> ptrLon]       ];      I would want some pointers on how to do this. **EDIT:** The expected transformation of the example data I gave above is > >     {198, 32.250, -75.529} >     {198, "NotAvailable", -75.529} >
