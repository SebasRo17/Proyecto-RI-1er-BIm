We often receive last minute requests from the business asking for an extra feature to be implemented. The project manager is usually responsible for filtering out these requests as "must haves" or "nice to have", but there are cases where the business wants to squeeze all these features into a release. Is there a good way to say NO to the business? What steps can be taken to stop or minimize scope creep?
