I'm in doubts this design is OK, it may be there is a way to do it better? The case is that I need a class which would be used in one and only class and that's it. But, this class needs to inherit from another one, which is in another package. This doesn't sound right as for me.               public class User {          private class SpecificParser extends BaseParser {} // BaseParser.java is in another package          }      I would simply create `SpecificParser` as a separate class, but don't want to do that also because the only consumer of it is a `User` class.
