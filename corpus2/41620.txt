Let suppose that I have a function $f[x]$ I want to approximate using a Pade expansion and that I decide what would be maximum number of terms to be used. Is there any way with Mathematica to find what have to be the degrees of numerator and denominator in order to have the best approximation over a given range of $x$ ? Doing this manually is, as one could expect, quite tedious. Any help and suggestion will be really appreciated.
