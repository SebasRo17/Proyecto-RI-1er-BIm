I want to set up a part of my Mathematica package so that typing `<``-``Space` is replaced with the left arrow character (`←` or `\[LeftArrow]`) just like it does with `-``>``Space`. Does anyone know how to do this? I looked briefly at event handling but didn't see anything immediately useful. I already know, of course, that `Esc``<``-``Esc` will insert `←`, and that doing so is not that much additional effort, but I'm more interested in the concept involved here. Any ideas?
