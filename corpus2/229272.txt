JavaMail sends e-mails using an e-mail server, typically through the SMTP interface of an e-mail provider. Is it necessary to use an e-mail server to send e-mails? I have a web site that will send e-mails and if possible I'd like to send the e-mails directly from the web site code without using an e-mail server. The JavaMail FAQ says that an e-mail server is required. Is there a way to send e-mails without using an e-mail server, either with JavaMail or another API?
