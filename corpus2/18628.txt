I'm relatively new to _Mathematica_ programming, so forgive my rather unsophisticated question: I'm trying to do a Monte Carlo simulation using geometric Brownian motion (GBM). I want to write a indicator function which produces is 1 if my GBM stays within a certain corridor `[L, U]`. I found a function which produces the paths of my GBM:               data = RandomFunction[       GeometricBrownianMotionProcess[0.01, .15, 100], {0, 1, .01}, 100]      How can I access `data` so that I can write the indicator function? EDIT: Ive got a follow up question: Let's say one sample path is the following list               pts=data["Paths"]            pts         {{0,100},{0.01,98}...}      How can I select from all my pahts only those values where the x-variable is >=1? I tried `Select[pts,#1.0&]`, but this gives me an empty list.
