I'm working on a new web based development tool (version management based on git). Usability tests showed that developers are used to manual save. I asked 15 developers that are used to work with Eclipse or Visual Studio to develop in my web based code editor. After a short mission I asked them if they feel their code is saved. They all said no, and looked for a save button, and didn't notice a "saved" label turning on and off at the top right corner. I'm wondering if auto save will be a better experience, and something developers will get used to, like in google docs?
