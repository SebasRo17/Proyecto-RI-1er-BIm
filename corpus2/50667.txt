I have a table: ![Table I want to be editable](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nbukd.jpg) I want it to be editable only where the zeros appear. I read this post Generating an editable table that can be used as input because it's almost exactly what I want, but I couln't figure out how to keep uneditable the first column AND the first row. I don't show the modifications I did because they wouldn't shed any light.
