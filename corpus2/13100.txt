I am using Mathematica to run a probabilistic simulation. Essentially, I have a list of members of a population (they only have one, numerical, attribute, so it's just implemented as a list of numbers), and a function to move from one generation to the next, in a random manner. I need to iterate this function on my list until the list exceeds a given length, and then I want the number of iterations/generations is took to reach that length. My first instinct would be to use a While loop, but I know that using explicit loops in Mathematica is usually bad practice. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find a better or more functional construction, and that's where I'm asking for help.
