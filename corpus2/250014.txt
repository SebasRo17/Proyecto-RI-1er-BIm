There's a question that might be deemed a duplicate of this one (I use an IDE (Eclipse) to develop software. Why should I switch to vim or emacs?) but I don't think answers my question. I usually program in C++ (not exactly to create GUIs so rather low-level) and I find myself comfortable with editing code into visual studio, compiling it and debugging it. I know that all of this can be done in a linux/unix environment (even on Windows) as well, but I'm wondering how come that many low-level programmers are proficient with tools like emacs which I suppose hasn't any debugger integrated (no breakpoints setting, doing that with gdb seems pretty slow and really unhelpful). How can they develop a complex software with a write-compile-debug cycle in such environments? Am I missing something? I doubt that they develop code in Eclipse, Qt Creator or Visual Studio and then get back to their textual tools.
