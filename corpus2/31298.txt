**Objective:** I am trying to save a HTML file using the **URLFetch** function (native to Mathematica 9 onward). Sometimes the file is huge. **Question:** Is there a way to check/verify (using the headers or other parameters native to URLFetch) that the **COMPLETE PAGE HAS BEEN DOWNLOADED** , i.e. the page was not partially downloaded? Is there a protocol say like MD5 for file downloads, which allows one to confirm that the HTML file's contents were completely downloaded? (or can I be _assured_ that URLFetch returns/transfers control **ONLY** after the COMPLETE page has been fetched?) **Related questions** :   * IF the download was partial (not complete), will the "STATUS" (from the URLFetch) still be 200 ?   * Can this be solved using **Import** function
