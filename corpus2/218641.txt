I have a software engineering midterm tomorrow and as I was going through the past exams I saw this question: True or False with justification: One of the problems with CORBA is that distributed systems created using it must be written using the same programming language. I don't remember my professor saying anything about CORBA in class so I am having hard time answering this question even though I searched for CORBA online , so it would be great if you could help me understand the question. Thanks in advance
