As you already know there are compiled and interpreted languages. From a performance point of view which is better when visiting a website? Will a website that was developed with a compiled langauge will load faster and performs actions faster as will? I want to reach to a point where I can unnderstand the steps required in both compiled/ interpreted site in order to bring them on stage! (in this case to the user browser).
