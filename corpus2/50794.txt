I own the first edition of Expert F# by Don, et al. and I'm considering buying the next edition, Expert F# 2.0. But I'm wondering if it's worth it. Sure the syntax will be updated and all, but I'd be more interested if there were new topics covered or just compelling expanded coverage of the same topics otherwise. Glad to hear from anyone who owns both editions, thanks.
