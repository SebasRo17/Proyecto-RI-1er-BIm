We have some requirements to send emails when various field values are changed in our system. It's an asp.net system using linq to sql with javascript/jquery. Is it preferred to check if a value is changed via js (hidden field is set if the value is changed) or is it better since we are using linq and I have access to the object in question to check that object's current value with what the user has entered (basically compare the textbox value with the object's field value before it is being updated)?
