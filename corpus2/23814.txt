I have recently started using Mathematica as a calculator while teaching (definitely overkill, but I try to use as few tools as possible). I would like my students to be able to trace simple numerical calculations, for example if I enter               a=1; b=2; c=3; x = 1 / (  (a+2b)/c^2 )      I would like to automagically generate               x = 1 / ((1 + 2 . 2)/3^2)      and even if I could               x = 1 / ((1 + 2 . 2)/3^2) = 1/ (5/9) = ...      Is there a way to do this? **Addition :** I found out that this seems to do a rather good job :               a = 1; b = 2; c = 3;     ClearAll["Global`*"]     a = "1"; b = "2"; c = "3";     x = 1/((a + 2 b)/c^2)      Now I need to automate it. Any suggestion ?!
