In the industry, there is a distinction made between an 'in-house development' environment where the software developers are writing code which will be used by the company itself and a proper 'software development' environment where software is built to be sold/distributed to the public. Among others, one obvious difference between the two is that a software- development-oriented company will typically adhere to some sort of software development life cycle such as spec-writing, testing, building etc. whereas the in-house-oriented shop will usually do things in a more casual way since they themselves are the end-users and can always fix something that wasn't done right. As a student (like most other students), I kind of expected myself to wind up working in a software development environment, but I ended up getting my first position at a firm which operates in more of an in-house fashion. At times, I wonder whether I am missing out on the full-fledged software development experience. Is there a basis for this feeling? Should I seek to join a proper software development environment?
