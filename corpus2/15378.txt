In version 8, if one evaluates               test::usage="test[x,y]";      then types `test`, then `shift`-`cmd`-`k` (or `shift`-`ctrl`-`k`), a template appears with placeholders for `x` and `y`. In version 9, this does not work: if I evaluate the same thing, when I type `te`, I am offered the choice to select `test` from the dropdown menu, just like for the built-in functions. If I select `test` and then press `shift`-`cmd`, however, I do not get the template (whereas I do get a template for built-in functions if I do this). How do I get the frontend to show a template? # Note: This has been fixed as of 9.0.1
