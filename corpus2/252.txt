I know there is a Notebook option `WindowOpacity` can be used to adjust the opacity of a whole notebook. But what I want is keeping the text and graphics and so on being `Opacity[1]` while the other parts of the window being `Opacity[0.3]`, which may look like (the pic is roughly produced by photoshop): ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OoFhr.jpg) I guess this effect might be achieved by capture the screen prior and set it as the background of a Cell/Cells. But even if that is applicable, it must be very inefficiency. My questions are: how to achieve this transparent effect in Mathematica (maybe with some help from external applications)? and how to do it effectively?
