Is there a set of industry approved rules to avoid vendor lock-in? I mean something one can show to a manager or other decision maker that is easy to understand and easily verifiable.   * Are there any universally accepted set of rules, checklist or conditions that help detect and prevent vendor lock-in in an objective, measurable way?   * Have any of you warned a manager about the risk of vendor lock-in during the initial stages of a project?
