I have a Visual Studio solution with multiple projects:   * `Acme.Core`   * `Acme.Core.Tests`   * `Acme.UI.MvcSite1`   * `Acme.UI.MvcSite2`   * `Acme.UI.WinformsApp1`   * `Acme.UI.WinformsApp2`   * ... The entire solution is checked-in in a single GitHub (private) repo. `Acme.Core` contains our business logic and all `UI` projects are deployables. UI projects have different requirements and features, but some of them are implemented in more than one project. All issues are opened in a single issue tracker and classified using labels (`[MvcSite1]`, `[WinformsApp1]`, etc) but I'm thinking it's starting to get messy. Is it ok to use a single repository and issue tracker to track multiple projects in one solution?
