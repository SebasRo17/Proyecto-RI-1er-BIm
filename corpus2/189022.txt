I'm looking for guidance from someone who has successfully hired a freelancer to assist with writing software they later marketed publicly. Simply, what kind of software agreement should I have the freelancer sign so I have full rights over the code and cannot be sued later. I'm currently independent but have plans to launch a software company once I've perfected my software products.
