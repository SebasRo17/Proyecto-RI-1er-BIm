After seeing http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ibdknox/light-table I'm wondering if anyone has come across other alternative methods of developing. When working on embedded things Notepad++ was ample, which isn't necessarily an IDE but it is a different way of handling things from using Xcode, Visual Studio, or Eclipse. And even JDeveloper follows the same design as those. As OS X and other OSes change, along with website methodologies, app structures, frameworks, can we start changing how we develop? I've also seen quite a few "code on your iPad" apps. Will we eventually move away from coding as we know it? Will there be a split? Can something like Light Table bring even low level C++ coding into the next generation of enterprise or embedded level development? Especially since I feel like a small minority who even takes advantage of some non-default IDE settings such as custom syntax coloring (once you go Zenburn you don't go back)
