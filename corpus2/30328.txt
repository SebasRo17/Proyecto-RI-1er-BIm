Does anyone know, or know of a link for the underlying algorithms used for list manipulation functions? Specifically:   * `Union` with and without the `SameTest` option   * `DeleteDuplicates` with and without a _test_ function.    * `Gather` with and without a _test_ function   * `Sort` with and without an _ordering function_ This question came about as there has been numerous questions that have asked about removing duplicates or some other list manipulation function. Some of the best answers often included usage of `GatherBy` due to the performance it offers (a few hundred times over `DeleteDuplicates` in some cases).
