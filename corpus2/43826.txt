Suppose that I have two plots, `pl1` and `pl2`:               pl1 = Plot[x, {x, 0, 1}, Frame -> True, ImageSize -> 350]     pl2 = Plot[x^2, {x, 0, 1}, Frame -> True, ImageSize -> 350]      ![pl1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Rl6lc.png) ![pl2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/kyTjV.png) I would like to **(1) combine** these plots side-by-side in a **(2) non- rasterized** graphic with **(3) no spacing**. I get pretty close to my desired result by using `Grid` with `Spacings -> 0`:               Grid[{{pl1, pl2}}, Spacings -> 0]      ![grid](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XdZE6.png) The above satisfies my requirements **(2)** and **(3)** : the result is **non- rasterized** , and there is **no spacing** between the plots. However, the above doesn't satisfy my requirement **(1)** , that the plots be **combined** into a _single_ `Graphic` object. That is, if I click on either of the plots, I see that they are separate `Graphic` objects: ![gridA](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XF1K9.png) ![gridB](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2sYch.png) So the above approach doesn't satisfy all of my requirements. (Why do I need the plots to be combined in a single `Graphic`? The reason is that I want to be able to place other `Graphic` objects -- e.g., text, arrows, shapes, etc. -- that _span_ the two plots.) Another possibility is to use `ImageAssemble`, but unfortunately this leads to a rasterized image:               ImageAssemble[{{pl1, pl2}}]      ![imageassemble](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7Lray.png) A third possibility is to use `GraphicsGrid` with `Spacings -> 0`:               GraphicsGrid[{{pl1, pl2}}, Spacings -> 0]      ![graphicsgrid](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UMui5.png) It seems that this produces a single `Graphic` object ( **(1)** ) that is not rasterized ( **(2)** ), but, unfortunately, there is spacing between the plots. Do you have any suggestions? Is there any way to remove the spacing/padding in `GraphicsGrid`?
