**Edit: I changed the title and (slightly) the wording of this question in order to make it more easily answerable.** If I evaluate this in Mathematica 9:               SetAttributes[foo, HoldFirst]     foo[x_] :=      (T`var := x;       DeleteFile["thisisatest"];       Save["thisisatest", "T`"]      )          foo[$ProcessID]      The resulting saved file looks like this:               T`var := $ProcessID          $ProcessID = 6903      If I evaluate `Get["thisisatest"]`, mathematica complains that I shouldn't be setting the value of special symbol `$ProcessID`. If I change `Save` to `DumpSave` and try again, `Get` no longer triggers the complaint. Examination of the saved file in a text editor shows no evidence of a stored value for `$ProcessID`, though it's a little hard to tell. The behavior I want is that of `DumpSave`, but platform independent. The documentation seems to suggest that these two functions would be interchangeable, except that `Save` will append to an existing file. What are the known differences between the two functions in practice, and how does one account for them?
