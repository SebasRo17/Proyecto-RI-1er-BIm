Imagine I have a matrix of the following form: TestArray = $((a_1,b_1,...),(a_2,b_2,...),(a_3,b_3,...),...)$, where a specific example might be: TestArray = $((10^6,1,...),(10^7,7,...),(10^3,4,...))$ In the above example, we have $Max[a_i] = 10^7$, and $Max[b_i] = 7$. In a single line of Mathematica, how can I find the maximum $a_i$, $b_i$, etc.? Moreover, what is the most computationally efficient manner in which to do this?
