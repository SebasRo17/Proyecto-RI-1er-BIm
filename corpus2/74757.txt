So here's my situation - Currently in college and confident, that i want to pursue a career in Microsoft technologies (.NET development more specific). I haven't got any real world experience (as in no experience in paid nor open source projects, just personal applications and school projects) and it's hard to get into any development position, as most if not all ask for years of professional experience. I'm pretty sure going for a certification is the right thing to do, to "seperate myself from rest of the pack", which should help me get into open source projects and paid jobs alike. The question is, which certifications should i choose? I thought about about going for MCTS: .NET Framework 4, Windows Applications ( 70-511 ) and then MCTS: .NET Framework 4, Web Applications ( 70-515 ) Is that even the correct way to do what i'm trying to do ? Should i disband anything related to desktop applications since everything is moving towards web based ? Which way to go after the given certs ? Any input appreciated! L.A.
