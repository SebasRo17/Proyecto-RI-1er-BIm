The company I work for requires all code to be reviewed by other developers before it is committed. The members of my team are often frustrated because the other developers are too busy coding to do a review, especially if it is very long. How do you incentivize other developers to do timely code reviews? (We use git-svn so we are able to continue coding while waiting for a review. However, I still find it frustrating when I have to wait a long time before I can commit my code.)
