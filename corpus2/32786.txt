I have many friends that see what I do, find it interesting and ask me the question               Do you think I could be a programmer?      My response is               ...   ummm  ...  do you like math?      I'd like to have a helpful response, so I didn't know if anyone knew of a fairly decent aptitude test for someone that would be starting from square one, but has critical thinking and problem solving skills?
