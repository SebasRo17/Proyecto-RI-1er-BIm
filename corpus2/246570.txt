Since trying to use them will cause an error what is the workaround to get the same effect as them? My Base Class:               public abstract class IPacket     {         public abstract int Identifier { get; set; }              public abstract void Handle();     }      Child Class:               public class DoSomething : IPacket     {         public override int Identifier         {             get             {                 return 1;             }         }              public override void Handle()         {             // Do Something         }     }      Incoming Packet Routing:               Dictionary<Byte, IPacket> Packets = new Dictionary<byte, IPacket>         {             {DoSomething.Identifier, DoSomething} // <-- Not Possible         };          Packets[ID].Handle();      Basically I get a packet from Server which contains an Identifier. I use this identifier to find the handler for that packet from a dictionary and pass the packet to it's handler.
