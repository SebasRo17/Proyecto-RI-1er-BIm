I'm having an issue with the `Eigensystem` command. I need to diagonalize a bunch of 3 by 3 complex valued matrices, but more importantly, I need to keep the exact ordering of their eigenvalues once brought to their diagonal form. For example, if               A = { {1.999, 0.000428712*I, 0} , {-0.000428712*I, 2.00072, 0} , {0, 0, -4.00057} }      then `Eigensystem[A]` returns the three eigenvalues (with their corresponding eigenvectors) listed in order of decreasing magnitude (absolute value). What is even more annoying is if my loop runs into an already diagonal 3 by 3 matrix such as `B = {{2,0,0},{0,-3,0},{0,0,2}}`, it will reorder the eigenvalues as `{-3,2,2}`. Is there a command that gives me the eigenvalue without re-sorting them?
