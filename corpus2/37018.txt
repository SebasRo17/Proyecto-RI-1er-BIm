I try to plot a 2D gravity field or something similar in the form like $r/|r|^3$ with the standart builtin VectorPlot function:               VectorPlot[{-x/(x^2 + y^2)^(3/2), -y/(x^2 + y^2)^(3/2)}, {x, -5, 5}, {y, -5, 5}]      It should look like: ![what it should look like](http://www.euclideanspace.com/maths/geometry/space/fields/gravity.png) I get something strange when I run my command: ![what i get](http://i.imgur.com/Wq069rJ.jpg) Any suggestions? Thanks Cx
