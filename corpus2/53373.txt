We want to formalize our development process. Aim is to provide a clear view of software in each phase. For example, to translate requirements to task, to specify the pre and post-conditions of task etc. So that each role (analyst, developer, tester) can perform better and has a checklist to finish his job properly Does your company follow any software process e.g. Agile, OpenUP, RUP etc. If yes what tools do you use to enforce it or to facilitate it?
