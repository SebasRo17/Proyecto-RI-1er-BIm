I recently finished my Master of Science in Software Engineering, and I am about to start my professional career in a few weeks. My role will be as a Junior Developer for a company which develops software using Java & related technologies (among them Spring and Hibernate). To be honest, I am really excited about what is coming, especially because I want to develop my career as a Java developer. I am also very interested in gaining experience in the field. Additionally, this is going to be my first work experience as a professional developer so I really want to do my best from the very beginning. I would like to know which skills and abilities, both soft and technical, would be most appreciated in a new professional (Junior Developer) that could be part of your team and in which skills I should focus on to achieve a successful career as a Software Engineer.
