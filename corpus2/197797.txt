I hope this is the right place for this type of problem. An Object of my class `Movie` can have several `keywords` ( like 'fight club', 'brad', 'fincher'), and be part of different `categories` (like 'Drama', 'Best Movies Ever') I implemented them as ManyToMany:               @OneToMany(targetEntity = Keyword.class,fetch=FetchType.EAGER)         private Set<Keyword> keywords;          @OneToMany(targetEntity = MovieCategory.class, fetch=FetchType.EAGER)         private Set<MovieCategory> movieCategories;      Somehow I don' think, this is not the correct relationshipmodel, how would you implement this? Right now hibernate wont allow me to fetch.eager. fetch.lazy is okay. I found this link http://www.mkyong.com/hibernate/hibernate-many-to- many-relationship-example-annotation/ but it didn't answered my question.
