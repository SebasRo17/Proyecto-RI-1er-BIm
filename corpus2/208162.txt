Say you had a live video stream of a popular boardwalk that had thousands of pedestrians walk down it each day. Could software be written to count the number of people that walk by a camera and collect data on things like how many of them were wearing red clothing or how many were over 6' tall? I'm thinking the software would be a layer between the camera and the people. But I have no idea if that is even possible. If something like this already exists, I wasn't able to find it but please share if it does. Thanks!
