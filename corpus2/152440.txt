What tools similar to GWT's UIBinder exist in other languages? By this I mean a system where you can define your UI layout in a markup language (preferably html+css) and attach the functionality to the layout using the code. I'm most interested in anything for python, but answers in other languages would interest me as well. I'm interested because the benefits of having a non-programmer work directly on the layout without needing to touch the code and adjust a bunch of UI toolkit method calls is very productive. I'm aware of Flex for flash, but is there anything else out there? What search terms might I use to find such frameworks? I've looked around but I haven't found anything concrete. Edit: I'm not only interested in web frameworks, but desktop applications as well. Edit2: My question appears to be close to a duplicate of http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2962874/what-are-the-open-source- alternatives-to-wpf-xaml
