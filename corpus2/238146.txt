I read about CI/CD, loved it, but I'm having trouble with the details as everything I read was high level. Some authors seemed to suggest that there couldn't be any failing commits on the repository (or master branch?), so a programmer that is delivering bad code would be stopped and he wouldn't be able to create a big mess. He would be forced into fixing his code so that the tests pass. Others mentioned that the trigger would be the pull requests, not the commits. I haven't used pull requests a lot to be honest, and besides aren't they something external to git? They aren't part of git AFAIK, but part of services like github, bitbucket, etc., so I wasn't sure if I should bind my workflow to something like that. Any thoughts on this will help me greatly. Please also mention which tools you are using, eg: Jenkins, Buildbot, etc. None of the tools I have tried were very friendly IMO. The docs and examples were lacking or tied to certain technologies like java, or services like github. I even considered building my own, it shouldn't be too hard to get the basic functionality. Right?
