I always start the day thinking "I'll easily get this done by the end of the day" and set what looks like a realistic target. So why do I never hit it? The task always ends up taking 3x longer due to unforeseen bugs, last minute changes etc. Is it just me? I don't seem to be getting any better predicting what can be done in a day.
