I want to highlight two different directed paths on a graph with two different style. I am using the following two code snippets:               HighlightGraph[      CompleteGraph[5], {PathGraph[{1, 2, 3}], PathGraph[{4, 5}]},       GraphHighlightStyle -> {"Dashed", "Thick"}]      and               HighlightGraph[      HighlightGraph[CompleteGraph[5], PathGraph[{4, 5}],        GraphHighlightStyle -> "Dashed"], PathGraph[{1, 2, 3}],       GraphHighlightStyle -> "Thick"]      But either of them results in the following plot: ![Highlighted Graph](http://i.stack.imgur.com/raJVY.png) It seems that highlighted paths use the same style (the last one applied to the graph) if we have more than one path. In addition, I want to make the highlighted paths directed, but If I add the option `DirectedEdges->True` to the path, it doesn't work.
