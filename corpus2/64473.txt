I'm interested in building some functionality similar in nature to that provided by VoiceDrop (http://www.voicedrop.ws/). I'm thinking about using Twilio, offers some very powerful telephony features, but it's not immediately obvious how one would dial a user's voicemail directly. Anyone have any ideas? _edit:_ apologies for the poor tag, I wanted to put "voicedrop voice-mail twilio"
