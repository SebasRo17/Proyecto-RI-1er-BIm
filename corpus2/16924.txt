Normally when you have symbol Abc, WorkBench creates a symbol page named _Abc_. Then when you make a build, type Abc and then press the F1 key, you are sent to the Abc symbol page. Suppose however that you want to type a string , say _xyz_ , but on pressing F1 you want to go to symbol page Abc or, at least, be given Abc page among the search results. Is this possible? I think it might be. For example, type the exclamation mark (!) and then F1. You are given the choice between the _Factorial_ , _Not_ and _Run_ pages. How were these associations made? In other words: is it possible to intercept the F1 action? Or somehow indicate for a symbol page which search strings are appropriate? Or use some other hack to obtain this effect?
