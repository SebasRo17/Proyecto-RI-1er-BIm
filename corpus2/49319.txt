Trying to evaluate an integral. To be specific, I'm trying to find the expectation value of $x^2$ for the ground state of hydrogen. Here is the code I used:               FullSimplify[       Integrate[x^2/(Pi*a^3) E^((-2 Sqrt[x^2 + y^2 + z^2])/a), {x,-Infinity, Infinity}]]      The odd part is it worked when I calculated $\left<x\right>$, i.e. just drop an $x$ from the first fraction.
