Suppose I need to create sliders associated with variables from a given list:               ClearAll[a, b, c, d];     vars = {a, b, c, d};     Slider[Dynamic@#, {0, 1}] & /@ vars     Dynamic@vars      Unfortunately it works only for variables which don't have values:               ClearAll[a, b, c, d];     vars = {a, b, c, d};     a = 1;     Slider[Dynamic@#, {0, 1}] & /@ vars     Dynamic@vars      As you can see now the first slider is not working because Mma attempts to assign values to raw object `1` instead of `a`. Nevertheless simple               Slider[Dynamic@a, {0, 1}]     Dynamic@a      produces the desired result. So, what is the right way to do such things?
