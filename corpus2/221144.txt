There is a Open Source project which I need to use in my project. All other functionality is built on top of it. I am new to programming and find it very daunting. There are a lot of Open Source projects and APIs out there. At one point or another we need to use these in our projects since we don't want to re-invent it again. There are tons of lines of code written in those Open Source projects by other programmers. It's really hard to understand. How do I pick a library or API and understand it quickly to use it in my project? Do I need to understand each line of code, or just have a general overview of how it works? Please share your experience of how you approach it and any guidance on how to look at it.
