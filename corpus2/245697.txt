I learned Java and I'm pretty competent programming in it. I also learned C recently. I looked at a comparison between Java and C++ and I like C++'s features like operator overloading and its speed. So, C++ is an OOP language, but it also has all the things java doesn't have and C does, like pointers and memory allocation. Do I need to change something in my OOP design to consider pointers and memory allocation? If so, what do I need to change? If not, why not?
