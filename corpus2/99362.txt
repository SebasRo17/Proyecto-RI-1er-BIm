Long time user of SO, and figured this is the best place to ask this question. I am currently consolidating our eCommerce payment clearing systems into one Asp.Net MVC website that will work like PayPal but for our own websites. The businesses within the group have different rules as to the payment provider that is to be used throughout the world and, at present, we currently integrate with Servebase, Moneris and PayPal. Thus, I have an architecture that allows new providers to be written and plugged in through a single extensibility point. In the future I am likely to have to support 3D Secure, which complicates matters significantly; not only because of the additional web workflow but because each provider appears to recommend it's own MPI provider/solution for the 3D Secure process. Assuming that all three of these payment providers appear to offer the same kind of 3D Secure hooks (I'm seeing similar parameters in all of their APIs), do you think I'm going to be able to use a single MPI to manage the 3D Secure process for all or do you think I'm going to have to have a different 3D Secure implementation for each of my providers? For example, PayPal recommend using Cardinal Centinel for 3D Secure - so let's say I get a single account for them, what are the chances I'll be able to reuse it for Moneris or Servebase, say. Is the 3D Secure system a 'standard' (using the term loosely there!) that is simply being echoed by these other payment providers? It doesn't matter if you know nothing of the other APIs I mention here - i.e. Moneris, Servebase - if you've had any experience similar to mine I would appreciate any thoughts.
