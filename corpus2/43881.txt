I evaluate               gt = Graph[{"A" <-> "B", "B" <-> "C", "A" <-> "C", "C" <-> "D"}, VertexLabels -> "Name"]     gt = SetProperty[{gt, "B"}, VertexWeight -> 3];        I check that the property is set.               PropertyValue[{gt, "B"}, VertexWeight]      > >     3 >   Next I evaluate               gt = SetProperty[{gt, "A"}, VertexWeight -> 4];        and check               PropertyValue[{gt, "A"}, VertexWeight]      > >     4 >   Then I check to confirm the `B` vertex still has the weight I set               PropertyValue[{gt, "B"}, VertexWeight]      > >     1 (* should be 3 *) >   Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?
