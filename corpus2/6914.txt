I'm trying to export a rather complex `Animate` command into a full-HD resolution video, but having no success so far. The animation has around 520 frames (the number of elements in the `trajectory` array). What I should be seeing is a tube object moving with a sphere object, and whilst I can see the animation is working with the `Animate` command, I cannot see the same results when I export the animation. I have tried different things but this just doesn't seem to work, I'm probably not using the export command in the right way. Instead of the 500~ frames trajectory of the tube and the sphere, I just see the animator moving from one side to other. I'm using the `Export` function, in the following way:               Export["my_output.mov",animationObject,"QuickTime",ImageSize->{1920,1080}]      My animation object follows this pattern:               (*theta and phi work as a function of s (the only animated variable) to change the view point*)     theta = N[Table[q, {q, 0.1, 2 \[Pi], (2 \[Pi] - 0.1)/Length[trajectory]}]];     phi = N[Table[q, {q, 0.5 \[Pi], 2.5 \[Pi], 2 \[Pi]/Length[trajectory]}]];          Animate[      Show[       (*data is a static array of around 5000 points*)       ListPointPlot3D[(*my list plot options and data*)],            (*A tube *)       Graphics3D[{White, Thickness [0.01], Opacity[0.4],Tube[trajectory[[1 ;; s]]]}],            (*A sphere*)       Graphics3D[{Yellow, Sphere[{trajectory[[s]]}, {0.02, 0.02}]}],            (*Just showing some grids with 10 grid lines*)       FaceGrids -> {(*Specific options for the face grids to show more lines, etc*)},            (*ViewPoint changed according to the corresponding value of s in the theta and phi arrays*)       ViewPoint -> Dynamic[{Sin[theta[[s]]] Cos[phi[[s]]],Sin[theta[[s]]] Sin[phi[[s]]], Cos[theta[[s]]]}],       ViewAngle -> 50 Degree],           (*Animate Parameters*)      {s, 1, Length[trajectory], 1}, DisplayAllSteps -> True,AnimationRepetitions -> 1, AnimationRunning -> False]      I'm using Mathematica 8 student version.
