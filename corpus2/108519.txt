While doing some contracting lately for a fairly large company that handles its IT internally (mainly with younger technical staff who don't have the experience to deal with hierarchy), I came across what must be a common situation with regard to the board level not really understanding the ethical considerations of some of the things that they require from the technical department. As an example, board level members seeing software which "would be nice to incorporate into our platform" without due consideration to licensing ("well, why dont we just remove the licensing and ship it - who will know?" etc) and sales people promising highly problematic features and deadlines that the technical team now must keep because the client is a large one. The standard issues in large companies... As a "disposable" contractor, I raised this with the director that brought me on board, and he asked me what the best way was to resolve said issues without causing major battles between the various people involved... So, one thing led to another and to my surprise I found that my suggestion of an internal advisory body from the pool of general employees was taken up by the board - and I was given the task of implementing it. The board have committed to having one representative from this committee at every board meeting (with special dispensation for confidential discussions allowed) for the next year, as a trial measure - the representative is to take note on current discussions and report back to the committee, and make advisory notes to the board. Has anyone else done this? What advice can people give? Is there anything to watch out for? My idea has gained wide support with the general employees of the company, with many people wanting to put themselves forward for it, so acceptance doesn't seem to be an issue.
