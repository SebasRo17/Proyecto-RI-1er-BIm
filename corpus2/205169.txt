I've worked with Cinder previously under Windows, but have recently switched to Ubuntu. Since Cinder doesn't work on Linux (::sadface::) I've began looking for alternatives. With that in mind, could you please tell me what the differences between Processing, openFrameworks and Polycode are, and compare them to Cinder? Specifically, I would like to know   * If there are differences in the _functionality of the packages_ compared to Cinder (ie. one does something that Cinder doesn't and vice versa).    * I would also like to know how different the _syntax of the package_ is from Cinder's. I have already seen the following articles : here and here and have also visited the corresponding website for each of the libraries but could not find a clear and concise answer to my question.
