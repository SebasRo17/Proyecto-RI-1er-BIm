I'm able to plot a 3D plot of a grayscale image using `ListPlot3D`, where it plots a 3D surface of the image pixel intensity. But I would like not to plot the pixel value below a certain value. In the specific case I'm working on, I want to remove all the pixels with value zero but still plot the pixels that are above zero at there original position. Does anyone knows of how to do this?
