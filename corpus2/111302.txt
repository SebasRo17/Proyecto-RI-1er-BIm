A preview of the new "Visual Studio 11" was recently shown at Microsoft's BUILD conference. Out of interest, what technology is being used to create it? I assume it's not WinRT (which I've been led to believe is only for Metro style apps in the new Windows 8 touch-first environment) Is it still using WPF (like 2010)? Is it built on .NET 4.5? Are there any new technologies going into it? Do we know?
