As recently reported here: > Xamarin has forked Cocos2D-XNA, a 2D/3D game development framework, creating > a cross-platform library that can be included in PCL projects. However the founder of the project that was forked says: > The purpose of the MIT license is to unencumber your fair use. Not to > encourage you to take software, rebrand it as your own, and then "take it in > a new direction" as you say. > > While not illegal, it is unethical. It seems that the GitHub page of the new project doesn't even indicate that it's a fork in a typical GitHub manner, opting for an easily-removable History section instead (see bottom). So my questions are:   1. Was Xamarin's action and the way the action was done ethical or not?   2. Is it possible to avoid such a situation if you are a single developer or a small unfunded group of developers? I am hoping this could be either a wiki question or there will be some objective answers grounded on modern OSS ethics/philosophy.
