My problem is the following: I have an interface that requires its implementations to implement a static method, namely `void load()`. However, until Java 8, it seems we won't get static methods in interfaces. I trust my users to still implement it correctly, but my problem is how to write a proper doc. There are up to 50 implementations of this interface and not being able to inherit the javadoc is a bother. What is the best way to proceed in my case? Should I document a random implementation and add `@see` annotations in the others? It seems dirty to me. Any suggestion is welcome.
