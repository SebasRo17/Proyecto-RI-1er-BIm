So here's my situation: I have seven years of experience with web development. I can do PHP, MySQL, OOP, all of that stuff. I would like to make the argument that I have enough technical experience to go out in the real world and get a well-paying, full-time job if I were to drop out right now (I've had a number of job offers recently, and I have already gotten a lot of actual job experience), but I would like to stay in school and get a degree for a number of reasons ranging from the social aspects to the fact that I just want to have a BS in one thing or another as it seems to be important to have one for a lot of jobs, even when it doesn't have anything to do with the job. With that said, it makes little sense for me to major in Computer Science, because that would be like studying everything I already know. I don't want to major in something COMPLETELY different, because that would be contrary to my career goals. I am considering trying to find some interdisciplinary, customized degree of sorts that allows me to combine my current skills with a new education. I'm thinking maybe buisness or even psychology (interface design?). Could I get some ideas for what to major in and tips on who I might talk to? Thanks!
