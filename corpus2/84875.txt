I'm trying to come up with a good approach to creating a re-usable development environment such that it doesn't take a couple days to re-build a machine if it starts to sputter and to be able to onboard new developers faster. Reading about Quora's development setup made me consider alternatives to the old development environment build delay. For a .NET/Windows shop though, how are you solving this problem?   * Local virtual machine on your desktop/laptop that you can share with the other members of the team?   * A dedicated server (physical or virtual) that all developers remote desktop into and that can be easily backed up. (obviously requires a network connection, so there's a downside)?   * An instance in the cloud (like Quora)?
