I adjusted my code accordinly to the advice I got. However I still have a problem with this code which now looks like this:               NDSolve[{       D[y[r, f, t], r, r] + (1/r)*D[y[r, f, t], r] + (1/r^2)*          D[y[r, f, t], f, f] == (1/1.27*10^-4)*D[y[r, f, t], t],        y[r, f, 0] == 0,        y[0.01, f, t] == 0,        (D[y[r, f, t], r] /.          r -> 2*10^-6) == -(1/(3.14*10*10^-6*318))*(1 - Cos[2*2*3.14*t/2])           Piecewise[{{t 10, t < 1/10}, {1, True}}],        (D[y[r, f, t], f] /. f -> 2*3.14) == -(10/238)*y[r, 2*3.14, t],        (D[y[r, f, t], f] /. f -> 3*3.14/2) == 0},       y, {r, 2*10^-6, 10^-2}, {f, 3*3.14/2, 2*3.14}, {t, 0, 1},        MaxStepFraction -> 1/60]      When I run it, I get the following error message: > NDSolve::ndsz: At t==0.000039576, step size is effectively zero; singularity > or stiff system suspected Please, anyone can help me with this?
