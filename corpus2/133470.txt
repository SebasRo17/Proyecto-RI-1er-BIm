My module is enabled by default (i.e. when you add the module). There's also a configuration you can _optionally_ use, which supports an `enabled="true|false"` setting. This way the module can be disabled after it's been added, without the need to remove the module. But I realized the module doesn't play nicely with another module that is also enabled by default. I am considering changing my module so it's not be enabled by default. This would break for anyone that has not explicitly enabled it with the `enabled="true"` configuration setting. Should I wait for v2.0 for this? semver.org mentions the public API and breaking changes, not configuration. Is it generally accepted that configuration is part of the public API?
