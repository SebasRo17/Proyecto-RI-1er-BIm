What are some convenient methods to sum selected rows or columns in a matrix? This question Summing along rows or columns of a matrix only addresses how to sun entire rows or columns ie, by level. For example, suppose one wants to add columns 2 and 4 of:               M = Column@Table[RandomInteger[10], {3}, {4}];      Neither MapAt, nor ReplacePart appear useful in this regard. Of course `#[[2]] + #[[4]] & /@ M` works for summing columns and `Transpose` can be used for rows, but that seems like a hack to specify using such syntax. Any better solutions?
