I have built a function which carries out a set of operations given two parameters. The function looks as follows:               playingHand[Player_, Name_String] :=      Row[{Style[Name <> ":", FontSize -> 48, FontFamily -> "Calibri"],         Spacer[20]}~Join~        If[Player == {}, {Style["Not playing", 48, Gray,            FontFamily -> "Calibri"]},         {ButtonBar[Table[            With[{i = i},             Player[[i, 3]] :>              {AppendTo[discardPile, Player[[i]]],                Player = Delete[Player, i]}],            {i, Length@Player}]]}]]      The gist of this function is that as its first input it takes a list, which looks something like: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/S6cOs.jpg) and displays the third elements of each list within that list: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ejcR3.jpg) It also makes these images clickable, so that when one of these cards is clicked, it should disappear from `player1` and get added to an initially empty list called `discardPile`. So far so good. When I run this function by itself without the defined function, namely like this:               ButtonBar[Table[        With[{i = i},         player1[[i, 3]] :>          {AppendTo[discardPile, player1[[i]]],            player1 = Delete[player1, i]}],        {i, Length@player1}]] // Dynamic      it works like a treat. The cards are clickable and they disappear from the `ButtonBar` as soon as they are clicked and added to `discardPile`. When I try to do the same from within the function though, namely `playingHand[player1, "Aron"] // Dynamic` it suddenly stops working. A `Set::shape` error message comes up warning that two lists are not the same length, and although it does add the card to `discardPile`, it does not remove it from `player1`. So:   1. What is wrong with this function and why won't it delete the card from the list when it is clicked, and   2. How come the same error does not occur when I run the function directly without calling it by its function name?
