I am trying to use `Sow`/`Reap` to replace `Append` in my code. The problem is that I need to define the tags within my code, but doing so doesn't reap the desired results. A simplified version of my code is               Clear[tag];     Reap[tag = {a,b}; Sow[1, a];Sow[2,b];, tag]      However, if I define my tag outside of Reap, then it works               Clear[tag];     tag = {a,b};     Reap[Sow[1, a];Sow[2,b];, tag]      Any ideas as to how I can define tags within my code?
