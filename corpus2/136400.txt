I'm developing a Java application that utilizes several third party open source libraries. I'm adding a section to my app's "About" dialog that lists the components and their license notices. For those that use the same license, do I have to repeat the same license text for each one? For example, I use several components that are all released under the Apache 2 license. Do I have to list the Apache 2 license terms for each one, or just say "Foo, Bar, and Baz are used under the terms of the Apache 2 License" and list the actual terms once? Thanks. Just want to do the right thing.
