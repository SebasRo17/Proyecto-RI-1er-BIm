I am working on an application right now that needs a way for employees to log in to the back-end of the public facing application for some basic reporting. If you were creating this, would you put the admin interface on the public side or on the intranet side? Update: It is the back-end of our eCommerce application. I am logging all of the transactions with the CC processor (NOT the sent data, just the response from the processor) and the processed transactions to aide in us being able to troubleshoot when a customer has a problem. Kind of a one-stop-shop instead of looking up in multiple places. They should be in the office when doing this. This is an ASP.NET MVC project if that matters.
