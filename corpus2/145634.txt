I am trying to draw a UML use-case diagram to model requirements for a software project. The two requirements I have issue to model are:   1. `TravelAgent` creates a booking for a [old] client who is requesting a home.   2. When a new client wishes to make a booking, the `TravelAgent` register him/her to the system before doing the booking. I have two approaches to model these requirements:   1. Modeling the first use-case as a sub-procedure of the second use-case (Figure 1).    2. Extending the first use-case (Figure 2). Both approach imply that the first use-case could be perform independently, but when the second use-case is executed, the first one MUST be executed too. Are they actually same and both correct? P.S. As another question, since the `NewClient` converts to a `Client` after the registration, should I show the `NewClient` as subclass of `Client` or something?
