The problem I have is the following: Let `C` be a list of coordinates, say, `C = {x1, x2, ..., xn}` and `T` be a tensor (possibly with symmetries) defined using the `Array` command (e.g., for a tensor with $3$ covariant components):               T = Array[ tt, { dim, dim, dim}]      where `dim = n`.   Now what I want is to declare that each and every component is a function of the coordinates. Unfortunately, a command like:               T = Array[ tt[ x1, x2, ..., xn], { dim, dim, dim}]      does not work. Any suggestions?
