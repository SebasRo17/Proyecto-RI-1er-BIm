I am given geographic data in the form of Gauss-Krüger-Coordinates and would like to calculate distances with them and convert them to longitude/latitude coordinates in another system for plotting (e.g. WGS84). Gauss-Krüger-Coordinates are essentially like UTM-coordinates based upon a transversal Mercator projection where positions are indicated by a Right-value (East-value in UTM; y-coordinate in the geodetic coordinate system) and a High-value (North-value in UTM; x-coordinate int the geodetic coordinate system) Far from being an expert in geodesy the way I understand it Mathematica's geodetic functions allow entering coordinates as `GeoPosition`, as `GeoPositionENU` or as `GeoGridPosition`. `GeoGridPosition` essentially will reference to a position on a projection so probably should be the way the Gauss-Krüger-Coordinates are entered, but I am not so sure. Mathematica does not seem to know Gauss-Krüger-Projection (not listed among `GeoProjectionData[]`) and I do not know which parameters to use for Gauss- Krüger and how best to do this. Thus: How can I enter the Gauss-Krüger-Coordinates into Mathematica so they can be used for distance-calculations and conversions using Mathematica's geodetic functions?
