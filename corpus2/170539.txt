Can anybody point me to some resources about "cutting algorithm"? The problem:   * have rods with length of `L` meters, e.g. 6 m   * need cut smaller pieces of different lengths, e.g. need:      * 4 x 1.2m     * 8 x 0,9m     * etc... (many other lengths and counts) How to determine the optimal cutting, what will produce the minimum wasted material? I'm capable write an perl program, but haven't any idea about the _algorithm_. (if here is already some CPAN module what can help, would be nice). Alternatively, if someone can point me to some "spreadsheet" solution, or to anything what helps. Ps: in addition, need care about the "cutting line width" too, whats means than from the 6m long rod is impossible to cut 6 x 1m, because the cutting itself takes "3mm" width, so it is possible cut only 5 x 1m and the last piece will be only 98.5 cm (1m minus 5 x 3mm cut-width) ;(.
