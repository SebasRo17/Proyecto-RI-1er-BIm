Sometimes, maybe during a code review or a design meeting arguments can get heated and it's easy to insult someone unintentionally. These things can in turn create a tense atmosphere in the workplace or in a team which will sooner or later harm the co-operation between colleagues. My question is: what are some good methods for resolving these tensions? What can you do - on a personal level - to help these issues?
