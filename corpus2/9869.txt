Is there a nice, simple script one can use to swap two entires in a matrix? For example, suppose we have the matrix below: $A=\begin{pmatrix}2 & 4 & 1\\\ 3 & 1 & 2\\\ 4 & 3 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$ Is there a script of the form `switch[A,a,b]`, which will swap all occurrences of $a$ in the matrix with $b$, and vice versa, and then update the matrix $A$ accordingly? So in this case the output of `switch[A,2,3]` would be: $A=\begin{pmatrix}3 & 4 & 1\\\ 2 & 1 & 3\\\ 4 & 2 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$ My own solution involves a lot of `If` and `For` functions, and will, I think, also run into the problems detailed here. I think it will work eventually (and I'd be happy to post what I have so far if people would like), but really I'm just wondering whether there's a simpler way to do this. Thanks!
