A lot of web frameworks have a MVC-style layout to code and approaching problems. What are some good similar paradigms for JavaScript? I'm already using a framework (jQuery) and unobtrusive js, but that still doesn't address the problem I run into when I have more complex web apps that require a lot of javascript, I tend to just end up with a bunch of functions in a single, or possibly a few files. What's a better way to approach this?
