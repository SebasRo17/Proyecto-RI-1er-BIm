I have a problem with `Hyperlink` (in a web-embedded CDF) opening links in the same browser tab and I couldn't find an option to avoid that. I have the following constraints:   1. CDF is web-embedded (created by me).   2. The hyperlink should open only after mouse clicking, no combinations with keyboard keys are allowed. **Failed attempts:**   * I've tried to click it with `Shift` like it is written in `Help` but it does not work. It doesn't matter because of constraint #2 above. However if it is possible to mimic the `Shift` key being pressed (in some other way than pressing the key) maybe that will help?   * I've tried to replace `Hyperlink` by `Button[ "link", SystemOpen["link"]]` but there is no reaction. I don't think this is important, but this is how I'm testing it:   * I create a CDF file using _Mathematica_   * Export as "web embeddable..."   * I paste script received in the end to a `.txt` file -> save -> switch to `.html` It is quite important for me to find a solution to this, because the CDF resets every time the link opens in the same tab.
