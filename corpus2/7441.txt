In MATLAB, there is a command `kmeans()` that divides an array into $k$ clusters and calculates the centroid of each cluster. Is there any command in _Mathematica_ to perform the same action? For example:               x = {{1,2,3,4,5}, {6,7,8,9,10}, {11,12,13,14,15}, {16,17,18,19,20}, {21,22,23,24,25}}      The MATLAB `kmeans` command does this:               [b, c] = kmeans(x, 2)      It divides `x` into two clusters and calculates the centroids of these two clusters, and indicates for each element in the array which cluster it is a member of               b = {1,1,2,2,2}      and               c={{3.5000,4.5000,5.5000,6.5000,7.5000},{16.0000,17.0000,18.0000,19.0000,20.0000}}
