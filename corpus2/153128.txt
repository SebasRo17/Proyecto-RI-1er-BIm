What is Scheme's dotted pair construct analogous to in other Lisp implementations? I can make a vector or list quite easily, and understand those in Clojure, even though the syntax is a little different, like Clojure's vectors use square brackets []. However, seeing a dotted pair for the first time threw me. It almost looks like it is an implementation of of map. I'm not looking for a discussion, but more for use or the dotted pair equivalent in other Lisp dialects, like Clojure, or even Python.
