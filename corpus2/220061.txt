I have a windows service, 2 web services and a web interface that need to follow the same path (data wise). So I came up with two ways of creating my solution. ![first one](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zcPcD.png) My concern is the fact that the UI/WS/etc will have their own kind of DTO (let's say the model in ASP.Net MVC) that should be mapped to a DTO so the SL can then map it to a BO then mapping it to the proper EF6 DTO so that I can save it in a database. So I'm thinking of doing it this way ![second one](http://i.stack.imgur.com/viDm4.png) to remove one level of mapping. Which one should I take? Or is there a 3rd solution?
