I came across the idea of using function points as a metric for the velocity of a Scrum team. I saw it in a team and I found two articles mentioning a link between estimates and function points (http://www.ifpug.org/ISMA5-2010/Amol%20Keote-FunctionPointsAndAgile-Hand-in- Hand.pdf and http://www.cosmicon.com/portal/public/FromStoryPointsToCOSMIC.pdf). I am not sure how this can work, because if I understand it correctly, function points measure the _value_ of a feature (e.g. from the users perspective) whereas the velocity measures the _effort_ of finished features. And in my view there's no direct connection between these two. To put it another way: If you have (let's say) a stable Scrum Team which works 2 week Sprints, the number of functions points they deliver per Sprint should vary (possible wildly), which would render a velocity based on function points quite meaningless (e.g. for planning purposes)... Am I missing something here?
