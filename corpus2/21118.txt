A link and a quick explanation why would be very helpful. General tech news, I mean not like InfoQ which is too technical. Probably much more like P.SE than SO. EDIT: site should help developers gain general knowledge about the industry, technologies, inventions, etc. Much like when we listen to the news every morning in our car to know what is happening in our world. But target audience must be either programmmers, geeks or any other persons interested in technology.
