First let me post the question that I am doing: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/aaayQ.png) You see for wave equation y2, there is a `±` sign. I know how to do `+` or `-` at one time. Of course, I can use copy, paste and do each case separately; yet, I don't think that would be smart. I am wondering is there a way to include the both `Animation` in two graphs? (Simple and efficient code) The way I approach this problem is that first I define A1 as a constant, whose value is 1. Then I can vary the ratio of A2 versus A1. I would like apply `Animate` to variable `A2` and `δk`, because in the problem we are asked to `Animate` different amplitude ratio and phase difference. Here is my code for the `+` case:               Remove["Global`*"]          k2 = k1 + δk;          y1[x_, t_] = A1 Sin[k1 (x - v t)];     y2[x_, t_, A2_, δk_] = A2 Sin[k2 (x + v t)];          yr[x_, t_, A2_, δk_] = y1[x, t] + y2[x, t, A2, δk];          k1 = 2 π;     A1 = 1;     v = 1;          xmax = 10;     tmax = 30;     range = {{0, xmax}, {-4, 9}};          pix1[t_] := Plot[y1[x, t] + 4, {x, 0, xmax}, PlotStyle -> Red]          pix2[t_, A2_, δk_] := Plot[y2[x, t, A2, δk] + 4, {x, 0, xmax}, PlotStyle -> Blue]          pixr[t_, A2_, δk_] := Plot[yr[x, t, A2, δk], {x, 0, xmax}, PlotStyle ->Black]          plot[t_, A2_, δk_] :=        Show[{pix1[t], pix2[t, A2, δk], pixr[t, A2,δk]}, PlotRange -> range, AxesLabel -> {x, y}]          Animate[plot[t, A2, δk], {t, 0, tmax}, {A2, 1, 4, 1}, {δk, π/8, π, π/8}]
