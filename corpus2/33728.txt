I am having trouble with the while loop not breaking,               While[Abs[f[a, b] - f[aold, bold]] > 10^-5,      aold = a; bold = b;      α = dfx[a, b];      β = dfy[a, b];      l[t_] = {a, b} + t*{α, β};      h[t_] = f[l[t][[1]], l[t][[2]]];      dh[t_] = D[h[t], t];      tnew = t /. Solve[dh[t] == 0, t];      a = a + tnew*α;      b = b + tnew*β;      count++;      If[count == 10, Break[]];      ]      When I print the output, `Abs[f[a, b] - f[aold, bold]]` is way smaller than `10^-5`, the condition should be met around `5` loops.   Can you see what is wrong with the code?
