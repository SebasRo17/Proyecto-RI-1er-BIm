For example, there are some key-value configuration in .properties file. Such like `someFeatureEnable=true`. It must be bool type value which will be parsed by framework, in my case it's typical Java Spring configuration. Spring will handle the configuration and throw Exception when users set `someFeatureEnable=123`. My question is: if there many properties in .properties file, Is it worth testing them one by one? It's quite troublesome and low priority. The .properties file is always configured by tech administrator stuff. Limited chances that they will mess up the configuration. Thanks!
