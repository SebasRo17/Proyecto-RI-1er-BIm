Is it possible to use the framework behind the Windows 8 Metro UI to make Exposé-like application for Windows? I tried Mac and I really like this feature, on another side i like that I can drag the screen from the top of the screen into the Metro UI, but that is completely useless. So imagine if it is possible to use this functionality in a Exposé-like application for windows. Is it even feasible? If not, maybe at a later stage? I am a programming rookie, but it could be a fun project. Thanks in advance for any answers, suggestions and information.
