Often when I'm writing code to do a certain thing, I'm faced with either writing my own or using someone else's code. Assume here that this "thing" is something that I've never done before and am interested in learning how it's done. **Which would you say is better from a learning perspective: try writing your own solution; or looking at code by someone else?** I've always written my own code if I have an idea on how to do it, but resorted to looking at someone else's when I don't have a clue. I believe that the best is probably a combination of both: make your own attempt and then look at how someone else did.
