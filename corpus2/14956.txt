When `ImageAdjust` is called with an image, i.e. with one parameter, it returns an automatically adjusted `Image`. I would like to retrieve the `{contrast, brightness, gamma}` values `ImageAdjust` has calculated and use them as starting points for a following interactive manipulation of these value using `ImageAdjust[img, {contrast, brightness, gamma}]`, i.e. with four parameters. An obvious solution is to perform an image histogram equalization and calculate `{contrast, brightness, gamma}`. However, since **_Mathematica_** provides the solution somewhere in its code and I intend to continue using `ImageAdjust` I would rather conform with the already implemented algorithm. Hence, my questions is: How do I retrieve the parameters calculated and used by `ImageAdjust` when it runs automatically?
