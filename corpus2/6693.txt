I'm trying to run a regression using `Fit` on the output of `FinancialData["SPY", "Jan. 1, 2011"]`. However, the dates returned from `FinancialData` are not in a format that is recognized by `Fit`. The function returns dates in the format `{y,m,d}`, and I need the dates to be expressed in decimal form. I'm relatively new to Mathematica, but I've got to believe there's an easy way to transform the list provided by `FinancialData` into one that has the format of `{<date in decimal>, price}`. Any guidance would be most appreciated.
