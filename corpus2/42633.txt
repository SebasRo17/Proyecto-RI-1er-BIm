I am trying to simplify the slope of vectors with symbolic coordinates {x,y} using ArcTan[x,y] I am working with real X and Y I tried the following :               ClearAll@L;     ArcTan[L, L]     ComplexExpand@ArcTan[L, L]     Assuming[Element[L, Reals] && L > 0, ComplexExpand@ArcTan[L, L]]     % // Simplify     Simplify[ComplexExpand@ArcTan[L, L], {Element[L, Reals], L > 0}]      and got the following output:               ArcTan[L, L]     Arg[(1 + I) L]     Arg[(1 + I) L]     Arg[(1 + I) L]     \[Pi]/4      Why is there a difference between the last line               Simplify[ComplexExpand@ArcTan[L, L], {Element[L, Reals], L > 0}]      and the third-last line?               Assuming[Element[L, Reals] && L > 0, ComplexExpand@ArcTan[L, L]]
