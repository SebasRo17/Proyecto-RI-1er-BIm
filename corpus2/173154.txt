Once upon a time, I heard from someone > the only difference between programming languages is the syntax I wanted to deny it - to say that there are other **fundamental** aspects that truly set a language apart from others than just syntax. But I couldn't... So, can you? Whenever I search Google for something like "differences between programming languages", the results tend to be debates between two specific languages (I'd like something more general) - however, some of the aspects that people seemed to debate the most were:   * Object-Oriented   * Method/Operator overloading (I actually see this rather related to syntax)   * Garbage-Collection (While it seems like a good difference, for some reason it doesn't seem that "fundamental") What important aspects other than syntax can you think of?
