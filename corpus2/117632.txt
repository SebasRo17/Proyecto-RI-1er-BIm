I want to learn about developing websites with Python; how should I go about this? I am not new to programming, as I have knowledge in C#, ASP.NET, HTML, and CSS. What resources should I explore? I had a brief look at Python documentation and Dive Into Python a while ago, although the one I read was a newer version hosted at a .org website which appears to be down right now. Therefore I am aware of some Python syntax, operators, lists, etc. The main thing is that I want to learn about developing websites, and at the same time learn Python overall; I don't want to start back at the documentation or other stuff. **NOTE: You can assume I have zero knowledge in Python since what I know isn't that great.**
