Repeated measures designs or "Within-Subjects" designs are very important in live sciences and social sciences. Unfortunately, _Mathematica's_ ANOVA package is not able to analyze those designs. It only handles "Between- Subjects" type of analyses. During my whole research career I haven't been able to use _Mathematica_ to analyze most of the studies I performed, which really is a pity. In an e-mail exchange I had with WRI's Andy Ross in the beginning of this year he confirmed that I wasn't overlooking built-in functionality. The question is: is any one aware of third party packages that handle these types of ANOVAs?
