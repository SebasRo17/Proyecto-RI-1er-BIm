With relation to what's considered good OOP engineering principles, SOLID, DRY, KISS etc I am wondering whether to complete multiple tasks within one loop when easily done. The problem is that this conflicts with some principles (SRP), but could also partially lean in favor of others (DRY, KISS). A simple example would be We have a array of image file paths and we want to complete 4 overall tasks per image               get size of image     resize the image     apply a watermark to the image     apply a border to the image      This could be achieved by using one for each loop on the array, and applying each function one after the other, or we could do this with four separate foreach loops, one for getting the size, one performing a resize and so on for the other tasks. I am trying to adhere to these principles as much as possible to remove any bad habits and improve my coding skills.
