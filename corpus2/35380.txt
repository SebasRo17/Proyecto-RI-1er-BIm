I know the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization generates an orthonormal basis from an arbitrary basis. I need help with: > **Write a program that inputs a list $\\{b_1,\dotsc,b_n\\}$ of linearly > independent vectors and an inner proudct and outputs a list of orthonormal > vectors $\\{e_1,\dotsc,e_n\\}$ with the same span.**                           innerproduct1[f_,g_]:=Sum[(f/.t->i)(g/.t->i), {i,1,4}]                      gramschmidt2[innerproduct1_,list2_]:=                   Module[{k,u,v,e},                    k=Length[list2];                    Do[Subscript[v,i]=list2[[i]],{i,1,k}];                    Do[Subscript[u,i]=                      Subscript[v,i]-                       Sum[(innerproduct1[Subscript[v,i],Subscript[u,j]]/                           innerproduct1[Subscript[u,j], Subscript[u,j]]*Subscript[u,j],  {j,1 ,i-1}];                   Subscript[e,i]=                    Subscript[u,i]/Sqrt[innerproduct1[Subscript[u,i].Subscript[u,i]]],{i, 1,k}];                 Table[Subscript[e,i],{i,1,k}]                 ]      Sorry if the program is wrong. I might be going ahead of what I read which I probably am. I just learned somethings about the Gram-Schmidt process from reading an analysis text a couple days ago. I saw this question online and thought I would try to solve it with what I read. I came to some frustration and really wanted to know how to write a _Mathematica_ program for this.
