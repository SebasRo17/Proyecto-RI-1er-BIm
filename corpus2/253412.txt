In an API which should be both restful and support OData for different client types. I have an endpoint that always returns a single result. Should I:   * Return the entity as a single entity?   * Put it in a list which will always contains 1 element?    * Do something completely different? Normally a Get request returns a list of items and Get(int key) returns a single item based on the key, this however is _the_ exception. I don't want to be inconsistent, but it seems counter productive to put a single element in a list.               public SingleEntity Get() { }     public IEnumerable<SingleEntity> Get() { }
