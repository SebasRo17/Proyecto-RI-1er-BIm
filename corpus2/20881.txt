Why is _Mathematica_ returning different values for these two integrals: ![Complex Integral Sine Cosine](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1KIMw.png) I am just being introduced to complex integration, so it's possible that I have a misunderstanding of how this works, but in this case the functions inside the integral are completely equivalent. For some reason the image is not displaying, here is the code:               Integrate[1/(a^2*Cos[t]^2 + b^2*Sin[t]^2), {t, 0, 2*Pi}]          Integrate[1/(a^2*((E^(I*t) + E^((-I)*t))/2)^2 + b^2*((E^(I*t) - E^((-I)*t))/(2*I))^2),       {t, 0, 2*Pi}]
