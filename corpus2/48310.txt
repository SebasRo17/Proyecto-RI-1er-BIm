I have a legacy application written in C, using the raw Win32 API. The general level of abstraction is low and raw dependency on <windows.h> is common. I would like to port this application to GTK+. There are any kind of guidelines or best practices on how to do this? I've previously ported a MFC application to Qt, but the application was very abstracted - it draw it's own set of widgets, for example - and initial porting was very straightforward. I've been thinking at first using Winelib to build a native Linux executable and then trying to slowly refactor it into a GTK+ app. Does some one have best practices or previous experiences to share about this?
