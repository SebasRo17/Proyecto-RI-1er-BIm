We are trying to create an online-shopping like application in which we have to store a huge amount of data,since the data that will be stored are mostly document like data, the suggestion was to store the data in mongodb and using elasticsearch to add the search functionality, but i also know that elasticsearch itself can be used as a database to store the data, but I'm not sure if that's the right thing to do. Can you guys help me out?
