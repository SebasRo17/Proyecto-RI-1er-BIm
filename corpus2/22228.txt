Is there a rationale, beyond historical accident, why some _Mathematica_ option values are strings, while others are symbols? It seems natural that some value spaces, e.g. named color schemes, are so numerous and only applicable to `ColorData`, e.g. `ColorData["HTML"]` and so should be strings. On the other hand wouldn't it make more sense if `"XAxis"` in `PairedHistogram[..., BarOrigin -> "XAxis"]` were a built in symbol to be shared as an option value across composite graphics functions?
