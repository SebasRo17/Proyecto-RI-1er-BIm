I'm trying to find a way to collect data from different servers around the world. Here are the details: There is only one single PowerShell script on servers that encrypts data (simple csv file) and sends with preferred method (HTTP/HTTPS Post could be) There is no more control on that servers. Can't install any service, process etc. Just I can configure script to execute every hour. This script also will have encrypted username/password/license key for every server. Script will compress data and send to me with these information. So I need a service (I'm not sure if Web Service is the rigth solution) on the cloud that will help me to: Will get data that is sent from servers using a method. Will authenticate request to recognize sender using license key/username/password and most importantly, Will redirect/send this filecab to my SQL Server on the cloud (Azure). Also it should seperate data according to customer information in license key. So every data for every customer will be stored in dedicated DB/Tables on my SQL All the processes above should be completed automatically. No way for manual steps. Question: A Web Service (SOAP or Restful) is the rigth solution for that?
