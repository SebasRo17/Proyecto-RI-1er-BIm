I am using this code to plot a graph, and I am trying to make the font of the legend bigger.               <<PlotLegends`     ListLogLogPlot[{Sort[moby]}, PlotRange -> Full, Joined -> True,          PlotLegend -> {"Moby Dick"}, LegendPosition -> {0.30, -0.20}, LegendShadow -> None,          LegendBorder -> None, PlotStyle -> {Dashed}, BaseStyle -> {FontSize -> 14}]      This only seems to change the font size of the labels on my axis. But I also want the legend to be size 14.
