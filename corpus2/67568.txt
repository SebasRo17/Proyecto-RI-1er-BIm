I've migrated several of my projects over to the git flow work flow, and I'm loving it. However, I haven't found a best practice that keeps things flowing as smoothly when working with a project in which more than one major version is maintained at a time. _Specifically, I'm not maintaining a "free version" and a "paid version" or any other parallel model, I'm talking about a project in which Version 1 gets released, and remains supported with minor versions (1.1, 1.2, etc.) until Version 3 has been released, at which point 2 and 3 would be maintained, until 4 is released...you get the idea._ How have you, or would you, maintain two or more supported versions of a project at once in a gitflow workflow?
