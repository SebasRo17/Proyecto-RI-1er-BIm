I want to plot multiple functions with the same settings side-by-side, so I use the pure function construct (for clarity, I only use one function in this example)               Plot[        #,        {x, 0, 1}        ] & /@     {        Chop[x, 0.5]     }      however, it somehow ignores the Chop function: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/kAMYm.png) If I plot the function directly               Plot[        Chop[x, 0.5],        {x, 0, 1}     ]      everything works as expected: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cie3d.png) I get similar behaviour with Plot3D. Do you see a problem in my code? Does the pure function and Map mechanism (/@) have something to do with it? PS: I, in fact, want to use Plot3D. That's why I want to draw multiple plots next to each other instead of plotting all functions within one graphics object. I only chose showing the problem using Plot function in order to make the example simpler.
