I run into the following problem, I tried to evaluate a very simple integral:               Assuming[ a > 0  , Integrate[Sin[a*s]/(s - I)^2, {s, -Infinity, Infinity}]]      Mathematica claims the answer is zero, even though you can evaluate it by hand using residues to convince yourself that the answer is: $I\ a\ \pi\ e^{-a}$ What is weird, is that if you substitute some numerical value instead of `a` the answer is correct. Also if you switch the pole to be `+I` Mathematica gives an incorrect answer: $-2\ I\ a\ \pi\cosh(a)$ instead of simply minus the previous result. Anyone had a problem like this?
