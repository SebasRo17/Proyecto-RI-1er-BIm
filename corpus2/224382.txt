Up until now, the only networking concept I have ever implemented are basic sockets that are part of the java.net API. I am now trying to learn some higher-level API's/frameworks in java, and I am having trouble differentiating between TCP/UDP client/server libraries such as Apache MINA or kryonet and application servers such as Tomcat or JBoss. Furthermore, I would appreciate it if I could know the relationship between java.net.Socket and application servers and client/server libraries. My hypothesis is that Application Servers use websockets, which are similar to sockets but are limited by something related to the HTTP protocol. Moreover, I get the feeling that TCP/UDP client/server libraries are just higher-level abstractions of the basic sockets. Is this correct?
