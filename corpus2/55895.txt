In the documentation > As a function of the first argument, MathieuCharacteristicA is a piecewise > continuous function So how to avoid joining different pieces of the function? For example,               Plot[MathieuCharacteristicA[r, 1], {r, -2.5, 2.5}]      I get ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6r6FQ.png) So why does Mathematica draw the vertical lines in default? And how to avoid drawing them except using a explicit setting such as `Exclusions -> 1`?
