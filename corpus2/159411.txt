If one would to write auto-suggest for an IDE/code editor (like IntelliSense), does one generally need to write a parser for any language that should be supported, or do compilers/runtimes provide these things? Neither the PHP or Python binaries seem to support just parsing files and generating some kind of raw output. Eclipse seems to roll their own parser, but is this the only way to do it? Using the "native" parser would be awesome on so many levels :)
