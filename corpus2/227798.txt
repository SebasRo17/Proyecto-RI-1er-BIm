When programming, I often end up naming some generic class (think of an abstract base class for stuff you manage in your project) something like `FooObject`, `FooComponent` or `FooItem` (where `Foo` is an abreviation of project name). The problem is, that these names are used so often, they become meaningless - I mean, when I'm talking about an "object", no-one knows whether I mean "a subclass of `FooObject`", or an ordinary object. I think that a good list of synonyms for "object", "component", "callback", "handler", "action" and so on would help, because we could just redefine these world on a per-project basis. You could even make up some totally nonsense word and define your meaning in documentation. I think it would be clearer than naming stuff "objects". Here's what I mean by "nonsense" (taken from Alice in Wonderland): > Twas brillig, and the slithy toves > > Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: > > All mimsy were the borogoves, > > And the mome raths outgrabe. Maybe you can have some nice words you use in such cases? How do you deal with similar situations in your projects? [ Related: How to avoid general names for abstract classes? ]
