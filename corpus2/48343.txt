I am experimenting with `Parallelize` and `ParallelTable` This is the code I am using:               K[a_, b_, r_] = a*Exp[-r/b]/r;          T = D[K[10^5, 10^9, s], s]/299792^2 /. s -> 7.6          R = Range[0, 7, 0.01];     \[Theta] = Range[0, 2*Pi, 0.05];          RcG[d_, t_] = Sqrt[7.6^2 + d^2 - 2*7.6*d*Cos[t]];     f[a_?NumberQ, b_?NumberQ] :=        1/299792^2*NIntegrate[K[10^5, 10^9, x], {x, 7.6 - a, b}];          tab = Parallelize[        Table[1/299792^2*           d*(K[10^5, 10^9, RcG[d, t]] - K[10^5, 10^9, 7.6] - d*T) +           f[d, RcG[d, t]], {d, R}, {t, \[Theta]}]];     p1 = ListPlot3D[tab, InterpolationOrder -> 4]      I want make a 3d plot using the complicated function defined in the table. When computing, Mathem. gives this error a lot of times:               NIntegrate::inumr: The integrand K[100000,1000000000,x] has evaluated to non-numerical values for all sampling points in the region with boundaries {{7.3,7.30039}}.      It doesn't happen without the `Parallelize`, so this means that I am using it wrongly, but I don't get where. I also used `ParallelTable`, with the same result.
