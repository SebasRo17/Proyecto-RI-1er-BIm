I'm working on a translator in C++. Basically I want to parse the file with translations and store it in my program, so I can **perform search through the words and simply access the corresponding word**. My file will look like that:               word|translation     second word|second translation      etc. It doesn't have to be `|` as delimiter and the word can contain spaces. So after I store it in my program I want to search for a word and get the corresponding word easily. The question is, what is 'the best' way to store this dictionary? Should I use dynamic structures and link them? Maybe vectors? Or should I use two- dimensional array to store the 2 strings? Could you please propose to me how the structure will look like?
