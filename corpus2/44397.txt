I have this:               $ord = 9;          eq = X^Q - V^P ((V - 1)^Q/(c^(P - Q) (V - c^2)^Q)) /. Q -> 2 /.      P -> 3           VV = Series[Sum[a[i] X^i, {i, 0, $ord}], {X, 0, $ord}]          Solve[((eq /. X -> 0) == 0), V]          VV = VV /. a[0] -> 1          ef = Solve[Series[(eq /. V -> VV), {X, 0, $ord}] == 0,        Table[a[i], {i, 1, $ord}]]          aa = VV /. Flatten[ef] // Simplify          L = Log[Series[aa, {X, 0, $ord - 1}]]/X // Simplify          Expand[Coefficient[L, X]]      which is great in that it gives me what I want and expect. However, I don't understand how the Log[Series[aa,... term distributes a logarithm through a series. Is it just the case that some magnificent simplification occurs? I mean, how does the algorithm in Mathematica even start this? Is the implementation (with the assumption of bounds on the argument):               Log[Z] = Sum[(((z-1)^j)/j)*(-1)^(j+1),j=1..infinity]      I guess I just find it amazing that there are no Log terms left and a polynomial remains. Can someone enlighten me? Thanks!
