I'd like to plot a function of one real and one integer variable, but I don't want them all shown in the same 2-D plot - I'd like to see them as separate curves so I can see both 'axes', more like `Plot3D` works. I'm sure Mathematica can do this, but how? Edit: Rephrased, I'd like to `Plot3D` a function of one real and one integer variable. Instead of seeing a surface, I'd like a discrete set of curves in three space.
