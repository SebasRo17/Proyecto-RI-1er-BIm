Looking for the recent and powerful upcoming programming languages over net, I came across Ceylon. I dropped in at ceylon-lang.org and it says: > Ceylon is deeply influenced by Java. You see, we're fans of Java, but we > know its limitations inside out. Ceylon keeps the best bits of Java but > improves things that in our experience are annoying, tedious, frustrating, > difficult to understand, or bugprone. What are the advantages of Ceylon over Java?
