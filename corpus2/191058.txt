I work in Java so basically I use OOP paradigm during coding. I am about to start working in Perl and I was wondering what is the paradigm that Perl developers follow. In wiki it mentions that it supports many paradigms but I am not sure I understand this since it is a scripting language. So my question is: Are the object oriented patterns I'm familiar with in Java idiomatic in Perl, or will I need significant change to my design style to write effective Perl? Note: This is not a question to critique Perl. I actually have to work in Perl and would like to understand how the current way I program will change.
