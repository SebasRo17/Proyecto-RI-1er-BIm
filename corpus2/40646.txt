I'm running a Mathematica (version 8) notebook. In one of the first few cells, it is supposed to plot some data. It uses a couple functions that are defined in an above cell. If I do Evaluation-> Evaluate Notebook (which should evaluate the whole notebook, starting from the top, right?), it goes through and seems to evaluate it (the bars at the right turn from highlighted to regular as it goes down the notebook), but it doesn't produce the plot, or several other results that should output to the screen (they don't have a semicolon). However, if I go down from the top and manually hit shift+enter for each cell in order, it produces what it's supposed to. Am I doing something dumb? What's going on? Thanks!
