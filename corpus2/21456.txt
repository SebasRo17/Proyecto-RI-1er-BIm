In an attempt to reach at least beginner status with such a legendary editor, I have been coding in Emacs for the last two months. I try to keep an open heart, but I find myself continally disagreeing with one core design choice: that Emacs allow its users to never have to leave. In a 2010 world, I just think that every side feature of Emacs is hopelessly behind dedicated software:   * I would never use its built-in browser; Chrome is years ahead.   * I would never use its dired feature; Path Finder (Mac OS X) suits my needs.   * I would never use its built-in email; the Gmail web interface has more relevant features like Priority Inbox.   * Etc. Sure, I might occasionally dip into Emacs to use regexps, etc. for one of the above tasks, but other than regexps, I really see no reason to ever touch those side features. I'm a completely newbie, yet I have a strong gut feeling that Emacs-as-an-OS is obsolete. Emacs experts, do you think that Emacs' choice to be a comprehensive environment is the right choice for 2010 and the future? Are there particular peripheral features that are still at or ahead of their time compared to alternatives?
