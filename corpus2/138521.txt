I am cautious of asking this question because it might appear overly fastidious. I just opened up JavaScript: The Definitive Guide, and it states of the first page of chapter 1 > "JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped interpreted programming > language‚Äù So am I to take it that the interpreted part is a requirement in the language specification, or is it misleading to say that the language is an interpreted programming language when respecting the difference between a language and its many implementations? There are no static compilers for JavaScript apparently - Is there a native machine code compiler for JavaScript? so maybe it's just a reflection of this.
