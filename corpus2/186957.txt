I was reading up on data structures from Code Complete. This is when I stumbled through this piece about arrays: > **Think of arrays as sequential structures** Some of the brightest people in > computer science have suggested that arrays never be accessed randomly, but > only sequentially (Mills and Linger 1986). Their argument is that random > accesses in arrays are similar to random gotos in a program: Such accesses > tend to be undisciplined, error prone, and hard to prove correct. Instead of > arrays, they suggest using sets, stacks, and queues, whose elements are > accessed sequentially. Does this hold true for `System.Array` class in C#?
