I can't decide what to name my class. So far I've labelled it up as a Factory, but I am not sure. Here is the class. As you can see, it exists to return a concrete type of an Interface (`ResolveRegistrationIssue`) based on the argument supplied to the getter method (`ResolutionFamilyEnum`):               @SuppressWarnings("serial")     @ManagedBean(name = "resolveIssuesFactory")     @ViewScoped     public class ResolveIssuesFactory implements Serializable {              @ManagedProperty(value = "#{resolvePrimaryIssuesFactory}")         private ResolvePrimaryIssuesBean resolvePrimaryIssuesBean;              @ManagedProperty(value = "#{resolveSecondaryIssuesBean }")         private ResolveSecondaryIssuesBean resolveSecondaryIssuesBean ;              @ManagedProperty(value = "#{resolveTertaryIssuesBean }")         private ResolveTertaryIssuesBean resolveTertaryIssuesBean ;              public ResolveRegistrationIssue getResolutionBean(                 ResolutionFamilyEnum familyEnum) {                  //null safety             if(null ==familyEnum) {                 throw new IllegalArgumentException("The family which determines the Resolution Bean to be used may not be null.");             }                  if (familyEnum.equals(ResolutionFamilyEnum .PRIMARY)) {                 return resolvePrimaryIssuesBean;             } else if (familyEnum.equals(ResolutionFamilyEnum .SECONDARY)) {                 return resolveSecondaryIssuesBean;             } else if (familyEnum.equals(ResolutionFamilyEnum .TERTERY)) {                 return resolveTertaryIssuesBean;                         } else {                 throw new IllegalArgumentException("Could not determine the correct Resolution Issue bean for the provided family.");             }         }      Now, I understand that a Factory class accepts arguments which define the entity to be **developed** and then **delivered** (returned). However in my case, my entities are already developed, as they are EJB references. Thus this method only delivers them. So is this still a Factory?
