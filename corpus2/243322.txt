Can someone explain to me how are effected the performances of an Access 2003 DB when it's used by a lot (30) of users on the same LAN? I'm working on a vb6 project with this access 2003 DB wich performs ok on my local PC, but it's terrible when used across 20-30 users. It's there something I can do to improve performance? How can I understand what's the cause of this degradation in performance?
