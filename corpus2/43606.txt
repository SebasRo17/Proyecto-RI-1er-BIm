I tried to search for a topic on this, but didn't seem to find anything, so here goes. I'm pretty new to Mathematica, so there are a lot of things I don't know yet, but one thing is pretty annoying so far. If I type something, lets say 10 lines with functions, variables, matrices and so on, and I push SHIFT + Enter on each line to get an output. Then I can either give each function, plot etc. a name or some sort, so I can use it always. But I can also, at least I've seen, use %, and then it takes the last output, if I'm not mistaken, or else I can use %(number) to define which output I want to use. But, and now comes the problem, if I want to change something in a previous line, let's say a value in a matrix needs to be changed, and I SHIFT+Enter that line again to update the output. Then the input/output number changes, and the places where I have used the % command, and want to update as well, are now flawed because the input/output is not the same as before. As I said, I find it pretty annoying that I just can't change a tiny value without affecting the whole document. But maybe it's just because I'm a noob, and don't know how to do it ? Thanks in advance.
