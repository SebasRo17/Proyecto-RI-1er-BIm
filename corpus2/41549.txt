I have two lists with some data.               a={1,2,3,4,5}     b={5,4,3,2,1}      Now I want to compute the cross correlation of the two lists with a time lag of 1, like it is mentioned on wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross- correlation The only function I found in mathematica is **CorrelationFunction** , but this one seems to only compute the autocorrelation of a lists with itself. So I was wondering if there is another function or how do do this. Can anybody help me out?
