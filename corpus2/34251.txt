I am constructing a diagram that consists of a sine curve and its tangent line at a given argument. However, I want to show the coordinates of the point of tangency and the equation of the tangent line dynamically. My work so far:               f[x_] := Sin@x;     l[x_, a_] := f[a] + f'[a] (x - a);     Manipulate[        Show[         Plot[Sin@x, {x, 0, 2 \[Pi]},           PlotRange -> {-2, 2}, AxesStyle -> Arrowheads[0.03],            AxesLabel -> {"x", "Sin[x]"}, AspectRatio -> Automatic,            PlotLabel -> f[a] <> "+" <> f'[a] ("x-" <> a)],          Plot[l[x, a], {x, a - 2, a + 2}, PlotStyle -> Pink],         Graphics[{PointSize[Medium], Red, Point[{a, Sin@a}]}]],       {a, 0, 2 \[Pi]}]      Unfortunately, what I've done doesn't work. So my question is: how do I get the information I need to make it work. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/O3TFk.png)
