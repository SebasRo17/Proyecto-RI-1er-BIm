When I install `RLink`:               Needs["RLink`"]     InstallR[]      then evaluate the command               REvaluate["R.version.string"]      I see that it is running               {"R version 2.14.0 (2011-10-31)"}      a version which I did not intentionally install on my system. I believe that _Mathematica_ downloaded this itself. Now I wish to install packages. For example:               REvaluate["install.packages('LaplacesDemon')"]      yields               REvaluate::err:      General error in function RLink`Private`withRTemporaryVariables >>      Is it possible to install packages with _Mathematica_ 's version of R? Even a command line solution would be great. EDIT: It seems that the error above was an aberration. It stopped showing up after I restarted Mathematica. Following Sasha's advice, I tried to add a repository:               REvaluate["install.packages('LaplacesDemon', repos='http://cran.wustl.edu/')"]      and the error is equally as bad:               REvaluate::rerr: Failed to retrieve the value for variable or piece of code     install.packages('LaplacesDemon', repos='http://cran.wustl.edu/'.      The following R error was encountered: Error in typeof(myRandomVar123456759046) :     object 'myRandomVar123456759046' not found >>      Similar errors for ggplot2, Zelig, etc. There appears to be a whole R tree in               $HomeDirectory/Library/Mathematica/Paclets/Repository/RLinkRuntime-MacOSX-x86-64-9.0.0.0/SystemFiles/MacOSX-x86-64/R/library      but the R version there doesn't seem to be usable.
