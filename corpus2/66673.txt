In bidding a complex project for a client, I wanted a way to determine their reliance upon software. They have many people doing manual entry and Excel spreadsheets power many pieces as well as legacy code and some off the shlef solutions that do not interact in any way. Its one thing to say "You need software to run your business" but how do you create a measure of this to be able to say something like "You are currently 68% reliant upon software" its time to take it seriously before the expanding complexity costs more to maintain than to re-write?
