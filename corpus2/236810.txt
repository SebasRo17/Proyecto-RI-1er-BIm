I am making HTTP calls on the client side and the server expects me to supply a client nonce. It needs to be 4 bytes long. I am planning to use this combination:               base64(parts of the MAC address + random bits generated by RNG)      Given that the protocol is created by experts (thus its security is not to be questioned), is my nonce calculation acceptable in your view ?
