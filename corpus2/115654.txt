I have seen and read quite a few books about software design (using UML, etc.), and others about user experience, GUIs, etc. but I'm looking for books that describe the process that happens before all of that. I'm looking for the pre-development stuff. How to develop a cohesive and comprehensive plan for what the application is functionally supposed to do, leading to flow-charts and a functional specification, etc. So I guess my question is in two parts: Is there a book out there that's the de-facto standard for describing best practices, design methodologies, and other helpful information about functional requirements analysis? What about that book makes it special?
