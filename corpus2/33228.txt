So, I'm seriously considering axing ASP.NET AJAX from my future projects as I honestly feel it's too bloated, and at times convoluted. I'm also starting to feel it is a dying library in the .NET framework as I hardly see any quality components from the open-source community. All the kick-ass components are usually equally bloated commercial components... It was cool at first, but now I tend to get annoyed with it more than anything else. I'm planning on switching over to the jQuery library as just about everything in ASP.NET AJAX is often easily achievable with jQuery, and, more often than not, more graceful of a solution that ASP.NET AJAX and it has a much stronger open-source community. Perhaps, it's just me, but do you feel the same way about ASP.NET AJAX? How was/is your experience working with ASP.NET AJAX?
