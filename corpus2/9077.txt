I am reasking this question in a new thread. My previous post How Can I Use Solve/Reduce Output? seemed to have led to a an interesting dissussion of how to (better) solve the problem that produced the output rather than in how to use the output further as I had intended. [Perhaps it indirectly answered my question by telling me that if I wanted to know more I needed to reformulate the problem and the solution as qiven was as far as Mathematica could go with the original formulation.] My questions is "Can I use the following result for further Mathematica calculations?" [i.e. I am not particularly interested in this solution other than using it as an **example** expression of a conditional with restricted domain.]               solQ= (x | y) \[Element] Rationals && -1 <= x <=       1 && (y == -Sqrt[1 - x^2] || y == Sqrt[1 - x^2])       I do know of one Mathematica function that will accept this as input:               In[9]:= FindInstance[solQ, {x, y}, 10]          During evaluation of In[9]:= FindInstance::fwsol: Warning: FindInstance found only 3     instance(s), but it was not able to prove 10 instances do not exist. >>             Out[9]= {{x -> -1, y -> 0}, {x -> 100/2501, y -> 2499/2501}, {x -> 1,        y -> 0}}      [However (as an aside) this function has strange behavior when I ask for 50 instances it can only find 2 for sure!]               In[11]:= FindInstance[solQ, {x, y}, 50]          During evaluation of In[11]:= FindInstance::fwsol: Warning: FindInstance found only 2     instance(s), but it was not able to prove 50 instances do not exist. >>          Out[11]= {{x -> -1, y -> 0}, {x -> 1, y -> 0}}      Are there other Mathematica functions that will accept these types of solutions (like solQ) as a valid input expressions that would help me further explore the solution? Perhaps some graphics functions? Perhaps in an Assumption? ...? Perhaps the solution as given above satisfies a Mathematician (which I am not) by "proving" that a solution exits and giving a few examples? Thank you all for your patience with these rather poorly defined questions [coming from a 75 year old physicist in retirement, with no cohort for discussion, just trying to (re)learn some math and Mathematica.]
