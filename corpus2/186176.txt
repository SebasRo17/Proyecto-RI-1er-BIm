I come with a clear agenda on how to code correctly. I used to be a team leader, and I managed using significant amount of mentoring to create a team that creates high quality code. Now I have 3 teams under me, each one has its own team leader. My time is mostly spent on strategic meetings and I can't devote enough of it to mentor my teams. Once I do get to see code or design, I usually finds flaws in it, but I get to see little of that and I am afraid that all the code I can not see is designed or written poorly. How can I make sure my teams produce great code? Note: I am not in the position to fire anyone.
