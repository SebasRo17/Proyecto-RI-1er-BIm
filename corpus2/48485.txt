Let's say I created a 3D plot in _Mathematica_. It's not oriented the way I want it, so I manually rotate it (in the output cell) to a desired view. (I tried playing with some view options in the code, but I gave up -- I admit my spatial imagination is really bad.) Here's the question: how can I find the options in the manually adjusted graph, so that I can reproduce it with _Mathematica_ code?
