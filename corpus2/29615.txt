On V 9.01 on windows 7, all 64 bit. I am sure I am missing something simple here, but I used all the tricks of the trade that I know about, and read docs, and do not see anything that helps. Here is a compiled function made to speed up some computation. When this function is put inside `Plot` or `Table` it resort back to being slow at the speed of the original uncompiled function speed. Using `Evaluate` gives an error. Here is a MWE (This function takes about one minute to evaluate and compile, sorry that is what I am using, but it is only one line, and takes one minute to compile)               ClearAll[f, g, g0, x, b, a];     f = Function[{##} /. {x_, b_, a_} :>Piecewise[{{Exp[-b*(-Log[x])^a], 0. < x <= 1.}}]];     g = InverseFunction[f, 1, 3];     g0 = Compile[{{x, _Real}, {a, _Integer}, {b, _Integer}}, g[x, a, b]]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/LQ24u.png)               Timing[g0[.1, 3, 2]]     (* {0.156001, 0.416409} *)      and               Timing[g0[#, 3, 2] & /@ Range[0, 1, .1]]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/AT4Ff.png) It is fast now. Uncompiled version takes more than 60 seconds for each one computation. But when in a table, it becomes slow again, using the original version? or for some other reason               Table[Timing[g0[x, 3, 2]], {x, 0, .1, .1}]     (* {{61.308393, 0.00258519}, {61.323993, 0.416409}} *)      `Evaluate` gives error and still slow               Table[Evaluate[g0[x, 3, 2]], {x, 0, .1, .1}]     (*CompiledFunction::cfsa: "Argument x at position 1 should be a      "machine-size real number " *)      Direct use of Table is too slow, same as above.               Table[g0[x, 3, 2], {x, 0, .1, .1}]      Same issue with `Plot`. Can't use `Evaluate` and if I do not, it is slow. Using `Compiled-False` did not help (since `g0` is already compiled), it is still slow               Plot[g0[x, 3, 2], {x, 0, 1}, Method -> {Compiled -> False}]; (*slow*)     Plot[g0[x, 3, 2], {x, 0, 1}, Method -> {Compiled -> False}, Evaluated -> False];      Plot[g0[x, 3, 2], {x, 0, 1}, Evaluated -> False]; (*slow*)      **How can one use Compiled function in`Table` and `Plot` without it being slow?** Is it one of those `HoldRest`, `HoldFirst` issues or I am missing something more basic here?
