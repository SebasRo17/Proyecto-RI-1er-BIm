I won a bid on Elance and was had a request to fix some css and html issues with a WordPress site. How do I make changes to the document without working on the live site? Do you set up a development environment for every job you get? This would be time consuming on a job that pays very little. I was offered access to the wp-admin and the cpanel but any changes would affect the live site immediately. What is the best practice for changing and updating sites for clients? Any advice on how to develop on a site that you do not have the full install on is helpful.
