I want to create a database that tracks different projects and their finances. As finances are tracked monthly, a new column has to be created for each month. I could create all tables together at the start, yeah, but I guess it would be bad development strategy. Also I would be guessing the number of months. I will be creating an application to monitor those projects (like graphs and such)... so maybe I could code the program to do it at regular intervals.
