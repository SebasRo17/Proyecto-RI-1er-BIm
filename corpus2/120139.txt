I am developer / analyst in an internal IT department at a medium sized business. I have to deal with business people all the time and many of the things I create can have profound impacts on the business. I am starting to regret not taking any business classes in college because I don't understand the first thing about running a business so I don't always understand what people are wanting, the best I can do is "think through it". Does anyone have suggested methods of learning this stuff, maybe some resources. And please don't just say to ask people who work here. I have tried that before and I get no where.
