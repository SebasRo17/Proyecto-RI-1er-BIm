The following tools is provided by Apple   * dlopen   * dlsym   * objc_getClass   * sel_registerName   * objc_msgSend Those are listing Objective-C selectors, or strings. Objective-C selectors are stored in a special region of the binary, and therefore Apple could extract the content from there, and check if you've used some undocumented Objective-C methods.   * How to utilize these tools to find undocumented Objective-C methods? **EDIT:** Recently, one of my App rejected due to using one undocumented methods. > -[UIDevice setOrientation] Since, selectors are independent from the class you're messaging, even if my custom class defines `-setOrientation`: irrelevant to UIDevice, there will be a possbility of being rejected.
