Some of my calculations depend on the choice of several values from the interval [-2, 2] (it is more or less interpolation of a fixed function using the points as parameters). I want to create a dynamic control for them. The ideal thing to have would be a Slider with multiple positions to move, or a Locator on a line. As for now, I have tried to implement the second variant:               Manipulate[       points[[All, 2]] = Table[0, {5}];       Plot[points, {x, -2, 2}, PlotRange -> 1/100, AspectRatio -> 0.01],       {{points, ({#, 0} &) /@ RandomReal[{-2, 2}, {5}] }, Locator}]      That works, but with quirks: locator panes still can be lifted visibly higher or lower than the base line. Sure, they fall back immediately due to `points[[All, 2]] = Table[0, {5}]` line, but I hope there is a better solution. Is there?
