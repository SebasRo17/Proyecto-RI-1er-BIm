My company has decided to purchase a multitude of devices for browser testing our stages e.g. iPhones, Android, Windows and assorted tablets. They've tasked me with finding specific devices that cover largest common denominator of users and scenarios. We recently had a client that had us testing 10-20 different devices; each having their own oddities. Which android and windows phone would give us the largest spectrum of the market in terms of compatibility?
