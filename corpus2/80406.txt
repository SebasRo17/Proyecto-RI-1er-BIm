I'm writing an authentication system which uses XML formatted messages between client/server. A successful username/password authentication needs to return a randomly generated session ID to the client:               <?xml version="1.0"?>     <amhAPI>         <auth>             <sessionId>728c91ea-2ead-4fa9-93c5-3a8453174bea</sessionId>         </auth>     </amhAPI>      How do I write a unit test which can confirm the format of the success message, since I can't simply do a straight string match due to the random component?
