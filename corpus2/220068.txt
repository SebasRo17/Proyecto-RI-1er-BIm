I read the original text of Apache License, Version 2.0 and the explanation in plain English. OK, I copy a class distributed by _The Best Company in the World_ , their license, and modify the code a bit. **The original file with my changes.**               /*      * Copyright (C) 2011 The Best Company in the World      *       * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");      * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.      * You may obtain a copy of the License at      *       * http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0      *       * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software      * distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,      * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.      * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and      * limitations under the License.      */          package com.mypackage;          public class MyClass {              private void someMethod() {             // Their code             // My little change         }     }      Then I use MyClass in my application.   1. Do I need to replace _The Best Company in the World_ with the name of my company or with my own name? If not, will my project contain two licenses: theirs and mine? Where to save them in this case?   2. And as far as I understand, I must distribute my application using Apache Licence, Version 2.0. Wikipedia says: > The Apache License is widely, but not universally, considered permissive in > that it does not require a derivative work of the software, or modifications > to the original, to be distributed using the same license (unlike copyleft > licenses â€“ see comparison).
