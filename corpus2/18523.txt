When taking the derivative of a series expansion around a finite point, the $O(x^n)$ part is differentiated as expected. $O(x^n)$ becomes $O(x^{n-1})$ except $O(x^0)$ which stays $O(x^0)$. When expanding around infinity, things do not work out that nicely. $O\left(\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^n\right)$ in general becomes $O\left(\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^{n+1}\right)$. So far so good but $O\left(\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^0\right)$ stays the same as in the expansion around a point that is finite. This doesn't seem to make sense because the leading constant term should drop out and the second one should be differentiated so we should get $O\left(\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^2\right)$. Am I missing something? Is this behavior to be expected?               D[O[x, Infinity] x, x]     (* Out[1]= SeriesData[x, DirectedInfinity[1], {}, 0, 0, 1] *)
