I'm just coming to the end of my BSc Computer Science degree, and I'm faced with a choice. My dream has always been to do independent game development, and I'm considering taking the next year to try at indie game dev. If it works, that's cool and I can carry on, if it fails I'll try looking for another job. However, one of my friends suggested that doing this would massively hurt my employability, which would not be good! Will it?
