I have seen many people around complaining about verbosity in programming languages. I find that, within some bounds, the more verbose a programming language is, the better it is to understand. I think that verbosity also reinforces writing clearer APIs for that particular language. The only disadvantage I can think of is that it makes you type more, but I mean, most people use IDEs that do all that work for you. so, What are possible downsides to a verbose programming language?
