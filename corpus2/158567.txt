Is there evidence that some software development best practices depend on programming skill level? I mean, these methods are good, but maybe the way the are used or the extent might vary? This question arose after I read Paul Graham's commentary about OOP, and the last bullet point of this accepted answer. It proposes that where, how, and how much to use unit tests might depend on your programming skill. So do top programmers use different approaches than average programmers?
