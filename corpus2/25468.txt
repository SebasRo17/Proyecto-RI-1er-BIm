How do I get rid of blurry transitions between pixels of the background image below. It's the fault of `Texture[]`, previously discussed in this answer. I haven't been able to get good results with `ImageCompose[]` or the other answers in this question. I'd like to avoid manual white margins that have to be adjusted if the image size changes or the font size of tick marks changes. The best solution I've found so far is to manually scale `a` up using `ImageResize[]` before using it as Texture. It reduces blurry transitions, but does not get rid of them.               a = Import["http://i.imgur.com/PiLKV6S.png"];     Show[ParametricPlot[{20 + 1.4 x - 40 y, x}, {x, 0, 200}, {y, 0, 1},       BoundaryStyle -> Directive[Purple, Thick],        PlotRange -> {{0, 201}, {0, 144}},       Prolog -> {Texture[a],         Polygon[{Scaled[{0, 0}], Scaled[{1, 0}], Scaled[{1, 1}], Scaled[{0, 1}]},          VertexTextureCoordinates -> {{0, 0}, {1, 0}, {1, 1}, {0, 1}}]         }]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/H8UHL.png)
