I think there should be a simple solution for my current problem, but neither StackOverflow (or the help of Mathematica) or Google have it. I have to plot multiple density plots with a color function.               ListAnimate[Table[         ListDensityPlot[ListOfResults[[i]],              ColorFunction -> "TemperatureMap", PlotRange -> All,              PlotLabel -> i],          {i, 1, Length[ListOfResults]}], AnimationRunning -> False]      The main problem is that for each plot, the extreme colors are assigned to the maximum and minimum values of the current plot. I want the extreme values of the color function to be the global maximum of minimum of my complete data set.
