I have to invert the following matrix in which the functions `U[t,x,y,r]` and `K[t,x,y,r]` and all their derivatives are "small";               matr={{(1 - 2*U[t, x, y, r]/c^2 - 2*D[K[t, x, y, r], t]/c), -D[         K[t, x, y, r], x], -D[K[t, x, y, r], y], -D[K[t, x, y, r],          r]}, {-D[K[t, x, y, r], x], -(1 + 2*U[t, x, y, r]/c^2), 0,        0}, {-D[K[t, x, y, r], y], 0, -(1 + U[t, x, y, r]/c^2),        0}, {-D[K[t, x, y, r], r], 0, 0, -(1 + 2*U[t, x, y, r]/c^2)}}      furthermore I need the final expression only up to the order `c^-2`. I am using the code:               Simplify[Series[       Series[Series[         Series[Series[           Series[Inverse[matr], {c, Infinity, 2}], {D[K[t, x, y, r], r],             0, 1}], {D[K[t, x, y, r], y], 0, 1}], {D[K[t, x, y, r], x], 0,           1}], {U[t, x, y, r], 0, 1}], {D[K[t, x, y, r], t], 0, 1}]]      The problem is that inevitably, there are terms of the type:               D[K[t,x,y,r],t]*D[K[t,x,y,r],x]      and so on. Is it possible to tell Math. that those terms are small too, without adding them to the series? Even better: how can I simplify my nested series expansion? **EDIT** To answer @Daniel Lichtblau The "small" terms must be at first order. There are no problem in terms of the type `c.small=TooSmallToKeep`.
