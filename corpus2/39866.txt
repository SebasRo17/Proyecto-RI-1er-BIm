Say I have a normal distribution,               NormalDistribution[25, 7]      I'd like integers from 1 to 50, not sampled at random from that distribution, but sampled in a way that the mean is more common than the bounds, following that distribution. What is that called, and is there a way of doing it concisely within Mathematica? I suppose one way to do it would be selecting a number from 1-50 with the probabilities given by               Table[NormalDistribution[25, 7], {x, 1, 50, 1}]     {0.00015967, 0.000257934, 0.000408253, 0.000633121, 0.000962014, \     0.00143223, 0.00208921, 0.00298598, 0.00418147, 0.0057373, 0.007713, \     0.0101596, 0.0131119, 0.0165803, 0.0205426, 0.0249376, 0.0296614, \     0.0345672, 0.0394707, 0.0441593, 0.0484068, 0.051991, 0.0547124, \     0.0564132, 0.0569918, 0.0564132, 0.0547124, 0.051991, 0.0484068, \     0.0441593, 0.0394707, 0.0345672, 0.0296614, 0.0249376, 0.0205426, \     0.0165803, 0.0131119, 0.0101596, 0.007713, 0.0057373, 0.00418147, \     0.00298598, 0.00208921, 0.00143223, 0.000962014, 0.000633121, \     0.000408253, 0.000257934, 0.00015967, 0.0000968449}      Where each position is the probability that that number would be selected: 1 would show up with p = .00015967, etc. Is that right? I'm not really sure how to map and select the integers 1-50 along these probabilities, or even if that's on track. I'm not sure because I don't want it to be left to probability: the function that makes these should be deterministic. I don't think I'm describing this very well. The idea is to have parameters vary normally around the mean, 25, but are integers and not randomly sampled, as I only need a few (though in this case 50) though that number may change. I hope this makes some semblance of sense. The end result would be a list               {1, 5, 10, 13, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, 33, 37, 40, 45, 50}      Or something like that, but with whatever distribution and number of numbers (I'd like to do it for something like `MixtureDistribution[{1, 1}, {NormalDistribution[25, 7], NormalDistribution[75, 7]}]` as well).
