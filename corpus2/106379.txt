Do programming languages, that we are mainly coding in, really change the way we are thinking about problems? Sort of programming kind of the Sapirâ€“Whorf hypothesis. And if they do, doesn't it really mean, that there **are** programming languages, which can make us, well, not stupid, but narrow-minded? **UPDATE:** this question is actually not about acknowledging the fact that we all should know at least three or four languages. This goes without saying. But what if there are some "dangerous" languages, which is better not to learn at all?
