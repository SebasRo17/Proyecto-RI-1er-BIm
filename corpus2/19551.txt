I use two different radii in a `Tube` expression to draw a cone. I know for a fact that this worked in Mathematica 8, but when I reevaluated my code in versio 9.0.1               Graphics3D[{CapForm["Butt"], Tube[{{0, 0, 2}, {0, 0, 4}}, {2, 4}]}]      which looks like this I get a tube !["Butt" gives no cone.](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dEgCj.jpg) while               Graphics3D[{CapForm[None], Tube[{{0, 0, 2}, {0, 0, 4}}, {2, 4}]}]      returns open cones, which is not what I want ![None gives a cone but is open](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PrioW.jpg) The `Help` does not indicate that any changes have been applied in version 9. **EDIT** Thanks for the comments. The error has been reported. Below a summary of Mathematica's behavior.               Graphics3D[{Opacity[0.6], CapForm["Square"], #, CapForm[None], #,     CapForm["Butt"], #}] & @ Tube[{{0, 0, 2}, {0, 0, 4}}, {2, 4}]      ![Summary of CapForm error.](http://i.stack.imgur.com/kU10D.jpg)
