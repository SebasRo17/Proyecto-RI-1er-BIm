Whenever I'm writing a typical if-else-construct in any language I wonder what would be the best way (in terms of readability and overview) to add comments to it. Especially when commenting the else clause the comments always feel out-of-place for me. Say we have a construct like this (examples are written down in PHP):               if ($big == true) {         bigMagic();     } else {         smallMagic()     }      I could comment it like this:               // check, what kind of magic should happen     if ($big == true) {         // do some big magic stuff         bigMagic();     } else {         // small magic is enough         smallMagic()     }      or               // check, what kind of magic should happen     // do some big magic stuff     if ($big == true) {         bigMagic();     }     // small magic is enough     else {        smallMagic()     }      or               // check, what kind of magic should happen     // if:   do some big magic stuff     // else: small magic is enough     if ($big == true) {         bigMagic();     } else {         smallMagic()     }      What are your best-practice examples for commenting this?
