I have an object that contains a reference to another object of the same type. Example in PHP:               class A {         protected $child;         public function __construct(A $child = null) {             $this->child = $child;         }              public function go() {             if($this->child) {                 $this->child->go();             }         }     }          $a = new A(new A());     $a->go();      Is the `go` method considered a recursive method? I can see it both ways myself, and I'm not sure if there is a 'correct' answer or not, but I assume that there is.
