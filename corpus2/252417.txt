I am teaching myself to program in C and have been for a few months. I recently took a one month break and came back a week ago, and it's all gone. I had to look up some things that I really put effort into understanding (see: pointers) and some others just stuck with me. Now learning about `malloc` and dynamically allocated memory is also getting a bit tough. What do you suggest for keeping it all retained? Will it just come with time and experience?
