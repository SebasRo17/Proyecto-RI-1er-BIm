I need advice on how to get a job in Robotics. I got a rejection when I applied in IRobot or some company related to Robotics. I am a international student. I have a masters in Artificial Intelligence and Bachelors in Electrical and Electronics engineering. Master's thesis is based on using machine vision in solving marine science problem. I made few robots. Two of them are, Hexapod walker and fire rescue robot. I am comfortable with C, Prolog and MATLAB. Can someone suggest me where I am going wrong? I want to develop career in robotics.
