Consider this code:               variable = Sin[x];     fun = Compile[{{x, _Real}}, variable, CompilationOptions -> {"InlineExternalDefinitions" -> True}];     NMinimize[fun[x], {x}]      This code returns:                CompiledFunction::cfsa: Argument x at position 1 should be a machine-size real number. >>      {-1., {x -> -1.5707963267948966}}      Why do I get the error? How can I resolve this issue? Edit What if we use instead of Sin an expression like a+b? Because in reality I have an expression with 63 variable which must be find by NMinimize I cannot define a function of that expression and use it instead of Sin
