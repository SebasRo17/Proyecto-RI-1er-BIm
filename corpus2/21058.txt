I want to draw temperature 3D plot based on given data points {{x1,y1,z1},{x2,y2,z2},...}. Here z coordinate is temperature.Am going to Show the temperature z in corresponding {x,y} coordinate. In my example i used only 11 points. I tried like this.               list = {};     width = 50;     length = 30;     place = { {20, 4, 20}, {20, 10, 10}, {20, 15, 10}, {20, 19, 15}, {20,      23, 5}, {20, 27, 60}, {40, 5, 50}, {40, 10, 30}, {40, 19,      20}, {40, 27, 40}, {45, 10, 35}};     Table[AppendTo[list, Table[0, {x, width}]], {y, length}];         Table[                     list = ReplacePart[list, {{y, x} -> place[[n, 3]]}],                     {n, Length[place]}, {y, place[[n, 2]] - 1,place[[n, 2]] + 1}, {x, place[[n, 1]] - 1, place[[n, 1]] + 1}             ];     ListPlot3D[list, Mesh -> 10, AxesLabel -> {x, y, z},RotationAction -> "Clip"]      Here i have given the data is x coordinate, y coordinate and z coordinate(temperature). Sub list {x,y,z} represent each point. In this manner, I want to create 1000 to 1500 points that are laid out in the plot with gap between each point shown clearly. I have specified length and width of plot as 50 and 30 respectively. The problem am facing is i can't layout all(1000 to 1500) points in 50*30 dimension of `Plot`, even if i place all the points in 50*30 dimension plot the gap between each point is not shown clearly. If i increase the dimension of list from 50 to 500 and 30 to 300 means 500*300, i will get the output but its really slow. Because 500*300 leads 150,000 data which makes the plot slow. In this plot i have used `ReplacePart[]` function to replace 0 with given temperature and i have used table to span from previous point of current point to next point of current point means -1 to 1(three points).
