I like that SourceForge can also let people browse your code using Git. But, before I even set up the project on SourceForge, I had a GitHub repository for it. Now that I have created my SourceForge project, I had the option to use the Git tool. The problem is when I did that it made a new repository from scratch. I would like to use my existing GitHub repository with my SourceForge project, is this possible? As of now the SourceForge project has no files, so the button on the summary page, instead of a 'Download' button, is a 'Browse Code' button, but the button leads to an empty repository. So I am wondering, is it possible to link my SourceForge project with my existing GitHub repository, or do I need to remove the 'Code' tool from my SourceForge project and just leave a link to my repository in the description?
