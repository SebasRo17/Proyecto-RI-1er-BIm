I am considering building a **DBAL** from scratch with PHP to use within my projects and also to learn through the process. I have noticed on _SO_ and other reputable forums that whenever this is mentioned most users advise to use an established DBAL like Doctrine and to not " _reinvent the wheel_ ". Why is it that with this specific piece people continuously recommend to use a pre-made one? Is it that hard/problematic to create and build as you go? If so what are the main problem points? I assume security is one. In regards to the established DBALs like Doctrine, I have downloaded and inspected the contents and noticed its rather big, for those who have experience with this, is all of this really necessary? Do you use all of this functionality provided(and know whats happening in the backend)? From what I inspected I am finding it hard to see how I would use more than 40% of the libary, along with this I have the feeling that I am not completely sure whats happening in the backend with such a big library. Perhaps this is a common feeling and you get over it?
