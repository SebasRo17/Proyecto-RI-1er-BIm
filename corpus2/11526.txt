I came across a variant of k-means that adds a algorithm to select good starting values called k-means++.               kMeansInitializer[data_, k_Integer] :=      Module[       {startingPoint = RandomChoice[data], getDistance, getDistances,         nextPoint},       getDistance[datum_, points_] := Min[Norm[datum - #]^2 & /@ points];       getDistances[points_] := getDistance[#, points] & /@ data;       nextPoint[points_] := RandomChoice[getDistances[points] -> data];       NestList[nextPoint, startingPoint, k - 1]       ]      After implementing the algorithm (a bit of a challenge for someone at my level) I now find I have no idea how to feed the values I generate to `ClusteringComponents` to use as initial values for use in its k-means implementation.
