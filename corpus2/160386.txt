I wrote a (super) simple Chrome Extension for the Telerik Code Converter that just iframes their page in a browser action pop-up. It's been really helpful as I use this tool all the time when I have to port some of my more complex C# code to VB. I was wondering if it would be **ethical** for me to upload this Extension to Chrome Web Store for other developers to use? Of course I wouldn't ever be charging or profiting from it in any way.
