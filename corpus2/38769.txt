I'm trying to calculate the function:               CoshIntegral[x] Sinh[x] - Cosh[x] SinhIntegral[x]      Unfortunately _Mathematica_ seems to hit a point (x~20) and things become unstable (see plot below), there shouldn't be any infinities in the area, so I am rather confused as to what is going on! ![plot of above function](http://i.stack.imgur.com/axuW0.jpg) Does anyone know why this is happening and how to fix it?
