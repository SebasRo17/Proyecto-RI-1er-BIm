I was going through this article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subculture Which got mee thinking is programming a subculture? After the a while I started thinking it really hard, and if you go really in depth this is a very complex and interesting question to ask. YOu can even ask yourself if (heavy) internet (social) users are an subculture and programmers a culture within. I think it might be an interesting discussion, hope you like it! NOTE: I linked the wiki article because it might be a good baseline, maybe you can base you answer on Ken GelderÂ´s proposal to distinguish subcultures. But it should be based on a little bit more that intuition. Thanks in advance! Trufa
