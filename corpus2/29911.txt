Normally, we can ask for the mean, median, etc. underlying pixel values for morphological components with the command:               ComponentMeasurements[{MorphologicalComponents[img], img}, "MeanIntensity"]      I'm looking to use SelectComponents to select components based on their mean or median underlying pixel values. However, commands like the following:               SelectComponents[{MorphologicalComponents[img], img}, "MeanIntensity", # < 0.4 &];      Seem to simply fail. Is there a way to proceed? Clarification - Actually, let me be a bit more specific about my question. I mean to first select MorphologicalComponents of a modified version of the image, specifically after running a filter on it. I then want to prune morphological components based on pixel values in the original unfiltered image. So I'd like to do something like this:               SelectComponents[{MorphologicalComponents[LaplacianFilter[img,3]], img}, "MeanIntensity", # < 0.4 &];
