Based on certain previous questions, I figured that if my `NotebookBrowseDirectory` looked like this               Options[$FrontEnd, NotebookBrowseDirectory]     {NotebookBrowseDirectory -> "/Users/brian/mma"}      then the OSX front end would default to saving new notebooks there. Instead it defaults to saving them in the home directory `/Users/brian`. Does there exist a variable I can set to make the UI default to saving into a different directory from my homedir?
