I have a list like this:               list = {0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1}      I want to color all the 0's in red, but I dont want to count through all the elements, like in my solutions, which seems awefully complicated:               Table[If[list[[x]] == 0, Style[list[[x]], Red], list[[x]]], {x, 1, Length@list}]      How else could I do this without using Table? In other words, a simpler way, if possible.
