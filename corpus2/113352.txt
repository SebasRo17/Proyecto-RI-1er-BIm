When you recommend updating jQuery/jQuery UI? Or in other words: **what are the best practices for updating jQuery/jQuery UI?** I’m working on a long project that will take at least one more year. In that time span, I’m sure that jQuery/jQuery UI will be updated many times. Do you recommend update my jQuery/jQuery UI files every time an update is released? Or is better to stick with a particular version until the end of the project? I’m afraid of “breaking” code changes, and every time an update is released, I have to test everything. That takes too much time. But on the other hand, if I didn’t update, I’m afraid of bugs that later will bite me in the rear. The project is an ASP.MVC and I use jQuery a lot. Any thoughts?
