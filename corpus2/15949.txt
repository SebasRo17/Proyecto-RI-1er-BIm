There are many software development methodologies - SCRUM, agile, XP, etc. - and they all have there advantages and disadvantages I suppose. But when do we really need to apply them? Surely they are not necessary for small 1-man projects, but for large 50+ teams you can most certainly not go about ad-hoc:ing the whole thing. So what's the line for when to use and when to not use such a methodology, if there indeed is one?
