I have a list from which I want to extract only the values beginning from where b (from {a,b}) is the closest to zero. For example: I want extract data={{2, -0.036704}, {56.7499, 0.95489}, {73.7349, 0.73489}, {2, -0.237504}} from the following list: list={{1, 0.67342}, {77.7499, -0.93489},{6.73448, 0.056704},{2, -0.036704}, {56.7499, 0.95489}, {73.7349, 0.73489}, {2, -0.237504}} Thanks in advance
