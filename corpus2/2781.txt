I am trying to import a group of PDFs that I have downloaded (it is in the realm of 1,000+). They are a group of doctoral dissertations that I'm trying to automatically extract bibliographic information from. They open perfectly in Preview and Adobe Acrobat Reader. Unfortunately, when I go to `Import[]` them, I receive the following errors like so:               Import["1997-01.pdf","Elements"]          Import::general: Expected cross reference table >>     Import::general: Expected cross reference table >>     Import::general: Could not find document trailer >>     General::stop: Further output of Import::general will be suppressed during this calculation. >>      I have never encountered this with `Elements` before, which is normally my first step in figuring out how to tackle a file. The same holds for `Plaintext`, etc. If I `Import["1997-01.pdf","Text"]` it generates a file akin to this:               %PDF-1.2     %BHIL-SC:0014503155,00391,00004,00008,00399,00790,00004,00004,00009,00400,00791,00004,00004,00010,00401,00792,00004 ... etc. etc.      The file itself is downloaded from an online repository, however, but is of high quality. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YZxnx.png) My end goal is to try `TextRecognize[]` on it, but I cannot even get to that stage. Does _Mathematica_ offer any workarounds for PDFs like this? FWIW, the PDF claims that I have full permissions to edit, alter, etc., but there is no built-in text layer. --- Edited to Clarify --- The PDF is version 1.2. It is an image layer, not a text layer. Hope that this helps!
