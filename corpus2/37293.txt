Some symbolic derivatives of certain special function are not expanded automatically, but `FunctionExpand` often helps to get a derivative-free closed form expression.               Derivative[1, 0][BesselJ][0, 1]     (* Derivative[1, 0][BesselJ][0, 1] *)          FunctionExpand[%]     (* 1/2 Ï€ BesselY[0, x] *)      But for some functions it takes too much time to evaluate. Possibly, there is even an infinite loop. For example, I left the following expression to evaluate overnight, and it was still running in the morning without any result or messages.               FunctionExpand[Derivative[1, 0][StruveL][0, 1]]      * * *   * Is there a workaround that could get an expanded form the expression `Derivative[1, 0][StruveL][0, 1]` in reasonable time?   * Is there an infinite-loop bug in the implementation of `FunctionExpand` or I just have to wait longer for the results (weeks, months, ...)?   * Are there any public information about what approaches are used by `FunctionExpand` to expand derivatives?
