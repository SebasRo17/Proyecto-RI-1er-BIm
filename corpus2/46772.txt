I have the following to set into mathematica. Assume a stress(sigma) applied on a specimen which has a number of fibers within it. All fibers that have a strength less than the applied stress should fail. I set a cumulative distribution of the fiber strengths with a mean and standard deviation. I want to use this cumulative distribution to tell me how many fibers are less than the applied stress which have failed and store this number somewhere. This procedure should be repeated until all fibers have failed. so there is a convergence in the two variables. I am new in mathematica so sorry for a vague question. thanks, Nick
