I have already studied bubblesort, insertion sort and selection sort and can implement them in C pretty much from knowledge of the algorithm. I want to go on to learn shellsort, merge sort, heapsort and quicksort, which I guess are a lot harder to understand. What order should I take these other sort algos? I am assuming a simpler sort algo helps learn a more complex one. Don't mind taking on some others if it helps the learning process.
