I am writing a report which requires the analysis of performance of each individual team member. This is for a software development project developed using the Unified Process (UP). I was just wondering if there are any existing group & individual appraisal metrics used so I don't have to reinvent the wheel... EDIT This is by no means correct but something like: Individual Contribution (IC) = time spent (individual) / time spent (total) => Performance = ? (should use individual contribution (IC) combined with something to gain a measure of overall performance).... Maybe I am talking complete hash and I know generally its really difficult to analyse performance with numbers but any mathematicians out there that can lend a hand or know a somewhat more accurate method of analysing performance than arbitrary marking (e.g. 8 out 10)
