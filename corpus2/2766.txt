I found the following code:               Compile[{{m, _Real, 2}}, Fourier[m]][Table[N[i - j], {i, 4}, {j, 4}]]      which doesn't work correctly. But the following was posted as a correction:               Compile[{{m, _Real, 2}}, Fourier[m],              {{_Fourier,_Complex,2}}][ Table[N[i-j],{i,4},{j,4}] ]      Firstly, why does Compile care about matching the size of the input and output? Secondly, could someone kindly explain to me why the above works?
