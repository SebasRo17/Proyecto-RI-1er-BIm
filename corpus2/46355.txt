I made this `Graphics3D` of the Sun with the plotted orbits of a few astronomical objects.               otherCelestials = AstronomicalData["MinorPlanet"][[;; 10]];     Graphics3D[{       {Yellow, Sphere[AstronomicalData["Sun", "Position"], 0.05]},       AstronomicalData[#, "OrbitPath"] & /@ otherCelestials       }, Axes -> True, SphericalRegion -> True]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6VPII.png) I would like it to rotate around the sphere representing the sun's position though. At the moment the `ViewCenter` is somewhere next to the sun, which means that when you rotate the plot, it rotates around that point and not the sun. How can I make it so that it rotates around the sun? (The obvious thing to do would be set the `ViewCenter` of the plot to the coordinates of the sun, but in this case the sun's coordinates are given as `{0, 0, 0}`, but that just makes the `ViewCenter` point to the corner of the graph.)
