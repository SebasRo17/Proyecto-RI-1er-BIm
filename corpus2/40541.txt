My boss recently went back to our international office in his home country to interview some potential new employees, and we have decided to hire a few as programmers. They are fresh out of college and have very limited experience (similar to me when I first started working here). I am told they are able to read English, however I looked at the code they wrote as a part of the application process and all their variable names, method names, comments, etc are in Spanish. I am having doubts that they have any ability to _write_ English. I hear they are learners though, so maybe they can learn over time as we give them small training projects. I will be working with them closely, helping them learn good design principles and other things, and I will eventually get to the point where I am producing code with them. Has anyone dealt with this sort of situation and had it end well? What kind of pitfalls should I look out for? What kinds of tools do you know of that can assist in international collaboration and training?
