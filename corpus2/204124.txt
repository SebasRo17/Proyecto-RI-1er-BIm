I am a Product Manager, under me I have about 10 developers, UX designers and marketers. Marketers research about the demands of features, UX designers providing UI mockups, and develkopers write code. Now, we want to do our feature development monthly meeting (sprint) in a more structured manner ( previously, feature priority is decided in a somewhat adhoc manner, we want to change this). The goals of the meeting are   1. To set the priority ( urgent, important, normal, not important) of each feature   2. To make sure that everyone knows what to do for this coming milestone after the meeting is over. But given that we have 10 people on the team and usually, we have more than 50 features to discussed, I afraid that the whole meeting will drag on for a long time. Also, for the second step, I would need to allow time for everyone to check their schedule, as not everyone is fully available to work on the features ( some would need to fix bugs, provide technical supports etc), so if I ask them to do this in the meeting, then there will be some lull time and disrupt the flow of the meeting. Is there any well-established meeting procedure that is fitting to my situation above?
