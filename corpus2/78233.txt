I'm a self taught C# programmer and up to now I haven't really been making use of Debug and Trace and feel as though I should use them. I've been leaning more on TDD to understand and get feedback from my code. The .Net Framework Developers Guide declines to specify general guidelines for strategic placement of trace statements _"because applications that use tracinig vary widely..."_ ; What are your experiences of using Debug/Trace? Does using them too much create code maintenance issues? How much output is too much? How much is too little? What sorts of things do you tend to record?
