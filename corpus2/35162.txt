I have an algebraic output (a solution to a de) similar to, but far longer than: {y->(x+3)^2/sin(7*(x+3))+(x+3)^3/7} I'd like to get Mathematica to notice that the group x+3 appears repeatedly, define a new parameter par1=x+3, and rewrite the original output as: {par1=x+3, par1^2/sin(7*par1)+par1^3/7} The new expression would be far simpler and faster to evaluate than the original if par1 is, say 40 characters long, and appears say 6 times in the original expression. Ideas on how to accomplish this? Eric
