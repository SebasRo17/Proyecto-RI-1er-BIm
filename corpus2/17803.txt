To create a percentage axe in some plot I use this `Ticks` configuration:               ListPlot[          Range[0,1,0.1]         ,Ticks->{Automatic, {#,If[IntegerPart@Mod[100#,10]==0,Row[{100#,"%"}],""]}&/@Range[0,1,0.05]}     ]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HieCK.png) That has 3 disadvantage:   1. Non automatic range scale   2. No subticks with different sizes   3. It's nor elegant nor simple I miss a Mathematica `TicksFunction` or equivalent, so I could have better control over it. I also tried something like: `ListPlot[Quantity[Range[0, 1, 0.1], "Percent"]]` without succes. Some clue into a better approach?
