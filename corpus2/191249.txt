My question is about changing industries as a developer, after having spent half a decade in one. Let's say I'm a full-stack web and mobile app developer, I use a good variety of languages and paradigms out there and have been around the block for a few years, both at a very large corp and as a startup founder in a mostly technical role. Hypothetically, let's say I'd like to see if I can make as a AAA game developer, perhaps start out as a gameplay programmer and go from there. I interned at a large game company before, but ended turning down their offer at the time as I didn't see the project going very far (it didn't). I could probably easily get a role in server-side development, but that would be close-ish to what I'm already doing. I know that because of my breadth of experience I won't have a particularly hard time ramping up fast in whatever technologies and paradigms the game will be using and will do great on the long run, but I'm not sure what the short term will look like. What kind of setback can I expect? Will I have to re-climb the totem pole from the ground up? Is there anything I can do to hit the ground running? Also, what has your experience been with changing industries (doesn't have to be the same industries as the ones I mentioned)? Did you end up regretting not being able to carry over your domain knowledge?
