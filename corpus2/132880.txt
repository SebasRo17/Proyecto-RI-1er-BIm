I'm at a pivotal point in my small software company where I have reached the critical mass of too much work and need to hire someone. Simple question: Do I hire someone who is simply qualified and can do the work and possibly grow with the company, or do I hire someone overqualified for the immediate work I have to offer but who can significantly deepen the knowledge and experience pool of my company?
