I have the following problem. Consider expression               f=Sqrt[(x-2y)^2]      There is an obvious ambiguity in the definition of `f` related to multivaluedness of the square root. Two possible interpretations for `f` are $x-2y$ or $2y-x$. My needs require to work with power series expansions of expressions like `f`. When asked to perform a series expansion _Mathematica_ automatically chooses a branch               In[106]:= Series[f, {x, 0, 1}, {y, 0, 1}] // Normal          Out[106]= -x + 2 y      I'm OK with that since I can adjust the sign of the square root manually and use `-f` instead of `f` if needed. The problem is that _Mathematica_ is not consistent in her choice. For example, evaluate               In[107]:= Series[f, {y, 0, 1}, {x, 0, 1}] // Normal          Out[107]= x - 2 y       now it's the other branch! In a real task I have a quite complicated function depending on many parameters under the square root. When I work with its series expansions naively, as described above, things just go wrong. How can the problem be handled? Any help is appreciated!
