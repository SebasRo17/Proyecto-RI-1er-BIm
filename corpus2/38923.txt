I need to have $\pi$ with an accuracy of $10$ digits. My first guess would be               N[Pi, 10]       However, this rounds to the last digit instead of just chopping of any additional digits and hence the last digit is $4$ (and not $3$, as it actually is). I could do               N[FromDigits[RealDigits[Pi, 10, 10]], 10]      but I am pretty sure that there are nicer solutions.
