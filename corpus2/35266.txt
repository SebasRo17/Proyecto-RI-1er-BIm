**Edit:** This bug is fixed in _Mathematica_ 10.0.0 I want to calculate eigenvectors of a Hermitian matrix. For example               $HistoryLength = 0;     n = 3000;     mat = # + ConjugateTranspose[#] &@RandomComplex[{0, 1 + I}, {n, n}];     evec = Eigenvectors[mat];      However, `evec` is unpacked!               evec // Developer`PackedArrayQ      > False System monitor shows ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1GrDX.png) It seems that the result was unpacked in the end of evaluation. I think the problem is that the last element of each eigenvector is real instead of complex               evec[[All, -1]]      > >     -0.100012, -0.059244, -0.0723702, ... >                 evec[[All, -2]]      > >     -0.0994738 - 0.00136552 I, -0.0527357 - 0.0532419 I, 0.158174 + > 0.0341157 I, ... >   With real matrices everything is fine               n = 5000;     mat = # + Transpose[#] &@RandomReal[1, {n, n}];     evec = Eigenvectors[mat];     evec // Developer`PackedArrayQ      > True ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/R9cEy.png) My current workaround consist in packing the result immediately after `Eigenvectors`               evec = Developer`ToPackedArray[0.0 I + Eigenvectors[mat]];      Now `evec` is packed but there is a very big peak in the memory usage ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/lNBEQ.png) It is not a problem for a small matrices, but if matrix `mat` is ~30GB then I need ~300GB memory. It is quite a lot even for the swap space! It seems that this is a very simple question, but I could not find anything. P.S. I use _Mathematica_ 9.0.1 and Linux. _Mathematica_ 8 has the same problem. **Update** halirutan's answer solves this problem completely! Now memory profile is much better ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/NJ9DS.png) Some notes: You need 11 version of MKL. In Gentoo it is available in science overlay. I compile the library with the command               gcc -shared -fPIC -o PackedEigenvectors.so -I /usr/local/Wolfram/Mathematica/9.0/SystemFiles/IncludeFiles/C/ -I /opt/intel/composerxe-2013.0.080/mkl/include/ PackedEigenvectors.c      Helpful links: 1, 2
