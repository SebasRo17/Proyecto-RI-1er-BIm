Does anyone know (or, I guess, I have gut feeling about) how the download size of a software product affects potential users, bandwidth not withstanding? For example: Does a bigger download make them believe that is it more full- featured than it is (like huge .NET Runtimes if deployed with your package)? Reason is, I'm developing a VSTO add-in where there is my add-in (small MB), the VSTO run-time, .NET runtime, and Primary Interops. This could make it more than 70 MB in total size, just for an add-in that does a couple of things well. _But that's all they are - just a couple of things._ With VSTO deployments, I know I could deploy a smaller package size by assuming they've got the .NET runtime (and when they don't, initialize the download/install of that, but it seems like a clunky way to make just an ass out of me). What I really want is for people to just download the app (the trial version) to see if they like it. Is there some kind of magic happy threshold - like users of non-big name apps are more likely to download something that is under 20 MB than 50 MB?
