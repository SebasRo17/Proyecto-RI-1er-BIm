My colleague recently pointed me to Ohloh, a website providing statistics on FOSS based on versioning repositories. It's quite a fun procrastination tool, e.g. to compare programming languages by active projects: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ekEZT.png) Which makes me wonder: how representative is such a comparison? Can we draw conclusions from this such as "Javascript is the most used programming language in FOSS, followed closely by Python, Java and C++"? Or are there some big caveats to take into account?
