I have a server which is returning very big JSON message and my client application is only dependent on part of this response. Client application needs to check if "xyz" property exist in JSON message and depending on the result run a specific usecase. For this requirement converting the whole JSON message to object sounds bit expensive to me and hence this question. Is there a standard JSON query language like one we have for XML? If yes what are best know implementation of this query language in java. FYI : Changing or adding new service on server side is not an option.
