Questions here talk about most important programming skills someone is supposed to possess, and, a lot of great answers spring up. The answers and the questioners seem mostly interested on qualities related to getting a better job, nailing some interview, things desired by boss or management, or improving your programming abilities. One thing that often gets blown over is the genuine consideration for what traits peers want. They don't much value things like you're one of those 'gets things done' people for the company, or you never miss a deadline, or your code is least painful to review and debug, or you're team player with fantastic leading abilities. They probably care more if you're helpful, are a refreshing person to talk to, you're fun to program in pair with, everybody wants you to review their code, or something of that nature. I, for one, would care that I come off to my peers as a pleasurable programmer to work with, as much as I care about my impression on my boss or management. Is this really significant, and if yes, **_what are the most desirable traits peers want from each other_**.
