For websites that need to be highly scalable, such as social networks like facebook, what's the best way to design the website?   1. Should I have a web service which the site queries to get data that it needs? or   2. Should the site query databases directly? (can be done using built in language constructs to fill tables automatically etc). I would think the web service is the better design since it gives centralized data access and things like caching and the like become much easier to control, but what do others think?
