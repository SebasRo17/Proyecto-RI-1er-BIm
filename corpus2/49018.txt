I'm approaching the end of Sophomore year in college (Studying Computer Science), and very soon I'm going to have to decide on my concentration, but I honestly don't know what each concentration means. I basically have two questions:   1\. How much influence does your concentration have on your career path? For example, would a video game development company only look at people with a concentration in Game Development? 2.It would be great if you guys could, in a line or two, tell me what sort of jobs am I looking at for each of the concentrations? I need to pick at least two of the 9 below. \- Algorithms and Data Structures   \- Artificial Intelligence   \- Computer and Network Security   \- Computer graphics and vision   \- Human-Computer Interaction   \- Game Development and Design   \- Numeric and Symbolic Computation   \- Programming languages   \- Systems
