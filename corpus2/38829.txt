What is the easiest way get new symbols into _Mathematica 9_? For example I want to be able to write the Symbol               \mathfrak{A}      that you have in _Latex_. I know that you can simply write an "A" in the notebook and change the font, so you get the right symbol. But this way you have to change between the font- window and the notebook window, and find the right font for your purpose. Favourably I would like to set a new pallet or integrate the symbol in the aliases or set a shortcut like `Cmd`+`Shift`+`A` for the symbol above I already tried to change the fonts of _Mathematica_ generally, so that the Symbol produces by "`Esc` `A` `Esc`" changes to `\mathfrak{A}` in _Latex_ , but did not get any satisfying result.
