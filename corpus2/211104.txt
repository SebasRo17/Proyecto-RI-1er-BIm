I am building a software and trying to learn the typical steps for software life cycle, I am not sure if what I did is correct or enough so I would like to ask for the typical steps you follow during your life cycle in terms of actual steps taken for example requirement gathering is a not the step i mean, but gathering requirements using User Stories from the customer or from the requirements documents is the step I mean. This is what I do now,   1. Write User Stories from the requirement document I had.    2. Write Use Cases for these stories.    3. Collected nouns from the requirement documents and used them as classes to build class diagram.    4. Draw state diagrams for main entities in the class diagram.    5. Draw database diagram to map the class diagram to database tables    6. Started coding to 3-tier architecture.  Please tell me if I am doing it right or missing something.
