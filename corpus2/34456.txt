I searched and couldn't find any _business_ reasons why git/mercurial/bazzr systems are better than centralized systems (subversion, perforce). If you were trying to sell a DVCS to a non-technical person what arguments would you provide for the DVCS **increasing profit**. I will shortly be pitching git to my manager, it will take some time converting out subversion repositories and some expense in buying smartgit licences. **Edit** I tried to make this question into a generic discussion on centralized vs decentralized, but inevitably it has turned into git vs subversion. Surely there are better centralized systems than subversion.
