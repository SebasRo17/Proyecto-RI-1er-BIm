I’ve been looking at various asynchronous resource-loaders and I’m not sure which one to use yet. Where I work we have disparate group-efforts whose class-modules may use different versions of jQuery (etc). As such, nested dependencies may differ, as well. I have no control over this, so this means I need to dynamically load resources which may use alternate versions of the same library. **As such, here are my requirements:**     1. Load JavaScript and CSS resource files asynchronously.   2. Manage dependency-order and nested-dependencies across versions.   3. Detect if a resource is already loaded.   4. Must allow for cross-domain loading (CDN's)   5. (optional) Allow us to unload a resource. **I’ve been looking at:**     * Curl   * RequireJS   * JavaScriptMVC   * LABjs I might be able to fake these requirements myself by loading versions into properly-namespaced variables & using an array to track what is already loaded...but (hopefully) someone has already invented this. **So my questions are:**     * Which ones do you use? And why?   * Are there others that my satisfy my requirements fully?   * Which do you find most eloquent and easiest to work with? And why? **UPDATE:**   For those interested, I tried all the AMD libraries above (and more). In the end, I went with RequireJS. It's just cleaner and easier overall...and I'm glad to be using it.
