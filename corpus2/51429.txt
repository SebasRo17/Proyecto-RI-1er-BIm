I'm looking for a way to export 3D graphics objects to the Collada (`.dae`) format. I need an automated way, i.e. using Blender to manually convert from another format is not a good solution. I'm sure all of the following is not possible at the same time, but ideally:   * Aspect ratio (`BoxRatios`) should be preserved   * Colours should be preserved (if possible)   * Visible bounding box should be preserved (if possible)   * Initial view point should be preserved when opening the file in a viewer (if possible)   * Supporting `Polygon` and `Cuboid` is sufficient. * * * Information that would help me implement this myself:   * Which formats that Mathematica supports can theoretically handle most of the requirements above? Out of these, which one does Mathematica have the best support for?   * Are there command line programs or other Mathematica-controllable tools that can convert a Mathematica-exportable format to Collada?
