Is there a name for including a limitation in a loop structure to prevent it from running if its primary condition becomes unwieldy. For example               for (var i = 0; i < len; i++){             some_function();          }      but if len is somewhere set to ten million, I don't want to run it, so I would do something like:               for (var i = 0; i < len && i < 50; i++){             some_function();          }      Is there a name for this type of hard-coded condition?
