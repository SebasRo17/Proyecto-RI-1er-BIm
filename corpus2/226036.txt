In our company we do usability test at the end of each Sprint. Many times we discover that the users don't like the implemented feature, so we either completely change it or scrap it in the next Sprint. However if we start doing potentially shippable product, thus fixing all bugs, running a lot of tests, preparing documentation for FDA and for users, fixing little UI issues - all this work will go to waste if users will not like the feature. Isn't it better NOT to do all this extra potentially shippable stuff until we are sure users actually like the feature?
