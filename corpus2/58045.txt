Suppose we have the following simple RegionPlot:               f[x_] := 1 - x^2     g[x_] := 1 - 0.5 x^2     RegionPlot[{y < f[x], f[x] < y < g[x], y > g[x]}, {x, 0, 2}, {y, 0, 2}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZPGQG.jpg) Now I'm trying to change the curve defined by $y=g[x]$ into a thick black curve, while leaving all other boundaries in the plot unchanged. I've tried adding the region $y=g[x]$ and playing with the plotstyle, which didn't work, and I've tried BoundaryStyle, which changed _all_ the boundaries in the plot. Now I'm kinda out of ideas... Any help would be appreciated!
