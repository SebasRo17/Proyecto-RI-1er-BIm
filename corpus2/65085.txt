> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Is a university education really worth it for a good programmer? I'm currently looking for a job as a web developer, and I have ~3 years experience in the field and know PHP and Ruby on Rails fairly well, and HTML/CSS like the back of my hand. I'm also well-versed in jQuery. I'm self- taught in all of these disciplines and I am a voracious learner. I've found several jobs which I think might be good fits, but they all list a BS in Computer Science as a prerequisite to applying, which I don't have. I have a BA in English with an emphasis on Creative Writing. I consider this an asset--not a hindrance--but I'm worried that I won't even be considered since I don't have a BS in CS. How important is a BS in CS when applying for a job for which that is the only prerequisite I don't satisfy? How can I sell myself to these positions not having a BS?
