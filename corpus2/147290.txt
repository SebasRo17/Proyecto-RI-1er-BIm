I've been reading some papers recently on domain specific languages (DSL), but none of them appear to address the advantages of a DSL over a rich internet application (RIA). In an RIA, instead of learning the domain language, the user is provided with domain objects as form fields, which abstracts the lexical definitions for the domain language. This seems more usable. What I am missing?
