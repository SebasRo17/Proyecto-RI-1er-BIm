I am using a Mathematica script to programmatically generate a Mathematica notebook. The script generates a `Notebook` expression and then uses `Export` to write the notebook to a file. The following interactive kernel session sketches the necessary commands:               $ /Applications/Mathematica.app/Contents/MacOS/MathKernel     Mathematica 9.0 for Mac OS X x86 (64-bit)     Copyright 1988-2012 Wolfram Research, Inc.          In[1]:= notebook = Notebook[ { Cell["Hello World", "Text"] } ];                                                                                                                  In[2]:= Export["HelloWorld.nb", notebook]                                                                                                                                        Out[2]= HelloWorld.nb      The problem is that the `Export` command always launches the Mathematica front-end as a side effect. Is there a way to write the `Notebook` expression to a file without having the kernel launch the front-end?
