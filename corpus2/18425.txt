_Mathematica_ expansion of expressions with symbols isn't slow, but with square roots it is very slow. In Maple or Mupad both are fast: with square roots they both take less than a second. Here is an example.               Expand[(a + b + c + d + e)^100]; // Timing          Expand[(Sqrt[2] + Sqrt[3] + Sqrt[5] + Sqrt[6] + Sqrt[7])^100]; // Timing      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CGLAE.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8fRmw.png) Can you reproduce this? I used Mathematica9.0.0.0 and Maple16 on windows7 64 bit. **Updated** Maple and Mupad also give the exact result, please see following picture. It's equal to Mathematica' result. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TxHrL.png)
