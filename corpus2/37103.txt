The documentation for PDF has an example for plotting a confidence interval of a standard normal distribution:               pdf = PDF[NormalDistribution[], x]     Show[Plot[pdf, {x, -1.7, -1}, Filling -> Axis, FillingStyle -> Green],       Plot[pdf, {x, -1, 1}] ,       Plot[pdf, {x, 1, 1.7}, Filling -> Axis, FillingStyle -> Green],       PlotRange -> {0, 0.4}, AxesOrigin -> {0, 0.1},       Ticks -> {Automatic, None}]      The plot range is set such that this code would not work in a generalized case for `NormalDistribution[u,s]`. **What is the appropriate format for {x, xmin, xmax} in the`Plot` function above for the general case of a normal distribution with mean = u and standard deviation = s?**
