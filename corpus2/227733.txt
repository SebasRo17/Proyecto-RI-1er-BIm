I'm having trouble understanding a past quiz question I got: Bobby works at Starbucks in San Mateo (V). He is doing quality assurance testing and needs to visit stores in Palo Alto (B), Tenderloin (C), and San Jose (S) - and then return to San Mateo for a meeting. The distances between the stores are: V→B = 2   V→C = 3   V→S = 6   B→C = 1   B→S = 5   C→S = 4 Which is the first store he visits in the optimal solution to this problem? How would you approach solving this problem? It reminds me a bit of Djistra's algorithm but I suspect there's an easier way other than trying every combination as the time limit is short. My interpretation:                 B__1__C       |     |     2 |     | 4       |__6__|       V     S      For Bobby to visit all 4 stores and return to V, he simply starts at V and travels the edges of the above box. But the question is asking which is the first store? Either direction will give a total of 13, so how is there a right answer?
