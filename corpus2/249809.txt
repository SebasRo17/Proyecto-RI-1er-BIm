When working on multiple similar projects there are often changes that can't be extracted into a library, but should be applied to most of the projects. I mean changes like a modified directory structure, some common configuration, similar ui code, etc. The most basic strategy is to copy a new project from the last finished one and throw out the business logic. The problem is that the improvements to the newest project won't move back to the older ones. A slightly better strategy is to set up a boilerplate repository, clone every new project from it. Then the reusable bits can be extracted form the newest project into the boilerplate and then pulled to the older projects. Of course, merging might be complicated, but I've had this strategy work quite well for me. Pushing the changes is still too much work though. Is there a strategy to automate propagation of _some_ changes across multiple projects?
