I have a list(kicks), and a function(fix). I am aware of the problem using Loop and Append or AppendTo. My question is why does the Flatten produce the desired output. List:               kicks = {6.28992, 1.78953, 4.67832, 3.85717, 4.15561, 7.9862, 8.02365,              2.62077, 5.89348, 6.50246}      Function:                fix[list_] := Module[{xos, comp, ct},         comp = {};         xos = If[list > 7, AppendTo[comp, list]];         ct = Flatten[comp]]          fix[#] & /@ kicks               Output: {{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {7.9862}, {8.02365}, {}, {}, {}}      Desired output:               {7.9862, 8.02365}      I want to understand why Flatten in this case does not work, and how to solve it while using Module.
