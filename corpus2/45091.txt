I noticed a strange thing when trying the new astronomical data functions in Mathematica 10 on my Raspberry Pi. The `Sunrise` and `Sunset` functions return incorrect times. Then I started to play with time and date functions and I've discovered that `Date` and `DateList` return different results. As a reference, the output of both functions on my main computer:               Column[{Date[], DateList[],$TimeZone}]      > >     {2014,3,31,20,54,59.141095} >     {2014,3,31,20,54,59.141123} >     2. >   But on the Raspberry Pi: > >     {2014,3,31,20,54,49.685639} >     {2014,3,31,19,54,49.778047} >     1. >   Looks like the `$TimeZone` is off, but `Date` ignores it. Let's look at the documentation of the two functions: > Date[] uses whatever date and time have been set on your computer system. It > performs no corrections for time zones, daylight saving time, etc. vs > DateList[] uses whatever date and time have been set on your computer > system. It performs no corrections for time zones, daylight saving time, > etc. So they should return exactly the same output. There's a warning that "Date has been superseded by DateList since Version 6.0" but in this case it actually works better. Why doesn't Mathematica detect the correct time zone and why does `Date` work, but `DateList` doesn't?
