I'm starting to use Wolfram Workbench 2 to develop a Mathematica package. For the first time I tried "Documentation - Build" under the "Application Tools" but got fatal errors: BUILD FAILED /Users/[...]/docbuild.xml:132: The following error occurred while executing this line: /Users/[...]/docbuild.xml:90: taskdef A class needed by class com.wolfram.jlink.util.MathematicaTask cannot be found: org/apache/tools/ant/Task This is with Mathematica 9.0.0.0 on a Mac with OS 10.9. Any idea on what's wrong here?
