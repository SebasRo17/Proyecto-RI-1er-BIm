I am not sure if this is the place to ask the following conceptual question (Stackoverflow is definitely not). I saw this question in a multiple choice exam (single answer), similar to the ISTQB exams: > _Why it is not recommended to report several defects in the same issue / > ticket ?_ > > a. In order to keep the report concise and clear. > > b. Because the developers might fix only one bug. > > c. Because the testing group testers are rated by the amount of bugs they > find. > > d. Bugs management systems does not support this feature of multiple bugs. My sole opinion is that `a` is the correct answer. `b` \- can't be it as the _fix-feedback-resolved-closed_ should avoid that case. `c` \- Obviously wrong. `d` \- Redmine / Trac plugins supports multiple fields. The answer according to the answer sheet is `b`. Can someone explain why ? Comments with opinion about answers are welcome.
