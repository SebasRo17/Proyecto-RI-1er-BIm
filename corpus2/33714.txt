I've a construct that reads               ParallelTable[      MyFunction[i],      {i, 16}     ]      Now, MyFunction[i] takes an amount of time to be evaluated which is a decreasing function of i. When I evaluate with multiple kernels however, mathematica assigns close values of i to the same kernels. In this example it has assigned i=1,2 to kernel 8 and i=3,4 to kernel 7, and this is of course not optimized at all. Out of 8 cores I get a speedup of only 2.49 which is quite unsatisfactory, due to the fact that a huge part of the work was made by 2 kernels leaving the other 6 with a relatively low load. ![Parallel Kernel Status screenshot at the end of the evaluation](http://i.stack.imgur.com/W99Vv.png) Is there a way to explicitly assign values of i to the kernels?
