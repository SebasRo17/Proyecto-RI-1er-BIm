I've worked with Adobe Flash-related technologies for the past 5 years. I've seen small bugs in some apps, but I don't understand why many big companies don't consider Adobe Air for their mobile apps. I've seen many mobile developer job postings that require Android or iOS expertise, but not too many that require Adobe Air expertise. This puzzles me because you can deploy Adobe Air apps to Blackberry, iOS **and** Android. Also, in my opinion, it's much easier to develop a game with Flash, than it is with the Android SDK, for example. Does Adobe Air really have weaknesses that I've never seen?
