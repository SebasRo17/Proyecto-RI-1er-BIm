My follow-up question is whether it is a good idea to place all the database tables from each module into the same database, or whether they should be separated into entirely separate databases? I am using PostgreSQL. My worries are:   1. Problems with running data analysis if data is in many different databases   2. Problems pinning down database performance issues if we use the same database for all modules   3. In ability to join tables across modules if we some time in the future discover that our modularization is flawed for creating a certain feature
