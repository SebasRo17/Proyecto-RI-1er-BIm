I have a number of distinct Java utilities that are shipped together. Currently there are two startup scripts for each utility: a `.sh` one for Linux and a `.bat` for Windows. I'm thinking of rewriting the startup scripts using Python, or perhaps Ruby, Perl, Lua or other scripting language. This way I avoid having different versions for each OS. Is this a good idea? Are there projects that already use this approach? What scripting language would be best suited for the task? What other alternatives exist to avoid having separate `.sh`, `.bat` files for this group of utilities?
