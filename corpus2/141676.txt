As much as I love to code, as little do I know about the history of programming. I know some names (Turing, Ritchie, Linus) - but that's it. I know roughly what they did and I'm a bit ashamed. This, and because I want to know more, I'm asking for recommendable reads (be it books, e-books, articles, w/e) on this topic.
