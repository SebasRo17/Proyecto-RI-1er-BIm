This seems ridiculously basic, but I cannot find anywhere explaining how to do it. If you evaluate certain undefined functions like `1/0` or `Tan[\[Pi]/2]`, Mathematica evaluates to `ComplexInfinity`. For some reason, however, the following expression does not act as expected:               1/0 == ComplexInfinity      This results in > ComplexInfinity == ComplexInfinity rather than the expected > True So the question is, how do you test whether a function evaluates to `ComplexInfinity`, or better yet, how do you test if a function is (mathematically, not programmatically) undefined?
