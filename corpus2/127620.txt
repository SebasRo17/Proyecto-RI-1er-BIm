I've seen a number of question asking whether someone should learn procedural or OO first. But is this even possible? Can you learn OO programming without first having an understanding of procedural programming? Obviously, they can learn to program in an OO language like Java or Python first. But you can write Fortran in any language. My impression is that such beginning programmers write procedural code in an OO language at least at first. But what do you think?
