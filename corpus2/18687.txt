What kind of argument is expected by `MinimumSpanningTree` (from the package `Combinatorica``)? Is it possible that I am providing the right kind of argument, but that conflict between usual definitions and definitions from the package `Combinatorica`` prevents correct evaluation? Note that, conform the documentation page of `FindShortestPath`,               graph = System`PetersenGraph[4, 1, EdgeWeight -> {4, 0, 3, 1, 3, 2, 7, 8, 5, 2, 1, 6}]      Produces some weighted graph. We can then do               FindShortestPath[graph, 1, 3]      which works as expected. Note that if we use `Combinatorica`PetersenGraph` this will not work. Anyway, I would expect `MinimumSpanningTree` to work on at least one of the two graphs generated this way. Unfortunately, I cannot get it it to work. I have been unable to get `MimimumSpanningTree` to work on any graph so far. Remarks The documentation center provides very little information on `MimimumSpanningTree`. The `PetersenGraph` may not be a very nice example, as _Mathematica_ seems to point out an error in the syntax even before the package `Combinatorica`` is loaded. However, upon asking the `FullForm` of the result, everything seems to be as we expect it to be. **Edit** : Can I assume there is no efficient way to let `MinimumSpanningTree` calculate a minimum spanning tree between many points in $\mathbb{R}^2$? I suppose that for this, one should refer to How to speed up Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm?. As a test I entered a huge graph in `MinimumSpanningTree`, but an algorithm by Daniel Lichtblau was faster.
