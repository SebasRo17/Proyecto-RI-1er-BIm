Expressive Power is defined by Wikipedia as: > .. the breadth of ideas that can be represented and communicated in that > language. Does "ideas" refer to the things (operations, structures, algorithms, etc.?) we can communicate _to the machine_? Or does it refer to the "human" concepts that can be captured and communicated with the language to other humans? How is expressive power assessed and measured? For instance, if we took a language like JavaScript and imposed a weird restriction on variable names, such as _variable must be an 8-digit number preceded by an underscore, matching`/^_[0-9]{8}$/`_, would we lose expressive power? Or would that _only_ be absurd and annoying? * * * **To clarify:** Is expressive power measured by the _general_ ideas inherent to the language:   * integers and strings   * loops   * conditionals Or the number of _specific_ , unique ideas that the language can represent:   * the integers 1, 2 ... 2^32   * strings containing "what does the fox say?" and "wha pah pah pah pah pah pow"   * for each _frog_ in _my collection of frogs_   * if _frog_ is _green or something_ then _do something_
