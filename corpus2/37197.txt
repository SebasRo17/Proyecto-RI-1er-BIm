the `Complement` gives result in standard order. But that's not what I want. I want it to keep the original order. say I have a list               list = {8, 3, 6, 4, 2, 5, 7};      and               compli = Complement[list, {3, 6, 2}]      gives               {4, 5, 7, 8}      But I want               {8, 4, 5, 7}      I write the following code to bring it back to the original order               Reap[If[MemberQ[compli, #], Sow[#]] & /@ list][[2, 1]]      I don't know whether it is good or not. Maybe there is more elegant way to do this. Finally, I must say I just don't understand why `Complement` is designed to give standard order. If I want standard order, I can simply use `Sort`. And now things got more complicated than it should be.
