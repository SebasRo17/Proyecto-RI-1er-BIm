Lately, we had a nice question about artistic image vectorization which got very nice answers. As Szabolcs pointed out himself > Since "true" vectorization performed by various specialized software is a > tough problem, I suggest to consider "artistic" approaches, which produce > inexact, but beautiful version of the original. And this is true: Sophisticated bitmap tracers like the implementation in Inkscape let you adjust how many color-levels, how detailed or how smooth the vectorized image should be. Following example was created from a Mathematica image with Inkscape: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/a9GPY.png) **Still, I wonder whether it is possible to implement a vectorizer which comes very close to the behavior of the above without re-implementing the algorithm but with the help of the many tools we have in Mathematica?**
