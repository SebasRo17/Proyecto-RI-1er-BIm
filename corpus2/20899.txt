I am fairly new to _Mathematica_. I am working my way through a number of books. I have been looking at the use of `SetDelayed` and want to confirm that my understanding is correct. I define a function as follows.               f[x_]:= f[x] = x;      When I evaluate `?f`, I can see a rule for this function. Now each time I evaluate `f`, I see another rule is created for `f`. So by declaring the function as above, I ensure that for any given value of `x` the function will only be evaluated once. Suppose I had declared functions `f` and `g` as follows.               f[x_] := f[x] = Sin[x] + Cos[x];     g[x_] := Sin[x] + Cos[x];      Am I correct in saying that, for any given `x`, `f` will only be evaluated once? That is, for a given value of `x`, `Sin[x]` and `Cos[x]` will only be called once; whereas in the case of `g`, each time `g` is called, _Mathematica_ will evaluate both `Sin[x]` and `Cos[x]`? Will using `Trace` confirm this?
