I am a programmer hobbyist (self learnt), and once in a while I like to make games and interactive scripts (nowadays mostly in JavaScript for its ease). Sometimes I start long projects that end up being forgotten because of other things I have to do. Sometimes a project gets really big (say, 3000 lines is a huge deal to me). My code is mostly uncommented, unorganized, and unoptimised and some of my projects are never finished. **Question:**   * What do programmers (or teams), do with such projects ?   * Is there a recommended practice regarding this issue in the "real world"?
