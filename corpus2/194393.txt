I have a PHP MVC application and a file table. I need to implement the functionality: mark all as read. The best solution for the code I found so far was to put the actual implementation in a Model/Service/FileService.php The problem is the class FileService will get bloated really fast with different functionality. What would be a good solution to avoid bloated Services. Should I created different Services for each action?
