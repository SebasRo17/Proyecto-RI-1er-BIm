I am finding it difficult to get together in a single place the different types of relationships used for different things and would like to find out which I have correct and incorrect and the proper "technical" terms for the different types of relationships. An example:               In database we have:     One to One     One to Many     Many to Many      I beleive (although I may be wrong hense the question) that these types of relationships are collectively termed "Multiplicity" relationships. Is this correct, and if so, are there other names for it.               In programming we have:     Ihneritance     Encapulslation     Polymorphism      I beleive (and may be very wrong here) that these are different types of "Compound" relationships. If they are all the same type of compound relationship then is there other names for it. If they are different, how are they named. I would also like to know if there are other relationship types in general database / programming world that would be used to some degree without going into obscurity like some sort of unused sci-fi "molocular mumbo jumbo bumbo" relationship. Just keeping to what would be generally useful in the real world. I think I have a good understanding of the different relationship types, its more the terms used to describe them, and comming up with a brief 2 or 3 line description that really sums it up (assuming someone has allready got a fair understaiding). Knowing the technical terms properly and clearly will help me should I need to advise others on what to look for elsewhere. Can anyone offer suggestions on this for me without getting overly technical. Thanks in advance.
