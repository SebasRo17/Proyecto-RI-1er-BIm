I've googled 2 days straight and I can't find how to do this. I have an open stream between client and server, and client will send a JSON string (encrypted to bytes) to the server each 3 to 5 seconds. How can I write to the `Socket` `OutputStream` so that I can read each JSON string in the server. I'm guessing I need to specify some kind of end of file or something, but can't find any info on how to achieve this.
