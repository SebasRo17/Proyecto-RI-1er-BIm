I have been seeing opportunities go past me for just 1 reason: not having professional industry experience. I say to many employers that I'm capable of doing the job and show them the work I've done during the academics and also several personal projects which I took extra time and effort to teach myself the new industry standard technologies. But still, all they want is some 2-3 years experience in an industry. I'm a recent graduate with a Master's Degree in Computer science. I've been applying for quite a few jobs and most of these jobs require 2 years minimum experience. So, I thought somebody here might give me some realistic ideas about getting some experience which can be considered professional. Any kind of constructive comments are welcome.
