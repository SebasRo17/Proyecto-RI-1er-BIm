We have our daily stand-up meeting at **8:45** while the workday starts at **8:30**. Even with the 15 minutes slack people keep coming too late, on a regular basis. This results in our meetings being small, incomplete, inefficient and sometimes even completely useless. We have tried to have people bring fruit for the team on the next day, but this didn't work as we'd be having multiple breakfasts every day (and after a while they didn't even bother to bring any anymore). We have been thinking of imposing a fine, but we find solutions like that quite childish. How do you handle regular latecomers at stand up meetings? What worked - and what didn't?
