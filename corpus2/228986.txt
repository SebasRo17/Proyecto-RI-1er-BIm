Me and some of my friends would want to start a side project which we will work at our spare time. Here is our criteria 1) A challenging project which will teach us skills which has business value in the future. 2) A potential to make money from the project itself. Quite obvious targets. We are looking into the possibility to create a live price feed. We understand we cannot match the ones in the market now. But we are looking into the possibility to provide a feed which could at least provide a "live" feed, even though it cannot match the real time performance provided by the insane hardware and software resources the "biggies" could provide. If we could host the feed in a website which can show prices even 5 minutes late, that could do. The current skills pool is C++ and C#. We have WPF, asp.net, silverlight skills for UI (UI doesn't matter much anyway) The questions 1)How is it possible to get the raw price feeds for cheap(or free)? 2)Is it possible to do this idea at least as proof of concept(which means it might not have any commercial value) in a year by 3 developers working 20 hours a week? 3)Is there any information available in the internet to start with? 4)Is there any open source projects in this area?
