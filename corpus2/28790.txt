I have an inequality, ie: 1.57116 < g < 14.1405 There will be a large set of similar inequalities, and I want to find the intersection of them all. I figured it would be easier to convert the inequalities to intervals first. Then find the intersection. Is there an easy way to convert inequalities to intervals as the inequalities are generated? Alternatively, a way to find the intersection of a group of inequalities.
