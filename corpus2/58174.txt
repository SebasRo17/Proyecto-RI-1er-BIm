Every time I install VS (whichever version going back years) it installs with the Solution Explorer on the right. Now as most UIs have the navigation in a left hand column (and at the top of the viewport) and the content to the right of this navigation this always seems wrong to me. So I drag the solution explorer to the left of the screen and dock it there. But I've never seen another developer do this. Considering how most programmers usually like to customize their environment, adding their favourite text editor, browser, plug-ins, greasemonkey scripts etc **why do Visual Studio developers never seem to make this simple UI change?** Does anyone else do this or am I just screaming in the dark?
