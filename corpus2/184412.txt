I want to quote an answer on Stack OverFlow by Daniel Joseph: > To quote the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge > > Typically, where the word “defect” is used, it refers to a “fault” as > defined below. However, different cultures and standards may use somewhat > different meanings for these terms, which have led to attempts to define > them. Partial definitions taken from standard (IEEE610.12-90) are: > > Error: “A difference…between a computed result and the correct result” > > Fault: “An incorrect step, process, or data definition in a computer > program” > > Failure: “The [incorrect] result of a fault” > > Mistake: “A human action that produces an incorrect result” Based on my understanding of above definition, error is the result of fault, i.e., failure. Could someone explain more clearly?
