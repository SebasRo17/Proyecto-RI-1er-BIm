I am new to SSL/HTTPS so uncertain on the basics. PROBLEM: A Java applet must communicate with a socket server listening on a port on the web server. Also communication must be secure. Without SSL, the Java applet can make a direct socket communication to the server port (running on the web server). But if communication must be encrypted using SSL, then how will the Java client communicate with the socket server? My confusion is that the Java client will need to communicate with the HTTPS port (which is presumably connecting to a web server). But then how does the communication channel get 'split off' to communicate with the custom socket server? How would the ssl client specify the custom port in the message?
