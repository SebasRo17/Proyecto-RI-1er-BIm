I am a c# developer. I have always been interested in increasing my skills and knowledge and trying to pickup new technology. However now I want to enhance my knowledge in Programming standards and principles. So for example I want to know about how to structure code, refactor code, coding standards and good practices etc... Does anyone have any recommendation on any books or website links?
