I have 3 pages to my site. The 1st page allows you to select a bunch of options. Those options get sent to the 2nd page to be displayed with some data about those options. From here I can click on a link to get to page 3 on 1 of the options. On page 3 I can create a new/edit/delete all on the same page where reloads come back to page 3. I want a "back" button on page 3 to go back to page 2, but retain the options it had from the original page 1 request. Page 1 has a bunch of check boxes which are passed to page 2 as arrays to the controller. My thought is that I have to pass these arrays (I converted them to lists) to page 3 (even thought page 3 directly doesn't need them) so that page 3 can use them in the back link to it can recreate the values page 1 sent to page 2 originally. I'm using asp.net MVC and when I pass the converted array it seems to convert it to the type instead of actually showing the values: "types=System.Collections.Generic.List" (where types is a List. **Is this what is needed or are there other options to getting a "back" button in this case to go back to page 2.** It's sort of a pain to pass information to page 3 that isn't really relevant to page 3 except the back button.
