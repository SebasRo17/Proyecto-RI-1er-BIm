In this question it is answered how to add a vertical line to a graph. However, it has not been shown that how can someone add the position of that vertical line to the axis. How can I add the coordinate of a vertical line to the graph itself? I want to be able to change the font size of the coordinate too. By using the code below I can change the font size of the coordinate of axes. I want similar thing for the solution to this question too.               FrameStyle -> Directive[Black, Bold, 80]      Here is an example:               line3 = Line[{{2.33, -2}, {2.33, 2}}];     Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 2*Pi}, PlotStyle -> {Thick, Red}, Frame -> True, FrameStyle ->Directive[Thick, Bold, 20], Epilog -> {Directive[Thick, Blue], line3}]      Result: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0Giig.jpg)
