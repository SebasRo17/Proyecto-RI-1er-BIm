I am running _Mathematica_ 7\. In a `Graphics` environment I am setting `Frame -> True` (and using `FrameLabel -> {"x", "y"}` and `PlotLabel -> "My Title"`, etc) so that I can see length scales in `Graphics` environments. Suppose that I create a `Disk` of radius `0.9`, centered at the origin. I have set `PlotRange -> {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}`. The result looks nice: > >     Graphics[{ >       Cyan, Disk[{0, 0}, 0.9] >       }, >      PlotRange -> {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}, Frame -> True, >      FrameLabel -> {"x", "y"}, PlotLabel -> "My Disk"] >   > > ![Disk 1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ikJex.gif) Now, however, suppose that I want to create a `Disk` that is not entirely contained in `Frame`. For example, I might leave `PlotRange -> {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}` and increase the `Disk` radius from `0.9` to `1.2`. However, in the resulting image, the `Disk` goes beyond the boundaries of the `Frame`: > >     Graphics[{ >       Cyan, Disk[{0, 0}, 1.2] >       }, >      PlotRange -> {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}, Frame -> True, >      FrameLabel -> {"x", "y"}, PlotLabel -> "My Disk"] >   > > ![Disk 2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tqoyq.gif) Is there any way that I can direct _Mathematica_ to chop off parts of the `Graphics` objects that exist outside of the `Frame`? Thanks for your time.
