Off the top of my head, I can think of a handful of large sites which utilize the Microsoft stack   * Microsoft.com   * Dell   * MySpace   * PlentyOfFish   * StackOverflow    * Hotmail, Bing, WindowsLive However, based on observation, nearly all of the top 500 sites seem to be running other platforms.What are the main reasons there's so little market penetration?   * Cost?    * Technology Limitations?   * Does Microsoft cater to corporate / intranet environments more then public websites? I'm not looking for market share, but rather large scale adoption of the MS stack.
