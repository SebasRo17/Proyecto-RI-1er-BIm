I wanted to know whether you think and audio background is just a distraction or could be of some help while programming. For me, it works like this: when I'm writing pseudocode, or implementing procedures that are very clear in my mind in a language I can write without looking up docs, having music playing in the background (very straightforward electronics, mostly) helps me a lot: it kind of gives some rhythm to my coding and, if the procedures are trivial, avoids the distractions that boredom can cause. When I incur in a problem, or I have to try to fix a bug, instead, it just distracts me. Also, if the song is really regular and I know it well enough not to cause me to focus on it, it eliminates unexpected environmental noise that sometimes make me waste precious seconds before I can concentrate on the code again. * * * _Guidelines checklist: 1 ok, 2 I hope; 3 I suppose; 4 Definitely; 5 I would like that to happen; 6 Doch (English should implement a way to disambiguate double negatives in answers)_
