> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Scrum: how to handle backlog-items that are longer than one sprint I have a project with complex user stories which take way longer to implement than spring length. For example: user story sounds like this : > "User is able to receive a report at 10:00 am daily" But behind the scenes, it requires around 2.5 month of development so it does not fit in our two weeks sprints. Could you share the best practices for this case?
