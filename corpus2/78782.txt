I going to create a project that has the following features:   * Create Audio and Video Podcast    * Create & Browse Podcast Hoster's Profile   * Manage Hoster's Profile ( add podcast , remove podcast , archive podcast )    * Paypal Payment implementation   * Secure User Login system   * Able to expose data as a webservice. Can anyone suggest me the better PHP framwork or CMS ( if required ) and a multimedia server for the same purpose. Any other suggestions are also welcome.
