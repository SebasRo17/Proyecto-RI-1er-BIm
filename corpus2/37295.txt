I'm having a bit of trouble. I've seen other questions answered on here about how to 3D plot data from .txt files of the format:               x y z          x y z          x y z      Which works well with the `ListPointPlot` function. However, using that methodology seems to confuse poor _Mathematica_ when trying to do surface plotting of data that is in the format               ` y y y y y y y y y y y y y y          z x x x x x x x x x x x x x x          z x x x x x x x x x x x x x x          z x x x x x x x x x x x x x x       Where the ` is a place holder (just an empty space in my case). I've tried the manipulations that I know of or could find around the web, but those attempts end with errors being kicked back at me. How would I get _Mathematica_ to plot this .txt data?
