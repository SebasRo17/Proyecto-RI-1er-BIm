Can someone recommend a good robust "Free" testing framework for Qt? Our requirements:   1. Should be able to test basic mouse click / mouse move events   2. Should be able to handle non-widget view components   3. Should have "record" capability to generate test scripts.   4. Should be automatable for running it daily. We looked at:   1. Squish - this solves all our problems. But it is just too da** expensive.   2. KD Executor - the download page now links to the squish page and says that's what they recommend for testing. Not sure what they mean by that.    3. TDriver - from nokia.qt. Super difficult to install. Very little documentation. Having a hard time to just install. I wonder how much harder it would be to write tests.   4. qtestlib - Could not handle non-widget components. Everything has to be a widget to be tested. No "record" feature.  Can someone help with any other alternative?
