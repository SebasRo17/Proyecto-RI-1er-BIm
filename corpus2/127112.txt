We are going to start using Git (not using it yet), and I want to define the workflow. We have 4 teams at 4 different global locations, developing together the same product. Each team owns a part of product's code, but sometimes they also have to make changes in the code owned by other teams. Is there a recommendation for a Git workflow for such environment? I have already seen this article, but the approach here is "we create additional branches as seldom as possible", and I believe more in "branch for each user story" approach. Also, this article presents a nice approach. I had in mind having a master branch, a permanent branch per each team periodically merging to master, and a per-user-story branches merging to the teams' branches. Does it make sense, or it wouldn't work?
