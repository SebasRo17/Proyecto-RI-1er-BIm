I want to have a button present in a CDF that, when pressed, shares some content material e.g. via Facebook. Is it possible or would the restrictions of the CDF format prevent anything from happening? Can it be done outside of CDF then? I don't have the slightest clue how to solve this... built-in? JLink? .NET/Link? My ridiculously simple example code is this:               data = {"title", "URL", "summary", "image"};     Button["Share", shareOverFacebook[data]]
