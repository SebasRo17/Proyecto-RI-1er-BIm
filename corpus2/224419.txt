I have been developing a database-driven web application with extensive contents. The application is set to release using a GNU GPL v3 license. Whereas the content would be licensed using a Creative Commons license. To provide a brief context, this is an e-learning site, where I provide some kind of learning materials. Additionally, I am planning to provide a database dump along with the source code. The reason being, one would be able to setup and actually use the application given the contents. I have two questions in this regard:   1. Should I actually include the database dump along with the source code? If I don't, a user would require to create everything by his own, which is not desirable.   2. If the above answer is "yes", what license is applicable to the physical file containing the database contents? Please note that it is not possible to use any other type of licenses for the code and content, and both are to be licensed. P.S.: In case this question seems off-topic, could you please point to a more relevant site?
