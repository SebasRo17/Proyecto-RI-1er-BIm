I'm currently working as a software developer and studying for a software engineering degree (the former whilst not doing the latter). I'm confident in my ability to do my job competently, but I feel I could do it better. I know my greatest pitfall is in my business skills; for example, I often don't understand at first why I'm asked to implement something in such a way, because I haven't understood the business requirement behind it. Does anybody have any good advice on improving my business skills? Or is it something that comes with experience?
