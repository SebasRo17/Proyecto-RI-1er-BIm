I have very limited experience in software project management roles, and I was asked this question by another engineer and I was sort of stumped. How do I measure when a software project is complete? The part I'm struggling with is the "measure" part. I know there are measurements such as EVM, but they are more focused on overall project performance. For instance, having a low SPI or low CPI can indicate performance/allocation issues, but it doesn't really indicate how complete a project is. Is there a rule of thumb here to say my project is XX% complete or am I overthinking this?
