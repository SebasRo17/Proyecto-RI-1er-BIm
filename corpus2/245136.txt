Is it a good idea to use **pywebsocket** in a production environment, since it is so widely used, but their google developer page states " _pywebsocket is intended for testing or experimental purposes_ ". Since Mozilla as well as Google use it to test their websocket implementations, and it was suggested (for production) in many SO threads, I thought it to be a pretty stable basis until I looked at their page. Or am I misinterpeting something, and it is just meant to be _especially_ helpful for testing, as well as suitable in production? Moreover do you know what the specific drawbacks of using it would be?   * Are there performance drawbacks?   * Is it not stable or unsecure in a certain way?
