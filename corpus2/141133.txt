I think of the scope of a variable as - "The scope of a particular variable is the range within a program's source code in which that variable is recognized by the compiler". That statement is from "Scope and Lifetime of Variables in C++", which I read many months ago. Recently I came across this in _LeMoyne-Owen College_ courses: ![http://sankofa.loc.edu/CHU/WEB/Courses/Cosi350/Ch4/scope.13.gif](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Krcsi.gif) What exactly is the difference between the scope of variables in C# and (C99, C++, Java) when > However a variable still must be declared before it can be used
