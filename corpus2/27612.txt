I am trying to evaluate a few limits in _Mathematica_ , and I can only get it to evaluate them in certain cases. I don't fully understand the evaluation order and when it substitutes numerical values in for variables. If anyone could explain to me how to do these I would appreciate it. Mn, g, and extent have numerical values that are determined before this. x0 and order are parameters that I input manually when plotting and using for matching, etc.               DeltaAnalytic[k_?NumericQ, g_?NumericQ, extent_?NumericQ] :=        ArcTan[((Sin[k*extent])^2)/(k*extent*Mn/g - Sin[k*extent]*Cos[k*extent])];          EffRangeExp[k0_, x0_?NumericQ, order_?NumericQ, coupling_?NumericQ, extent_?NumericQ] :=       Limit[Normal[Series[DeltaAnalytic[k, coupling, extent], {k, x, order}]], x -> x0] /.          k -> k0;      Now when I try to plot the above, `EffRangeExp`, or just get it to spit out a numeric value at some k with various parameters, it is clearly evaluating something in the wrong order. I just don't know how to fix this problem. Would it help to make the variables local in the above function?
