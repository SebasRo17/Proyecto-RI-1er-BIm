I am trying to plot the derivative of function `g[x]` below where `g[x]` is defined as the root of another equation. However, I am getting nonsensical answers for the derivative. Any advice would be much appreciated! Simplified code is below:               jRa[T3_] := 10^-5/(1 + 5*10^-8/T3)           jRb[x_, T3_] :=       x*1.3*10^-4/(10^-4 +           x*(1 + 10^-6/(10^-5 - T3)))          g[x_?NumericQ] := (T3 /.          FindRoot[{jRa[T3] == jRb[x, T3]}, {{T3, 10^-7}},           MaxIterations -> 1000])/Ttot          s1 = Plot[(g[x]), {x, 10^-7, 2*10^-5}, PlotRange -> All]          s2 = Plot[g'[x], {x, 10^-7, 2*10^-5}, PlotRange -> All]          g'[.9*10^-5]
