# Use Case What are the use cases for creating a **one-to-one** relationship where the parent points to the child compared to a child pointing to the parent? If there is no difference, is one preferred over the other? ## Example               +---------+     +-------+       +--------+     +----------+     + Parent  +     + Child +       + Parent +     + Child    +     +---------+     +-------+  vs.  +--------+     +----------+     + idChild + --> + id    +       + id     + <-- + idParent +     +---------+     +-------+       +--------+     +----------+      I suspect that you'd choose between these relationships depending on which entity is used first in the application. i.e. If the parent object always appears before the child object, then the relationship should be mapped from the parent to child.
