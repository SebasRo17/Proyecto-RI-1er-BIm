I'm creating a website based on users' code, a place where they can share code in a social way and one of the features I'm currently developing is Code Review. This feature will allow users to evaluate code in certain aspects, from the top of my head I came out with things like:   * Legibility,    * Performace and    * Modularity. What are the general characteristics that you evaluate when reviewing code?
