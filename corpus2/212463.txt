Doctrine offers three ways to define the object mapping properties: in XML, in YAML and as inline docblock annotations in the code. The Doctrine documentation doesn't give any advice on choosing among them, but I'm specifically wondering if there is a generally accepted for best practice with regard to keeping mapping metadata for an ORM system in the file where the objects are defined versus keeping it in a separate data file. Is there?
