When I was studying in the university I often heard the idea that Fortran compilers produced faster code than C compilers for an equivalent program. The key reasoning went like this: _a Fortran compiler emits on average 1,1 processor instruction per line of code, while a C compiler emits on average 1,6 processor instruction per line of code_ - I don't remember the exact numbers but the idea was that C compilers emitted noticeably more machine code and therefore produced slower programs. How valid is such comparison? Can we say that Fortran compilers produce faster programs than C compilers or vice versa and why does this difference exist?
