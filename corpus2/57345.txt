I'd been having trouble using `JoinAcross` on two datasets. After going through the answers to my original question and fixing my code, I find I'm now having a problem that I think is being caused by my data. I'm adding a column to an Excel sheet, but not using it in my dataset. I'm reading in two Excel sheets, "Reported" and "Estimated". Below are screens shot of "Reported" followed by "Estimated": ![Reported](http://i.stack.imgur.com/sgG2u.png) ![Estimated](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ILPHf.png) Next is my code and its output:               repFile = Import[NotebookDirectory[] <> "test.xlsx", {"Sheets", "Reported"}];     repHeader = repFile[[1]];     repData = repFile[[2 ;;]];          estFile = Import[NotebookDirectory[] <> "test.xlsx", {"Sheets", "Estimated"}];     estHeader = estFile[[1]];     estData = estFile[[2 ;;]];          repDS = Dataset@Map[AssociationThread[repHeader, #] &]@repData;     estDS = Dataset@Map[AssociationThread[estHeader, #] &]@estData;          rep1 = repDS[All, {"a", "z1"}];     est1 = estDS[All, {"a", "z2"}];          rep1     est1     rep1 // Normal     est1 // Normal     JoinAcross[rep1, est1, "a"]      ![Output1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Nl6cP.png) Now I add one column to "Estimated" to get: ![Estimated2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xxufd.png) My output now looks like: ![Output2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ufteh.png) Since I'm not actually bringing in that additional column to the dataset I don't understand what's happening. Is this a bug or am I doing something wrong?
