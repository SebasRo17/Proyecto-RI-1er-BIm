I am writing a system where both the system owner and myself are developers, and we are currently the only source of 'requests' or requirements for the system, which I would like to capture in user stories tied to features{1}. My urgent priority now is to get a managaeble backlog captured. How should I go about capturing the level of technical spec I am used to to working with in users stories, which aren't supposed to be too technical. {1} I am evaluating agile project management service TargetProcess, and each user story must be tied to a parent feature. The system seems a good fit, so this small constraint is something I would rather work with than work around.
