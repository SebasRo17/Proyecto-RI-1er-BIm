Normally, you can enable `Graphics3D` to show tick marks by doing this:               Graphics3D[Sphere[], Axes -> True]      ![ticks](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XQkj4.png) But in _Mathematica_ version **10** , when I add an `Inset` which contains a `Grid` or `Column`, the output looks wrong:               Graphics3D[Sphere[], Axes -> True,      Epilog -> Inset[Column[{"a"}], {.05, .05}]]      ![no ticks](http://i.stack.imgur.com/NaiIC.png) The ticks only appear when I manually rotate the graphics or start editing the input line. But note that I produced the enclosed images here by doing `Export["file.png",%]` after each plot, so that this faulty display is indeed not just a notebook display problem - it leads to incorrectly exported graphics, too. This doesn't appear to happen when the inset contains a `Row` instead of `Column`. I also see this strange behavior when doing something like this:               Plot3D[1, {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1},      Epilog -> Inset[Column[{"a"}], {.05, .05}]]      ![partial ticks](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wKTTd.png) Here, you can see that the tick marks are displayed only _partially_! My operating system is Mac OS X 10.8.5, and I am wondering if this is reproducible on other systems. If so, it would be nice to know how to work around this problem. The issue also goes away when the `Inset` only contains numbers and not strings. **Edit** I've reported this as a bug (CASE:1384605).
