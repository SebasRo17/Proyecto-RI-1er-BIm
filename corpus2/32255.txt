Given a list of the form:               {{1,2,3,4,5},{6,7,8,9,10},{11,12},{13,14,15,16},{17,18,19,20,21,22,23},{24},{25,26},{27},{4}}      How can I bin each sequential set of N elements of the list together? For example, if N = 3, we would transform the above list into:               {{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12},{13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24},{25,26,27,4}}      Of length 3.
