Writing software for a client, and one of their requirements was that the user be able to specify where the application database is stored, be it on the local network or in an online repository. I can let them choose where to put it, but how do I store that information in the application? I guess I don't understand how to persist changes in an application that is already deployed. This is my first piece of software, so I've never been through the deployment process. Written in C# for Windows.
