While trying to evaluate the integral $\int_{y=0}^{x_2}\int_{x=0}^{min(x_1,y)} n (n - 1) (1 - y)^{(n - 2)}dxdy $ , Mathematica does not seem to yield any results.                Integrate[n (n - 1) (1 - y)^(n - 2), {y, 0, x2}, {x, 0, Min[y, x1]}]      Wolframm alpha also fails saying standard computation time exceeded. Is there anyway to evaluate the integral? I also tried this,               Assuming[0 < x1 < x2 < 1,       Integrate[n (n - 1) (1 - y)^(n - 2), {y, 0, x2}, {x, 0, Min[y, x1]}]]
