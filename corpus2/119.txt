One thing I could never wrap my head around is how `Flatten` works when provided with a matrix as the second argument, and the _Mathematica_ help isn't particularly good on this one. Taken from the `Flatten` _Mathematica_ documentation:               Flatten[list, {{s11, s12, ...}, {s21, s22, ...}, ...}]      > Flattens `list` by combining all levels $s_{ij}$ to make each level $i$ in > the result. Could someone elaborate on what this actually means/does?
