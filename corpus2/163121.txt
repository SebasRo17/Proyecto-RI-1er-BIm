The situation: We are about to roll out what is essentially a logging service. As we are rather PHP heavy, the current implementation use it. We will have about 200 computers (most on the same network) that will each send, via HTTP POST, around 5000 requests/day. With each request containing about 300 bytes of data. The receiving end is hosted at Amazon and is a very simple PHP form with some simple validation that puts everything in a database. Now, I've recently been introduced to Node.js and I'm curious as to if it would be a good fit for the backend here. Granted I could easily build something to test this. But since I haven't fully grasped the async-methology I would really like someone with experience to explain it to me.
