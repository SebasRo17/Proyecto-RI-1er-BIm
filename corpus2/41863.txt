I've been given the task to train our manual testers to become developers in test (write test automation!). Some have basic programming knowledge (either dabbling in PHP or reading stuff) and some who have no experience. Note that I do have teaching experience, but with real students, not employees, and one concern is that they will not put extra hours except the 20% management gave them for the transition. Language to be taught and used: C# We have 8 hours per week to do this and should decide if they will make it in 2 months. I am thinking of a combined approach:   * use a manual such as Head First C# (although I'm not happy with the labs, they're mostly games and I don't want to add UI complexities)   * have them read from the manual    * do labs with them, solving more and more difficult problems and explain the theoretical stuff as well   * have them do a bigger project towards the end  Some questions:   * do you have a better suggestion as far as manuals go?   * do you have a better approach? Focus less on labs?   * what kind of assessments should I use and how often?   * should I let them do a bigger project (bank system or small game) and how much time should I invest in that?   * ideas on labs?   * other resources ? Any other tips would be most welcomed! Thanks!
