I've been mucking around with passing functions as arguments to other functions and via trial and error seem to have something that works. I was wondering if someone could have a quick look at some simple example code and let me know if this method is sound or if there are some things that I am overlooking. Cheers...               Clear[mother];     mother[] :=      Module[{f},       f[x_, y_, z_] := x + y + z;       child[f]     ]          Clear[child];     child[functionArgument_] :=       Module[{},        functionArgument[1, 2, 3]     ]
