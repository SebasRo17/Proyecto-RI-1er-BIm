I have commit access on an open source project named Foo hosted on GitHub (there are many other committers if that is relevant). I would like to make a change via pull request so that someone else reviews it before it gets committed to the master branch of the Foo codebase. To make this pull request, I can either make a branch on the official Foo repository or I could fork Foo and commit to a branch on my fork. What issues should I consider when I'm deciding whether to make my pull request on the official repo or my fork?
