I am (re-)designing some packages for R, and I am currently working out the necessary functions, objects, both internal and for the interface with the user. I have documented the individual functions and objects. So I have the description of all the little parts. Now I need to give an overview of how the parts fit together. The scheme of the motor so to say. I've started with making some flowchart-like graphs in Visio, but that quickly became a clumsy and useless collection of boxes, arrrows and-what-not. So hence the question:   * Is there specific software you can use for vizualizing the design of your program   * If so, care to share some tips on how to do this most efficiently   * If not, how do other designers create the scheme of their programs and communicate that to others? * * * Edit: I am NOT asking how to explain complex processes to somebody, nor asking how to illustrate programming logic. I am asking how to **communicate** the **design** of a program/package, i.e.:   * the objects (with key features and representation if possible)   * the related functions (with arguments and function if possible)   * the interrelation between the functions at the interface and the internal functions (I'm talking about an extension package for a scripting language, keep that in mind) So something like this : ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pohJ4.png) But better. This is (part of) the interrelations between functions in the old package that I'm now redesigning for obvious reasons :-) PS : I made that graph myself, using code extraction tools on the source and feeding the interrelation matrix to yEd Graph Editor.
