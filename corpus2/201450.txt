I'm a server-side junkie, and by that I mean I spend time writing code that's not visible to anyone. I'm interested in rounding out my skillset and becoming more self-sufficient with writing full-stack webapps. But, I find it difficult to work with the the sort of 'organicity' of client- side html tech. I know there is no substitute for time and experience, but if an experienced client-side dev was starting over from scratch, what would he read/do? EDIT: an example of an answer that I'd give for server-side: > Learn the best practices of the language you're working in, eg. for java, > read 'effective java'. Learn fundamentals of algorithms, application design > concepts that are useful in any language, two good sources are 'design > patterns', 'SICP'. I'm not looking for: 'Learn CSS, HTML and Javascript.' I am looking for something like: > Intent, rationale, concepts of X are well-explained in Y. Framework Z is a > good example and the source-code is enlightening and well-documented.
