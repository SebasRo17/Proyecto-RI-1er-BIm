I'm trying to have several initializer lists in a `With` function and choose which one I want to use. So far I have this:               With[Evaluate@{Unevaluated@{a = 2, b = 3}, Unevaluated@{a = 4, b = 6}}[[1]], a + b]      which doesn't work on a pretext that " _Local variable specification Unevaluated[{a=2,b=3}] is not a List._ ", and gives me `With[Unevaluated[{a = 2, b = 3}], a + b]` for an answer. Now, if I just feed this same purportedly erroneous expression back to the kernel, it evaluates just fine with the correct result of 5, showing that Unevaluated list not being a list is a rather moot point. But how do I connect `Unevaluated` with `With` without me in between?
