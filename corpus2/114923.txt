Many (perhaps most?) database applications today use B-Trees and variations to store data, because this data structure optimizes the read, write and seek operations on a hard disk (and these operations in turn play an important role in the overall efficiency of the databases). Should Solid State Drives (SSDs) completely outplace traditional hard disks (HDDs), though, could we say that B-Trees and variations will become obsolete, giving room for data structures that are more efficient operating on direct access memory? If so, what will those structures be? (e.g., hash tables, AVL trees)
