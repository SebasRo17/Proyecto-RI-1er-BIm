I am currently in the process of selecting a widget framework to be used for a new project. Current choices are Dojo/ExtJS4. We are leaning on ExtJS4 but might have some issues with the licensing. From the Sencha license page: > Our open source license is the appropriate option if you are creating an > open source application under a license compatible with the GNU GPL license > v3. However on the GPL FAQ: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#UnreleasedMods > **A company is running a modified version of a GPL'ed program on a web site. > Does the GPL say they must release their modified sources?** > > The GPL permits anyone to make a modified version and use it without ever > distributing it to others. What this company is doing is a special case of > that. Therefore, the company does not have to release the modified sources. > > It is essential for people to have the freedom to make modifications and use > them privately, without ever publishing those modifications. However, > putting the program on a server machine for the public to talk to is hardly > “private” use, so it would be legitimate to require release of the source > code in that special case. Developers who wish to address this might want to > use the GNU Affero GPL for programs designed for network server use. Seems **contradicting** on what they have on **Sencha's** licensing page. Moreover, the webapp will be deployed on the cloud and will offer a subscription model. I've read that this is the so called **ASP loophole** and that the **Affero GPL** was made to address this. The project will have multiple modules, but certainly there would be backend/integration and frontend modules. The **frontend** will just **consume exposed REST services** and will be an entirely **different application**. The question is, would there be any license issues if we use the **GPL** version and willing to offer the source code ( **frontend module only** ) which uses ExtJS for our future clients?
