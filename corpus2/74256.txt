I've got to dive into a very large PHP site and have my first client meeting today. All they gave me so far was the URL. How do you guys go about gathering/structuring/documenting and preparing for a new project in a PHP environment? What things do you ask for up front? PS - I know there are other general questions about this but I want a PHP- flavored one, including tools (even if universal) and approaches. Thanks!! I'm excited but also scared.
