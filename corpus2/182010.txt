Recently I realized that the most popular social platforms on the net are in the hand of just a few companies, Google, Twitter, Facebook, to name just a few. Taking into account the world changing power of these frameworks I am looking for a non-profit, democratic alternatives to these sites. (Mozilla is a non-profit project, however it could not thrive without the backing of Google.) In my imagination, the ideal approach (see explanation below) would be a distributed approach as used in file sharing programs or tools like seti@home. Every user willing to take part in the project would have to install software on his or her computer to act as a node in the network that would make up a social space similar to Google+, Facebook or Twitter but with a non-commercial approach. This approach could also be used for a "democratic" cloud to store data. Is anyone aware of projects that go in this direction? * * * I call it "ideal approach" for a couple of reasons. No need for big server farms or hardware maintaining costs. Invulnerability against most hack attack because it's distributed and there is no central node. Just some I could think of right now.
