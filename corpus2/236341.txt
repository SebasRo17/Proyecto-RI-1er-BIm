I was wondering, if it makes sense to encrypt passwords for external services stored in my config file with an symmetric encryption algorithm? On the one hand I think, if someone gets access to the config file, he will probably also get access to the code and it will relatively easy to decrypt the passwords... on the other hand I am not comfortable to store the passwords in plain text either. Whats your opinion on this topic? Are there any "best practices"?
