I want to explain design patterns to my niece, but always struggle in doing so. It is largely due to my lack of clear understanding of design patterns. How do you suggest explaining patterns like MVC,Singleton,Factory,Repository etc in such simple terms that even kids of 10 years old can understand. I'm looking for examples which can ease in helping understanding patterns. Examples with toys,movies,music etc.
