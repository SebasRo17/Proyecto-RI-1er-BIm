How can we define a function that works like `f[x_]=ComputeSomething[x]` and treats `x` as a variable that does not have a value? We could call this function `LocalSet` and the computation should be done when the assignment is made as in the following example.               var=3;     LocalSet[f[var_],Normal[Series[Exp[var],{var,0,3}]]];     DownValues[f]          (*     ---> {HoldPattern[f[var_]]:>1+var+var^2/2+var^3/6}     *)          var     (*     ---> 3     *)       Notice I don't want to be limited to a pattern variable (`x_`). The function called `LocalSet` should figure out what symbols are used for patterns and evalute the right side with those variables in a `Block` construct.
