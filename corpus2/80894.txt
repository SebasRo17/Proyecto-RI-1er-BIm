I work on an agile team at the moment where our stories are written primarily from the user perspective as well as testing. So, for example, we may have a request for a date picker. The story would go something like:               User goes to page x and clicks on date to launch a native date picker      All fine and good, but the problem is how to communicate what that is from a development POV. For example, the issues we'd want to address:   * we have to support multiple devices   * even though the user sees a 'native' widget, we're often having to build emulated versions in JS   * we'd want to be using said widget on many other pages than just x and would want to incorporate variations needed on page y and z into this one component. We're struggling in figuring out how to best handle this to enable the dev team. One option seems to be for our dev team to build our own component and pattern libraries. We'd then take the user stories and use that data to enhance our own component/pattern library. Have you ran into this problem and, if so, have you found a way to consolidate the discrepancies between user stories and the concept of reusable component code for the dev team?
