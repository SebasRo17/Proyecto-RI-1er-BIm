I want to solve a large LP problem using `NMaximize`. This is a small instance of my bigger problem: $$max \sum^{4}_{t=1}(\sum^{4}_{c=1} V_{c}*f_{c,t})\\\ s.t\quad \sum^{5}_{t=1} f_{c,t} \leq 100,\forall t$$ where $ f_{c,t} \geq 0$ and $c=1...5$ and $t=1...5$ I wrote the following:               NMaximize[{Sum[f[c, t]*V, {c, 1, 4}, {t, 1, 4}],        Sum[f[c, t], {c, 1, 5}] <= 100}, {f[c, t]}]      How can I declare `f[c,t]` as a variable?
