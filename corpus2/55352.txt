I have a list of functions defined on the plane, and I want to know which one of those functions is smaller than the other functions at particular points. Currently, what I do is               Plot3D[{1 + 3/2 v, 1 + 2/3 m + 1/6 v, 9/4 + 1/8 v, 10/7 m,        m + Min[2/3, 1/2 m, v]}, {m, 1, 2}, {v, 0, 1},       PlotStyle -> {Orange, Red, Blue, Green, Black}, ViewPoint -> Bottom]      And I get a picture like this (it is a little bit rotated because I can't view 3D plots unless I'm moving it... but that's another question) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OfFPC.png) I feel there must be a smarter way than doing this without invoke plotting a 3D diagram.
