I know someone may have asked similar questions but the solution doesn't work to me. My code is like this:               a = ComponentMeasurements[       MorphologicalComponents[rb], {"Centroid" , "Area"}, #2 > 60 &]       My output is               {1 -> {{134.861, 140.779}, 65.5}, 2 -> {{168.362, 140.052}, 62.5}}      How can I make the output be `{{134.861,140.799},{168.362,140.052}}`?
