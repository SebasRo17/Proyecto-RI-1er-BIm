I have an expression that is the the sum and product of undefined derivatives and their derivatives. e.g. `fg+ Dt[f,t]g +Dt[g,{t,2}]f+` What I would like to find is the maximum order of the derivatives, and so 2 would be returned for the above example. My first attempts use `Cases` to make lists of the order of derivatives. This would send `Dt[x_,t]->1` and `Dt[x_,{t,n_}]->n`. However for some reason `Dt[f,t]` and `Dt[f,{t,2}]` fail to match with their respective patterns and don't trigger the rule. If, in the rules, the `x_` is replaced with `f` the rules will trigger but only for `f` and no other function. Is there a way to do this search without a strict list of the available functions.
