Is it any indications of poor programming if the support staff for a given product requires you to clear the cookies in order to troubleshoot issues with their web-site? As a point of example, if you're trying to activate a new SIM on a tablet, and the carrier's activation web-site is giving you an error message that their web-site is down, even though there is no problem with actually accessing their web-server, which responds with the our-website-is-down page just fine. Subsequently, the support staff instructs the user to try clearing the cookies (even though this activation web-site is not know to have been accessed prior to the error message taking place).
