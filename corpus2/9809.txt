I have Mathematica 8.0.0.0 installed on my Mac, and while I tried to see what it could do with CUDA, it downloaded a large directory (~1 GB) named `CUDAResources-OSX-8.0.0.8` in `~/Library/Mathematica/Paclets/Repository/`. However, after the download, I tried to see what it would give but `CUDAQ[]` returns `False` on my system. Seeing that CUDA's not going to be useful on this machine, how can I reclaim this disk space? In other words, how to get rid of this downloaded data?
