Is there any cons of making your employees use open-source programs in your company? I am planning to start a bussiness and I wonder why companies usually work with proprietary software, as _Microsoft Word_ to quote the most famous one. Why do not they use _Open Office_ (or _Libre Office_ ) etc.? From my point of view, you can save a lot of money and help the open-source community by, for instance, giving them part of your benefits in form of donations. I do not know any (medium-big) company that does this. Probably you could give me some examples, just to prove that this model of open-source usage/collaboration ~~works~~ rocks.
