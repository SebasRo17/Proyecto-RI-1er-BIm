The following function is defined for Real input:               FFc = Compile[{{x, _Real}, {EF, _Real}},If[x > EF, 0., If[x == EF, 0.5, 1.]]]      FFc is now used in the function called foo:               EBoundary = 6.5;     foo[Ef_?NumericQ] := NIntegrate[FFc[x, Ef] , {x, -EBoundary, EBoundary}]      When I call foo like               foo[3.2]      I get an error message:               CompiledFunction::cfsa: "Argument x at position 1 should be a \!\(\"machine-size real number\"\)."      Since I'm using real numbers I have no idea why I get this message. What is the problem? Is it, because If[] can return 0?
