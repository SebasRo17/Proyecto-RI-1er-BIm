This is purely a design question and the example is simple to illustrate what I am asking and there are too many permutations of more complex code to provide examples that would cover the topic. _I am not referring specifically to this example, just using the example to illustrate what I am referring to._ In an if statement, is there a preferred way to order conditions, in terms of coding convention and, more importantly, efficiency? For such a simple example, efficiency will not be an issue, but I am not asking for a code review per se, but an understanding of the concept. Two alternatives:   1.               public double myStuff(int i)     {         // check for an invalid number of tourists         if (i > 0)         {             // do something here                  return doubleSomething;         } else         {             return Double.NaN;         }     }      2.               public double myStuff(int i)     {              if (i <= 0)         {             return Double.NaN;              } else         {                  {                 // do something here                      return doubleSomething;             }      If the if statement was to become more complex, and possibly nested, in what order should conditions be addressed?
