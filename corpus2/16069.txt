I want to draw one plot showing all the solutions the following ODE with different values of `N`. How can i do it?               s = NDSolve[{2 y'''[x] + (y[x]*y''[x]) == 0,                   g''[x] + (0.5****N***y[x]*g'[x]) == 0,                   g[0] == y[0] == 0, y'[0] == 0, y'[8] == 1, g[12] == 1}, {y, g}, {x, 0, 12}];          Plot[Evaluate[{g[x]} /. s], {x, 0, 12}, PlotStyle -> Automatic]
