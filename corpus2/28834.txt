I'm trying to create a rather big 3D image and export it. Currently, I create the image then display using `Show`, then use `Export`. The problem is that drawing the 3D image as an interactive object is absolutely caning my little laptop, and I don't really need it - I just want a _jpeg_ output. Any way to do this? What I am doing is basically along the lines of               Show[{object list}, options]     Export["name.jpeg",%,options]      So as an example, if I wanted an image of a `Sin[x]` graph without _Mathematica_ first "drawing" it, how would I do it? Thanks
