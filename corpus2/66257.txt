This is always a puzzle to me- and I realise that it is not strictly an issue in programming or software development, but it seems to be a reasonable common one in our field. For example, if I were to set an expiry datetime as 2011-04-08 00:00:00 - and given my current local time is 10:45 on the 8th already - have I already expired? Or do I still have half a day or so left? Is there are universal standard for which end of the day midnight 'belongs' to? Or should I take a leaf from the British military, and say that the day ends at 23:59:59 and starts at 00:00:01 and that there is no midnight?
