From what I can see, when using Riak to update an object, I first need to load the object into PHP, then edit the object, then store the object back to the Riak database. I was wondering if there is a way to update a bucket without pulling it into PHP first. That way, it would save on the network I/O and latency of pulling it into the PHP script. Can objects be edited directly on the Riak side of things? Edit: Is there away to push data to the end of a raik object, so if i have an object that is numeric array can i make a push to add subject that i know its not there or no in place updates what so ever
