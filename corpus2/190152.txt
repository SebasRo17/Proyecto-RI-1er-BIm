I'm a strong proponent of writing if statements like this:               variable == constant      Because to me it just makes sense, it is more readable than the inverted:               constant == variable      Which seems to be used a lot by C-programmers. And I see the use, namely that the interpreter or compiler will throw an error and let you know if you're not doing a comparison. But still it is less readable, and for that reason alone I don't think comparisons should be written in the manner of the second example. **The actual question is:** > **Does it exist a general best practice for this, or is it different > depending on language/religion/age/etc..?** I'm happy that so many seem to understand why you'd want to do as in the latter example, but that is not what I'm asking about.
