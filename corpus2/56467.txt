I have been plotting time-dependent vectors. Earlier I used the following plotting options:               CLB4D[t_] := {CLBx[t], CLBy[t], CLBz[t], t};          tempdata = Table[CLB4D[t], {t, 0, d, (0.01/\[Omega])}];     tempdata[[All, 4]] = Rescale[tempdata[[All, 4]], {0, d}];     clrfnct[x_, cf_] := ColorData[cf][1 - x[[4]]];     Graphics3D[{PointSize[0.013],      Point[#[[1 ;; 3]], VertexColors -> clrfnct[#, "SolarColors"]] & /@      tempdata, Opacity[0.01], Sphere[{0, 0, 0}]}, Boxed -> False,      Axes -> True, AxesLabel -> {x, y, z}]      where CLB4D[t] is the vector, specifying a point in 3D-space, with a color that corresponds to a time-coordinate. The components of this vector are defined in the same module, which then plots the answer. Actually, I have several different modules with different definitions for vectors that I am comparing. It worked well, but I wished to tweak the options to get a clearer plot (changing the visual appearance wasn't just my wish, either). I am happy with the following options:               CLB4D[t_] := {CLBx[t], CLBy[t], CLBz[t], t};          tempdata = Table[CLB4D[t], {t, 0, 2*pi/f, (2*pi/f)/150}];     tempdata[[All, 4]] = Rescale[tempdata[[All, 4]], {0, 2*pi/f}];     clrfnct[x_, cf_] := ColorData[cf][1 - x[[4]]];     Graphics3D[{PointSize[0.010],      Point[#[[1 ;; 3]], VertexColors -> clrfnct[#, "SolarColors"]] & /@      tempdata, Opacity[0.5], pic[[1]], pic2[[1]]}, Boxed -> False,      Axes -> False,      PlotLabel ->      Style["text and "<>ToString[variables_from_the_module], FontSize -> 16, FontFamily -> "STIX"],       ViewPoint -> {1.14, -3.09, 0.77}]      There, pic and pic2 are parametricplot3d's of unit circles, and the coordinate axes from 0 to 1. These are always plotted as a reference. The trouble is that whenever I have any plot that takes, say, 20 minutes or an hour from the local computer to calculate (or would take in the previous style), after evaluating it for a long while, Mathematica just freezes, and most of the time I have to kill it, or it crashes. Finally, it gave me the **Self-test error MLParseStream|c|297** instead of crashing. It fails to evaluate with both Linux and Mac. I got this message on a Mac. If the plot only takes for a couple of seconds to evaluate, it manages to do this. Sometimes it has managed to evaluate a heavier plot, but will crash when I try to save .nb or export the plot as a PDF. I have no idea what goes wrong, nor have I found out what the message is about. I have not changed any other definitions in the module. I also noticed that taking away the option "viewpoint" does not remove the problem. Any suggestions? I am using version 9 of Mathematica.
