Is there an option to align Text to automatically adjust for font descent? In the attached graphic, strings that contain "g" are visibly shifted upward, even though all strings are uniformly rendered by:               Text[Style[name, FontFamily -> "Helvetica",        FontSize -> 12], {(b + 20), y}, {-1, -0.85}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ta0e6.jpg) Is there a way to align strings vertically by the font's baseline? You can also see this issue in a simpler example:                 Graphics[          {Line[{{0, 0}, {1, 0}}],           Text["g", {1/4, 0.01}],           Text["h", {3/4, 0.01}]},          PlotRange -> {All, {-1, 1}}          ]      which somehow doesn't replicate the issue (M9/OSX10.8) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2W1n0.jpg)
