I'm studying the quantum mechanics of an infinite square well from a computational standpoint. My eigenfunctions are defined as $u_n(x)=\sqrt{2/L}\sin\left(n\pi x/L\right),\quad 0 \le x \le L, \quad n=1,2,3,\dots$ and zero outside of the $[0,L]$ interval. I'd like to transform the wave function from position domain to the momentum domain. My book says that this is achieved by writing the Fourier transform of $u_n(x)$: $\phi_n(k)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} u_n(x)e^{-i k x}dx$               ClearAll["Global`*"];     L = 1;     u[n_, x_] := Sqrt[2/L] Sin[n π x]     φ[n_, k_] := Assuming[{n ∈ Integers, {k, x} ∈ Reals},                     1/(Sqrt[2π]) Integrate[u[n, x] Exp[-I k x], {x, -∞, ∞}]]      > Integrate::idiv: Integral of E^(-I k x) Sin[n π x] does not converge on > {-∞,∞}. >> If I, though, use `FourierTransform[]`, I get the result:               FourierTransform[u[n, x], x, k, FourierParameters -> {0, -1}]      > -I Sqrt[π] DiracDelta[k - n π] + I Sqrt[π] DiracDelta[k + n π] But my book says that the result should be: $\phi_n(k) = \sqrt{\pi L} n \frac{1-(-1)^n e^{-i L k}}{(n\pi -L k)(n\pi + Lk)}$ I tried to get _Mathematica_ to fully simplify the output of `FourierTransform[]`, but I/it couldn't. So my questions are:   1. Why does the integral not converge when written manually but it does converge when it is being calculated via `FourierTransform[]` ?   2. How could I prove that the output of `FourierTransform[]` is equivalent to the formula that is written in my book for $\phi_n(k)$ ?
