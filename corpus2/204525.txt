I am yet to start my career, I have a profound interest in algorithm design. I somehow fail to understand that, how would a tech firm use the algorithmic paradigm? I mean in real life projects do we actually end up using dynamic programming, greedy techniques, graph algorithms etc. Is there actually a future for people who are good at this subject. I understand that there are a wide variety of projects that are based on java, html5, css, javascript, j2ee etc. that never use algorithms. But are there companies out there using from the algorithmic paradigm for software development/solving complex (business or other) problems or is just for clearing interviews. p.s. I understand that software development is also based on other subjects as well, for example Design Patterns .
