I've been told that when I have a hash table of size `m` and `m=2^k`, I can use the `&` operator as `num & (size-1)` instead of `num % size`, to fit the hashCode to my table size. I've also been told that the the command Num&sizeMinusOne is more than twice faster than `num & (size-1)`. My question is, why? And isn't the operation of creating a variable called SizeMinusOne takes time too?
