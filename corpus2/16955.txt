There have been a couple of questions about incorporating labels and equations that were typeset in $\LaTeX$ into a _Mathematica_ notebook. Ideally, this requires running `pdflatex` (or `latex`) from within _Mathematica_ and then importing the generated `PDF` document. Unfortunately, importing of `PDF` is known to be buggy, as discussed in these questions (among others, probably):   * Mathematica PDF import and fonts   * Difficulties with Importing PDFs in Mathematica   * Combine multiple PDF files into one document The last two also mention `ghostscript` as the way to solve some of the issues, in particular using the `pdfwrite` device to re-generate a new `PDF` from existing ones. This could be used in a $\LaTeX$ workflow like this (I am assuming **Mac OS X** here):               Export["words.tex", "\n\\nonstopmode       \\documentclass[12pt]{article}       \\begin{document}\n       here\\qquad we\\qquad go       \\end{document}\n       ", "Text"];          Run["pdflatex words"]          (* ==> 0 *)          Import["words.pdf"]      > `Import::general: Expected cross reference table >>` > > `Import::general: Expected cross reference table >>` > > `Import::general: Could not find document trailer >>` > > `General::stop:` As was to be expected, here we get error messages similar to what the second question referenced above saw. So now try the `ghostscript` workaround. Since this question aims at using $\LaTeX$, by assumption we have a working $\TeX$ installation which nowadays includes `ghostscript`, so the following will be able to execute:               Run["gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dNOCACHE \     -sOutputFile=words-nofont.pdf -q -dBatch -dNOPAUSE words.pdf -c quit"]          (* ==> 0 *)          Import["words-nofont.pdf"]      ![wrong spacing](http://i.stack.imgur.com/88iT7.png) But the imported `PDF` has incorrect spacings between the words. It should (as you can tell from the `\\qquad` in the source) look more like > $\text{Here}\qquad \text{we}\qquad \text{go}$ This is just a somewhat artificial example illustrating the general problem of incorrect lengths and fonts upon import of a `PDF`. So the question is, how can one fix this, either by using $\TeX$ and its companion utilities differently, or by relying only on _Mathematica_ 's capabilities? If this can be done, then it will be possible to automate the generation of $\LaTeX$ labels etc. from within _Mathematica_. I'll post my answer based on `ghostscript` below, hoping that eventually someone will come up with a fix for `PDF` import that doesn't require external software.
