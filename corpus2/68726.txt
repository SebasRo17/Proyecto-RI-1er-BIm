Based on this question. Would you consider it best practice to create a function that does the opposite of an existing function just to give it a different name. Example: If you already have bool In(string input,string[] set) which returns true if the the array set contains the string input and false otherwise, should you create a function like bool NotIn(string input,string[] set) which returns false if the string is in the set or true otherwise?
