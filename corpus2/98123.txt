> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  I cannot reach my deadline. What to do? My manager is a very deadline specific person. Even though I am a trainee, he insists on a deadline for every small assignment that he gives. Now it so happens that I miss the deadline. And boy, he doesnâ€™t like that at all! So how do I say that i missed the deadline without inviting his wrath? How to stop getting into his bad books? P.S. I am not being lazy. Just that the assignments that he gives are not easy stuff, plus I am doing it in Delphi, which is new to me.
