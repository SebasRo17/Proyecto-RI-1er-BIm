I will be looking for a job after a long break, so I need all the help I can get. Problem is, my best point in a portofolio is an unusual application, using quite unusual algorithms, that may seem simple at a glance for anyone who didn't have to design and implement them. The natural thing to do would be to describe the design and implementation details, so that any developer would be able to assess how much skill and determination it took to finish the project. But, I intent to polish the application some more and sell it. I don't want clones to appear anytime soon. The barrier to entry currently is high, but if I were to be giving hints about my implementation, then it's no longer the case. I don't believe in the honesty of recruiting developers. I have experience going to interviews and in some cases it seems like the main point of an interview was to gain information about our pipeline, used technologies and custom solutions, as opposed to hiring me :) EDIT: Not telling what the application does, or not providing a link to it won't even get me a call back for an interview. I won't be applying to companies which could be selling solution similar to mine. I'm rather worried about giving advice to individual developers on how to make a clone, without going through some dead corners and lengthy research.
