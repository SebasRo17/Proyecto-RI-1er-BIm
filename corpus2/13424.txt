I find it fairly simple keep focused on a task at hand whilst I am actively engaged on it, however, during a long compile (and our current main project can compile in 5-10 mintues on a bad day) that my focus will drift. I'll start procrastinating, check the web, talk to someone, start thinking about something else, and just generally lose my attention, and realise that the compile had finished a while back and I have lost my train of thought, or worse, a lot of time. This is hurting my productivity, and whilst it has not been mentioned by anyone, I think it's a habit I should stop. I have tried white-noise generators (brilliant whilst I have something to focus on), shutting down my web connection and the like, however, through long compiles what can I do rather than stare at the monitor? What tricks or tips can be used to keep focused without spending large amounts of your day starting at a compile in boredom, just to ensure you don't miss it finishing? Hang on, my build broke 10 minutes ago ... :) Finally, I am fairly sure this question isn't a dup of this, as as I am talking specifically about compile times, rather than waining motivation. Foosball is not an option, rather the problem :) **EDIT** People trying to gloat about their language of choice compiling faster are not really helping, nor being particularly amusing. Thanks anyway.
