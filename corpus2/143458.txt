Most of simple "group chat" systems are based on local file storage logs (e.g. _log.txt_ ). I'm developing a simple group chat (under 20 users simultaneity ) with jQuery/AJAX. So basically, client-side code loads log from server **every second**. It needs to be fast. In database system (PHP/MySQL) that would mean MySQL query every second. Is that overload for server (shared hosting)?
