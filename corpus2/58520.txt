Let $p_n$ be the sequence of prime numbers, and $s(x,n)=$ the set of integers less or equal than $x$ that are _not_ divisible by $p_1,\dots,p_n.$ I can define it as follows:               s[x_,n_]:=DeleteCases[Map[If[Total[Table[Map[If[CoprimeQ[Prime[Range[n]],a][[#]]==True,1,0]&,Range[n]],{a,1,x}],{2}][[#]]==n,Range[x][[#]],0]&,Range[x]],0]      But it is inefficient. I am sure there is a more efficient way of doing this.
