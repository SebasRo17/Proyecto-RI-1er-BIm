When I use `ColorFunction`, the appearance of my plots is ruined, changing from this ![Nice antialiased plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/y4be4.png) which has the normal smooth lines and antialiased fonts, to this ![Ugly plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BUDZm.png) in which the line for the plot has become jagged and thin, and the fonts have lost their clear appearance, and the points have become jagged and have even shifted position a bit. The latter figure is useless to me. How do I prevent this behavior? Is there a setting somewhere that I missed? Setting the "Antialiasing Quality" to "Highest Quality" in Preferences, partly remedies the problem with the line, but points, fonts, and axes still shift, as if the scale of the figure has been changed: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/sEstj.png) * * *               Manipulate[Show[       {If[showcf,          ParametricPlot[{u, Sin[u]}, {u, 0, 2 Pi},           ColorFunction -> (White &), PlotStyle -> {Thickness[.02]}], {}],        ParametricPlot[{u, Sin[u]}, {u, 0, 2 Pi}],        Graphics[{Black, PointSize[Large], Point[{Pi, 0.5}], White,           PointSize[Medium], Point[{Pi, 0.5}]}]}],      {{showcf, False, "Show ColorFunction"}, {True, False}}]
