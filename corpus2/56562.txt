So I've gotten past the technical interviews for a company, and now I'm having an interview with my potential host for an internship during the summer. What are some tips for interviews like these? I know they're not really technical, but I'm not sure what exactly they are meant to gauge. Any tips on what to say, how to show my interest in the project, questions I should ask, etc.? * * * Edit: Side question: What's a good synonym for the word "interesting" or "interested"? I find that I use those words a bit too often (e.g. "I'm definitely interested in working on the front-end!" or "Yeah, that sounds really interesting, I would love learning more about it." or "Those all sound really interesting, I'm definitely interested in all of them!", etc.)... but I can't seem to find any good synonyms. (Online sites don't really give me good synonyms.) Any ideas?
