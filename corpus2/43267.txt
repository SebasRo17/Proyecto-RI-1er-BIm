Personally I'd prefer to work on one project at a time, maintaining absolute focus on that. I find I'm at my most productive in this situation, however it's not always the way things happen in the real world. Do you prefer working on one large project, and being totally focused on that, or be working on say 3-4 small projects at once which may even be developed using different languages?
