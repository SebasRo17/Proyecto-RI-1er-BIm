So, unfortunately, I'm stuck with code where I'm doing this:               @Override     method A{         //calls private methods 1-8     }          private method 1{         //copy/pasted     }      And so on for all of the private methods. I'd have preferred if the developers of the method I'm overriding had made the private methods protected, but I can't change that now. All of these private methods have javadoc along with them - should I carry this along with the copy/pasted functions in my class and adjust them accordingly, or not waste my time since it is documented in the original file?
