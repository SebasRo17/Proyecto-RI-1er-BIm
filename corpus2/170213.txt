I'm currently planning on implementing API for HgLab and the obvious role model for me here is GitHub. My API obviously won't be an _exact_ copy due to inherent differences between Mercurial and Git and due to different tasks GitHub and HgLab solve, but similarity will be quite clear. How ethical of me will it be to copy their API to a significant extent? Is the API design copyrightable?
