Whether you learned from a University, or mentor, or what have you (I'm mainly more concerned with University/Equivalent), what did the institution do right? And what do you think they could've improved upon when learning your programming skills? I'm curious how everyone felt their institution did as far as teaching them how to become a good programmer.
