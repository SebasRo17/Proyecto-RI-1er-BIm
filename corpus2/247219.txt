I've been struggling with timezones online for a few years now. Because I've had enough of it, I want to develop a Chrome extension that leverages moment.js so I can paste in a representation of a time and it will return the time in the user's current timezone. So this is basically a GUI front-end for moment.js. I would release this for free on the Chrome web store (and I'm surprised that such a Chrome extension does not exist yet). Does the MIT license allow this?
