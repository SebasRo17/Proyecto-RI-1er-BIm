I wanted to use the base64 Python library to encode a sequence of binary digits into base 64. Would it be possible to do it without converting to a string? If not, what is the best way to do it, assuming that my string of 1/0 digits may not be an integer multiple of 8, it may even be an odd number. In addition, I have the following question: is it possible to assign a specific binary string to a variable? For example,               x = 0b00010101010     y = 0b1110000        I want x to hold the three initial zeros, and I would like to be able to concatenate these to to obtain               z = 0b000101010101110000
