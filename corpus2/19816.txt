How do I use the `::usage` tag to allow the Mathematica v9 front end to know that there are multiple ways to call an overloaded function (a function that can have different number of arguments? For example, if I sequentially run the two commands               myfunc::usage = "foo[x,y,z] will combine x, y and z for you.";     myfunc::usage = "foo[x,y,z,w] will be even better.";      The second line has overwritten the first and the front end doesn't know about both cases. A built-in example of what I'm talking about is `Table` which the front-end recognizes as having many different templates.
