I have a client that asked me to develop his Windows Application and use MS Access instead of SQL database. I did and now he asked me that he deployed the Application through several of his offices. Now he wished to have a "main Server" with all information from the "client applications" for Reporting purposes and also to update information per "client application". I proposed the idea of "EDI" through FTP, also converting the current app to connect thru SQL via WAN, but somehow he said that FTP is not an option and also WAN connection is impossible since the internet on their country is so slow that an mp3 must be downloaded for 20 minutes or so he says. Is there any other way to communicate with the other DB(MS Access) and capture data or update data as necessary without using FTP EDI exchange?
