I'm currently working on designing a small web application (MVC5) and I'm to the point of designing my database. I have the schema I want worked out and I am quite proficient in SQL Server. (I have my SQL 2012 MCSA.) I'm going to be using entity framework 6 as my ORM. I've been quite interested in the code- first approach because I'm not a big fan of designers and I like to be able to see and work with the code myself. Because my SQL skills are quite strong I am inclined to create the schema myself and write my own `CREATE TABLE` queries, etc. I feel like that gives me a lot more control over constraint and index creation. But I haven't really worked much with entity framework in the past so there may be some benefits to this that I'm missing. I know you can do code-first against an existing database in EF6 anyway, so that would be another option. I've tried googling around a bit and reading MSDN but most of the benefits seems to be that you don't need to worry about the SQL. Since that isn't a concern of mine I'm failing to see the benefit of allowing entity framework to create my schema. Are there any benefits to allowing entity framework to create my database that I'm missing?
