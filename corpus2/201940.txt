How do you opt into one software license and not the other when the distributor gives the consumer more than one choice? For example I would like to use the DataTables JavaScript library in my web application. According to their web site, "DataTables is dual licensed under the GPL v2 license or a BSD (3-point) license." Furthermore, the source code of the JavaScript library has this text **that calls out both licenses:**               /**      * @summary     DataTables      * @description Paginate, search and sort HTML tables      * @version     1.9.4      * @file        jquery.dataTables.js      * @author      Allan Jardine (www.sprymedia.co.uk)      * @contact     www.sprymedia.co.uk/contact      *      * @copyright Copyright 2008-2012 Allan Jardine, all rights reserved.      *      * This source file is free software, under either the GPL v2 license or a      * BSD style license, available at:      *   http://datatables.net/license_gpl2      *   http://datatables.net/license_bsd      *       * This source file is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but       * WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY       * or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the license files for details.      *       * For details please refer to: http://www.datatables.net      */      Finally, the web pages with the licensing text (e.g. the DataTables BSD license page) has this statement: "DataTables is made available under both the GPL v2 license and a BSD (3-point) style license. **You can select which one you wish to use** the DataTables code under." My specific question is "how do you select which one you want to use." In my case, I want to only use the BSD license and I want to make it explicitly clear that I do not opt into the GPL v2 license in any way. How do you do that **and have it hold up to legal challenge?**
