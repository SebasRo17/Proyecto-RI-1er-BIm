i am going to buy TextMate or phpStorm. Before i do it i want to ask community which one is THE choice. I am maintaining existing php+xml+html+yaml code so as developing new functionalities for same existing system. Sometimes running posture queries, or creating views. I often work with Subversion, sometimes with Git. I use very often quick open for classes and files Following i write to tell what assumptions i have and find out which of them are correct, which are not, or thoughts i am missing Unfortunately i've missed my trial time with TextMate, so i can't test it for my work **TextMate** _Why to buy_   * every developer on Mac, i see has TextMate from which i draw about some qualities   * some of mine projects are in Rails which TextMate covers too _Why not to buy_   * i am missing jump to the definition   * it seems TextMate does not have integrated version controll (changed/new lines, diff between particular versions ), but it supposed to be integrated in some of future versions (but when it is?) **phpStorm** _Why to buy_   * integrated version control   * integrated db query tool   * phpDoc      * generation     * reading (methods completion, type of variable, etc) _Why not to buy_   * price
