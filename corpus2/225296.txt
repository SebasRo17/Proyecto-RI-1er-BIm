I've recently started a new job, & I've been tasked with completing a feature that another developer didn't finish before he left the company. The existing tests are out of date (i.e useless)...technical debt everywhere. I think it would be a very bad idea to implement features without tests, I've put this across to him a few times and he keeps saying that we'll complete this feature and then I can do tests. But the previous developer didn't get around to updating the tests, so it seems that my manager just says that, but doesn't mean it and keeps pushing for more features. This latest feature is a big one, and I think it would be a really bad idea to finish it without writing tests for the whole application first. I understand that my manager has his own deadlines/pressures etc, but this feature needs to be done right, or it could come back to haunt both of us. So how can i put this across to him in a way that will sink in how important this issue is? I should also mention that I'm the sole developer, and the manager is non- technical.
