For example, say I create a notebook with a cell               a = 5 + 2      and then I close _Mathematica_ , reopen the notebook, enter a new cell               b = a*2      and evaluate the new cell with `Shift`+`Enter`. I want the output to be 14 without evaluating to evaluate the first cell. Is this posible? * * * I want this because i'm making a Stylesheet Creator and i have ColorSelectors, inputfield, etc and i want to have dafault values.
