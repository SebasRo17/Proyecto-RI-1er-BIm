I'm a junior developer and I'm supposed to be debugging this project, but the simple fact is that neither I, nor anybody else here (the only person who's worked on it just left recently) knows much about how it works. I'm frustrated because I'd like to get this done and get it off of my plate, but that's not really possible at the moment. Is this normal?
