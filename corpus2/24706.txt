In adapting some plotting functions to utilize the `PlotLegends` option of version 9, I came across the following errors:               f[x_] := Legended[Plot[Sin[t], {t, 0, Pi}], x]     f[1];     Information[f]      > `TextForm[First::first: StandardForm[Short[Shallow[HoldForm[{}], {10, 50}], > 5]] has a length of zero and no first element. >>]` This is just a toy example for a more complex situation where I can't directly use the `PlotLegends` option but have to use `Legended` explicitly. What is the best way to catch this error when a user invokes the above or types `?f` to see the code for this function. It seems the output of `Definition` works as expected (it formats the `Legended` contents, and that happens for other constructs such as `Framed` too).
