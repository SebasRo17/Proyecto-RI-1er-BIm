I'm trying to convince another group in my company— that's about to hand code off to my group—that they need to provide more documentation in their source code, but they're treating it as a "nice to have". In my view, it's a necessity. Of course, I also support intuitive naming conventions, but I think I'll have less difficulty getting the original authors to add comments than I would getting them to rename their functions and variables. I've run a source code analysis tool and it's showing about 10% comment line, but looking at the source code, most of that is coming from entire functions that the author has commented out. How can I convince my managers to enforce documentation standards on this other team? Have there been studies or work done to prove that code documentation increases profitability or productivity?
