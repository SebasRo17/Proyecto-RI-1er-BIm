I am an Electronics engineer so forgive my newbieity. Ok I want to build an `exe` file for multiple steps to be done on a windows when someone press on that file. the steps are:   * Install a media center,   * Change some data in the files of the media center,   * Install some plug ins to the media center,   * Change some setting in this media center,   * Make this media center work as shell on windows booting. The file should include:   * The media center installation files,   * The data which will be changed,   * The plug ins. I prefer to add like a unique password for every media center so it will work on this specific one only and only used for installation. Is this possible?
