here is my main question:   **What is the most common way that Java is used in web development?** The reason I ask:   I am currently in the process of finding my _first_ internship. Every employer has a separate set of languages, technologies and acronyms they want their candidates to know.   * In school I did well with Java.    * As a hobby and interest I have developed a handful of web pages widgets, scripts, etc. My university emphasized _Java_ , C and theory. My hobbies emphasize HTML, PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and a little jQuery, etc. I can't learn a dozen different technologies to satisfy most prospective employers (in what is left of the summer). I think my best bet is combine my skills with Java and my interests in web development. That brings me back to my original question: _What is the most common way that Java is used in web development?_
