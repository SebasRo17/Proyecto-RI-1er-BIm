I'm new using mathematica. I'm plotting a funcion that depends on two variables (r and C) let's say z= r^2+c^2 When I use ContourPlot, level curves are shown in a r-C plane. I'm trying to obtain the curves but in a r-Z plane and r-C Plane and if this were possible, gave a label to any curve For instance, the curves in the r-Z plane has a different behaviour when I change C Does anyone know how to do that? ? :S thanks!
