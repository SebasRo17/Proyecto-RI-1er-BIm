I am running v9 on mac pro and think that I am doing something wrong. When commenting the solution of a particular exercise I add a text cell (command 7) and type the comment which is nothing more than a sentence with some mathematical expressions (control ( - expression- control )). To change the size and color of the whole comment, I simply highlight it and Format - Size or Color - to the desired size and color. The change does not apply to whole comment! Why? (I think that is due to the expressions). For instance, if the comment is as follows > Here is an example, if $P = 1$ then the whole solution depends on the number > of ... the change applies up to $P = 1$. The rest of the sentence is unchanged. Many thanks Ed
