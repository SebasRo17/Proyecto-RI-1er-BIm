I'm visualizing some hydrogen like atomic orbitals. For looking at plane slices of the probability density, the `DensityPlot` function works well, and with something like:               Manipulate[      DensityPlot[ psi1XYsq[u, v, z], {u, -w, w}, {v, -w, w} ,       Mesh -> False, Frame -> False, PlotPoints -> 45,       ColorFunctionScaling -> True, ColorFunction -> "SunsetColors"]      , {{w, 10}, 1, 20}      , {z, 1, 20, 1}      ]      I can get a nice plot ![hybrid orbital sample plot in x y plane](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nHtMY.png) I was hoping that there was something like a `DensityPlot3D` so that I could visualize these in 3D, but I don't see such a function. I was wondering how `DensityPlot` be simulated using other plot functions, so that the same idea could be applied to a 3D plot to construct a `DensityPlot3D` like function?
