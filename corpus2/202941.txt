I find that whenever I want to go run a past project, it will take a long time before I can find it and before I have everything set-up again for it to be able to run. For example, I have python projects I created in Linux, and it depends on software packages that are easily installed in Linux, yet I no longer have the Linux VM I was using. And some of my other projects depend on other variables like web server configuration, PATH variables, sdk, IDE, OS version, device, etc. Does someone have an effective way of handling this issue? As of now I have only concerned myself with keeping the source code backed up yet **it is difficult re-establish the working development environment and it is also difficult to keep the working development environment around as well**.
