' _Cohesive classes reduce coupling_ ' So, if cohesive classes or connected classes reduce coupling (union), which piece of the puzzle is missing me? BTW, I took this sentence from an article about identifying classes before any developmemt, which I'm trying to figure out the whole sense of why, when, how to use 'that' particular classes, polymorphism, abstraction, etc. For sure I'm in the beginner stage about OOD. I have read some books but I don't understand the relationship between cohesion and coupling.
