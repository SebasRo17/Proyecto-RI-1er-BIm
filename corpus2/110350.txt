I'm finishing my last year of school while working full time and currently, I have a job that's completely unrelated to programming (student job to pay the bills...). I'm trying to find a job as a programmer (or website developer) or in a related field to get some experience. So far, I've seen companies that hire students part-time and I tried going there, but they always ask me for a portfolio of some kind to show my work and what I can do. The problem is most of my projects so far have been for school work, so they're not really impressive. The other projects are for my current job to help my fellow coworkers accomplish some tasks more easily or so they can be able to accomplish my current tasks when I'm gone. This would be a great project to show, but it's not done yet since I'm always adding new functionalities and I don't really feel like it's a good idea to show something that's not polished enough as a project I'm proud of. So I end up with nothing to show future employers and they don't call back for an interview or anything. I'd like to know what kind of projects are good to add to a portfolio to show future employers. I know it depends on where I'm applying and what that corporation does, but I'd like to have multiple different projects to show I can learn quickly and that I'm versatile. I know Python, Java, C++, Javascript, PHP, Oracle and MySQL the most, but I can pick up other languages and be functionnal with them very quickly. I'm asking because I don't want to end up spending a lot of time on projects that will end up not being a good way to show what I can do. I'm trying to plan my future the best I can.
