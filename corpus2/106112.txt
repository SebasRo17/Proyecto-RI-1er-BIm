I wanted to name this topic as "Education vs. Experience", but this topic already exists. I've read that discussion and though what I'd like to ask is related with that topic, the question is quite different. I've started learning programming about 12 years ago. For the last 4 years I'm working as developer in software outsourcing (located in Russia). I'm thinking about leaving Russia and moving somewhere else like Australia (doesn't matter basically). I have a number of examples illustrating the general ability and success stories, but still there's a difference between all these people and my case. I have quite a good technical experience - primary areas are C++ and .NET. I have already participated in 7 projects based on different technologies/platforms (Windows, Linux, Android, Qt, .NET, etc). So, I believe, _I'm capable_ of working as a software developer. Let's just take it - "from technical standpoint, this guy is absolutely OK". The only problem is, I don't have any education. So, here's the question: **In most cases, may I read words like "BS in CS, equivalent, or better" as "N years of experience"?** **Update** : Is there a sense in getting certificates like MCSD (for .NET)? I know there's a separate topic for this question, but still asking for the case when there's no education but there are certificates and experience.
