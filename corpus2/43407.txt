Local variables in `Module` are no longer specially colored for me, but other syntax coloring remains, for example iterators in a `Table`: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/efW6M.png) What causes this? How can I restore the original syntax coloring behavior? The altered behavior has persisted across hundreds of rebootings and new notebooks. And the preference for "local variables of Module and With" is correctly set, but shows the incorrect behavior in the example: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cMz1v.png) Resetting to defaults does not restore order. Changing the color to something different also has no effect. Restarting after clearing the `init.m` file using:               RenameFile["~/Library/Mathematica/FrontEnd/init.m", "~/Library/Mathematica/FrontEnd/init.m_Backup"]      also does not change the behavior.
