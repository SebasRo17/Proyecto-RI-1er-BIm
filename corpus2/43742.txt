I have two matrices A1 and A2 in HDF format. I use the following code to import them.               A1 = Import[       "http://www.math.mtu.edu/~struther/Courses/4610/Data/A1.hdf", "Data"];`      When I type `Dimensions[A1]` I get the output > >     {1, 12, 10} >   Now, I want to do the Singular Value Decomposition on `A1` and reconstruct it from the output matrices. I can do the SVD, but when I check the original and reconstructed matrix by inputting `A1 - U.W.Transpose[V]`, I get a shape not matching error. Also, when I see `A1` in `MatrixForm`, I see a matrix with each column as a separate vector(column matrix) inside the big matrix.               {U, W, V} = SingularValueDecomposition[A1];     Norm[A11 - U.W.Transpose[V], 2]               Here's a screenshot of A1 in MatrixForm      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tdgs1.png) I can't figure out why there are separate columns inside the matrix. Also there are 10 rows and 12 columns, but `Dimensions[A1]` outputs > >     {1, 12, 10} >   Any help would be greatly appreciated.
