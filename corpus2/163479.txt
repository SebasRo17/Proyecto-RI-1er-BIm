We've all probably met someone like this, that developer who just _knows_ that his language is the one true language and won't shut up about it. How do you deal like someone like this? I don't want to offend anyone (especially since the fanboy in my workplace is the senior developer). But I want to be able to use my own choice of scripting language when I have to write a throwaway script that never makes it to the repository and no one else need know existed. Thoughts that I had to dealing with this:   1. Laugh it off - "Haha yeah maybe language X is a bit easier, I guess I'm a masochist!"   2. Go with it - I'd really prefer to avoid this as I can't afford the drop in productivity associated with picking up a new language.   3. Hide my language - Become a closet programmer and hide my monitor whenever I'm scripting or automating something. What would you suggest for this situation?
