I know that outside of aggregates I can't change anything inside an aggregate without passing by his root. That said I would like to know if an aggregate root can hold references of members (objects insides) of another aggregate root? (following DDD rules) Example : a **Calendar** contain a list of **phases** which contain a list of **sequences** which contain a list of **assignations** Calendar is root because phases and sequences and assignations only work in context of a calendar. You also have **Students** and **Groups** of student (called groups) It is possible (following DDD rules) to make Groups holding references of **assignations** or it need to pass by the root for accessing groups from assignations ? Thanks.
