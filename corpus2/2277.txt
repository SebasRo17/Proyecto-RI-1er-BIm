In the answer to Bold face formatting for vectors instead of overarrows like latex \mathbf{}? was a nice method of specifying the visual display for a variable, so that I can do something like the following to generate display output for vectors in the way that I want it:               Clear[vecX]     Format[boldVector[v_]] := Style[HoldForm[v], FontFamily -> "Arial Black"]     vecX := boldVector[x]     Abs[vecX - vecX'] // TraditionalForm      Is there a way to specify how text in copy-as Latex should appear? For example, if I could do copy-as latex and have `vecX` above show up as `\vecX`, then I can have my latex macros deal with the formatting in that context:               \newcommand{\vecX}[0]{\mathbf{x}}
