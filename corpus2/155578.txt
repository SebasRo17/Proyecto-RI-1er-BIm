Justed stumbled across CRaSH and although it looks mighty interesting, I'm wondering why a Java developer should invest time & energy into learning (yet another) shell language. What sort of standard- and cool-applications can CRaSH be used for? Is this like a Groovy-version of Jython? I guess, when the dust settles, I'm looking for CRaSH's "wow" factors. I'm sure they're there, but after spending ~20 minutes perusing the documentation I'm just not seeing them. Thanks in advance!
