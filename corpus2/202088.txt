I've been practicing behaviour driven development (BDD). I understand that you have to write tests that test the behaviour of the code, and this will allow the design of your code to evolve and take shape. When doing BDD and I find I need to refactor my code into a better design, and that refactor happens to involve extracting some code into a new class, when do I start writing tests for that new class? Or are tests not needed for that class at all since it's a implementation detail and the behaviour of it should already be tested with the existing test coverage?
