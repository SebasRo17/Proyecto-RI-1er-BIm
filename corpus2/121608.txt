I have been writing an open standard for a protocol I am developing. As far as writing concerns I have it under control. But the main question is where can I publish such document. I have been searching on the internet and didn't find such site where I could upload a TXT or PDF file. I have no intention of keeping secrets and I would like people to read this and if possible make protocol better.
