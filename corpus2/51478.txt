I am working with database using OpenSQLConnection-JDBC. I am able to fetch the data perfectly from the tables but I cannot get nor the names of the tables (using SQLTableNames) neither the column names (using SQLColumnNames). I tried also to work with the help examples; but I got same problem. what could be the reason?               conn = OpenSQLConnection[        JDBC["MySQL(Connector/J)",         "IP/databasename"],        "Username" -> "username", "Password" -> "password"]          eventsdata = SQLSelect[       conn, "tablename",       SQLColumn["columnname"] == somevalue]      where: IP= Ip address of the database, databasename=database name that I am connecting to, tablename=table name which I have it before, columnname=columns names of the table that I have it before, somevalue=value so that I can fetch some of the data.
