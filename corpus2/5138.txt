Note that this is not a duplicate of the question over there. That one asks for a given point, while I'm asking about the lexical structure (which, of course, is not directly related to any point in the final graphics). What I want to know is whether there's a way to access the currently set colour. For example, let's assume I write the following function:               mydisk[p_,r_]:={EdgeForm[Darker[CurrentColor]],Disk[p,r]}      and then use it like this:               Graphics[{Red, mydisk[{0,0},1], Green, mydisk[{1,1},1]}]      it should be equivalent to               Graphics[{Red, {EdgeForm[Darker[Red]], Disk[{0,0},1]},               Green, {EdgeForm[Darker[Green]], Disk[{1,1},1]}}]      Is this possible, and if so, what would I write in the place of `CurrentColor`?
