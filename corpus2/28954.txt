I have the following integrand:               int = Sin[Sqrt[-g^2 + omega^2]*(t - tp)]*Exp[-g*(t - tp)]*A*Exp[-(tp - t0)^2/sigma^2]*Cos[Omega*tp]/Sqrt[-g^2 + omega^2]      and am trying to integrate it with:               Integrate[int, {tp, 0, t}, Assumptions -> {g > 0, omega > 0, Omega > 0, A > 0, sigma > 0, t > 0, t0>0}]      but _Mathematica_ is not able to do it (I have tried to do this with no assumptions as well). Maple does the integration in under a second and returns a solution (which can be expressed in terms of the Erf functions). Is there a way to help _Mathematica_ calculate this integral? ... and just to note, the result of the integration is a solution of damped harmonic oscillator, driven by a force:               A*Exp[-(t - t0)^2/sigma^2]*Cos[Omega*t]
