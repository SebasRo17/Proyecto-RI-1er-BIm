I am modeling an eye and am using `TurboPlot` and `DrawSystem`. I would like to export the graph, but using the `Move` function which returns a `Graphics`. When execute `Show[Graphics[%]]` I just get a graph, without the object and when I export get the following error: > >     Show::gtype: Optical System is not a type of graphic, >   And this leads me to the questions: **1)** Is there an alternative to the `Move` function, or similar to `Move`, which gives an option to `Export` a graph? **2)** Is there a function that will let me `Export` a graph even with the function `Move`?               colorscreen = CustomDeflections[Screen[0.9], Function[Ray[WaveLength -> .45]],                      AddTo -> ChangedRay];          myplot = DrawSystem[{ConeOfRays[20, NumberOfRays -> 7],         RefractiveIndex [1.5], Polarization [45],          Ray [WaveLength -> .45, AddTo -> NewRay],         Move[SphericalLens[{rr1, 5}, {rr2, -5}, 3, 0.5], {x, 5}, SaveDefinitions -> True],         Move[PinHole[0.5, 1.5], 7],         Boundary[{0, -4, -4}, {15, 4, 4}],         Move [Screen[5, " "], 15],         Move[Screen [1.5], 5], ColorView -> Long [Intensity],          Frame -> True, FrameTicks -> Automatic, SaveDefinitions -> True}];           Show[Graphics[%]]      > >     Move::pattern: The pattern HoldForm[colorscreen,1] is not recognized by > Move. >                  Export["myplot.jpg", myplot]
