I've been interning at a place where my manager believes that if you are in a,   * _product company_ , then you generally spend time tweaking the product and sometimes adding some features, or   * _service company_ , then you keep doing repetitive things which makes me feel industry is no place for someone who likes to do create news things and solve difficult problems. So is the industry not a place for a passionate programmer? Does this change from country to country? * * * **Update to clear some things that can be understood differently than what they were meant.** Tweaking here is making sure your product has tables with the number of rows and columns the client wants, etc. Customize it for the customer. New "feature" isn't new functionality here. Just aesthetic-level changes. And it's sometimes. I'm not sure what he meant by repetitive though. He was like, you have to make the UI again and again every time. (I see no repetition there though. If a different UI is needed then a _different_ UI needs to be designed. If you can use the old one then you don't need to do much anyway.)
