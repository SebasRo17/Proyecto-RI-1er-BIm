I have the following finite difference operator: $$ Lu_{ijk}:= du_{ijk} +c(u_{i-1,j,k} + u_{i+1,j,k} + u_{i,j-1,k} + u_{i,j+1,k} + u_{i,j,k-1} + u_{i,j,k+1})\\ -u_{i-1,j+1,k}-u_{i-1,j-1,k} - u_{i-1,j,k-1} - u_{i-1,j,k+1} \\ -u_{i+1,j+1,k}-u_{i+1,j-1,k} - u_{i+1,j,k-1} - u_{i+1,j,k+1} \\ - u_{i,j+1,k-1} - u_{i,j-1,k-1} - u_{i, j+1,k+1} - u_{i,j-1,k+1}, $$ where $d$ and $c$ are known constants. This is way too complex of an expression to expect people to understand, so I want to represent it by a stencil: ![5-point stencil](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WIo79.png) For example, I'd put a sphere of one color (representing $du_{ijk}$) at the origin, a sphere of another color at $(-1,0,0)$, (representing $cu_{i-1,j,k}$), and so on, and finally spheres of a final color at $(-1,1,0)$ (representing $-u_{i-1,j+1,k}$). My preliminary _Mathematica_ commands are:               Graphics3D[{Specularity[White, 10], Red, Sphere[{0, 0, 0}],                 Blue, Sphere[{0, 0, 1}], Sphere[{1, 0, 0}], Sphere[{-1, 0, 0}],                 Sphere[{0, -1, 0}], Sphere[{0, 0, -1}],                 Green, Sphere[{1, 1, 0}], Sphere[{1, 0, 1}]}, Boxed -> False]      but these spheres are way too big and cover each other up. How can this be fixed?
