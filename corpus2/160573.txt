What does the `=>` mean in Perl?               my $CreateArray = [     objectClass => [ "top", "person", "organizationalPerson", "inetOrgPerson" ],     cn => "Jane User",     uid => "0000001",     sn => "User",     mail => "JaneUser@mycompany.com"     ];      produces               CreateArray:     0  'objectClass'     1  ARRAY(0x104ef40)       0  'top'       1  'person'       2  'organizationalPerson'       3  'inetOrgPerson'     2  'cn'     3  'Jane User'     4  'uid'     5  0000001     6  'sn'     7  'User'     8  'mail'     9  'JaneUser@mycompany.com'      It seems that even numbers are keys and odd numbers are values. Why don't they use hashes? Because they aren't ordered? Is there a name for this strange structure? Thank you.
