I have created a Monopoly game with a 2D Graphics in Java for my final exam at college. I feel that the game doesn't look very good and I want to add a 3D Graphics. My problem is that I have never done 3D programming and I don't know how to create 3D objects. Can someone tell me where can I create 3D objects and what library to use for 3D programming that will allow me to create a 3D graphic interface fast? I have only two more weeks to do this. Can this be done?
