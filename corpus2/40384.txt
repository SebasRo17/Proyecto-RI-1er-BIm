In[1] := Hold[a.b] // FullForm     Out[1] := Hold[Dot[a,b]]      So far so good.                In[2] := Hold[a_.b_] // FullForm     Out[2] := Hold[Times[Optional[Pattern[a,Blank[]]],Pattern[b,Blank[]]]]      Why does the Dot become Times? I have a feeling it has something to do with the Optional that also appears, but I can't find anything that explains what's going on in the documentation.
