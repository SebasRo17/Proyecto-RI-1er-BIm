> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Hiring developers - listing IDE as a requirement? I've seen this from time to time, that people tend to mention editors in their resume/CV and I've been guilty of doing the same thing(although with IDE's). Is this in any way interesting for the employer, or is it maybe even regarded as something naive and negative? EDIT: I found this question which mentions a few reasons why maybe listing IDE's would be reasonable. Maybe this question should be closed.
