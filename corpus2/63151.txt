We are changing how we manage low priority admin, support and development tasks. The plan is to have a 'Stack' of tasks, which anyone can pick up if/when they are light on work. We would like a tool to make it easy to find tasks, check them out and work on them as well as creating and prioritising them. We could do this at a simple level using a custom sharepoint list, as we have that available, and it fits in pretty well with our environment but has anyone got any experience of using any third party tools for this? It is somewhat similar to a standard ticketing system, so I guess we could look at things like Bugzilla, but I don't have any experience in such things (Our incident management system we use in hosue isn't really fit for the job). has anyone used one in this way? Or any other tool suggestions would be welcome.
