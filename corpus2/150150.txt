In a project where I'm working on the data access layer I'm trying to make a decision how to send data and objects to the next layer (and programmer). Is it better to tell him to   1. reference my dll, OR   2. should I build a generic handler and let him take the objects from there (i.e. json format) If I understand correctly, In case of 2. he would have to handle the objects on his own, whereas in case 1. he will have the entities I've built. Note: It is very probable that other people would need to take the same data, though, we're not up to that yet. Same question here - should I make it into a webservice, or have them access the handler?
