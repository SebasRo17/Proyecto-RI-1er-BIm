Most programmers are not designers; at least that is what I hear a lot. I consider my design skills to be on par with my programming skills, although I prefer programming if I had to choose one. I feel like that could be a great advantage, but I don't know how to use it to my advantage when searching for a job. It seems either people are looking for a designer or they are looking for a programmer. Its hard to find someone who is looking for someone who is _both_. This may be because someone who is both is either too rare, or not actually desired. If it is indeed a desirable combination, then how do I use it to market myself?
