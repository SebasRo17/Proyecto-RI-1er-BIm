We've been having constant requirement changes of having to choose which graphic rendering library to use for our project. In a team of about 10 members, two of us are exploring the new graphic library. The team lead expects that we learn what's necessary within 2 days and introduce it to the rest of the team ( _wants the two of us to give a value-add to the other teams by introducing it to them so they won't be lost_ ). We've told him that 2 days is ridiculous, so he asked us to give him our plan. We've already lost a few months in exploring some other graphic libraries, so the project is behind schedule. The other team members are developing algorithms that will make calls to the graphic library. They'll have to write some code using the graphic library too. In such a situation, what is a good way to share knowledge?   * Have brainstorming sessions everyday for an hour where they tell us their algorithm interfaces and we tell them the graphic library interfaces which they can use?   * Give them a short overview of the skeleton of how their interfaces would fit in with ours and let them figure out the graphic library code for themselves?   * Any other ways?
