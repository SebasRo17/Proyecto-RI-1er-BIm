If you enter the following into Wolfram | Alpha, you get nice graphs:               graph 4 x^4 + y^2 = 2       ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/LG0sb.png) How do you do this in _Mathmatica_? I realize that these are not functions, because the graphs do not pass the straight line test. But what does Wolfram Alpha do to put these things into something that _Mathematica_ can understand?
