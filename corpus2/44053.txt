I'trying to do an embarrassingly simple linear programming problem, and being a total Mathematica and maths analphabet I'm stuck. The problem is to optimize (maximize) the function $1.2x+y$, with constraints: $$ 10x+12y\leq1920 \\ 5x+3y\leq780 \\ x,y\geq0 $$ Doing it by hand, or like this:               Maximize[{1.2 x + y, 10 x + 12 y <= 1920 && 5 x + 3 y <= 780 && x >= 0 && y >= 0}, {x, y}]      I get the correct answer of $x=120,y=60$. But when I try to calculate it using `LinearProgramming`, like this:               LinearProgramming[      {1.2, 1},      {{10, 12}, {5, 3}},      {{1920, -1}, {780, -1}},      {{0, Infinity}, {0, Infinity}}]      I get $x=0,y=0$ as an answer. I've been staring at the `LinearProgramming` documentation for an hour and can't find the error. If I switch from `{{1920, -1}, {780, -1}}` to `{{1920, 1}, {780, 1}}` it gives the correct answer, but according to the docs it's then testing for $\geq$, and not for $\leq$, as my problem states. Any idea what am I doing wrong here? Thanks...
