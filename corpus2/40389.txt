I'm building a Model-View-Controller framework, and it has come time to decide how I will be creating and using view templates and layouts. Some frameworks use special extensions for these files. CakePHP uses `.ctp`. I have heard-of/seen `.tpl` files, though I've never used them myself. There is the `.inc` extension, which doesn't feel right, and of course, I could stick with plaon ol' `.php`. For that matter why not `.awesome`? What do you use for your template files? Is there any benefit to using a special file extension for these files? Are you partial to a certain extension for nostalgia or convention alone? They're typically (and will be in my project) already in their own directory, so I assume there must be _some_ reason they are differentiated by their extension in projects like CakePHP.
