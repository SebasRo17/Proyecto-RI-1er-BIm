Software development today isn't evidence-based. That is, we don't really choose technologies and practices based on the outcome of research studies the way (we hope!) they do in, say, medicine. As an example, there was a study published in early 2011 in the Journal of the American Medical Association that suggested removing lymph nodes of breast cancer patients does not improve survival rates, which had an immediate impact on surgical practice. Imagine you found yourself reading a paper about a software engineering study which suggested that a software practice or technology that you currently use did not actually have the benefit you thought it did: i.e., this study was in contradiction with your personal experience. Assuming that the paper was published in a reputable venue that you trusted, what properties would the study need to have for you to actually change your practices based on the result?
