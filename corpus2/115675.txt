Very short introduction (this is quite a context-heavy question): I'm a 17 year old script kiddo/programmer, doing some projects, usually netting around 20 files of 200 lines each. I usually don't program very low- level, more high-level with battery included API's like Python + pygame and Lua + WoW API. Nevertheless I've written quite some code in the lower levels of the computer too (mostly C/C++). Now, I read **a lot** of programmer discussion and a common returning argument is _preventing pesky bugs_ , for example in "reusing variable names". I always nodded and thought that it was a valid argument, but just now I wondered, how valid is it? To be honest, after thinking for a while, I figured I have no idea what they mean with _pesky bugs_. We all heard stories about phenomenal impossible-to- debug bugs, we all have spent useless evenings on that one annoying bug, but apart from a few cases I have never been busy with a programming-related bug for longer than a few hours. Though on the other hand, the projects I work(ed) on aren't huge 10 million line projects like the linux kernel, and are quite simple... scripts. I have a good understanding of them (or at least my part in collaborations) and are not very error-prone. So I'm wondering, do these pesky bugs occur exponentially more as the amount of code increases, or ...?
