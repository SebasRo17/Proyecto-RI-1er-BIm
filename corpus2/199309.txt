I've read a lot o blogs arguing about private methods and testing. Some people say you should not test private methods, they say you should make them public or put those methods in a new class. But then, what about encapsulation? let's say:   1. I have this method which is simple enough for not being part of a new class, and    2. It can be useful only for internal stuff, so there's not a good reason to make it public. My general rule about methods being public or private is simple, if it's useful outside it's public, if it's useful just inside then it's private. Am I missing something with this logic?
