So, I've been developing some analytic software at my work and also have started to take more notice to analytics in general. For instance, I recently installed Google Analytics on my blog(which is custom and open source). I mostly make open source software outside of work, so I think it might be cool to be capable of gathering some form of usage data and such on how my tools are used, opt-in only of course. However, this seems to almost never be done. Why? What's with the taboo of analytics in open source software?
