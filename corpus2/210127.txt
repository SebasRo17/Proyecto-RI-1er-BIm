I'm writing a library. It's a completely rewritten version of another one, to suit my needs (PCL compatibility, mainly). However, the API will be completely rewritten, as I'll need to change a lot of stuff around for PCL compliance. Also, as it is a rewrite, I won't be able to just start from the library and just change it bit by bit, as I typically see with forks. I tried that, but it just didn't work. So what should I do? Should I fork here or should I make a new library?
