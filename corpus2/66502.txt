In a typical software development environment, **project closures** mark the end of a project.   1. Project records are completed and archived,    2. resources released,    3. issues and lessons are documented, and    4. a formal dinner/party held for celebration.  Last step is optional, though is very motivating for participants. :-) Contrast this with Scrum. I know that scrum runs on **stories from backlogs**. So, technically, every iteration closes certain stories. So, there are two questions here.   1. For a group that works on **multiple simultaneous projects** , how do project closures fit in?    2. For a project that involves **multiple groups** , how does this concept apply? Or, does project closure term not apply to **T &M projects** at all?
