I've been wondering about code reviews recently, based on how many questions I've seen on here talking about them. Between my internships, contracts, and full time jobs, I've worked for six different companies, and only one of them has done code reviews. At the last two places I've worked, code was good (or at least good enough) if all the unit tests passed, and it got the stamp of approval from our tester. We were all compotent programmers, so if the code worked, we were happy. Now, there were a handful of times where something came up months or years down the line that might have been caught in a review, but they were so few and far between that I'm not sure it'd be useful. I guess my question is:   1. Do you consider reviews to be useful?   2. How often do you do them?   3. How much of your time is spent reviewing code?
