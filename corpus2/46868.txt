**I want to know the velocity of point $p$, given that I know the coordinate.** $p_x=L_1\cos(\theta1)+L_2\cos(\theta1+\theta2)$ I calculate $\frac{dp_x}{dt}$ to achieve the velocity of point $p$ about the $x$ coordinate. My trial as below:               px[t] = L1 Cos[θ1[t]] + L2 Cos[θ1[t] + θ2[t]];      Now I'd like to give the variable some value, $\theta_1=t^2,\theta_2=t^3,L_1=2,L_2=3$               D[px[t], t] /. {θ1[t] -> t^2, θ2[t] -> t^3, L1 -> 2, L2 -> 3}      However, _Mathematica_ gives the result: > >     -2 Sin[t^2] [θ1'[t] - 3 Sin[t^2 + t^3] ([θ1'[t] + [θ2'[t]) >   It doesn't evaluate `\\[Theta]1]'[t]` and `\\[Theta]1'[t]` to $2t ,3t^2$, respectively. So I use the command `FullForm`               θ1[t] // FullForm      > >     Derivative[1][θ1][t] >   **So my question is why is it that _Mathematica_ cannot do the full evaluation and how to fix it?** ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zEBiQ.jpg)
