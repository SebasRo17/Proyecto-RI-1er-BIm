I am trying to use the `Animate` command to vary a parameter of the Lorenz Equations in 3-D phase space and I'm not having much luck. The equations are: > $\begin{align*} \dot{x} &= \sigma(y-x)\\\ \dot{y} &= rx-y-xz\\\ \dot{z} &= > xy-bz \end{align*}$ Where $\sigma, r, b > 0$ are parameters to be varied. Insofar, I am using the `NDSolve` command to numerically integrate these equations, then `ParametricPlot3D` and the `Evaluate` command to plot them. Just for starters, I am trying to create an animate command to vary $\sigma$ for example from 0 to 10. Can anyone guide me in the right direction? My code looks like this so far: * * *               σ = 10;          NDSolve[{x'[t] == σ (y[t] - x[t]),               y'[t] == 28 x[t] - y[t] - x[t] z[t], z'[t] == x[t] y[t] - 8/3 z[t],               x[0] == z[0] == 0, y[0] == 2}, {x, y, z}, {t, 0, 25}]          Animate[ParametricPlot3D[       Evaluate[{x[t], y[t], z[t]} /. solution], {t, 0, 25}], {σ, 0, 25},       AnimationRunning -> False]      * * * This will generate an animated plot but obviously as `σ` varies, nothing is changing since I am not implementing new `NDSolve` commands. Can anyone guide me as to how I can implement successive `NDSolve`'s inside the animate command? Thank you EDIT: I am using $r=28$ and $b=\frac83$ in place of `r` and `b` in my code.
