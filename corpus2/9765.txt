Sorry if this question is too basic -- I'm not very familiar with Mathematica. I am interested in a way to systematically address the following sort of problem: Suppose that $u=u(x,y)$ is a function of two variables on $\mathbb{R}^2$ that satisfies a Liouville type equation: $$\Delta u= e^{-2u}$$. I can check by hand that the function $$v=\partial^2_{xy} u+\partial_x u \cdot \partial_y u$$ is harmonic, i.e. $$\Delta v=0.$$ My question is how can I make Mathematica verify this? I'm interested in more complicated examples I don't want to check by hand, but the principle is the same.
