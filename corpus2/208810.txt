Consider having restricted man resources and thinking about using Xamarin studio for building cross platform application. Will you be afraid of Apple trying to ban all applications NOT developed by xCode? I mean in future. It is obviously not banned now. I am just asking this because I heard this on a meeting today as argument of not using Xamarin studio. I am not an expert in this area but very curious because it sounds odd. The application should be banned because of some kind of generated code which is always there when building app using Xamarin.
