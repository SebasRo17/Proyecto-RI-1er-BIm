I have data in the form of x, y, vx, vy where vx and vy are components of the velocity vector at point x,y. I want to plot a contourplot of this. How can I do that since contourplot asks for three values?               testBC = Import["...test.dat", "Table", "IgnoreEmptyLines" -> True];     testBCx = testBC[[All, 1]];     testBCy = testBC[[All, 2]];     ux = testBC[[All, 3]];     uy = testBC[[All, 4]];     u = Transpose[{ux, uy}];     testbdry = Transpose[{testBCx, testBCy}];     ListContourPlot[testbdry, u]      I am not sure which one is right, ContourPlot or ListContourplot. I am trying to look for something that provides "heat plotting"
