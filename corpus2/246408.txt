I have someone who wants me to develop a game for them. I do not intend to continue developing the game after its first release (he wants me to develop it for commercial use). To make the project easy, I was thinking of using the Unity game engine. I am going to say right now, I am a kid heading into college, he wants to pay me, but I don't want to be paid, and this is for his own personal business endeavor, I am afraid if I hand off this project to a more established professional, even if I use source control, he will disregard it, throw it away, and the part I am most afraid of tell him I did a cruddy or lazy job (because I used Unity). What are your opinions on this situation, and the use of Unity in this way?
