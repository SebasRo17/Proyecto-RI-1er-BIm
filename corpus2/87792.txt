So I created an HTML5/Javascript online game. I host it on my website for anyone to play for free. I am still currently working on it. Do I need to license my game? And if so, what license do you recommend? I was looking at some open source licenses like GPLv3, but i'm not sure if I even need a license? **If I need a license** , I need one that allows:   * my game to be totally free **to play**   * my game to be embedded on other websites   * no one else can re-distribute my game, unless it is under my name and not theirs Also, if I need a license, where do I include it? Do I just have to state somewhere that the game is licensed under "xxxxx license"? Or do I have to include a link to the license file hosted on my server? OR even include the license file in my game (i.e. in the games javascript file, or under a game menu, etc.)?
