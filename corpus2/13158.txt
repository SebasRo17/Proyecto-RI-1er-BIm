This is kind of a continuation of this question. I want to automate these 2 steps on _Mathematica_ once I give an integer $N$.   * generate a list of variables $\{a_i\}_{i=1}^{i=N}$   * then for some function like $f(x) = e^{x}$ or $f(x) = \sin^2(x)$ compute an expression like $\prod\limits_{i \neq j} f(a_i - a_j)$ or $\sum\limits_{i < j} f(a_i - a_j)$ or $\prod\limits_ {i,j} f(a_i - a_j)$ ( - and then hopefully integrate such expressions over all $a_i$...) I am having to type these expressions by hand for every $N$ and that is very hard once $N$ gets large (one would typically have $\binom{N}{2}$ terms to type by hand!) I would like to know how this can be automated - since I would typically need to to use large $N$. (...also, help with that previous question would be great!)
