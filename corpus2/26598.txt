In my HTML form I have 3 buttons. Each button calls different `.mx` files, based upon an `.mx file data`. `listplot` will be created in another `jsp` page. I placed all `.mx` files under `WEB-INF/Applications`. I wrote 3 functions in Javascript. Inside these functions I wrote the _webMathematica_ code between `<msp:evaluate>`tags. However the code doesn't seem to be working inside a Javascript function. I wrote the functions in the following way:               function button1()         {             <msp:evaluate>                 Get["Data/first.mx"];                 mxData=first;             </msp:evaluate>             var id=document.getElementById("name");             id.action="second.jsp";             id.submit();         }      I called this function in the following way:                <input type="button" value="Button1" onclick="button1()"/>
