I have to develop a real estate marketing CRM software for my client - where the application is installed on desktop but can also be accessed from web. 2 reasons why they want the application to run from desktop :   1. So that it can work with/without internet connection   2. They don't want their complete data to be online  They want to access few of the data like property listing & inquiries (managed from desktop application) from their website through secure login & password. The data that is entered in desktop application should be automatically synchronized with the website application. I was wondering if there is a way to develop this kind of software using PHP & MySQL. If yes, it will be great if anyone can provide me the referral link.Else please suggest, which language should I use.
