What is a good way to name a method that checks if X needs to be done, and does X it if necessary? For example, how to name a method that updates a user list if new users have logged in? `UpdateListIfNeeded` seems too long, while simple `UpdateList` implies a possibly expensive and unnecessary operation is done every time. `EnsureListUpdated` is a variant as well. C# has a `bool TryXXX(args, out result)` pattern (e.g. `int.TryParse(str, out num)`) to check if X is **possible** and do it, but that is subtly different.
