Let $s_a$ and $s_b$ be two strings over a $q$-ary alphabet. For each character $(c_1,...c_q)$ in the alphabet, I'd like to return a pair of values $(r,k)$ where $r$ represents the count for the character in $s_a$ and $k$ represents the number of instances where this character is in the same position in $s_a$ and $s_b$. For example, if we have two binary strings:               sa="00011001";     sb="11001001";      For the character $0$, we'd return the value $(r_0,k_0) = (5,3)$. For the character $1$, we'd return $(r_1,k_1) = (3,2)$. What is the fastest way to carry out these string operations? Should we be using arrays instead of strings?
