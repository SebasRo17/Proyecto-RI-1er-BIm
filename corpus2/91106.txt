From last one week i was searching for most suitable architecture for a **new web application**. To be honest i did web development for only 1 year (back in 2007). And from last four years i am working in C++. Now, suddenly i am assigned a task to search for best architecture for a new web application. During my search i cam across following 3 options:   * Model View Controller   * Model view Presenter   * 3 Tier Archi (Presentation layer <\--> BLL <\--> DAL) # What we are going to Develop We are targeting towards the development of a social web application like facebook, twitter etc. Once we have launched the web version then we move towards the **mobile edition** of same application # What we will use We will use ASP.net and C# under framework 4.0 # Why I Post Question? To be honest, i don't have experience either in web development or mobile application development, so the major purpose of posting this question is to get hep from some experienced developers/architects. # My Question: I am looking for such an architecture that first allow me to start with web version and then allow me to provide mobile edition with less effort. With less effort i mean to say that I only want to develop two UI Layer two times (One for web and one for Mobile). I want my Business logic and data access layers remain same for both UI layers. Please help me in chossing appropriate pattern for above application. # What i did so far at my own? I read all above 3 architectural patterns in details and have basic understanding of all three but still unable to choose appropriate pattern for me, secondly i didn't find any more patterns so if there are some more please share their names only
