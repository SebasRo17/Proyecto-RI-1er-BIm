I have numerous personal projects I've begun and never seem to finish because I get sidetracked with other ideas. I was wondering what the best method to get personal projects done is? Any tricks or tips to it? The problem is I get a spurt of inspiration on some projects, and I don't wanna lose track of my ideas and right now my method of "saving my ideas" is to just get as much stuff done on the ideas as possible in one night and then store some GitHub issues as to dos. I find that this makes me never get back to older projects tho.
