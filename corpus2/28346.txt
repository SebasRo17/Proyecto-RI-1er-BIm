We are in the process of building a web application for a client and they have inquired about owning the code for the site. We would like to issue a license agreement to the client for use of the code if we for any reason we are no longer working on the project. We would like to have ownership of the code but allow them use wherever they see fit, the only limitation we would like to have is the sale of the code. The are a company with several employees and will only be using the application within their company. What would such a license agreement look like?
