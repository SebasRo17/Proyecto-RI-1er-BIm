For about eight months I managed a development team doing a re-write of a web based application. During this time, I was focused on many aspects of the project that did not involve directly writing code, even though by trade that's what I started out as. Recently the number of developers assigned to the project has dropped and I am now forced to drop back into a developer/management role. Since that time I have found that it's very difficult to focus on a feature and get it completed while at the same time trying to stay ahead of the other developers and make sure that we're keeping on track. My questions is this: can you successfully keep managing a project when you are forced back into development?
