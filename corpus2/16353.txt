Is there a way to extract the coordinates of a box directly?               sty[list_] :=       Framed[Style[list, Medium, 12, FontFamily -> "Arial",         Background -> White]]          listy[list_, place_] := Text[sty[Grid[list]], place]          Manipulate[      Graphics[       If[d < .675,        {         listy[{{2, 12, 7}}, {d, 0}],         listy[{{5, 7}}, {2 - d, 0}]         },        {         listy[{{2, 12, 7, 5, 7}}, {.93, 0}]         }        ],       PlotRange -> {{-.5, 2.5}, {-.2, .2}},       ImageSize -> 200,       AspectRatio -> Automatic       ],      {{d, .6, ""}, .6, .77},      ControlPlacement -> Bottom,      Paneled -> False, SaveDefinitions -> True      ]
