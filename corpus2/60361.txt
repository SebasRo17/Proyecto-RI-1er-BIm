I've read somewhere that it's a bad idea to name classes after verbs (manager/browser/editor) but what's the proper name for manager/browser/editor? EDIT: the problem is that system could turn in a big ball of "services" - tiny objects which does something specific and does not contain any data - which is bad (at least because it just queries other objects) but I also need to be able add new "managers" easily (right now app needs to manage users, ftp accounts, mail accounts, etc.)
