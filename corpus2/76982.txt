Why don't some open source libraries provide binaries? I have noticed that some projects defer to third-parties who maintain current builds of the software, especially for Windows builds. I ask because it seems like a barrier for adoption of a library. It's more work for the developer since he must set up his environment to build it. A developer also has to worry that he introduced bugs by building the library incorrectly. * * * **EDIT** : Some updates to address comments and answers. I've removed the examples since they're not central to the discussion. Also rephrased my question as "some open source libraries provide" rather than "open source libraries tend to provide"... didn't realize people would take offense to that.
