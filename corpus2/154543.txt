I started coding almost a year ago. By "coding" I mean HTML(5), CSS(3), and only few times I implemented some AJAX and JavaScript. I am interviewing for a position that expects me to know HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, and AJAX. I feel confident in HTML5/CSS3 subject area and somewhat ok with javascript. Will agency expect from me to write some code during the interview? I do have a live website as an example which contains snapshots of past projects which were sent to them. I am little nervous, so any tips or recommendations are welcome.
