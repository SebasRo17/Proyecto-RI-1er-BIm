The former page "Trademark and Logo Usage Requirements" at http://www.sun.com/policies/trademarks/ is no longer available, is there a new version which helps with the proper naming of products (beans, libraries) for Java? I have found Third Party Usage Guidelines for Oracle Trademarks at http://www.oracle.com/us/legal/third-party-trademarks/index.html however there is no occurence of "Java" related product names. Former guidelines said that "(productname...) for the Java platform" was a correct name, and now it seems to me that it must be renamed to " **(productname...) for Oracle Java** " to comply with the Third Party Usage Guidelines for Oracle Trademarks
