I want to make a roulette board with a ball spinning and landing on a certain field. The catch is that the field the ball will land on, is known beforehand. I want the animation to look somewhat realistic, even though the result is decided beforehand. So I think I need to calculate the path the ball will follow, starting from it's end position. However, in this case, it always needs to end up in the same starting position. How can this be done?
