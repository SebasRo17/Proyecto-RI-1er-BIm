I'm curious to know what the prevailing best practice is about get commits are. Should they be enforced such that the project is in a working state (builds properly, all tests pass etc), or is committing broken code OK? If you waive the requirement, you can be more flexible with commits (use them as logical chunks, even though the app is not in a working state etc). But if you enforce it you gain the flexibility of being able to cherry-pick any given commit later on...
