I've been looking at development strategies for frameworks and have found a few good resources. However in the structure of frameworks in iOS and OSX I want to know why inside of the versions folder, there is a folder called 'A'?               MyFramework.framework/         MyFramework  -> Versions/Current/MyFramework         Resources    -> Versions/Current/Resources         Versions/             A/                 MyFramework                 Resources/                     English.lproj/                         InfoPlist.strings                     Info.plist             Current  -> A      According to the Apple documentation it seems that multiple versions can be created, however is there a logical or possibly historical reason why the character 'A' is used instead of using something like a date or version number?
