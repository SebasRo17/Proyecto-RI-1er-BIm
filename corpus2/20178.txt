I need a way to filter out resumes of folks who just copy-and-paste code then hope it works, and check it in if it does. All this happens without having an understanding (or care) to understand the rest of the code in the system. Sure I know that copying and pasting code is part of learning a new object, control, etc... but how can one tell if that accounts for 70% (or more) of their development career? I've come across some senior level guys perhaps whose skills are so outdated or irrelevant for the project, that all they do is google, copy-then-paste some code without thinking about the solution as a whole. As a result we have a mismash of JSON, AJAX, callbacks, ASMX, WCF and postbacks in the same project. It is clear there is no consistency or logic behind where each technology is being used. In the worst case, this type of developer creates security issues and vectors for attack. **Question** How would you recommend I filter out people who have a poor programming background? Can I do it at the resume level? If not, how do I do this during the interview.
