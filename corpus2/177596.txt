I'm wondering what generic build tools out there include their binary run- times and do not depend on another environment not shipped with them. For example, ANT requires Java, Rake requires Ruby, etc.. would be great if talking about also target-platform-agnostic tools, where I'd just give whatever command for building, whatever command for testing, etc.. and can then define my artifacts in CI or so. Would see something like that useful for building .NET projects (say, on both Windows .NET and Mono), and Node JS projects especially. I do not want to install Java and / or Ruby if what I want is a .NET build or a Node JS build. This is a bit of general awareness question not an exact problem I'm facing, that's why it's here not on StackOverflow. **Update:** To explain a bit more, what I'm after is the build script that would run MSBuild for compiling for example ( in .NET, and then maybe several Node/NPM commands in Node, etc..), and then have the rest build/test steps, instead of setting these all in MSBuild (again, in .NET case, also, wondering if there is equivalent story in Node). **Update2:** My target is being able to have a developer on a vanilla machine to just clone the code without installing any dependencies except the platform the code targets be it .NET/Mono or Node (not even Java, Ruby, or Python) and still be able to build and run tests.
