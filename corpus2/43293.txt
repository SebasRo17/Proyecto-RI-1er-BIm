Suppose I want to do calculations with a random variable $X$ that has a simple categorical distribution (a.k.a generalised Bernoulli distribution or discrete distribution). I was expecting to be able to work with a distribution "symbolically". That is, I was expecting that there would be a function like `CategoricalDistribution`, that we could use like this.               distX = CategoricalDistribution[{1/3, 1/2, 1/6}];      But no distributions in tutorial/DiscreteDistributions looked like they were suitable. An example of how the distribution would be used would be               {Probability[x == 0, x \[Distributed] dist],      Probability[x == 1, x \[Distributed] dist],      Probability[x == 2, x \[Distributed] dist]}      would output > >     {1/3, 1/2, 1/6} >   In this particular case, we can do a workaround, by doing               dist = TransformedDistribution[       x1 + x2, {x1 \[Distributed] BernoulliDistribution[1/2],         x2 \[Distributed] BernoulliDistribution[1/3]}]      Unfortunately, this is not always possible, even with only 3 possible outcomes. For example, we cannot simulate `CategoricalDistribution[{1/2, 0, 1/2}]` like this, as we cannot have independent Bernoulli random variables that behave like this. I was hoping the categorical distribution might be a special case of another distribution. Especially the `MultinomialDistribution` with 1 as its first argument looks useful, but I cannot transform that distribution into a distribution that gives an integer. Again it seems like I am missing a function like `CategoricalDistribution` to do so. To give an example               Position[RandomVariate@MultinomialDistribution[1, {1/2, 0, 1/2}],        1][[1, 1]]      "has the right distribution", but unfortunately I cannot use `Position` inside `TransformedDistribution`. I am aware of functions like `RandomChoice`, but really I only want to do manipulations on distributions. Does anybody know how to do this?
