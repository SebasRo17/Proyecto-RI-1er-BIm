I would like to transfer the colors of a ListContourPlot to a ListLIC-Plot. I tried to interpolate the data of the ListContourPlot and use it as ColorFunction for the second plot but I couldn't get it to work properly, is there a better way to do this?               data1 = Table[Sin[i + j^2], {i, 0, 3, 0.1}, {j, 0, 3, 0.1}];     data2 = Table[{Sin[i + j^2], Cos[i + j^2]}, {i, 0, 3, 0.1}, {j, 0, 3, 0.1}];     f = ListInterpolation[data1];     ListContourPlot[data1, ColorFunction -> "DarkRainbow"]     ListLineIntegralConvolutionPlot[data2, ColorFunction -> Function[{x, y, vx, vy, n},     ColorData["DarkRainbow"][f[x, y]]], RasterSize -> 100]      I get the following error:               InterpolatingFunction::dmval: Input value {0.,0.} lies outside the range of     data in the interpolating function. Extrapolation will be used. >>      ...      The result should look remotely like the following ![plot](http://i.imgur.com/Y3cO1Zc.jpg)
