I have been told, and have found for myself, that lots of developers are not good at UI design (I don't know how true is this) but _it is true about me at least_. In web development good code development skills are not enough without great skills in UI design to go with them. So for me, and many developers like me, that only have half of the thing (good development skills) how should we complete our other half other than paying for a designer? Is using Open Source web templates with little modifications the best solution for this, or are there other options?
