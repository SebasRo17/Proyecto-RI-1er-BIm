Recently I've started to put almost all of my data structures into interfaces, and many of the classes that contain pieces of logic code as well, depending on how much work they are. I find that this makes development of applications much easier because I can easily swap out parts of my code when they do not work as well as intended without changing the rest of the application and swap them back in when I have corrected them, or if I need something simpler for the time being. I was wondering if I'm developing a bad habit here. Is this a anti-pattern I'm using here, or is it okay to do this?
