Suppose I have a _Mathematica_ notebook saved to a certain location on disk. Given a pattern I need to get the list of all expressions matching this pattern that appear in input, output or print cells in the notebook, every expression being wrapped in `Hold` to prevent its evaluation. Ideally, I also want to extract expressions from cells with erroneous/incomplete input, if the expression itself is complete, but that is not strictly necessary. How can I do this?
