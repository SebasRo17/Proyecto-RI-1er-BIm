I have a Python script that counts the number of file in a folder, and if the number of files exceeds 10 then it creates a popup window to ask the user to clean up the folder (I use tkMessageBox). How can I have the program run in the background so that it consumes only minimal resources? I tried running it as a daemon and as an agent but I couldn't see anything happen (no popup window).
