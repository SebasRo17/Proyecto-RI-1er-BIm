I've a problem. I defined a simple list and a function like below:               lst := {5, 10, 20}     f[m_] := lst[[Floor[m/10]]];      and drew a plot               Plot[f[x], {x, 10, 38}]      which works fine. But when calling LogPlot               LogPlot[f[x], {x, 10, 38}]      the following error appears before the plot               Part::pspec: "Part specification Floor[x/10] is neither a machine-sized integer nor a list of machine-sized integers"      Can anyone suggest me what's going on and how to deal with this error? Thank you in advance!
