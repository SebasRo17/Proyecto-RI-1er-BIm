As you can see in the documentation of `CreateDialog` > In dialogs created with CreateDialog, pressing Return is effectively > equivalent to clicking the DefaultButton, and Esc to clicking the > CancelButton. > > If the dialog contains no DefaultButton or CancelButton, pressing Return or > Esc will close the dialog without taking any other action. I have a input field, for example, and I often press Enter key after I wrote my inputs. That what happened is that my window close immediately after that. How can change this behavior in Dialog?
