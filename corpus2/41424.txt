The problem is following: I have a following animation:               Animate[      Graphics[{Translate[Rotate[Rectangle[], ψ Degree], {x, 0}],         Translate[Rotate[Rectangle[], -ψ Degree], {1.75 - x, 0}]}],      {x, 0, 1},      {ψ, 0, 90},      AnimationRunning -> False      ]      For rectangles it works perfectly, but when I try to put instead of these rectangles any image, it shows me "Image is not a Graphics primitive or directive" error. How to put any image(raster-, vector- based) and transform it the way like it does with primitives?
