In a bootloader, the second last line is : > TIMES 510-($-$$) db 0 Now, will this command also do the same : > db 510-($-$$) DUP (0) If not why? I know what `TIMES` does, but its not mentioned in my x86 book by Mazidi (Pearson Publication). Any idea why? And what is the meaning of the `$` sign exactly? Different sites have different information about `$`. And is the line `TIMES 510-($-$$) db 0` absolutely necessary even if my bootloader code is of 512 bytes in size? So can anyone help me with these questions?
