Has anyone out there done this? Did you have to spend a few years learning .NET before you could get a job or were there employers just willing to throw you into the fire based on your Java experience? I'm wondering if it would be good for me to start learning .NET now in case a few years down the road I end up wanting to make the switch or maybe I don't need to worry.
