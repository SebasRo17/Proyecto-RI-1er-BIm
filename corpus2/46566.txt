I have two points p1 and p2, and I want to get the parametric equation of a linear function that passes through those, but ranging from one point to another. For example, if I have 2 points {0,0} and {1,1/2}, the equation would be {t,t/2}. > The goal of having a **parametric equation** is to have the function defined > even when the slope is $\infty$. I tried this (here the angle[] function is Atan2, is basically `ArcTan` but ranging from 0-2Ï€):               Piecewise[      {       {{t, Last@p1 + Tan@angle[p1, p2] (t - First@p1)},         Min[First@p1, First@p2] <= t && t <= Max[First@p1, First@p2]},       {{First@p1, t}, First@p1 == First@p2}       },      Indeterminate      ]      But when a point is on top of the other the function is a vertical line, ranging from $-\infty$ to $\infty$; I would only want the function to be defined from Last@p1 to Last@p2. In other words, I want a Graphics' `Line`, but using parametric equations. Something like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/buJF5.png)
