When I add some text to a simple plot with drawing tools, the text cannot be copied and pasted out with the graphic itself to Microsoft Word. Do you know how to copy the manually added text out to Word? Thank you! This is what I did in Mathematica plot with drawing tool (I got this by output it as a .bmp file): ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/S8EaY.png) This is what was copied and pasted to Word (result of direct copy and paste): ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ECkGy.png) After a few tries, I think it works for newly added text, but once I rotate & move the text to align with my curves it disappear again. The following screenshot shows how bmp image lose resolution when the document coverted to PDF eventually. ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Nau16.png) The topic has been a little diverted. We still haven't solve the problem "copy & paste do not work for rotated text in plot". I think it's a MMA bug. Any hints?
