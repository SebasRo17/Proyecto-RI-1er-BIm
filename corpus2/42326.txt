Edit: since the upgrade to _Mathematica_ 10, this problem seems solved I just want to solve a system of partial differential equations, for example: $$ \left\\{ \begin{array}{l} \frac{\partial}{\partial a}[f(a, b, c)] = 4 \sin^2(b) \cos(c) \\\ \frac{1}{a} \times \frac{\partial}{\partial b}[f(a, b, c)] = 4 \cos(c) \sin(2b) \\\ \frac{1}{a \sin(b)} \times \frac{\partial}{\partial c}[f(a, b, c)] = -4 \sin(b) \sin(c) \\\ \end{array} \right. $$ And when I try to solve this system in _Mathematica_ , the output does not help:               In[1]:= DSolve[     {         D[f[a, b, c], a] == 4 Sin[b]^2 Cos[c],         (1/a) *D[f[a, b, c], b] == 4 Cos[c] Sin[2 b],         (1/(a Sin[b]))*D[f[a, b, c], c] == -4 Sin[b] Sin[c]     }, f[a, b, c], {a, b, c}]          Out[1]= DSolve[     {         Derivative[1, 0, 0][f][a, b, c] == 4*Cos[c]*Sin[b]^2,         Derivative[0, 1, 0][f][a, b, c]/a == 4*Cos[c]*Sin[2*b],         (Csc[b]*Derivative[0, 0, 1][f][a, b, c])/a == -4*Sin[b]*Sin[c]     }, f[a, b, c], {a, b, c}]      Obviously, this output is useless… Probably I doing something wrong… Thank you for your help Note : The solution is $f(a, b, c) = 4a \sin^2(b) \cos(c) + K$ (K : the integration constant).
