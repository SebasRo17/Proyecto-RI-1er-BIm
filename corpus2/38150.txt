I'm working on solving differential equations through Fourier series, I made a function to help me calculate the coefficients that looks like this:               bn[α_, T_, f_] := (2/T)*Integrate[f*Sin[((2*Pi*n)/T)*t], {t, α, T + α}]      And it was workng pretty well, until I tried to evaluate this:               bn[0, L, Piecewise[{{0, 0 < t < L/3}, {w, L/3 < t < 2*(L/3)}, {0, 2*(L/3) < t < L}}]]      And it gives me the error: > Integrate::pwrl: Unable to prove that integration limits {L} are real. > Adding assumptions may help. >> Any idea on what is causing/how to avoid the error? I tried using assumptions, but I guess I'm doing it wrong because it doens't help.               bn[α_, T_, f_] :=        Integrate[(2/T)*f*Sin[((2*Pi*n)/T)*t], {t, α, α + T}, Assumptions -> Element[T, Reals]]      ### Edit You mean enter the code like it is now? Sorry for the inconvenience, but the advanced help for the site sort of suggested that I used LaTeX.
