I would like to know what, why or when it is better to choose a queuing tool and what, why or when it is better to choose database task table? I don't understand the difference of sending my tasks in a queuing tool or in a database table that will be read and act as a queue. Is there some properties that queuing tools has that database cannot do? Read my question as "what are the benefit or what are the arguments to choose a queuing tool solution". My question is not about what language, technology, or project one should take up next. Thank you,
