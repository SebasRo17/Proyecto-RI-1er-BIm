I believe that I am a good C programmer. I can solve beginner level Question in google's code jam. I did solve all of the programming examples in KN kings: C programming. Given a problem I can express a solution to it in C(probably not good, but still works with brute force most of the time). A couple of days ago I had registered for a C quiz. And took the quiz today. From the beginning till the end I was confused, feeling rejected and unhappy most of the time. I could not figure out what most of the question did. It was cryptic to me. For example I have used for loop almost 1000 times, but the for loops in that quiz were just cryptic and confusing. Most of the question looked like it had illegal syntax. After the test I felt dejected and posted this question. I wanna know that does solving cryptic code make you a good or a great programmer?. A simple solution to a straight forward question is better than a cryptic confusion right?. If I had done really well in the test what does it indicate? If I have performed average or bad what does that indicate?. Oh yes, I will get the paper of quiz on monday and i will update that monday evening around 7:30. (GMT +5:30). Thanks for your concern. By the way to hell with you people who have down voted for this post. You people cant wait for edits or dont have patience to at least listen to someone. I still think there is nothing wrong in this question and i wont delete it.
