A lot of big companies use recruiters to find new hires, and there's obviously an associated cost. Existing staff are likely to know people looking for work through their professional networks. The company could potentially save significant money if they found people this way. Obviously there are conflict-of-interest concerns to consider, but in general, **do you think it's appropriate for a company to offer a finders' fee for referring new hires?**
