http://www.dartlang.org/ I've checked out the site very briefly, and got curious. Is there any advantages of using Dart? Is it just a replacement for JavaScript? It looks like simpler Java. Writing quite a lot of C# at work, the language feels very much like what I'm used to, so learning the syntax looks like a breeze to learn. Has anybody any opinions or experiences with the language? (Compared to CoffeeScript (= I'm not doing Ruby syntax) the syntax looks more familiar to me).
