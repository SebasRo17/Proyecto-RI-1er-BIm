Is there a way to decompose a `BSplineFunction` output into two functions `x[t]`, `y[t]` parametrizing the curve `BSplineFunction[{{x1, y1}, {x2, y2}, ...}][t]` in a form which allows easy calculation of derivatives of arbitrary order of `x[t]` and `y[t]` and of composite functions which use `x[t]` or `y[t]` like               f[t] = y''[t]/Sqrt[x'[t]^2+y'[t]^2]     f''[0.5]      etc. ? Edit: I would also like to do this avoiding `SetDelayed` as much as it's possible.
