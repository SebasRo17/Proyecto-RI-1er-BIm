I want to find a freelance job, but I've never done any freelance work before. I want to know what the process involves. Can you please answer the following questions?   1. If the programmer finds a suitable freelance job, how can they apply, and how will the future employer evaluate the programmer's abilities?   2. How does the programmer deliver their work?   3. How does the programmer receive money? What if the employer and the employee are in different countries? How do they pay?   4. Do you really read the agreement when signing an account on a freelance website?   5. Any pitfalls? Under what circumstances will the employer not pay after the work is done?
