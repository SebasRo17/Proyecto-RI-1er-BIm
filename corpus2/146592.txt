I need to be familiar with at least the basics of using powershell to configure sharepoint solutions and their user accounts over the next couple of weeks. Would general powershell learning resources differ much from those more sharepoint-specific? Or is powershell powershell? i.e. is the syntax pretty similar whether it's for configuring sharepoint or used for other purposes? Also, does anybody have links to recommended pdfs for such reading? (I'll be looking myself now anyway, but it's worth asking in case any of you have an ebook that has helped you personally.)
