I'm wondering if there is a formula to work out the amount of IP addresses in a given range. I have a system that takes either a single IP address or a start and and end IP address:   * A single one might be: `145.16.23.241`   * A range might be: `145.16.23.122 - 145.16.23.144` The people inputting these aren't technical, nor are they receiving these details from technical people, so suggesting using CIDR notation isn't an answer for me. I want to be able to highlight that when entering a range such as: `122.100.10.12 - 128.10.200.140` it might not actually be a range and rather 2 singular IP addresses since such a range would comprise of `x` (large number of) IP addresses. Is there a basic formula to help me highlight this?
