in JavaScript:               function getTopCustomersOfTheYear(howManyCustomers, whichYear) {        // Some code here.     }     getTopCustomersOfTheYear(50, 2010);      in C#:               public List<Customer> GetTopCustomersOfTheYear(int howManyCustomers,       int whichYear)     {        // Some code here     }     List<Customer> customers = GetTopCustomersOfTheYear(50, 2010);      in PHP:               public function getTopCustomersOfTheYear($howManyCustomers, $whichYear)     {        // Some code here     }     $customers = getTopCustomersOfTheYear(50, 2010);      Is there any language out there which support this syntax:               function GetTop(x)CustomersOfTheYear(y)     {         // Some code here     }     returnValue = GetTop(50)CustomersOfTheYear(2010);      Isn't it more semantic, more readable form of writing a function? **Update:** The reason I'm asking this question is that, I'm writing an article about a new syntax for a new language. However, I thought that having such syntax for declaring methods could be nicer and more friendly to developers and would decrease learning-curve of the language, because of being more closer to natural language. I just wanted to know if this feature has already been contemplated upon or not.
