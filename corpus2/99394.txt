I am a freshman hired in an IT company in India. A lot of my friends have also been placed with different companies. Some of them have been trained online, Some in Classroom, and still some others (me included) are being trained 'on- the-job', This leaves me pretty confused as to what method should the companies follow so that the fresher is 'up-to-the-mark'? WHat advantages does all these methods have over one another? I would be delighted to hear from Industry people. P.S. Please(if you want) write if you are working in an IT company, and the post if possible. It will help me formulate my opinion. Nothing sinister in this request, I promise!
