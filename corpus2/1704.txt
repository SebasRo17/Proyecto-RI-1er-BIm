How can I automatically count the number of lines of code "Input" existing inside all the notebook files contained in a specified folder? I know there is the issue of considering or not the automatic line breakings as new lines. But considering the purpose of this exercise (statistically convince that the amount of developed work on Mathematica justifies keeping a license), I'm not searching for exact values.
