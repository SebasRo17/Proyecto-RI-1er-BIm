I'm new to VC++, and so am not very familiar with COM, ActiveX, IDL etc. When I mentioned this to my tech-lead, he assigned me the task of doing the code review of files he felt were important, in terms of the code that I'll soon be working with.   The actual code-base is approx. 10000 files. I'm a bit skeptical that doing a code review can help in understanding VC++ (I've already worked with C++ on Linux extensively for 2 years and have plenty of experience in Actionscript, Processing and many other languages). Since the code yet has to be built and run on my system (I'd prefer putting breakpoints and finding the code-flow), my tech-lead gave me the code review work. Is there a better way?
