In my org, we use SVN for version control So for each build (done periodically), we merge the code to trunk from the development branch (all the developers checks in to this branch). So when we want a new branch say for a new release, we create from the trunk doing a svn copy. Now in the new branch we have the _history only from the trunk_ and not from _the previous development branches_. Is there any way to maintain the history when merge is done from the dev branch to trunk? **Update :** By history I meant revision History of each and every file . Who created it and who edit it. Unfortunately we are using svn 1.6 right now
