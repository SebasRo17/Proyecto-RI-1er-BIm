In my work as a math teacher, I create lots of graphs to illustrate ideas. I have lots of math books and will often try to duplicate a particular style of graph. Below, one very simple example, created with Mathematica. (but as a "one off") ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/22GIY.png) I wish my Mathematica skills were better, I spend too much time grading and lesson planning, and I know I could be more effective with lesson writing if my toolkit was bigger and more robust. So I decided to try to write some functions to create these kinds of plots, and thought it would be best to put them into a package so I could use them easily. I have a program that created the plot, and it works fine, but I'm embarrassed to share it, it's so clunky...I don't care about speed and concise code, I wanted to be able to understand all the steps and pieces...               specialA[xmin_, xmax_, xscale_, ymin_, ymax_, yscale_, xtickmin_,        xtickmax_, xtickinc_, ytickmin_ , ytickmax_, ytickinc_, funclist_,        stylelist_, ratio_] :=       Module [{xvals, lightx, darkx, gridx1, gridx2, xgrid, yvals, lighty,         darky, gridy1, gridy2, ygrid, xticks, yticks},            xvals = Range[xmin, xmax, xscale];       lightx = Select[xvals, Not[IntegerQ[#/5]] &];       darkx = Select[xvals, IntegerQ[#/5] &];       gridx1 = {#, GrayLevel[0.8]} & /@ lightx;       gridx2 = {#, Black} & /@ darkx;       xgrid = Flatten[{gridx1, gridx2}, 1];       yvals = Range[ymin, ymax, yscale];       lighty = Select[yvals, Not[IntegerQ[#/5]] &];       darky = Select[yvals, IntegerQ[#/5] &];       gridy1 = {#, GrayLevel[0.8]} & /@ lighty;       gridy2 = {#, Black} & /@ darky;       ygrid = Flatten[{gridy1, gridy2}, 1];       xticks = Range[xtickmin, xtickmax, xtickinc];       yticks =  Range[ytickmin, ytickmax, ytickinc];            Plot[funclist, {x, xmin, xmax},         PlotStyle -> stylelist,        GridLines -> {xgrid, ygrid},         PlotRange -> {{xmin, xmax}, {ymin, ymax}},         AspectRatio -> ratio,         Ticks -> {xticks, yticks},         ImageSize -> 430,         Epilog -> Text[0, {0, 0}, {1, 1}],        BaseStyle -> {FontSize -> 18, FontFamily -> "Times"}]       ]      So, for example....                   f[x_] := 2 x^2 - x - 8;     g[x_] := -x^2 - 2 x + 2     specialA [-7, 7, 1, -32, 32, 2, -5, 5, 5, -30, 30, 10, {f[x], g[x],        f[x] - g[x], g[x] - f[x]}, {Red, Blue, Green, Magenta}, 2]      I'd welcome any comments on that and welcome any nice plotting routines for "high school math" graphs that others might be using. But here is my real question. I'm no expert but have created a few simple Mathematica packages. I put this function into a package, wrote a usage statement, defined the function. When I use it, I get a grid, but the functions don't display. I am sure this has something to do with contexts , but I just have no clue. How can I improve my function definition, and how would I include it in a working package of similar functions to draw other graphs? (I save my package online in case that would be helpful... https://dl.dropbox.com/u/24411154/grapher.nb) I know this is a huge question, I do appreciate the feedback and help from this group. Tom
