On an application I've been working on I have a function, connecting to a virtual machine, that can be performed two ways. The user can either select a machine from a list and click the "Connect" button. Or can double click on the machine in the list. Currently they are two separate event handlers because they function slightly differently. If a user is already connected, clicking the button will disconnect them, and double clicking will bring the window back up. ///edit The logic is essentially               button     if(connected)     Disconnect()     else     ConnectAndShowWindow()          List     ConnectAndShowWindow()      My question is should I keep the methods separate or combine the two methods even though they are slightly different and then, for the disconnecting/reconnecting switch them based on the sender?
