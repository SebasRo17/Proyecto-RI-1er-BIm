Based off answers to this question: Will I pick bad coding habits from PHP books? and many others it is a general consensus that PHP is not the most well suited language for web development anymore (if you are not completely knowledgeable about the language). I use Drupal and write custom modules in PHP, does this viewpoint of PHP being an ill fitted web coding language also apply to Drupal based PHP sites? I generally build community sites and intra-company sites, are there better means of building these than with PHP and drupal frameworks?
