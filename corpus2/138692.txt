I have an embedded device running a slimmed down version of a HTTP server. Currently, it can display static HTML pages. Here is an example of how it displays a static HTML page:               char *text="HTTP/1.0 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\n\r\n"     "<html><body>Hello World!</body></html>";     IPWrite(socket, (uint8*)text, (int)strlen(text));     IPClose(socket);      What I'd like to do is display dynamic content, e.g. a reading from a sensor. What I thought of so far is to have the page refresh every once in awhile with               <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="600">      and use sprintf() to attach the sensor reading to the _text_ variable for the response. Is there a way I can do this without having to refresh the page constantly?
