Though it is always a plus point to have knowledge of multiple technologies, but due to time-constraint it is not possible for me right now. I have extensive experience in .NET Windows development and 1 year experience in PHP. I want to apply for a job of web programmer. Is it absolutely necessary for me to learn web-designing also that includes CSS and PhotoShop?
