The aim is to calculate the definite integral of the function $f$ of the form $$f(x,t) \;\;\;\; x \in [0, \infty ) \;\;, \;\;t \in [t_0,T]$$ numerically. For example consider the function below $$f = e^{-xt}$$ For each **$t_i$** belongs to interval $[t_0, T]$, there is an integral like this: $$\int_{0}^{\infty} f(x, t) dx \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(*)$$ If the interval of $[t_0,T]$ divided to $n$ equal part, then we have $n$ integral of the form $(*)$ where $t_i$ is the lower bound of each interval. Also I'm willing to plot the result of $n$ integration. In MATLAB it's easy to code the above integral; by defining a **for** loop, one can deal with sweeping **t** over interval $[t_0,T]$.                         for t = t0 : 0.01 : T                    fun = @(x) f(x, t);                   q = integral(fun,0,Inf);               end      I familiar with the command "Integrate" (in Mathematica) but I can't sweep **t** over interval. How can I do this?
