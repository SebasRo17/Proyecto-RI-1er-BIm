I have 3 sets of 5 x-y points:               RandomInteger[10, {3, 5, 2}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/m7dna.png) I want to display only one set of points at a time, and use a slider to move on to show the next set. This of course could be simply done with a `Manipulate`:               Manipulate[Module[{l},       l = RandomInteger[10, {3, 5, 2}];       ListPlot[l[[i]], PlotRange -> {{-1, 11}, {-1, 11}}]], {i, 1, 3, 1}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/oezOd.png) However, notice that I have to hard code the Manipulate parameter to have a maximum of 3 (the number of sets there is). To avoid hard-coding, I have to make the `Manipulate` aware of the `Length[l]` i.e. the number of sets there is). I just can't seem to find a way how to do so given that `l` was a variable local to only the `Module`. * * * **My question is** : how can I make my `Manipulate` aware of a local variable in my nested `Module`? * * * **PS** : I could of course nest the `Manipulate` within a `DynamicModule`, but I'm wondering if there's any straightforward way to achieve the same thing with the opposite nesting (`Module` inside `Manipulate`).               DynamicModule[{l},      l = RandomInteger[10, {3, 5}];      Manipulate[ListPlot[l[[i]]], {i, 1, Length[l], 1}]]
