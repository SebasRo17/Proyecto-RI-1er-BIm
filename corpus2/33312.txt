If I enter               MathKernel -noprompt -run 'ToExpression["1", TeXForm]; Exit[]'      the kernel hangs, apparently while running `TeX.exe` as a `mathlink` (see below). But when I remove `-noprompt`, it runs just fine. Similar results hold if I pass these commands (to either `MathKernel` or `MathematicaScript`) as a script. Alternatively, even with `-noprompt`, any of the other formats accepted by `ToExpression` work just fine. Any ideas why this happens? * * * Rather than printing the output, I could just write to file and send all the prompt garbage to `/dev/null`, but this really doesn't fit into my tool chain very well. So I'd appreciate any solutions or workarounds. I'm running Mathematica 9.0 for Mac OS X x86 (64-bit) on OS X 10.6.8. My evidence for believing that it's `TeX.exe` causing the problem is that my processes look like this               2772 s000  S+     0:00.28 /Applications/Local/Mathematica.app/Contents/MacOS/MathKernel -noprompt -run Print[ToExpression["1", TeXForm]];Exit[]     2773 s000  S+     0:00.04 /Applications/Local/Mathematica.app/SystemFiles/Converters/Binaries/MacOSX-x86-64/TeX.exe -ml -mathlink -linkmode connect -linkprotocol SharedMemory -linkname jv5_shm      Now, without `-noprompt`, I also see `TeX.exe` in the process list with the exact same arguments. But it's only there briefly, and it returns normally. Also, I can run `file TeX.exe`, and see that it is indeed a Mac executable (not Windows, as the name would suggest).
