Is it possible to implement generic routines in any language (C#, Java, etc). By generic routines I mean, in specific event Handlers. Lets say, I have 2 Buttons and 2 text boxes. One Button, when pressed, takes the first text box text and converts to Uppercase and second button prints the length of the string in the other text box. Now, Can I have a function as               button(type, textbox) {     if(type==1)     /*Convert to upper case*/     else if(type==2)     /*Print the length*/     }      The type takes any button as input and further processes it. I want to implement this because of redundancy in my code and I want to make my code portable to other languages. So that I need to modify only the syntax to make it work. Is it feasible?
