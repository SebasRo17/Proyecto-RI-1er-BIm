I am trying to understand the point of Odata and when it would make sense. Right now how I work is I use ASP.NET and MVC/WebApi controller to serialize/deserialize objects into JSON and have javascript do something with it. From what I can tell the benefit of OData is being able to query directly from the URL ... But since I am writing the client and server code there is no need for that. Would anyone ever parse the results of a ODaya query in javascript?? Maybe OData is more about providing a generic endpoint for ALL clients to get detailed information from a query that JSON does not provide ? So if I was a provider of data then I suppose that is what odata is for ? Help me understand the purpose and use of REST/JSON/ODATA.
