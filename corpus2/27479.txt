I want to determine a balance distribution.               Ü = {{0.4, 0.2, 0.3}, {0.3, 0.5, 0.2}, {0.3, 0.3, 0.5}};       and               X = {{x1}, {x2}, {x3}};       so that               Ü.X == X      But when I want to solve               Solve[{0.4 x1 + 0.2 x2 + 0.3 x3 == x1,0.3 x1 + 0.5 x2 + 0.2 x3 == x2, 0.3 x1 + 0.3 x2 + 0.5 x3 == x3,        x1 + x2 + x3 == 240000}, {x1, x2, x3}]      I get the error > RowReduce::luc: Result for RowReduce of badly conditioned matrix {{0.3, 0.2, > -0.6, 0.}, {0.2, -0.5, 0.3,0.}, {-0.5, 0.3, 0.3, 0.}, {1., 1., 1., > -240000.}} may contain significant numerical errors. >>   >  {} How can I solve this system?
