In .NET, it is idiomatic to suffix exception types with `Exception`. But most, if not all, sources I have seen for custom exception types in F# don't follow this idiom. Most seem to use the suffix `Error`. From F# For Fun and Profit               exception MyFSharpError1 of string     exception MyFSharpError2 of string * int      From Microsoft Documentation*               exception MyError of string      The book 'Expert F# 3.0', co-authored by Don Syme, has an example that doesn't even seem to follow any idiom:               exception BlockedURL of string      Why don't custom exceptions in F# follow the standard idioms for .NET? Is it because of the OCaml heritage? * Link is to Google cache, as I cannot connect to MS at the time of writing.
