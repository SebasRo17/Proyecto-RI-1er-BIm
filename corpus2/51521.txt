I am trying to simulate the sampling of a waveform to then apply FFT Analysis to it. Here is the sample code I have now using a square wave:               frequency =50;     sampleFrec = 1000;     period =1/frequency;          f=\[Piecewise]  -1  (period/2)<=Mod[x,period]<period                      1  True                          testData=Table[N@f,{x,0,2*period,1/sampleFrec}];          Plot[f,{x,0,2*period}, PlotLabel->"Fundamental",ExclusionsStyle->Dashed, PlotStyle->{Thickness[0.006], Red}]          ListLinePlot[testData,PlotRange->Full, PlotLabel->"Fundamental"]      And this are the plots I'm getting, the first one is the 50Hz square wave I want but when I use `Table[]` and `ListLinePlot[]` I am not getting the same frequency, why? I am relatively new to Wolfram Mathematica so maybe this is something very stupid. Thank you for your help! ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/lwviH.jpg) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/EOmWI.jpg)
