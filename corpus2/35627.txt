I need send the result of my calculation to the screen connected to HDMI output as a full-screen image. As I understand, I need change the DisplayFunction to usage of certain OutputStream. Do anybody help me with creation of proper DisplayFunction? Which parameters are needed? Now I use DisplayFunction->CreateDialog and manually move the window to second screen, but it is evidently stupid way.. I need more or less precise alignment of an image at the HDMI-screen, which is normally reproducible each time.. Could anybody show me right way for creation of the true redirection of graphics output?
