In Mathematica 7, I want to determine whether a list of free of numbers greater than 1 or not. It seems like using `FreeQ` would be a concise way to do this:               FreeQ[{2, 1}, # > 1 &] (* The output is: True *)          FreeQ[{1, 1}, # > 1 &] (* The output is: True *)      Why does `FreeQ[{2, 1}, # > 1 &]` give `True`? `{2, 1}` is not free of numbers greater than 1, so I must be using `FreeQ` incorrectly.
