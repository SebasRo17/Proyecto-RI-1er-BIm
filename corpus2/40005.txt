Please help - I'm really struggling to understand why this evaluates with errors.               data = RandomReal[10, {4, 1000}];     metric[data_, perc_] := (x = Quantile[#, perc] & /@ data; Accumulate[x]/Total[x]);     Plot[Evaluate@metric[data, p], {p, 0.01, 0.99}, AxesLabel -> {"Percentile", "Proportion"},  PlotLegends -> {"Series A", "Series A+B", "Series A+B+C", "Series A+B+C+D"}]      Basically I need to see the results from the function as 4 separate curves in 4 colours. Placing the "metric" function inside the Plot means that it plots everything as one function, which doesn't help (although it evaluates error free). In line with other answers on here (here and others) I recognise I have to either Evaluate it or Apply the metric to the Plot pure function, but then I get a Quantile error (and critical/"fall over" errors with some of the other more complex metrics I'm using). I've tried using default values, Holds, matching patterns on when perc doesn't exist etc etc but to no avail. I'm losing years off my life trying to get this to work so any help would be really appreciated...
