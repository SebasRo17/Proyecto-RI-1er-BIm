Using functional programming in Mathematica, how can I compute a distance matrix for every element in a list of matrices... The distance would be computed between the item in the list and a "target matrix". For simplicity, let's consider that the list is a list of simple 3x2 matrices of integer with a range [0,4]. The target matrix is a matrix of that type as well. The reason I want to do that is to filter the list to find the matrix closest to the target one.
