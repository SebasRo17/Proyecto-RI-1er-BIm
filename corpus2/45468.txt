I have a list, say `Alist``               Alist = {{1}, {2}, {1, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {4}};      and want a list, `Blist` such that               Blist = {{0, 0, 1}, {0, 0, 2}, {0, 1, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {0, 0, 4}};      What I mean is that, if the set of numbers in Alist has the length smaller than 3, then I want to pad zeros on the left until the whole sub-list has length 3. This should be quite a simple problem, but somehow I could not successfully get a program done (issue with defining conditional variables in the Do and If in each set of loop running). Can someone provide an answer and a short program command for it? The simpler the better.
