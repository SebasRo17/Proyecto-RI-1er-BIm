Suppose I call               GroebnerBasis[{f1, f2, ...}, {x1,x2, ...}]      The output is a list               {g1,g2,...}      For each $g_j$, there should be an expression $g_j = \sum f_i h_{ij}$ for some polynomials $h_{ij}$. How do I make Mathematica output the $h$'s? * * * In case there is a better approach, I'll tell you my actual goal. I have polynomials $\\{ f_1, f_2, \ldots, \\}$ which generate an ideal $I$, and an element $q$ which I know to be invertible in the quotient ring $\mathbb{R}[x_1, x_2, \ldots]/I$. I want to generate an explicit polynomial representative for $q^{-1}$. My plan is to compute the Groebner basis of the ideal $\langle f_1, f_2, \ldots, q \rangle$, which will be $\\{ 1 \\}$, and find the expression $1 = \sum f_i h_i + pq$; the answer is then $p$. Calling `PolynomialReduce[1,{f1, f2, ..., q}]` does not have the intended effect because `{f1, f2, ..., q}` is not a Groebner basis.
