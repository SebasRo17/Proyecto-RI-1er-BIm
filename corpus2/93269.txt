If I write a public-facing commercial website, and use a GPL javascript library and/or binaries without modifying them (such as plupload), would I be required to make the source for my website available? Is that considered distribution? That component is just an example. I know a commercial license is available, but would I need a commercial license if I wasn't modifying the source code of the component?
