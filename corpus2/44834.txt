If I define a symbol in Mathematica, it doesn't show up in the autocomplete list that works for symbols in `System`. Test code:               foo = 1;     bar[x_] := x + 1     $ContextPath     Context@foo     Context@bar     (* =>          {Notebook$$35$859131`, System`}          Notebook$$35$859131`          Notebook$$35$859131`     *)      Neither `foo` nor `bar` will show up in the autocomplete list. Is it possible to make `foo` and `bar` show up in this list, without defining them in the `System` context? **Edit:** It works if I switch to the `Global` context, however I would like to have a separate context for each notebook. The question is then if you can add the notebook specific contexts to the autocomplete contexts?
