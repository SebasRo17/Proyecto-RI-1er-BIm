I am looking at taking the 70-515 (web apps with .net4) exam soon, and I am wondering what the pass mark is? The training material's test exams set the pass mark at 80%, but from past experience (taking 1.0 exams 6 years ago) I thought it was only 70%. Also, can anyone confirm if the number of questions on the exam is 45? Thanks.
