Here's a homework problem from the Coursera course Calculus: Single Variable by Robert Ghrist > Find the derivative $\frac{dy}{dx}$ from the equation $x \tan y - y^2 \ln > x=4$ I wanted to check my work using Mathematica so I tried this:               Dt[x Tan[y] - y^2 Log[x] == 4];     % /. {Dt[y] -> dy, Dt[x] -> dx};     Reduce[{%, dy/dx == z}, z]      On my system (Mathematica 9, Windows 7), this computation seems to hang. Does anyone have a suggestion on how to solve this? **Edit:** I'm also interested in why `Reduce` doesn't handle the problem well when used as above whereas `Solve` handles it just fine (see answers).
