I recently wanted to use `FilePrint` to print the contents somewhere else but in the notebook I was using. However, the obvious-seeming solution doesn't work at all:               In[137]:= temp = With[{str = OpenWrite[]},                  Block[{$Output = str},                   Print["fee fi fo fum"]];                  Close[str]];          In[138]:= FilePrint[temp]               "fee fi fo fum"          In[139]:= With[{str=OpenWrite[]},                Block[{$Output = str},                 FilePrint[temp]];                Close[str]];               "fee fi fo fum"      Since the obvious solution doesn't work, does anybody know a less obvious solution, preferably one that doesn't involve re-implementing `FilePrint` myself? Sure, that would be easy, but I'd prefer not to do it.
