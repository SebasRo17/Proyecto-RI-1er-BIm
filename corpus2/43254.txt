I am trying to solve the following system of equations for three unknowns _Theta, Nu,_ and _K_. All the other parameters are constants. The third argument in `Solve`, { _ub, uc, pm_ }, is to be eliminated: i.e. I don't want the solution to contain _ub, uc,_ or _pm_.               system = { Subscript[p,m] == K (Pi (c + uc)^2 - Pi (b + ub)^2)/(Pi c^2 - Pi b^2) ,      ub == (b (-2 a^2 Subscript[p,i] + (-b^2 (-1 + ν) + a^2 (1 + ν))     Subscript[p,m]))/((a^2 - b^2) θ) ,     uc == (c ((c^2 (-1 + ν) - d^2 (1 + ν)) Subscript[p,m] + 2 d^2      Subscript[p,o]))/((c^2 - d^2) θ) } // FullSimplify          Solve[system, {θ, ν, K}, {ub, uc, Subscript[p,m]}]      With the code as it stands, my Mathematica 9 just hangs. I have also tried `Reduce`. Could you please help me find what's wrong with my Mathematica code or identify the fault with the logic of how I posed the question? Thank you very much.
