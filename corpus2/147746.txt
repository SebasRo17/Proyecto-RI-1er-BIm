We have a requirement in our project to generate a big CSV file every 2 hours using a Java program. This file will have around 60,000 lines (around 120 characters per line). I am not sure about the size yet. I would like to know if I would run into any memory issues because I will open the file using FileWriter and then keep writing and then finally close the file. Should I worry about the size of the file? If yes, are there any other good techniques to write into a big file in Java other than using FileWriter? We are using Java 5.
