I am analyzing some variates from a steeply falling power-law distribution (approximately with a power index -4) using               Histogram[data, Automatic, "PDF"]      While the option `ScalingFunctions->{"Log", "Log"}` helps a lot in keeping the results in perspective, I cannot really see small deviations from the power law since the dominant trend in the log-log view will be a linear function with approximate slope -4. The usual trick in such studies is to scale the resulting pdf by dividing it with the approximate trend, i.e. for the bin entries I want something like               ScalingFunctions->{"Log", Function[{count, center}, Log[center^4 count]]}      instead of only `Function[x, Log[x]]` which I get with the `"Log"` option. Unfortunately `Histogram` seems to call this function with only one argument which is the corresponding bin count (or pdf value in my case), unlike e.g. `Plot` which calls `RegionFunction` with all the coordinates and similarly other plotting functions in Mathematica. Is there a way to convince Mathematica to call the scaling functions not only with the bin value but also with the bin center or location of bin edges?
