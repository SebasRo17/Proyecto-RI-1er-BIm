I have a good amount of experience developing software (5 years) in the corporate/enterprise world and would like to start working for a software publisher such as Microsoft, but never seem to get much of a reception when I talk to recruiters or respond to ads. I don't think it's specific language experience that's holding me back; I've spent the past 2.5 years doing web development in C#/.NET. Before that, I worked with mainstream technologies (C, C++) as well as legacy ones (MVS JCL, COBOL, etc.). I'm concerned that it might be my academic background (physics) or my relatively limited experience with any one _specific_ platform that's holding me back. My specific questions are:   * How should I market myself to get the best response from recruiters and hiring managers?   * What type of additional experience would improve my chances of getting interviewed/hired by software publishers? Should I try to start focusing on a single technology/platform instead of being a jack-of-all-trades, as I am now?
