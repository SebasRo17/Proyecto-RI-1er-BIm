The new CDF (computable document format) lets you embed a `Manipulate` or other interactive graphics on your website, and users can play around with your little script using the free player. What steps do I need to follow to   1. Create the CDF file correctly so that it displays a static picture (that I choose) if the user doesn't have the player and fires up the player if they do?   2. Make the necessary changes to my website/server to enable this?
