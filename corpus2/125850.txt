I have a two entity objects Site and Customer where there is a many to many relationship. I have read you try not to model this in DDD as it is in the data model and go for a unidirectional flow. If I wanted to show this in UML, would I show it as it is in the data model: `Site * ----->*Customer` but the direction arrow gives the flow? or as following `Site ----->*Customer` But then this would imply that Customer can only go in one site.
