Yes yes, I am aware that `'\n'` writes a newline in UNIX while for Windows there is the two character sequence: `'\r\n'`. All this is very nice in theory, but my question is **_why_**? Why the carriage return character is extra in Windows? If UNIX can do it in `\n` why does it take Windows two characters to do this? I am reading David Beazley's Python book and he says: > For example, on Windows, writing the character '\n' actually outputs the > two- character sequence '\r\n' (and when reading the file back, '\r\n' is > translated back into a single '\n' character). Why the extra effort? I will be honest. I have known the difference for a long time but have never bothered to ask WHY. I hope that is answered today. Thanks for your time.
