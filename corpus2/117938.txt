Subversion Re-education actually convinced me, but for now I'll stick to svn - mastering the use of a very popular tool can't be bad. To date I've not used branching/merges in production code, now I decided to give it a try in a small team environment. I'm afraid of suffering the same pain as the described in Spolsky's article. **Is there a "right" way of working with branches in svn?**
