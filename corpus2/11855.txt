How would you solve a problem like "write csc(x) in terms of sec(x)" in Mathematica? The best I can get is "True." http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/167935/write-cscx-in-terms-of-secx I'm asking in order to better understanding of Mathematica, and as a way to verify I'm solving my trig identities correctly. It's been a while since I've done identities, and I'm trying to brush off the cobwebs before its too late. I was told that I'll need this skill later on in Calculus.
