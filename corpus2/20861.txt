I'm trying to render an equation in the cylindrical coordinates, and I used the following codes:               With[{λ = 1, f = 50, R = 25},      ContourPlot[        -Mod[(Pi/λ)*(Sqrt[ρ^2 + f^2] - f), Pi] /. {ρ -> Norm[{x, y}], ϕ -> ArcTan[x, y]},        {x, -R, R}, {y, -R, R},        Contours -> 20, ContourLines -> False,        RegionFunction -> (Sqrt[#1^2 + #2^2] < R &),        ColorFunction -> "Rainbow", Frame -> False]]      However, I got a pattern which seems **not smooth** because points were sampled equally in the Cartesian coordinates. How can I get a smooth contour plot? Furthermore, can I plot such a pattern in the 3D coordinates? Thanks a lot. Here is an example of the output that I would like: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uHm7r.png)
