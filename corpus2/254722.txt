When I create an instance of a class the system allocates memory for all instance variables of the class. Some languages may call them fields or properties. But what about the code of the class methods? Are those duplicated too or do I have the code only once in memory? I know all instances got their own values - even inside the methods - but I would like to know about the code. Do I have instance variables and separate "instance methods"?
