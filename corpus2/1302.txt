I have a list of transformations like this:               list = {"A" -> "B", "B" -> "A", "C" -> "D"}      As this is used to plot an undirected graph with `GraphPlot`, I don't want to have an Edge between the vertices A-B _and_ B-A. I just want one of them. How do I remove either `A -> B` or `B -> A` from this list? In the end, I want the list to look like this:               {"A" -> "B", "C" -> "D"}      I've tried using `DeleteDuplicates`, but I don't think I understand the testing part of that function (I should add that I'm a Mathematica beginner ... ) I made a function that can compare two transformations:               CmpTrans[x_,y_] := (x[[1]]/.x) == y[[1]]      It returns `True` for `CmpTrans[A->B, B->A]`, but I can't seem to use this is the testing part of `DeleteDuplicates`.
