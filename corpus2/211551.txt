I always appreciated the Java language. It is known as a very secure platform and many banks use it in their web applications. I wanted to build a project for my school and I discussed the options with some developers. However, one of them said we should ignore Java ecause of vulnerabilities appreared recently in it. For this reason I want to make sure, what is the story behind this and does that mean that Java today considered not much secure as it was previously?
