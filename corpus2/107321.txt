I am currently taking an Assembly programming class, and I honestly find it extremely boring and tedious. While I've programmed some assembly before as part of a C++ program, I find what we are doing to be completely different than actual assembly code I've worked with (we are using a program called MARS MIPS, found here). Since we are using the MIPS architecture, which from what I gathered is hardly used any more, I find what we are learning hardly applicable to anything outside of the class. Likewise, I find myself not retaining the material we cover in class due to detachment from real world applications as well as the classroom setting itself. I've been trying to write my some code outside of the classroom to get familiar with it, but without any obvious real world applications, I find myself unmotivated to do so. **Is there any advice for trying to learn a programming language (such as assembly) for a class when I don't seen any real world application of it?** Or perhaps a more specific question to this problem would be: **Is there any real world application to the MIPS architecture which I am unaware of?** **EDIT:** I found the following information on StackOverflow concerning MIPS: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2635086/mips-processors-are-they-still-in- use-which-other-architecture-should-i-learn
