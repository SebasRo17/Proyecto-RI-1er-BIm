An associative array has many common similar names, hash, keymap, map, table, index. It's a map of keys and values but I cannot find a reputable definition of the phrase which tells me whether a map has to have order to be an associative array.   * What is a reputable definition of the term "Associative array"?   * Is an associative array ordereded? Personally I've always believed they have to be ordered because in JavaScript we claim Objects are not associative arrays because Objects are un-ordered maps of keys and values. However I may have been quoting that without a reference or a source.
