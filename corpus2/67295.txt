I am in grade 11 and we have learnt statements, objects, classes and arrays. We get programming test each week and I'm failing them. Now we have a project to do BlackJack using a JPanel form. Also memorizing the while loop is not the problem; I think that the problem is applying it to the situation (my friend never programs the same way as the teacher but still gets the same results).
