I find that I have to learn new technologies fairly regularly as a contractor in order to keep competitive. However, I also find that (not only, but especially) in these circumstances, I tend to end up with really bad code flow and need to do a lot of rework in order to achieve a canonical solution. While I realise that there are those contract programmers out there have no problems with taking the money and running, I wish to maintain good relationships through a good codebase that is not only easy, but fun to maintain -- which ultimately translates into a more lucrative business for me in the long run, as architectural risks are kept minimal. However, I wonder if there are ways by which I could improve my ability to learn technologies _while at the same time_ getting structure closer to what is correct / canon, right from the start -- particularly given some poorly documented techs, or those that are documented in a fragmentary fashion. While there is no substitute for experience, I want to streamline this process, reducing the considerable refactoring time I suffer at present, as it is something I experience often.
