Some programming languages are modeled on machine code, like assembly languages. Other languages are modeled on a natural language, the English language. Others are not modeled on either machine code or natural language. Languages such as PROLOG, for example, don't follow either model. I came across this Perl module Lingua::Romana::Perligata, that allows to write programs using a syntax that is very similar to Latin. Are there programming languages that have less positional syntax? Are there other languages or modules that allow you to write in syntaxes inspired by other natural languages, like French, Hebrew or Farsi? There is a very long list on Wikipedia, but most of those projects are dead. There is a related question on StackOverflow. The answer that was accepted is "Use Google".
