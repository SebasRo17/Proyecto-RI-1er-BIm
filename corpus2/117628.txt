I just read the question what are callback frameworks?, where the asker cites the following from Effective Java: > The disadvantages of wrapper classes are few. One caveat is that wrapper > classes are not suited for use in callback frameworks, wherein objects pass > selfreferences to other objects for subsequent invocations (“callbacks”). So I am curious, why are wrapper classes not suited for use in callback frameworks? And can you provide an example of what the problem is?
