I have calculated blooming and ripening times for a specific variety of plant, based on actual temperature data from over 40 years. I would like to create two histograms on a single axis; one for blossoming and one for ripening. Surely there is a more straightforward way than converting to integer dates and adjusting for leap yearsâ€¦ Here is some actual data (years have been removed) in the form of `{month, day}`:               {       {4, 3}, {4, 22}, {4, 15}, {4, 2}, {4, 18},        {4, 20}, {4, 12}, {3, 30}, {4, 4}, {4, 24},        {4, 26}, {3, 4}, {4, 26}, {4, 13}, {5, 1},        {4, 4}, {4, 8}, {4, 18}, {4, 9}, {4, 19},        {4, 10}, {4, 20}, {4, 3}, {4,4}, {3, 21},        {4, 19}, {4, 15}, {4, 17}, {4, 9}, {4, 17},        {4, 9}, {4, 8}, {4, 23}, {4, 17}, {4, 1},        {4, 10}, {4, 15}, {4, 15}, {4, 11}, {4, 15},        {4, 19}, {4, 22}, {4, 11}, {4, 4}, {4, 12},        {3, 27}, {3, 24}, {4, 26}, {3, 28}, {4, 16}     }
