In C# what is the best practice for encapsulating variables I need to use in multiple methods? Is it OK to simply declare them at the top of my class above the two methods? Also if I am using app settings from my config file should I use a getter? like this...               private string mySetting{ get { return WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["mySetting"]; } }      What best practice is?
