I like to build sophisticated plots by combining simpler ones with `Show[]`. Typically this involves setting non-default Plot-Options with the different Plot-Commands, like               Show[ ListPlot[ ,Op1], Plot[ ,Op2], Op3]      Unfortunately the `Show[]` command is not commutative, as               Show[ Plot[ ,Op2], ListPlot[ ,Op1], Op3]      can produce different results. My expectation was that putting settings in `Op3` should overwrite the ones in `Op1` and `Op2` however this does not work with options like `PlotMarkers` which are only available within `ListPlot[]`. The description of the `Show[g_1, g_2, g_3, ... ,g_i]`-command gives only two hints: > Options explicitly specified in Show override those included in the graphics > expression. and > The lists of non-default options in the `g_i` are concatenated. Iâ€™m not sure what this precisely means. Is               Show[ ListPlot[ ,Op1], Plot[ ,Op2], Op3]      equivalent to `Show[ ListPlot[ ,Union[Op1,Op2]], Plot[ ,Union[Op1,Op2]], Op3]`? while `Op3` overwrites whatever is in `Union[Op1,Op2]`? And there is one more question: In               Show[ g_1, g_2, g_3, ..., g_i ]      the Plot in `g_1` seems to be treated specially as it defines the `PlotRange` for the final image generated. **I would like to know the full set of rules how the Plot-Options are combined and to which Plot or Plots they are applied.**
