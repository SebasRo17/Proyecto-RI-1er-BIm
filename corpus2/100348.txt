I'm coming from a Java / PHP background and after I read this little essay by Paul Graham I started wondering about picking up a new language namely Common Lisp to speed up my work (I'm a web developer). I'm writing pet projects currently but I have some business plans for the future. Paul speaks about LISP in his essay as a "Secret weapon". I don't know if this statement is true after 10 years but I dipped my toes into a nice CL tutorial and it looks like that LISP may be superior for web development. Paul also mentions Python as a nice choice which I actually familiar with. My question is: which one should I choose for my future web projects? What I was thinking about:   * I'm not going to develop desktop applications so I can choose whatever language I prefer.   * python seems to have a very large community thus a mutch more libraries / frameworks compared to lisp   * I found out that lisp has some functionality (like macros) which cannot be found anywhere else   * I mostly work alone or with 1-2 other programmers but finding someone with lisp knowledge can be hard So what do you think?
