How can I copy a string with a bunch of `*Box` expressions without it blowing up into the raw expression?               text = Integrate::usage     (* Nice looking String *)          text//Head     (* String *)      After copying the output and pasting it into an input cell it looks like                "\!\(\*RowBox[{\"Integrate\", \"[\", RowBox[{StyleBox[\"f\", ....      Same thing happens when evaluating in place, so how can I do this without retyping the entire expression?
