I have seen several questions on here about touch typing and words per minute but not about improving ones ability to manipulate text using keyboard shortcuts, bindings etc. I have tried putting a **cheat sheet of keyboard shortcuts** next to my monitor but I can never incorporate them in my 'flow'. I have also tried the **'just use vi and don't touch the mouse'** method but that only helps me with navigating code and not editing. I would prefer to use some application (or game) to learn text manipulation. But it looks like nothing like that exists (app idea?). I'm open to other suggestions too.
