I want to define a function that involves a differentiation step that _Mathematica_ can do easily, which might be of the form               f[a_,b_,z_,j_]:=D[Hypergeometric1F1[a, b, z^2], {z, 2 j}]      (This will not work when given numeric `z`, but that is only a small part of the problem.) I will be using this for a limited set of `j`'s quite intensively in `z`. It is therefore important to me that the symbolic differentiation only take place once, so that _Mathematica_ is not repeatedly trying to do the same symbolic manipulations when running over a plot or a numerical integration. What is the cleanest/most elegant way to do this?
