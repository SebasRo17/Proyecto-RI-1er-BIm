I have a list of pairs, for example:               pairs={{13, 10}, {12, 14}, {10, 36}, {35, 11}, {3, 5}, {1, 6},     {20, 24}, {21, 22}, {33, 7}, {31, 8}, {31, 27}, {32, 25},      {21, 35}, {34, 19}, {18, 15}, {14, 16}, {9, 5}, {4, 7},      {1, 13}, {15, 2}, {6, 36}, {4, 34}, {8, 2}, {9, 3}, {25, 20},     {19, 26}, {22, 11}, {23, 12}, {32, 28}, {30, 33}, {23, 16},     {24, 17}, {29, 27}, {26, 30}, {17, 28}, {18, 29}};      `pairs` can be seen as the definition of a relation $R$. $x$ and $y$ satisfy the relation if and only if `{x,y}` $\in$ `pairs`. I need to compute the equivalence classes of the symmetric transitive closure of $R$. In other words, I need to compute a list `eqvclss`. The elements of `eqvclss` are lists themselves. For example, 13, 10, 36, 6, 1, ... should all be in the same list in `eqvclss`. (If you understand that, then I explained the question properly; if you don't, say so in the comments so I can try to improve).
