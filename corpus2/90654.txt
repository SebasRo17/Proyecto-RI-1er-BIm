Here is my situation. After almost 2 years I was able to convince my boss to use TDD, version control, coding standards for the entire team and a MVC framework for our web projects. I was finally there. It should be heaven but it's ending up like hell. I prepared some material about MVC and code samples showing common unit tests. Showed to the team, explained how things should be done and got their support. It seemed all fine, after all, team members were very experienced. I also made sure that the members had time to do things. At first, writing tests can take a very long time. So I tried to make them comfortable with "losing" this time without any manager asking them to do things quickly and dirty. After 15 days I was doing the first review of the code. And the result was not good. I found business logic on controllers and on views and the tests folder were almost empty How do you deal with these kind of things? Do you recommend any tools that can help me on code review or this is something that I have to do manually? I'm using PHP with Zend Framework.
