Performance testing is something that I, as a developer do when optimizing. However, if the change is purely optimization, should the QA or business user perform their own performance testing? I would reckon they should, aside from testing that the functionality remains the same. If that's the case, is it acceptable for them to test via manually timing the response time from the screen?
