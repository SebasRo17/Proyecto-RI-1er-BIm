It seems the V Model is just the Waterfall Model with the bottom half of the Waterfall bent upwards to form a V. I don't see how it adds anything new. From the diagrams, I also don't understand the flow. There are arrows pointing in all directions and I can't understand what comes first. Do we follow the V from the upper left, down to the bottom center then back up to the upper right? Or do we progress down the V doing everything higher before the item lower? The internet is lacking a sufficient explanation of this model. It would be awesome if someone can explain it in true StackExchange form :) ![V Model](http://i.stack.imgur.com/N9Hm4.jpg)
