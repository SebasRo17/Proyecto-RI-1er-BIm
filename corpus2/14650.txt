Is it possible to extract the `Method` which is used in functions like `NMinimize`, `FindRoot`, `FindMinimium`, and partners when one doesn't set this option explicitly? Basic example:               NMinimize[x^4 - 3 x^2 - x, x]      What is used as `Method` here? I expected to find some setting in `SystemOptions[]` but was unable to. Obviously `AbsoluteOptions[expr]` cannot be used in such a case since unlike a e.g. graphic, the minimization result does not contain this option information anymore. Here is what is stated in the documentation of `Method`: > With the default setting `Method -> Automatic`, _Mathematica_ will > automatically try to pick the best method for a particular computation. This tells us the chosen `Method` depends on the input problem. Therefore, a fixed setting in `SystemOptions` wouldn't make sense. Additionally, there exists a document describing some internal implementations. Basically, you can extract most information from there, but I was hoping for a way to extract the used `Method` during a run.
