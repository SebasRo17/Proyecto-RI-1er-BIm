I have been tasked with setting up a SQL Development environment, and i was wondering if anyone has any advice on getting this right? So far, I have restored the prod DB onto another box, and changed all our SSIS packages to use XML configuration files so we can deploy them to either environment without changing the DB connection setting. My plan was to restore the prod DB over the dev DB every 2 weeks (assuming its agreed by all the other developers). Also, i was thinking i would have a UAT DB restored every 1 or 2 weeks to test deploying the changes to prod. The UAT DB would only exist for a day or 2 to test things, and then the actual deployment would happen into the prod environment. Can anyone thnk of anything else that would be good to do, or has any advice on other considerations etc?
