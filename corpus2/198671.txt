I program in C mostly. However, it is pretty obvious that many more commercial applications are done in C++. As far as I can tell, C++ is a very complex language, with seemingly convoluted syntax and too many constructs. C++ also encourages the abuse of Objects where structs and functions will do. In fact, the only significant advantage I see in C++ is the use of templated generic types (though, according to the developers of Go, generics are bad for programs). Basically, my question is, did I miss something? Or is C++ more popular purely by merit of luck or marketing? Edit: I'm sorry that I apparently asked a loaded question; in retrospect I can see that the way I worded it appears to be complete flamebait. What I meant was, since C++ has so many different constructs and paradigms available to it, why hasn't it been replaced by languages that do less but are better at that specific thing? For instance, both Java and C# are much better suited for OOP than C++ is, while C is much simpler for system-level programming, and something like lisp is more suited for functional programming. Why is C++ used over one or more of these other languages?
