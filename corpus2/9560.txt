I have the following mapping on the complex plane: $$ z \mapsto \tau \mu z-1, $$ where $\mu$ is complex, $\tau$ is real number. I want to draw the image of left unit semidisk and play with $\tau$.               μ = 0.16255558520216132` + 0.1849493244071408` I;          pic[τ_] := Block[{d, ds},        d = Disk[{0, 0}, 1, {π/2, 3 π/2}];        ds =         Fold[GeometricTransformation, d,            {RotationTransform[Arg@#, {0, 0}],             ScalingTransform[τ Abs@# {1, 1}],             TranslationTransform[{-1, 0}]             }] & @ μ;        Graphics@{Gray, d, Red, Opacity[.5], ds}        ];          Manipulate[      Dynamic@Show[pic[τ], Frame -> True, Axes -> True,         AxesOrigin -> {0, 0}, PlotRange -> zz {{-100, 100}, {-100, 100}},        ImageSize -> 400        ],      {τ, 0.01, 1000, 0.01},      {zz, 0.01, 10, 0.01}      ]      Here `zz` is introduced to control zooming. The problem is that I get different (wrong) images for different zooms. It is clearly seen for big $\tau$'s. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/A33DX.png)![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/r4Lll.png)![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2rooj.png) It looks very like a bug, but I can not rule out that I'm making some silly mistake (Mathematica 8.0.4). So, what is the problem here and what is the best way of doing the job (I have several mappings for different $\mu$ actually)?
