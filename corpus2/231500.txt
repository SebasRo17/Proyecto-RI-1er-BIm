I have been doing some research on accessing a DB from mobile devices. There are so many different ways of doing it. There are also multiple ways to make it secure. What is a good way to access a database from a mobile device securely? Also considering my specific case, where I have an existing WCF service which does everything I would need for the app, I would like to re-use it. I have been working on using jsonp calls to the service and develop apps for iOS, Android and windows phone. The calls are secured by HTTPS and I would be implementing some authentication policy for the calls. But how secure would all this be? I have some really sensitive data to worry about. I am using HTML5 and JS for app development to keep it uniform and less difficult to manage for all platforms. How do I access the database and keep my data secure?
