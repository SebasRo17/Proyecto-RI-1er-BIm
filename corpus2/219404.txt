I'm kind of new to PHP. I can create basic sites with login/registration, etc., but I always struggle to build complex sites with lots of features, because eventually the code becomes messy and I just run into more and more little bugs, and then fixing those produces another, and so on. I realise that that's partially to do with me simply not writing clean code (I'm working on that!) but I would also probably benefit from using a framework. But is using ready-made frameworks "unprofessional"? Would a big site such a YouTube or Facebook use a framework like CakePHP or CodeIgniter?
