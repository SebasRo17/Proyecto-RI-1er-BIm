I was reading this article and was wondering, do we get rid of all switch statements by replacing them with a Dictionary or a Factory so that there are no switch statements at all in my projects. Something did not quite add up. The question is, do switch statements have any real use or do we go ahead and replace them with either a dictionary or a factory method (in using a factory method, of course, there will be a minimum use of switch statements for creating the objects using the factory...but that is about it).
