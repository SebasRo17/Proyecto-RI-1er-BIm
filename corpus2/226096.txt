In my app, I use a widget with a loading spinner to signify that a network request is waiting. On failure, there will be another view which contains a failure message and a "Reload" button. My question is, since both of these views/widgets will ALWAYS be used together (either one or the other will be shown - or neither), should I merge them into a single widget? Would that be bad or good practice? That way I wouldn't have to prepare them both whenever I want to use one of them. The main disadvantage I see is that modularity would be destroyed.
