I would like to plot an expression (like `TreeForm` does), but using the new `TreeGraph` functionality. `TreeGraph` takes as input a set of edges (of the form `a -> b`), so it seems that to solve the problem it is necessary to turn an expression into a set of edges. For example `Sin[Plus[a, b]]` would need to be transformed into: `{Sin -> Plus, Plus -> a, Plus -> b}`. How can this transformation be done for any _Mathematica_ expression? Thanks!
