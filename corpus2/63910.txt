In my work I have started development of a website/webapp that will be viewed primarily on smartphones and tablet. I have now been given the task of buying the necessary hardware for testing the webapp. As I'm not really a mobile-nerd, I'm not really up to date with the latest and greatest on the mobile market. So I need some advice on which units to buy. Some initial thoughts   1. I would like to cover the browsers in the most common systems; iOS, Android and Symbian? (are there any more I should know about?).   2. I would like each browser in both Phone size and tablet size. iPhone and iPad seems like a given choice, but after that my knowledge is limited. I hope this is in the realms of this site, feel free to move this question to another SE site if this question fits better somewhere else. Thanks in advance! **Edit:** In this scenario there aren't really any customer who can pay, this is an app that shall be used by our customers but is developed on our own initiative. Secondly, I get the feeling that for example the iPhone simulator uses the safari desktop browser for rendering the content (am I wrong?), if that is the case, how does it cope with the slight defferences in the desktop version and the phone version (for eaxample videos not being able to autostart on the phone and stuff like that). I can be totally wrong here, just raising the question.
