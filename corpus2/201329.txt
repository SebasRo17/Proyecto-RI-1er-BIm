I'm reading through a PDF on C++ programming from this page on Stanford's site. It says that when you're creating a C++ header file for a library interface, use a `#ifndef` preprocessor command to make sure you don't compile the same interface twice. So, your header would look something like this:               /**       MyFile.h     */          #ifndef _MyFile_h     #define _MyFile_h          // Function prototypes          #endif      But, I've always heard people say that using preprocessor commands like `#define` is (or quickly leads to) bad coding practice. I'm just starting to learn C++, so I don't want to get something ingrained that is bad. **Question: Is it "proper" coding style to use preprocessor commands as above?**
