What is causing the error in this code?               N0 = 4; μ = 2; ρ = 1; d = 1; n = 1;     eqone = Flatten[                Join[                  Table[x[i]''[t] == ϵ*(1 - x[i][t]^2)*x[i]'[t] - x[i][t] + d (z[t] - x[i][t]),                         {i, 0, N0}],                   {z'[t] == ρ*d/n (Sum[x[i][t] - z[t], {i, 0, N0}])}, z[0]==0,                     x[0][0] == 1, x[0]'[0] == .5, x[N0/2][0] == 0, x[N0/2]'[0] == 0},                  Table[x[i]'[0] == 0, {i, 1, N0/2 - 1}],                   Table[x[i][0] == 0, {i, 1, N0/2 - 1}],                  Table[x[i]'[0] == 0, {i, N0/2 + 1, N0}],                   Table[x[i][0] == 0, {i, N0/2 + 1, N0}]                    ]                    ]      and once I get my equations, I should be able to solve the differential equation, but it isn't working. I get a message that starts out: > The function value is not a list of numbers with dimensions ... I think I have to flatten something again in the NDSolve, but I'm not entirely sure how to do that and why.               eqtwo = NDSolve[eqone, {Table[x[i], {i, 0, N0}],z}, {t, 100}]
