Have I missed something or is there no built-in which mimics the behaviour of _do ... while_ loop? I am looking for a construct that evaluates `procedure` **once** and then repeatedly evaluates it while `test` is not fulfilled. I'm ended up using:               While[procedure; test, {}]      But clearly the second argument is redundant, so I have a feeling that I'm missing something. Maybe not, but I just want to be sure :)
