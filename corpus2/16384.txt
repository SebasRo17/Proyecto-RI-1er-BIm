Here is my situation. My boss wants to know everthing I am doing. We are using Scrum so we do 15 minutes daily meeting and I attend everyday.. I am perfectly fine with this and actually interested in this agile that my company started to practice.. My concern is my boss also want to be reported almost every issue I am handling for production and QA. If some production issue escalated to me and my boss is not included in the e-mail trail, she would storm me and escalate it to the director. If I fix one bug and deploy QA, she would like to know,,, in written. I stand up to the team once saying I attend daily scrum meeting and explain my status as detail as possbile, why I should send out e-mail again? I feel being micro managed. I feel there is no ownership for any task for programmers even we are practicing Agile. But would it be just my emotion? Maybe all she wanted is visibility of the task I am doing.. What do you fellow programmers think the difference between visibility of the task and micro-management.
