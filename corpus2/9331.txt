Is it possible to get a screenshot of the entire desktop directly in _Mathematica_? I am on Ubuntu running _Mathematica_ 8. For some reason `GUIScreenShot[]` fails. But something like `GUIScreenShot[{{0, 500}, {0, 500}}]` works It is strange that in the reference               GUIScreenShot[]      is given as an example (last one), with the caption **Capture the entire screen:**. But when I copy it and paste it in a notebook, it expects a parameter! (I have included the code `Needs["GUIKit`"]`) I get the error as shown in this image ![Screenshot of the image](http://i.stack.imgur.com/h78MS.png)
