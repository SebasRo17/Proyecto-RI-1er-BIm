I've defined three symbolic abstract matrices X, M and S as shown below.               In[1]:= $Assumptions = {      Element[X, Matrices[{k, 1}]],     Element[M, Matrices[{k, 1}]],     Element[S, Matrices[{k, k}, Reals, Symmetric[{1, 2}]]]     };          In[7]:= prodA = TensorTranspose[X].S.M;             prodB = TensorTranspose[M].S.X;          In[12]:= TensorReduce[prodA + prodB]     Out[12]= TensorTranspose[M, {2, 1}].S.X + TensorTranspose[X, {2, 1}].S.M      Since the S is a square and symmetric matrix, the production results prodA and prodB should be equal. How can I let the output reflect that? I need the output show something like 2TensorTranspose[X].S.M.
