This is a follow-up question from linking the libraries for CUDALlink in Ubuntu 12.10. The tests that I execute (`CUDAQ[]`, `CUDAInformation[]`, `CUDADriver[]`) seem to give successful outputs. However, when I try to execute actual CUDA commands the results are clearly wrong. For instance, `CUDATranspose[Table[i, {i, 2}, {j, 2}]]` returns                   {{140191557896416,140191327433448},{17523916273012,0}}      And the numbers change each time I execute it. I also noticed that some commands complain that CUDALink is actually not initialised, like `CUDADot[Table[i, {i, 2}, {j, 2}], Table[i, {i, 2}, {j, 2}]]`:                   CUDADot::notinit: CUDALink is not initialized      But according to `CUDAQ[]`, `CUDAInformation[]` and `CUDADriver[]` it should be. Before trying to solve the problem, how can I determine _where_ it is? Is it within Mathematica? At the NVIDIA drivers level? Does it have to do with the `gcc` version?
