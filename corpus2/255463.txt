I am currently reading the book RESTful Web APIs by Leonard Richardson, Mike Amundsen and Sam Ruby, that describes the Collection+JSON pattern, and while searching around the web during my exploration of the information in the book, I stumbled upon JSON API. Now I am thinking which to choose? And are there many more attempts and standardizing how a RESTful JSON API should look? So I looked around and found that big players like github invents there own! (Github+JSON) Others just use plain old, no standardized JSON formatting. So what is up with this? Are people actually using Collection+JSON or is it as standardized as Github+JSON, in the practical world? What about JSON API? What have others betted on? What are others doing in this matter?
