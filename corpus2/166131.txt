I am primarily a Web Developer (back end programming) - but intend to offer a complete service to my clients, from concept, to brand design, photoshop mock- ups and everything else in between. I'm aware that it's a good idea to outsource this design aspect of the project to someone that I trust. My question is more about the process: I imagine that in order for the designer to really grasp what the client wants to create, they would need some sort of interaction. Therefore, does anyone know if it is common to bring both parties into a 3 way discussion? Or is it more common to get all of the info from the client, and then pass it onto the designer, and act as a back and forth middleman? Afterall, I am the designer's client. Any insight into this would be great
