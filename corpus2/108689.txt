Several times after posting over at Stack Overflow, I have found that the problem I have is somewhat specific, and may have issues rooted elsewhere in my code. These are very difficult to solve with a question, and I often end up getting poor or irrelevant answers. When a problem is just too localized or to complex for Stack Overflow to be any use, what should I be doing to break down the problem so it can be solved? How can I approach peers or user groups about problems like these?
