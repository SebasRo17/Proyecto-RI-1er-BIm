I have an ASP.Net application that is using a MySQL database. My queries are not executing as fast as I would like them too. Are there some standard ways to increase the speed of a MySQL database short of putting it on a faster PC. For example, (I'm not sure if these are true or not) using prepared statements over transactional SQL. Using foreign keys if applicable? Things along those lines. EDIT: The database is on a remote machine
