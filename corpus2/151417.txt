Is it possible define methods from **the same class** in different "CPP" files? * * * I have header file "myClass.h" with:               class myClass     {     public:         // methods for counting         ...         // methods for other         ...     };      I would like to define "methods for counting" in one CPP and "methods for other" in other CPP. For clarity. Both groups of methods sometime use the same attributes. Is it possible? Thanks :).
