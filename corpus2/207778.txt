I thought Doctrine 2 DBAL prepared statements were safe from SQLi. But I found this confusing bit in the docs: > By default the Doctrine DBAL does no escaping. Escaping is a very tricky > business to do automatically, therefore there is none by default. When you > use the Doctrine DBAL as standalone, you have to take care of this yourself. What does that mean exactly? If someone tries to inject malicious code, will the query fail (as opposed to insert escaped) because the RDBMS protects me? Or I'm not protected at all? I'm using PostgreSQL as my RDBMS.
