In `Plot`, I would like to use my own font, eg Inconsolata, for operators such as ×, so I set `OperatorSubstitution` to `False` as follows.               Plot[       x,       {x, 0, 10^10},       BaseStyle -> {PrivateFontOptions -> {"OperatorSubstitution" -> False}},        LabelStyle -> {FontFamily -> "Inconsolata"}     ]      There are three vector formats into which I can export the figure: SVG, EPS, and PDF. Only the SVG export gives the correct result, ie the character × is in the font specified. The others have the following issues. My first question is: **Are they bugs?**   * PDF export: operators are omitted altogether.   * EPS export: the instruction of setting `OperatorSubstitution` is omitted, ie font substitution for operators still occur. I'm using Mathematica 9 for Mac. My second question is: **Is there any way to work around the issue with PDF export?**
