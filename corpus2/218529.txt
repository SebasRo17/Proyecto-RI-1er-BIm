I had the following DB schema:               Customer   Car     Rental     -------   ----     ------     Name      Name     Car_ID     ID        ID       Customer_ID                        Date      This is said to be non normalized as the date can repeat (multiple customers can rent a car at the same day). So the teacher said it should be like:               Customer  Car Date     ------    --- ----      and linked with foreign keys. Well I do not get that - how can I then simply enter that "John rented a BMW on 2/3/2013"?
