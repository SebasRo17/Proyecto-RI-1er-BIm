A profesional developer Zed Shaw says this: > Which programming language you learn and use doesn't matter.

So, being neutral to languages is a sign of a good/pro developer? We see worshipping and holywars what language is better. The good coder does not care about tools, he only thinks what software he writes (like writer does not care about pen he uses - he thinks about the BOOK content)   1. should a programmer develop total ignorance to language as tool he uses?   2. **is it a sign of pro developer** , if he does not care what language to use?
