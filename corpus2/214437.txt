Whenever I come across a new API or programming language or even simple Linux man pages, I always (ever since I remember) avoided them and instead lazily relied on examples for gaining understanding of new concepts. Subconsciously, I avoid documentation/APIs whenever it is not straightforward or cryptic or just plain boring. It's been years since I began programming and now I feel like I need to mend my ways as I now realize that I'm causing more damage by refraining from reading cryptic/difficult documentation as it is still a million times better than examples as the official documentation has more coverage than any example out there. Even after realizing that examples should be treated as "added" value instead of the "primary" source for learning. How do I break this bad habit as a programmer or am I overthinking?
