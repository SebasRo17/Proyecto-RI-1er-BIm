My code simulates a golf ball flight in 2 dimensions. I am not interested in the algebraic solution at all, but rather with the parametric plot. When I enter this code I get numerous errors. I have multiple other variations of these equations that I also need to plot, but I am starting with the simplest of these with no luck at all. I am sure this is not even close to what I need, so I am hoping someone with more experience in _Mathematica_ will lend me some guidance in how to approach this.
