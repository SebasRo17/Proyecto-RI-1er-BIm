What is the best choice LINQ TO SQL (.DBML) or using ADO.NET with procedures for a database with 29 tables and about 30 concurrent users that will run the system that I am going to build? I know that ADO.NET is faster than LINQ TO SQL but it is so much simpler to work with LINQ TO SQL. Will LINQ TO SQL handle all the concurrency? Or will there be problems in performance? The system I am going to build will be a WCF service using multiple layers:   * Service layer   * Business    * Repositories   * Data Access Layer
