When I set a variable to an object in VBA / VBScript, I always need to prefix the statement with "Set" such as: `Set Dict = CreateObject("Scripting.Dictionary")` If I set a variable to a primitive or array value, I have to omit the "Set" such as: `Num = 123` This is different from languages such as JavaScript, PHP, Python etc. Is there some technical reason why they have this requirement in VBA / VBScript?
