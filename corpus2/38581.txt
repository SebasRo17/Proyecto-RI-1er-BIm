Is it possible to have "Tufte" style figure axes? That is so that the axes do not need to connect or span the entire data range? For an example of what I mean from the R's default histogram style: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4TXsD.png) I know how to get the ticks out etc ... but not how to break the axes at the origin or only draw the axes/frame for a subset of the graphic range.
