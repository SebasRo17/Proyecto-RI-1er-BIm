This is actually somewhat related to the question I asked yesterday about why both a Stack _and_ a Heap are necessary in the applications we use today (and why we can't just go with a Heap instead of both, in order to have a simple & singular standard to go by). However, many of the responses indicated that a Stack is _irreplaceable_ due to the fact that is many hundreds (or thousands) of times faster than trying to allocate/reference the Heap. I know there is a problem with dynamic storage allocation if we do away with the Heap, but isn't there a way around this, or perhaps, a way to improve on the Stack so that it can handle dynamic memory allocation?
