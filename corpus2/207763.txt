I am handling a team of a few guys working on a software module in a large project. As per our estimates our module is getting delayed by a week. Since we can not have this delay, our client and our manager arrive at a decision that we need to work on few weekends (3-4) to try to finish the work. All members of the team are aware of this and understand this and since its just a matter of 3-4 extra days, so we decide to work on weekends to meet the deadline. But one of the team members is not following this. From last three weekends he has some or the other reason to not come on weekend. He is not even willing to put up extra hours during weekdays. Personally I don't care about the number of hours he works as long as he/(any one) can finish their work to meet the deadline. Please let me know how to handle this situation?
