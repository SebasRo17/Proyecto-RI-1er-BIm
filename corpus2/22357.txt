once again I am stuck solving a seemingly easy problem :( I would like to make a List of tables by importing data from several txt- Files. Importing the data into a table works so far and I am able to do ListPlots etc. The txt-file-names follow a simple pattern: `txtFile_1.txt, txtFile_2.txt, ...` **My take on the problem is the following:**                   testList = List[1, 2, 3, 4]         For[i = 1, i < 4, i++             testList[[i]] =             Import["C:\\txtFiles\\txtFile_" <> ToString[i] <> ".txt" <>               ToString[i] <> ".txt", "Data"];          ]      _Background:_ I would like to have the tables in the list to be able to access them via `testList[[i]]` and in order to do consecutive ListPlots via a `for`-loop etc...
