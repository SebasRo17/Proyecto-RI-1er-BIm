In what way(s) is LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine) Low Level? (At the time of writing, I did not find this expansion of the abbreviation "LLVM" on its web site, but on Wikipedia.) Is it called "Low Level" in what is it designed for (a compiler infrastructure) or because it is works on a "lower level" than other tools? As a (kind of) "illustration" of this, is LLVM lower-level than the JVM and CLR, or is it only _designed_ for "lower level" uses?
