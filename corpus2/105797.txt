I read A programmer should concentrate on at least how many languages?, and I found out that I don't know languages in number 2, 3 of first answer. I want to learn more languages to increase my knowledge and programming skill. However, usually in companies they use fixed framework and languages and changes seldom. So I'm not sure if I can get a chance to learn those languages and I think it would be same to other programmers. However, I've seen many developers who knows multiple languages in here. How do you get chances to learn many languages? **Update** I think, there are many people who feel uncomfortable because it seems I don't want study in my spare time at all. Actually, that's not true.:) I'm an enthusiast programmer and that's why I posted this kind of question here. I study in my spare time but I just thought it would be not enough to be skillful in languages. Anyway, thanks for all answers!
