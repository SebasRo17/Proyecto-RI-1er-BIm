I have noticed where I work people are keen on storing information in file names, and parsing the file names. To me this doesn't seem to be especially good practice. I already see the occasional issues with scripts globbing for a file, and getting the wrong one because another file matches first.We are also discussing how to get around problems with separators for the fields. Is it considered bad practice or not? What are other accepted solutions for retrieving files from a file system based on some type of metadata?
