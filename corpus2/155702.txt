What's the best way to give the end-user of my web application the ability to open, edit and save (via browser) word documents that are stored in my database? I have this working by doing an html conversion of the file (via Aspose Words) but this method seems not even close to flawless and i'm trying to improve this. Is integrating with google docs possible/good? Their edition seems awesome and very powerful. I can't use any Microsoft Word objects (and this is even discouraged by MS). EDIT: The application is developed in .NET and currently uses the .NET framework 2.0. However, as this is fairly obsolete the idea is to restart from scratch and therefore use the 4.0 framework and C# or VB.
