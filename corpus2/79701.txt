I just read this question asking how to determine if a senior developer's advice is bad and I realized that I couldn't really relate to his situation since I don't have a mentor. I also realized that I'm probably the most senior developer at the office, at least within my field. Which I suppose is remarkable considering that I'm only 22 and graduated from college a year ago. I realized that I make most of the design decisions and that I write my code however I feel like it. While I'm happy with that I feel like it would be good to be surrounded by superior developers that I could learn from. As it stands right now I'm mostly applying knowledge I've already acquired. Will not having a mentor at this point in my career have negative impacts later in my career?
