My development team presently uses the following software in our workflow:   * JIRA   * Bamboo (Atlassian continuous integration)   * Greenhopper (Atlassian agile project management)   * Confluence   * Git, hosted on BitBucket   * Visual Studio 2012 As you can see we are quite heavily invested in the Atlassian ecosystem. We are considering a move to TFS so we can get the niceties of advanced Visual Studio integrations such as code reviews and more importantly the Microsoft Test Manager. My previous experience with TFS was with 2005 or 2008 (I can't remember) and I have bad memories of it, although not quite as bad as my time with ClearCase. What criteria should we be looking at in order to properly evaluate our move to TFS?
