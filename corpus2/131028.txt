I'm currently working as a C++ developer in a software security department, but not as a researcher or whitehat hacker. Security is an interest of mine, mainly in the areas where I can exploit code or reverse engineer executables/communication/protocols. I've done some work in reverse engineering but only as a hobby (ie. modifying a saved game file for a game). As a person that knows C, C++ and some assembly (MASM), what types of resources would you recommend that I read so that I may gain more knowledge about these fields? Books, blogs, and articles would probably be best. Currently I'm reading 24 Deadly Sins of Software Security: Programming Flaws and How to Fix Them.
