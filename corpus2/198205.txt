Here are reasons why one would want this: 1) We often don't use all the dlls but we force customers to install the entire .NET framework. It would be great to just deploy the dlls we need. 2) We often want to update our application and the framework but that sometimes requires a machine reboot because other applications are using it. 3) A full .NET installation usually takes quite a bit of time. An xcopy type private deployment could be much faster. It seems to me that mono allows private deployment which solves all these issues. Thanks
