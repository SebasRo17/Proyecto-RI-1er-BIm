http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10941249/separate-rest-json-api-server-and- client In light of this post, I wanted to ask questions regarding Django and specifically the implementation methods of getting one of these client side technologies to work with Django. Currently, I have a backend that is setup that uses Django Rest Framework to serialize the data. My problem though, is I'm not sure how to get the client side to access the backend. Django is a MVC framework. Originally I thought that I could just take out the View, and just implement the model and controller. Then, I would write complete separate View code so to speak using Backbone/Ember/Angularjs. Then the client would access the REST resources. How would I combine these two later if I wanted to deploy this to Heroku? Heroku only takes a whole Django application. How can I get the client code on there as well then? The other option, which I've seen before, is to NOT take out the View completely, but to use Django templates WITH Backbone/Ember/Angularjs. Then, I can just simply put these js files in the "static" folder so to speak. But then that seems weird, because then I'd have a View on the server side (correct me if I'm wrong), that accesses my own REST resources. I tried this, but for some reason even though my page retrieves the javascript files, it does not seem to be working as expected.
