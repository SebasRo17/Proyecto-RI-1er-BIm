I was reading Why do we have to use `break` in `switch`?, and it led me to wonder why implicit fall-through is allowed in some languages (such as PHP and JavaScript), while there is no support (AFAIK) for explicit fall-through. It's not like a new keyword would need to be created, as `continue` would be perfectly appropriate, and would solve any issues of ambiguity for whether the author meant for a case to fall through. The currently supported form is:               switch (s) {         case 1:             ...             break;         case 2:             ... //ambiguous, was break forgotten?         case 3:             ...             break;         default:             ...             break;     }      Whereas it would make sense for it to be written as:               switch (s) {         case 1:             ...             break;         case 2:             ...             continue; //unambiguous, the author was explicit         case 3:             ...             break;         default:             ...             break;     }      For purposes of this question lets ignore the issue of whether or not fall- throughs are a good coding style. ### Are there any languages that exist that allow fall-through and have made it explicit? ### Are there any historical reasons that `switch` allows for implicit fall- through instead of explicit?
