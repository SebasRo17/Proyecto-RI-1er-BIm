Is better to keep our Membership stuff on the DefaultConnection and create another connection (another database) for our data? Or just one database for all? If I have a _MyAppContext_ and I want migrations for that context, It seems that I cannot have migrations for _UserContext_ (In other words, I can just migrate one context) So, having two different databases I can migrate or the users (maybe membership migration is weird) or the web data. Or, I can mix the _UserContext_ and _MyAppContext_ in one _UserAndAppContext_ and migrate all in one place, but this mixing also seems weird. What's the normal way to do this, one or two databases and what should be migrated?
