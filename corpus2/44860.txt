Today I read the new entry on WolframBlog with all it's nice little demos. I was realy interested in those with astronomic informations, but trying these with my own Mathematica I was irritated: Steven Wolfram wrote in the blog: "... You can use the Wolfram Language completely interactively, using the notebook interface we built for Mathematica." So I typed, like he did:               In: Sunrise[]     Out: Sunrise[]      So I didn't get the result in the blog. Same with other demos from the blog. So my question is: How can I use Wolfram Language with Mathematica? And how can I get it? (Yes I know, with indirections (WeatherData) I could do it with Mathematica too, but I wanted to do it like in the blog's demos.)
