I started programming later in my career (mid 30's) simply because I enjoyed it and had an opportunity to contribute at my job. While I still have tons to learn, at some stage I would like to know what is going on the area of computer science research. I'm wondering if folks here on the exchange can point me in the right direction of some methods or resources; good journals, etc. Are there some good topics to start with? Also, in what areas was reading research papers most helpful to you?
