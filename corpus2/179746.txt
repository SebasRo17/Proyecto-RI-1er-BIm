I am currently working on a rather large project, and I have used JUnit and EasyMock to fairly extensively unit test functionality. I am now interested in what other types of testing I should worry about. As a developer is it my responsibility to worry about things like functional, or regression testing? Is there a good way to integrate these in a useable way in tools such as Maven/Ant/Gradle? Are these better suited for a Tester or BA? Are there other useful types of testing that I am missing?
