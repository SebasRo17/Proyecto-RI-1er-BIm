I work for a subsidiary of a large world wide company. This was not a subsidiary from the beginning, it was a company bought by the larger company. We seem to be heading toward a death march and I'm wondering if there is anything I (or my team) can do to either resolve the management problems or complete the project in spite of them. It's a typical Daily WTF situation:   * Unrealistic deadlines (management "estimated" 6 months, dev team needs 18 months _minimum_ );   * Long (up to 3h) daily meetings, further cutting our productivity;   * Management refuses to budge on the schedule because they want to look good to the new owners;   * Developers being bullied, accused of incompetence, put on a "wall of shame", etc.   * Team lead just resigned and morale is at an all-time low. I'd like to leave - most of the dev team is considering it - but I'm reluctant to quit. I really need the money, and I've also only been here for a short time (5 months) after a period of unemployment, so quitting now might raise red flags for prospective employers. Are there any strategies which might be effective in fostering more cooperation from the management, or at least minimizing the ongoing disruptions? **EDIT:** _I received great advice from answers to this question. I can't really accept an answer because I can't accept more than one and it would be unfair for the others._ _We've decided to do our best at work given the circumstances. We're pushing back on management to see if we can actually obtain help from them (as new people, new deadline etc). At the same time I'm looking for a new job (as my colleagues were already doing)._ _We'll see what happens and plan accordingly. But one thing is sure: Sacrificing ourselves on the corporate shrine is out of the question._ _Thank you all!_
