I am litle curious about what sorting algorithm is using OrderBy (linq to objects). quicksort? heapsort? introspective sort ? As i see in MSDN documentation List.Sort is using introspective sort: see: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b0zbh7b6.aspx Maybe OrderBy use the same? If we go to order by documetation i don't see much information: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en- us/library/system.linq.enumerable.orderby(v=vs.110).aspx
