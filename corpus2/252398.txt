Due to partnerships, we are required to host our website through our partner company. However, we had an idea that perhaps we could offload the document storage to an AWS document server. The thinking is that we could serve the html from our server, and serve any large document files from the AWS server, which would greatly reduce our bandwidth load. Having never used AWS, can I simply provide a relatively secure AWS URL to the browser which will pull the document from AWS and bypass our web server altogether?
