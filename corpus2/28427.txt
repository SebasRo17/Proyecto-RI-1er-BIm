I want to create a long, skinny `Image` containing only text. This makes a square image of the default size.               Image@Graphics[      {       FontSize->20,       Text["now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country"]      }     ]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ANRhV.png) So I prescribe the dimensions I want:               Image@Graphics[      {       FontSize->20,       Text["now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country"]      },      ImageSize->{1000,30}     ]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/t0CP5.png) and the result is cropped well inside the `ImageSize` so some of the text is missing. But the `Graphics` alone is appearing correctly.               Graphics[      {       FontSize->20,       Text["now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country"]      },      ImageSize->{1000,30}     ]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2WAaJ.png) Why does `Image` mysteriously crop the input?
