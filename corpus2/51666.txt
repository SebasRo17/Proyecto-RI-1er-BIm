I want to solve the fallowing equation:               Solve[-(2/x^3) - 1/x^(5/2) - 1/x^2 + (4 Log[Sqrt[E] x])/x^3 == 0, x]      _Mathematica_ complaints: > This system cannot be solved with the methods available to Solve Does anybody know how to circumvent this problem?   Maybe there is a clever approximation of the `Log[x]/x^3` term?
