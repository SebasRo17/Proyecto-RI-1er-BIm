I have a function like: $$ f(E)= \Sigma_{n=0} \Sigma_{\ell=0} \, \delta\left(E+\frac{\ell+2n+2} {R\sec{\rho}}\right) w(n,\rho,\ell)\,, $$ i.e. the function is zero unless $$ E=-\frac{(\ell+2n+2)}{R\sec{\rho}} $$ and $(n,\ell)$ can take only integer values from zero (the function $w$ is boring and not important for the problem, and $\rho$ and $R$ are just constants.). How can I use Mathematica to plot this function against $E$? 1) I was thinking of use `Solve` with the domain `Integers` to spit out the (one or) two pairs of $(n,\ell)$ corresponding to each integer value $m=-(\ell+2n+2)$. Then I know that $E_m=-m/(R\sec{\rho})$, and I can compute $f(E_m)$ by summing the (one or) two corresponding $w(n,\rho,\ell)$ functions. Finally I can make a `ListPlot`. This didn't quite work as `Solve` spits out these `ConditionalExpression`s rather than `Integers` for some reason. Any other ideas? The `Solve` code I was using: (for example with $m=-7$)               Solve[7 == ell + 2 n + 1, {ell, n}, Integers]
