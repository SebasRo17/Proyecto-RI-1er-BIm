This works:               dogs = {{"chow", "medium", "brown"}};     dogs = Append[dogs, {"poodle", "small", "white"}];     dogs//TableForm         chow   medium brown         poodle small  white      but this doesn't:               add[name_, fields_] := (name = Append[name, fields])       add[dogs, {"pug", "small", "tan"}]     Set::shape: Lists {{chow,medium,brown},{poodle,small,white}} and {{chow,medium,brown},{poodle,small,white},{pug,small,tan}} are not the same shape. >>        The problem is probably very obvious, but I don't see it.
