Has it ever happened to you that you are a good developer but suddenly you need to lead a team or are responsible for some PM activities as well? Did you find that it affected your productivity? How did you handle it? I love my job, but I sometimes feel I was much happier as a programmer and the additional burden of being a Project Manager is currently affecting my productivity as a developer. What do you guys suggest as remedies to this? I do not have an alternative currently to quit from my job - basically because Im working for a startup that I co-founded.
