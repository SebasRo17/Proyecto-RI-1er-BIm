Regarding source folder hierarchy, there are always some common features, such as the `src`, `doc` or `test` folders, which have rather easy-to-understand contents. However, I realized that big projects have both a `lib` and `vendor` folders, while I had always thought they were the same, as their names hint at including “third-party `libraries` from external `vendors`”. Though, seeing both in the same project means there _is_ a difference. I couldn't find any information nor on Google nor on sources such as the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, even though this is actually a somehow common practice. * * * Here is a more detailed example with Symfony: once you create a project, you get a `lib` folder at the root of your project. In this folder, the following structure is found:               lib     +--filter     +--form     +--…     +--vendor         +--simpletest         +--symfony      Here, the `symfony` folder contains all Symfony's core.
