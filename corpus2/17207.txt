I have a 80 x 80 x 50 dataset. From this dataset, I get some curves. These curves are randomly seeded, by which I mean that their starting points have been chosen randomly. Below, you can find an example of points that form a curve :               points = {       {81.7317, 64.6811, 14.7966}, {81.7316, 64.6588, 14.8941}, {81.7294, 64.6378, 14.9918},       {81.7228, 64.6176, 15.0895}, {81.7087, 64.5979, 15.1865}, {81.6867, 64.5785, 15.2821},       {81.6576, 64.5595, 15.3758}, {81.6223, 64.5413, 15.4676}, {81.5825, 64.5243, 15.5577},       {81.5395, 64.5088, 15.6467}, {81.4945, 64.4953, 15.7349}, {81.4486, 64.4841, 15.8231},       {81.4027, 64.4756, 15.9115}, {81.3576, 64.4704, 16.0006}, {81.3128, 64.4684, 16.09},       {81.2674, 64.4693, 16.179}, {81.2217, 64.4729, 16.2679}, {81.1761, 64.4792, 16.3567},       {81.1306, 64.488, 16.4453}, {81.0853, 64.4992, 16.5338}, {81.0403, 64.5127, 16.622},       {80.9954, 64.5283, 16.71}, {80.9497, 64.5457, 16.7972}, {80.9025, 64.5649, 16.8833},       {80.8539, 64.5861, 16.9681}, {80.8043, 64.6094, 17.0517}, {80.7555, 64.6349, 17.1352},       {80.7075, 64.6628, 17.2184}, {80.6604, 64.693, 17.3012}, {80.6143, 64.7256, 17.3837},       {80.569, 64.7605, 17.4658}, {80.5249, 64.798, 17.5473}, {80.4818, 64.838, 17.6282},        {80.4398, 64.8809, 17.7082}, {80.399, 64.9267, 17.7872}, {80.3595, 64.9757, 17.8649},       {80.3213, 65.0279, 17.9411}, {80.2848, 65.0819, 18.017}, {80.2493, 65.1363, 18.093},       {80.2144, 65.1902, 18.1696}, {80.1795, 65.2433, 18.2469}, {80.1444, 65.295, 18.3249},       {80.1088, 65.3453, 18.4037}, {80.0722, 65.3938, 18.4831}, {80.0344, 65.4404, 18.5631},       {79.9951, 65.485, 18.6435}, {79.9539, 65.527, 18.7243}, {79.9104, 65.566, 18.8055},        {79.8646, 65.6019, 18.8868}, {79.8163, 65.6347, 18.968}, {79.7657, 65.6645, 19.0489},       {79.7136, 65.6922, 19.1296}, {79.6598, 65.7174, 19.2101}, {79.6044, 65.7397, 19.2903},       {79.5475, 65.7588, 19.3703}, {79.489, 65.7743, 19.4499}, {79.4291, 65.7861, 19.5291},       {79.3681, 65.7943, 19.6079}, {79.306, 65.7989, 19.6862}, {79.2432, 65.8002, 19.764},       {79.1798, 65.7984, 19.8413}, {79.116, 65.794, 19.9181}, {79.0519, 65.7873, 19.9945},        {78.9878, 65.7782, 20.0708}, {78.9239, 65.7658, 20.1467}, {78.86, 65.7502, 20.222},       {78.7959, 65.7318, 20.2965}, {78.7317, 65.7111, 20.3703}, {78.6672, 65.6885, 20.4433},       {78.6023, 65.6644, 20.5155}, {78.5371, 65.6392,20.587}, {78.4715, 65.6133, 20.6579},       {78.4053, 65.587, 20.7281}, {78.3387, 65.5606, 20.7979}, {78.2716, 65.5344,20.8672},       {78.204, 65.5085, 20.9361}, {78.1358, 65.4831, 21.0048}, {78.0668, 65.4575, 21.0725},       {77.9969, 65.4312, 21.139}, {77.926, 65.4039, 21.204}, {77.8541, 65.3753, 21.2673},        {77.7812, 65.3455, 21.3289}, {77.7071, 65.3148, 21.3887}, {77.6319, 65.2835, 21.4466},       {77.5553, 65.2517, 21.5026}, {77.4776, 65.2198, 21.5568}, {77.3985, 65.188, 21.6091},       {77.3183, 65.1564, 21.6597}, {77.2368, 65.1252, 21.7087}, {77.1543, 65.0947, 21.7562},       {77.0708, 65.0648, 21.8023}, {76.9863, 65.0358, 21.8473}, {76.901, 65.0074, 21.8911},       {76.8149, 64.9795, 21.9336}, {76.7278, 64.9523, 21.9745}, {76.6398, 64.9257, 22.0138},       {76.5509, 64.8996, 22.0515}, {76.4613, 64.8738, 22.0877}, {76.371, 64.8486, 22.1225},       {76.2801, 64.8238, 22.1558}, {76.1885, 64.7995, 22.1879}, {76.0964, 64.7757, 22.2187},       {76.0038, 64.7524, 22.2483}, {75.9108, 64.7293, 22.2768}, {75.8174, 64.7061, 22.304},       {75.7237, 64.6826, 22.3299}, {75.6297, 64.6588,22.3544}, {75.5354, 64.6346, 22.3774},       {75.441, 64.6098, 22.3988}, {75.3463, 64.5844, 22.4184}, {75.2514, 64.5581, 22.436},       {75.1565, 64.5307, 22.4515}, {75.0616, 64.502, 22.4645}, {74.9668, 64.4717, 22.4748},       {74.8723, 64.4401, 22.4826}       }
