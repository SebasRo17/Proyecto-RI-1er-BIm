I want to make sure a piece of software I am writing is usable by people with various disabilities such as blindness and an inability to use a mouse and / or keyboard. Unfortunately I have no experience with things such as screen readers or other methods that disabled people use to make using a computer easier / possible. I've never really had much experience with disabilities at all and unfortunately I don't know any disabled people who I can ask. I was wondering what other people do to make sure that their software is available to a wide range of people with varying abilities? This seems to be a subject matter that is often ignored by developers and I think it is a real shame. Edit: If anyone has any specific information related to desktop development in addition to the information already provided in the answers below I would be grateful. Particularly methods that apply to cross platform development on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.
