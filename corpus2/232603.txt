I am creating a resume so that I can start applying for entry-level programming positions. How can I include my time spent as a graduate student of pure mathematics since I did not complete my degree and am not currently enrolled? Should I attempt to include this? I have been given conflicting advice on this. Also, without this information I have a huge gap in finishing my BS and today. About me: I have a BS in Mathematics and Computer Science. As an undergraduate, I became more interested in pure mathematics than computer science. After graduating, I became a graduate student in mathematics. However, I was forced to drop out mainly due to the university cutting my GA position due to lack of funding (I am from Illinois). It has been nearly three years since I left my graduate program. Since then I have bounced around a bit in dead-end jobs while trying to figure out what sort of career would fit me best. I studied actuarial science, tried to create an internet start-up and spent time trying to figure out how I was qualified to be an industrial engineer.
