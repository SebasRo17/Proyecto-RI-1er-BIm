I have a user and a notifications table. I want to make sure that every users sees a new notification once and only once. Not more, not less. The intuitive idea is to have a n:m relation table with userId:notificationId. But isnÂ´t it a little too much overhead to create a new table just for that? What about NoSQL databases? Would it be a good idea to just add an array of notification ids to the individual user in the user table?
