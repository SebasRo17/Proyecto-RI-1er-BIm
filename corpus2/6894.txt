I wanted to draw some contours. I succeeded with this:               W1 = {p, -2, 2, 0.5};     W2 = {p, -10, 10, 1};     P = W1; ContourPlot[       Evaluate[Union[Table[y^2 == 2 p*x, Evaluate[P]],         Table[x^2 == 2 p*y, Evaluate[P]]]], {x, -5, 5}, {y, -5, 5}]     P = W2;     ContourPlot[Evaluate[       Union[Table[y^2 == 2 p*x, Evaluate[ P]],         Table[x^2 == 2 p*y, Evaluate[P]]]], {x, -5, 5}, {y, -5, 5}]      I don't like this solution. I used Evaluate[] a few times and I feel like it is unnecessary although without the function I get errors. Could anyone explain me that. I find the reference unhelpful (maybe that's my lack of language?) "causes expr to be evaluated even if it appears as the argument of a function whose attributes specify that it should be held unevaluated.".
