Ran a mathematica code using NIntegrate containing an integration over spherical and normal bessel functions. 1.Would the answer in the two cases change if I use MaxRecursion with some number of recursions and don't use it? 2. And also will it matter if I use the global adaptive strategy? 3. In case I want to exclude singularity points for x variable, would I use {x,a,b,c,d} where a and b are singular points and c and d are integration limits. The following is the integral $\mathbf{W}\left(k,l,m,\theta_{k}\right)=8\pi i^{l}\Gamma\tau_{rei}j_{2}\left(k\eta_{rei}\right)P_{2}\left(\cos\theta_{k}\right)\left[\beta P_{l-2}^{m}\left(\cos\theta_{k}\right)j_{l-2}\left(\xi\right)+\gamma P_{l+2}^{m}\left(\cos\theta_{k}\right)j_{l+2}\left(\xi\right)+2\zeta P_{l}^{m}\left(\cos\theta_{k}\right)j_{l}\left(\xi\right)\right].$ Integration is to be done of the following quantity: ($\Gamma$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ and $\zeta$ are just functions of l and m, $\Lambda$ is just a constant, $\xi=k*C$, C is some constant) $\int\mathbf{W}\left(k,l,m,\theta_{k}\right)\mathbf{W}\left(k,l^{\prime},m^{\prime},\theta_{k}\right)\cos\theta_{k}\frac{\Lambda}{k^{3}}\sin\theta_{k}d\theta_{k}$
