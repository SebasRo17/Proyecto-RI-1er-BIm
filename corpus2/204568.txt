This one's all over our codebase but I'm not sure I've ever heard a name put to it. We have C# and Java (and Rails but we don't have to touch it very often) so I'll speak more generally. It's like the data concerns never get fully established until you're literally right in a view controller preparing to drop it on the page (note: we're way past the actual SQL queries in most cases here). For instance, we have data for a certain product type coming in from CRMs, from scans done with our mobile app, and pulled up from inventory in DBs and yet somehow it's not until we get to the spot where we're literally about to drop it on the page that we suddenly discover that there's business logic to attend to. Our actions and view controllers are GIGANTIC. We're asking all kinds of questions of every object and branching on them, whether it isThis or hasThat, data sources, customer preferences and sometimes stuff so seemingly arbitrary it might as well be phase of the moon, migration habits of species I've never even heard of, most-googled film stars... And it doesn't always stop at the controller. The Java in particular is notorious for letting it all spill out into the JSP and then even onto the client-side in the JS. This phenomenon has to have a name, but I've never heard it. What is it?
