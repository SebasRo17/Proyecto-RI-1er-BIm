The following:               Mass/2  Integrate[(r^2 + Rotation^2 (2 - Cos[θ]^2))/(r^2 + Rotation^2       Cos[θ]^2)^2 Sin[θ], {r, r1, ∞}, {θ, 0, π},       Assumptions -> {r1 > 0 && Rotation >= 0}] // Simplify      returns > >     (1/(32 Rotation))Mass (-16 ArcTan[r1/Rotation] + 1/(2 r1^2)(16 π r1^2 + >     32 r1 Rotation + π Rotation^2 + 8 π r1^2 Log[r1] + >     4 ArcTan[Rotation/r1] (7 Rotation^2 - 8 r1^2 Log[r1]) - >     2 ArcTan[r1/(2 Rotation) - Rotation/(2 r1)] (Rotation^2 + 8 r1^2 > Log[r1]))) >   in _Mathematica 9.0.1_ , and > During evaluation of In[35]:= Simplify::time: Time spent on a transformation > exceeded 300.` seconds, and the transformation was aborted.

In the latter case, it takes much longer to return, although it fails to produce the result. Is this a bug?
