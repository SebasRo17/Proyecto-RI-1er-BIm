I use `vim` already for quite a while and every day try to learn new things. But, somehow I yet don't feel that I own it. I'm looking for some intermediate to advanced books on `vim` which may be used as a reference as well in every day development. What I look for in the book is more explanations of concepts and general background philosophies than cheat sheet style lists of actions. Maybe it could cover some commonly used plugins and plugin development as well.
