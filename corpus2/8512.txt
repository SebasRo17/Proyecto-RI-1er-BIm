This is a follow up question to RevolutionPlot3D: but NOT revolving about the z axis so please check that for the context. It seems that `RevolutionAxis` requires the axis of revolution to pass thru the origin. Suppose I want to use an axis of revolution that does not pass through the origin, e.g., the line $y=-1$ in the example above. What is a good way to accomplish this? I do realize that `RegionPlot3D` may be appropriate here, but even with seemingly simple examples such as the one above, it can struggle:               Show[       RegionPlot3D[1 <= Sqrt[(y + 1)^2 + z^2] <= 1 + x^2, {x, 0, 1},          {y, -3, 3}, {z, -3, 3}, PlotRange -> All, PerformanceGoal -> "Quality",          Mesh -> False, AxesLabel -> {x, y, z}, PlotPoints -> 100,          ViewPoint -> {0.87, 0.44, 1.76}, ViewVertical -> {0.32, 0.67, 0.67}],       Graphics3D[{Thickness[.01], Black, Line[{{0, -1, 0}, {1.15, -1, 0}}]}]     ]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/c5BNm.png) Bumping `PlotPoints` up to 200, 300, 400 doesn't alleviate the problem and gets really slow.
