I am creating Taylor polynomials and exporting them using `TeXForm`. When a polynomial `p[x]` is displayed in _Mathematica_ , it shows, for instance, `1+x+x^2+x^3`. However, `TeXForm` always reverses the polynomial, giving it with largest power first: `TeXForm[p[x]] = x^3+x^2+x+1`. How can I keep the polynomial in the same order? Taylor polynomials are generally thought of as being constructed from low-to-high powers, so reading them in the generated format is a bit confusing to some.
