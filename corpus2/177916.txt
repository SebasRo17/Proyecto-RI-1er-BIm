I have a site with a public API, and some mobile app developers have been brought in to produce an iPhone app for the site. They insist they need to see the database schema, but as I understand it, they should only need access to the documented public API. Am I right? Is there something I've missed? I've told them that if there's a feature missing or data they require I can extend the API so that they can access it. I thought a web service API held to much the same principles as OOP object API's, in that the implementation details should be hidden as much as possible. I'm not a mobile app developer so if there is something I don't quite see then please let me know. Any insight or help will be much appreciated. * * * Update: The mobile team are part of a government funded advisory service for start ups. I've since found out that the project manager, who was the one pushing so hard to see the database and other internals, also works for a web development agency. I can't say for sure what his reasons were for wanting to see this stuff, but considering he didn't once give a _valid_ technical reason I find this even more concerning than I did at the time.
