I have a background on .NET development, recently I was asked to code back-end service for a mobile app. I had experiences on MVC, and now I'm trying to understand more on Restful Web API. My questions are: Is Restful API as back-end service one of the best (or suitable) choice for mobile app? What is the common solution for mobile app back-end service nowadays? **Edit** : (about off-topic) I read this before I ask this question. > If it's related to higher level programming concepts or is conceptual (but > still related to programming), it should be on Programmers. This is not a question about **recommend a tool, library or favorite off-site resource** **I asked about**   * if restful web API suitable for creating mobile service    * what are the common solutions to build mobile app API
