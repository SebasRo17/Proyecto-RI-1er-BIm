I'm new to git (and github). I work in Java and Python. Right now, I manage my projects in only one directory - let's call it `Code` and the folder is on my Desktop. I want to group my projects by the language I code in. So, I want:               /Code/     ++ /Java/     ++ /Python/      I do not know if Git would be happy with this or not. If it would be, what should I set my home directory to be? And how should I manage it with my github account? For example, I create a new repo on GH for a `new-project` in Python (but I already have files on my local machine in `/Code/Python/new-project`), how should I about committing the files to GH making sure any other directories are not messed up with? EDIT: Just to be clear, I have unrelated projects in `/Code/project_1`, `/Code/project_2`, `/Code/project_3` etc. But I want to arrange them as `/Code/Java/project_1`, `/Code/Java/project_1`, `/Code/Python/project_1` etc.
