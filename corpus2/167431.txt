I have recently become curious about Factor, which, as far as I understand, is the most practical stack-based language around. Forth seems not to be used much these days - I think it is because it was meant to be used on its own, instead of inside an operating system, although ports of course exist. It is also pretty low level. Joy is essentially dead, as the author stated that it does not make sense to mantain it in spite of adopting Factor. The fact is that Factor itself does not seem much developed today. The GitHub repository does not seem very active, and a lot of stuff languishes in `unmantained`. So, are there any other languages of this type that are more actively mantained? Are any in production use?
