I am developing an app that will use the Twitter and Facebook login APIs exclusively. Suppose a new user downloads the apps and is presented with the option to log in through Facebook or Twitter. The user chooses Facebook. I think the procedure at this point is to a) create an auto-generated user ID in my Users table   b) store the Facebook credentials against the auto-generated user ID I am confused about part b. Does Facebook return a unique ID when their API is called that I can store against my user ID or is there some alternate process? In other words, what exactly does it mean to store the Facebook credentials?
