I'm trying to generate a phase plot of a sinusoidal voltage at discrete points using the following code:               ListPlot[Table[{5*Sin[n*π/4 + π/3], 5*Cos[n*π/4 + π/3]}, {n, 8}],              AspectRatio -> 1, AxesLabel -> {"Real", "Imaginary"}, PlotLabel -> "Plot 1d"]      I would also like to make it so there is an arrow that originates at the origin and ends at each point on the plane. Also, I would like to label each point with its corresponding value of n. Is this possible? How can I do it?
