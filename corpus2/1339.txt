If you edit the > `Wolfram > Research\Mathematica\8.0\SystemFiles\FrontEnd\TextResources\Windows\MenuSetup.tr` file you can make Ctrl+Shift+C copy not plain but in $\LaTeX$ format. Very useful. Look for the line in the file that says "&LaTeX" and the one that says "Plain &Text". The & sign gives the underscore letter in the menu. Then replace them with the following:               MenuItem["Plain &Text", FrontEnd`CopySpecial["PlainText"]],              MenuItem["&LaTeX", KernelExecute[ToExpression["FrontEnd`CopyAsTeX[]"]],              MenuKey["C", Modifiers->{"Control", "Shift"}],              MenuEvaluator -> Automatic],      Restart Mathematica and you are done. The question I have is if anyone knows what `MenuEvaluator` does, or if you know how to do this modification from a notebook in Mathematica rather than modifying the config file.
