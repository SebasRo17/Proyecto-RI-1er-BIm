I had a case when I needed to do something in code that **I knew is a bad practice**. but because of a unique situation and after considering the risks thoroughly decided that is worth it. I cannot start explaining all my considerations that include buisness secrets over the internet but I do need technical assistance. when I tried to ask at SA I got heated responses why it is a bad practice instead of answeres to how to do this. poeple are so conserned about what is the right way to write code that they forget that there are other considerations as well. can anyone provide insight of how to correctly ask such a question in order to avoid "this is a bad practice" answers and get real answers?
