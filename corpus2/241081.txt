I am working on large project solo as a hobby, and I made a mistake in the very beginning: I jumped right into programming without giving a second though to design. Now I am nearly 6 months in and things are starting to fall apart: I cant get anything done, the code is very inconsistant, and the whole thing is a mess. Ive definitely learned the importance of design in software development, but I dont know how one designs software to begin with. Are there any programs that can help with this? Or do I need to sit down with pen and paper for the next few weeks trying to work things out?
