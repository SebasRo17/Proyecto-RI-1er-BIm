Let me put this straight. I am quite passionate about programming. I am single and have plenty of time outside work. I haven't slept for 5 full hours for at least a month, as I am involved in multiple projects at work (most of them volunteered) and some open-source projects as well. I know that I am not a gifted programmer and work at a slower phase, but I always get a high (like what runners get) when I see my code working and being used by people. This high is driving me work crazy of late, as other aspect of my life like dating, meeting up with friends, workout takes backseat. Apart from a great reputation I enjoy at my work place, there is nothing to show substantial :-( I can barely sleep, as my mind keeps bouncing ideas even when sleeping. Also, I crave for people's attention at work these days to make up for my personal life and this makes me take up other's work as well. Everyday I start telling myself to work for fixed hours and focus on other beautiful aspects of life, but indeed fail miserably. I know all this sounds like a big rambling, but Iam sure there are people in this forum who would've went through a similar phase in life. How did you overcome it? I don't want to be nerd with no friends. I have been working for 6 years after school and 27 years old male. How to maintain normal life when your work and passion has become your obsession and addiction? **Update:**   Thanks for all the wonderful answers posted. It really helped me to put things in perspective. I definitely feel better now and signed up for gym few days back. Also I leave my work laptop at office, to avoid working late at nights:-) Anyway I started sleeping for 8 hrs and it feels good. Working out regularly feels great :-)
