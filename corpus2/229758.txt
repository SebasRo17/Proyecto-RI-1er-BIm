I write an android app. The user sends the server its location and get places relevant to him. He then can up-vote or down-vote any offer. I wonder if I should write to local DB and when? I connect via fb only. As I see it, there is nothing i should save in local DB performance wize it's better to save and prosess anything at the server side. And also in a local memory (per application session). Any idea what should I save in local DB to be more efficient and to last more than one session (and shouldn't be stored in the server only) ?
