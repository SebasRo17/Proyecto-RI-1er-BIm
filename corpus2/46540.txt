Let $a$ represent some real irrational number. I am trying to perform computations with an automorphism $f:\mathbb{Q}(i,a)\to\mathbb{Q}(i,a)$ which fixes $\mathbb{Q}(i)$ pointwise and maps $a$ to $i a$. What's the best way to represent $f$? My approach below didn't work, since `f@f` performs a replacement on the symbol `f`:               f[x_] := x /. a -> I a     f[a]          (* I a *)          f@f[a]          (* -a *)          (f@f)[a]          (* I a (* Not the same as f@f[a] ?! *) *)      What's the best way to define `f` so that this does not happen?
