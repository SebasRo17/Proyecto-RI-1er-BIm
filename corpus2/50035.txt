This is probably OT but it's less OT here than on any other SO site, so please bear with me. I'm working on a new project votEm. The goal is to give independent candidates a platform to introduce themselves to get elected for a political office. My main reason is that today, it's too expensive to run for an office. Some politicians in the US spend as much as 30 million dollars (!) for a single campaign. That money is better spent elsewhere. In a similar fashion, people who want to change countries like Egypt, could use such a platform to present themselves. Now I expect a lot of emotions and pressure on my site. People with a lot of money (and a lot to lose) will try to game it (political parties, secret services of ... errr ... "not 100% democratic countries", big companies, ...) To avoid as many mistakes as possible, I need a list of resources, ideas and tips how to keep such a site out of too much trouble. PS: I'd make this CW but the option seems to be gone...
