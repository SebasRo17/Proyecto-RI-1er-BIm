`RegionPlot` is plotting for all values. And using `ListPlot` I can only evaluate one inequality. How can I plot this type of inequality: $$\frac{1}{\alpha+1} \leq \frac{\sum_{i=0}^k i^a}{\sum_{i=0}^k i^b} \leq 1+\alpha$$. $a$,$b$ are const (I know values $a$ and $b$). I want to plot dependency between $\alpha$ and $k$ only for integer values of $k$ and $\alpha$ is only from $(0,1]$. So I tried to use `ListPlot` (as you suggested me in previous post).               ListPlot[Table[{k, (-1) + (Sum[i^a, {i, 0, k}]/            Sum[i^b, {i, 0, k}])}, {k, 1, n}], PlotRange -> {0, 1},       Filling -> Top]      But I don't know how to add here the second inequality. I tried also to use `RegionPlot`. This commend is easier for me, because I know how to add the second inequality, but I don't know how to restrict that `k` should be only integer               RegionPlot[(Sum[i^a, {i, 0, k}]/           Sum[i^b, {i, 0, k}]) <=         1 + f && (Sum[i^a, {i, 0, k}]/           Sum[i^b, {i, 0, k}]) >= 1/f, {k, 1, n}, {f, 0, 1}]
