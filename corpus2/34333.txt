I'm trying to analysis a signal and identify some time-frequency information of it. For example, around which time the specific frequency arrives. It appears that Mathematica has very powerful wavelet analysis functions builtin suitable for my job. I've being reading the documentation of them, but still can't get it. In particular I don't really understand what the functions `ContinuousWaveletTransform` and `WaveletScalogram` do. For example, for this example in the document,               data = Table[        Piecewise[{{Sin[2 π 10 t], 0 <= t < 1/4}, {Sin[2 π 25 t],            1/4 <= t < 1/2}, {Sin[2 π 50 t],            1/2 <= t < 3/4}, {Sin[2 π 100 t], 3/4 <= t <= 1}}], {t, 0,          1, 1/1023}];     ListLinePlot[data, AspectRatio -> 0.2]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pRGUJ.png)               cwd = ContinuousWaveletTransform[data,         DGaussianWavelet[5], {Automatic, 12}];     WaveletScalogram[cwd, ColorFunction -> "RustTones"]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pZqgU.png) The above example shows the maps of a 1D time signal into a 2D time-frequency representation. So my questions are:   1. In the documentation, it says `WaveletScalogram` "plots wavelet vector coefficients", what that really mean? What is the x and y axis represent? In my understanding the time-frequency 2d plot is kind of like a musical score where the time axis is horizontal and the frequencies (notes) are plotted on a vertical axis. It this understanding correct?   2. Is there a way to see the identify frequencies in the signal from the 2D plot? For example, we can see four difference frequencies from the 2d plot, can we read off their frequencies from the corresponding y value?
