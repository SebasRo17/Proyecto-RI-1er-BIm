How can I get from data segment format to the final segment format with a pure function? The data fields are fixed length. There are no separators between the fields. a) list               wordlength = {11, 20, 10, 9};     from = 2; to = 3;            datasegment = {"        109Lemon Chiffon       25:22:29  6519218  ",                    "       2082Mint Cream          39:24:41  7314284  ",                    "       6790Indian Red          21:57:53  3368766  "};  s     finalsegment = {"Lemon Chiffon       25:22:29  ",                     "Mint Cream          39:24:41  ",                     "Indian Red          21:57:53  "};        b) string               dataline = {"       1556Floral White        29:48:49  7856900  "};     finalline = {"Floral White        29:48:49  "};      * * * ## **Update** Final solutions were found for the task. I like to share it here.               inlist = RandomChoice[     {"       2524Lemon Chiffon       22:51:28  1881779  ",      "       3085Teal                19:22:24  9744812  ",      "       5935Light Yellow        03:32:54  8374029  ",      "       6128Powder Blue         27:20:07  7315046  "},      400000];            wordLength = {11, 20, 10, 9};     fromWord = 2;     numberOfWords = 2;            fields = Length[wordLength];     borders = {{1, wordLength[[1]]}};     Do[     borders =      FlattenAt[{borders, {borders[[i, 2]] + 1,      borders[[i, 2]] + wordLength[[i + 1]]}}, 1], {i, fields - 1}];     grenz = {borders[[fromWord, 1]],      borders[[fromWord + numberOfWords - 1, 2]] };     outlist = StringTake[inlist, grenz];// Timing            {0.141, Null}        The honor goes to the very concerned in this task. Every detail of their conception was vital to the solution. Keep'n rocking.
