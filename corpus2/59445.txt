I just tried making a `ParametricPlot` that worked error-free in _Mathematica_ 9, but now produces errors before successfully plotting in _Mathematica_ 10\. It appears to have something to do with which order _Mathematica_ evaluates the various expressions. A very simple example that generates this error is the command               ParametricPlot[{t, NIntegrate[a*t, {a, 0, 1}]}, {t, 0, 1}]      which produces > NIntegrate::inumr: "The integrand a t has evaluated to non-numerical values > for all sampling points in the region with boundaries {{0,1}}. " a couple times before suppressing the error and showing the plot. My actual functions are much more complicated, and, while I'd like to get rid of this annoyance, I'd also prefer to not have to rewrite many function definitions.
