Version 9, on Windows 7. Please compare these 2 very simple examples               Manipulate[      x,      Row[{Manipulator[Dynamic[x], {0, 10, 1/100}]}],      {{x, 1}, None}     ]      and               Manipulate[      x,      Row[{Manipulator[Dynamic[x, (x = #) &], {0, 10, 1/100}]}],      {{x, 1}, None}     ]      Would you not expect them to work the same way? But in the second case, `x` becomes real, while in the first case it remains rational as expected. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/90wtw.png) Any one knows the reasoning for this? I read about the second argument of `Dynamic`, but do not see something obvious. I did not read everything about it. But the above behaviour is surprising. The fix is easy:               Manipulate[      x,      Row[{Manipulator[         Dynamic[x, (x = Rationalize[#]) &], {0, 10, 1/100}]}],      {{x, 1}, None}      ]      I am only asking why it happens, so I can learn more.
