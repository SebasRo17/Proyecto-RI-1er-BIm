I am taking a Java class that teaches based on a Java 5 book and the prof. says that if we get the Java certification then we instantly pass the class, sounds like a deal. My question is, since I want to go for the most recent certification (Java 6), what can I expect to be different? I was told that Java 6 is so similar to Java 5 that learning Java 5 is not useless, but what about when it comes to exam differences?
