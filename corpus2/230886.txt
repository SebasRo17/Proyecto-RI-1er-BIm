There are three main "unique" components to my system:   1. Visual form builder (AngularJS backed);      * generates an `id`     * CRUD automatically available for it at `/form_type/id`   2. "Aggregate page"; with a form contain a title and **DSL input area**     * specify an `id`; which will present CRUD for forms created in `1.`     * can specify read-only     * CRUD "Aggregate page"   3. Search * * * With the DSL; I was thinking to use Markdown with an additional braces syntax, for example:               Heading      =======          Lorem ipsum          {2_columns: [{form_type:id}, {form_type:id read-only}]}      Alternatively I could provide a simple drag-drop interface; so you drag text boxes and widgets around a predefined template (e.g.: two columns). * * * Suggestions on this approach and/or my DSL syntax would be greatly appreciated. Note that I will likely FOSS this once it's ready.
