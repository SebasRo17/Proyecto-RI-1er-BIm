This is a simple and short question. I have a function which contains a certain number of square roots and 4th powers, lets take this one:               f=Sqrt[x] Sqrt[y] Sqrt[z + 2] b^4 + c^3 + d^4      I want to be able to count the number of occurrences of the square roots (3) and the number of occurences of the 4th power (2). I think it should be possible to use `Count` for this, but I can't figure out how. I have tried               Count[f,_Sqrt,Infinity]      and               Count[f, Power[4, _], {0, Infinity}]      but both don't seem to work. Can someone tell me how to achieve this?
