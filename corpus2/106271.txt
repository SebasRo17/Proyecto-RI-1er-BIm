I'm a fresh graduate, and I'm about to interview in two days and things are tight. I am well versed with Java EE Servlet and JSP technology, but never really used EJBs. Is learning about EJBs really important to effectively use the Java EE framework? Is it even necessary to have an idea about the technology for the interview? If yes, where can I find something that will be just an overview on the topic - a simple "hello world" tutorial that states what else is possible? I tried the terse roseindia tutorial and the very detailed Oracle tutorial, but I'd need _some_ time in order to complete it. As something unrelated, in the interview, can I mention of my knowledge about Django despite knowing that the company does not pretty much employ Django?
