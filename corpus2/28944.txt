I´d like to find the zeros of a function. I know I could find them by               Solve[f[x] == 0, x]       but that gives me only the x-coordinates. I want to get both the value of the maximum and the x-coordinate at which it occurs in the same form as the output from               FindMaximum[f[x], {x, 1}]      which returns both; e.g.,               {2, {x->3}}      Is there such a command? I´d like to use it later on to connect the zero of a derivative with the maximum of its antiderivative. Like this               Plot[{f[x], f´[x]},        Epilog->{Line[{{x /. FindZero[f´[x], {x, 1}][[2]],                       FindZero[f´[x], {x, 1}][[1]]},                      {x /. FindMaximum[f[x], {x, 1}][[2]],                       FindMaximum[f[x], {x, 1}][[1]]}}]      Well, since it´s not valid code, it doesn´t work, and I'm not sure how to write something like it that could work. I just wondered if there´s a built-in function or easily-written function to do what I label with `FindZero`? Currently, I'm using               Plot[{f[x], f´[x]},        Epilog->{Line[{{x/.FindMaximum[f[x], {x, 1}][[2]], 0},                      {x/.FindMaximum[f[x], {x, 1}][[2]],                       FindMaximum[f[x], {x, 1}][[1]]}}]      but I would be happier using the zero of the derivative. (What I do right now seems like cheating because I want to show the maxima occur at the zeros.)
