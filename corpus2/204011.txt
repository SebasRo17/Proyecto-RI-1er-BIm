I thought I'd post this here for the anonymity of someone I was speaking too recently at a social event for developers. Amongst the trading of _"war stories"_ , he presented the following dilemma.. (Specific questions below) > At the moment I'm working at a start-up - with a handful of developers. I > only really come in to contact with a front-end developer, my manager. This > is perfect when I'm doing front-end specific development - but I'm generally > more suited to back-end work, thus I get called upon to do back-end > development at times. > > I recently undertook a project where the requirements weren't made very > clear, there was no management as per se as my usual manager was on leave > during the development phase - and certain stumbling blocks appeared. > (Technical ones; file parsing and formats etc) There was an intention for > the front-end dev to be completed by my manager upon his return. > > Despite the stumbling blocks, the project was completed. A few bugs were > found, but these were largely ironed out before a handover late on a Friday > evening. My manager came back with several suggestions, some of which he had > made, and requested they be done for 11am on the Monday. The work required > for these changes include: > >   * Database Restructuring (To accomodate new data) >   * Code refactoring (To accomodate the above + a more complex file parser ) > > > To include testing, I'd estimate this was a good 12 hours or so of work. > Brainstorming, development, assorted fixes (was a list of 7 or so points) > and then testing.

I'd really like to hear other peoples views on this, as I'm going to guess it can be quite a interesting (and common) problem. One which involves a fair amount of diplomacy. (Will post my response as an answer, **I will not accept it however** )
