I have been working in asp.net from past 5 years. I have so far liked it. But I am seeing a new boom in the market. And its not all about money. People are going towards iphone developement and android developement. since I have not done developments in both. so was wondering if it is better to stay where and what I am doing or take a risk and should try to learn these technologies and jump with new job. Would my web development background anyhow support this new learning?
