I'm a senior in college that hasn't done much image processing before (except for some basic image compression on smartphones). I'm starting a research project on machine learning next semester that would require some biomedical image processing. What's the best way to get up to speed with the basics of image processing in about two months? Or is this impractical? It's my impression that once I'm good with the basics learning more from other resources would be easier.
