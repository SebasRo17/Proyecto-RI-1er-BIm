Having some spare time, I've decided to learn a new programming language while developing - for fun, will never see the light of day - an insurance administration web application (insurance is the industry I know). So I chose Scala as the language to learn but the more I learn the more I wonder if Scala fits the bill for the app I want to build. I don't want to bother learning functional programming and ignore all the best practices by making my domain objects - Policy, Section, Coverage, Insured, Insurer, etc. - mutable. Insureds have Policies which have Sections which have Coverages provided by Insurers blah blah. So there is this inter-relationship between all these objects and I don't understand how to update one object in the functional paradigm. Is it possible and worth the effort?
