I am debating with my colleague on when to perform code review - before or after unit tests. What is the best practice? Some factors we might need to take into account (there may be more):   * Size of code change - a big change means more changes will result from the code review. If these changes are big than, if UT was before code review, you'll need to repeat most of your UTs again.   * Time required to perform unit test   * Is it new functionality or a bug fix
