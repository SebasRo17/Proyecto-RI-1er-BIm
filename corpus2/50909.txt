Is it possible to fix the parameters for `NonLinearModelFit` within the function itself instead of defining the fix parameters at the beginning of the notebook? I am fitting multiple sets of data with the same function and certain parameters go to zero in some of the data sets. Fixing them to zero inside the function would be a lot easier than constantly changing which parameters are being used to fit the data.
