I want to numerically integrate two functions that have several poles inside the integration region. These are the functions:               ThermPotQuarkGluonLoop10 = 1/2*PreFactor* Jplus*Σx     ThermPotQuarkGluonLoop12 = -1/2*PreFactor*2*(Jplus (x - y) - Jminus (x + y)) nb*Nfx/ωpq;      with the following definitions:               ωpq = Sqrt[x^2 - m^2 - 2*Sqrt[x^2 - m^2] Sqrt[y^2 - m^2] z + y^2 - m^2];     Jplus = NG ((2*m^2 + Sqrt[x^2 - m^2] Sqrt[y^2 - m^2] z -         x y)/((x - y)^2 - ωpq^2));     Jminus = NG ((2*m^2 + Sqrt[x^2 - m^2] Sqrt[y^2 - m^2] z +         x y)/((x + y)^2 - ωpq^2));     nfxp = 1/(Exp[β (x + μ)] + 1);     nfxm = 1/(Exp[β (x - μ)] + 1);     nfyp = 1/(Exp[β (y + μ)] + 1);     nfym = 1/(Exp[β (y - μ)] + 1);     nb = 1/(Exp[β ωpq] - 1);     Σx = nfxp*nfyp + nfxm*nfym;     Σy = nfxp*nfym + nfxm*nfyp;     Nfx = nfxp + nfxm;     Nfy = nfyp + nfym;     PreFactor = αs/(4*Pi^3) Sqrt[x^2 - m^2] Sqrt[y^2 - m^2];      I've fixed several numerical values               hbarc = 1973*10^(-1);     β = 67*10^(-5) hbarc;     NG = 8;     αs = 3*10^(-1);     NC = 3;     m = 48*10^(-1)/hbarc;     μ = 300/hbarc;     Λ = 25*10^(-1)*μ;      Now I integrate it numerically:               NIntegrate[ThermPotQuarkGluonLoop10, {x, m, Infinity}, {y, m, Infinity}, {z, -1, 1}, AccuracyGoal -> Infinity, PrecisionGoal -> 3, WorkingPrecision -> 20]      and               NIntegrate[ThermPotQuarkGluonLoop12, {x, m, Infinity}, {y, m, Infinity}, {z, -1, 1}, AccuracyGoal -> Infinity, PrecisionGoal -> 3, WorkingPrecision -> 20, Method -> {"DuffyCoordinates", Method -> "GlobalAdaptive"}]      My questions are:   * The Code is working for the given numerical values. Why does no error/warning appear for the integration of `ThermPotQuarkGluonLoop10`? This expression has several poles within the integration region but Mathematica can handle it without that I fixed any specified integration method for dealing with poles   * When I assume higher masses (`m=95`) I get the NIntegrate::slwcon: warning. For the integration of ThermPotQuarkGluonLoop10 I can switch to `Method -> {"DuffyCoordinates", Method -> "GlobalAdaptive"}` and it's fine. But for the integration of `ThermPotQuarkGluonLoop12` it is not working without a warning. How can I get a correct integration?   * Are the chosen methods the right way to calculate the numerical integrals or shall I choose another preprocessor/method/rule?   * Is there a way to speed up the computation? Finally I apologize for my bad coding style. I'm a Mathematica beginner... Thank you very much for your help! Cheers, Startup
