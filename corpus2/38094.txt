I've been considering applying for some programming jobs that require experience in Equity derivatives and whilst I know what equity derivatives are, I have no idea what sort of things a programmer working with equity derivatives would do. So I was wondering if there were any developers on here that had experience in development roles working with equity derivatives and could shed some light on what sort of tasks an equity derivatives programmer might be expected to do.
