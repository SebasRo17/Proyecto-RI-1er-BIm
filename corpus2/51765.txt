I'm trying to create several symbols and assign values to them. Here's what currently appears to work:               Evaluate[Symbol["fdds" <> ToString[10]]] = 1      But there's then another problem: I can't clear it without explicitly saying `fdds10`, i.e. this code               Evaluate[Symbol["fdds" <> ToString[10]]] =.      as well as this               Clear[Evaluate[Symbol["fdds" <> ToString[10]]]]      give errors: the former gives > Unset::usraw: Cannot unset raw object 1. >> and the latter results in > Clear::ssym: 1 is not a symbol or a string. >> How do I create good easily manageable symbols? PS: I know I could use something like `fdds[[10]]` here, but I'm interested in symbol-based solution.
