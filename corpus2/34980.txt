I have a small question about how the _Mathematica_ frontend colours in the variables that appear in (wrongly written) iterators. More specifically, I'm intrigued by the colour of the third `x` in iterators of the form               Table[x, {x, 0, x}]      which, as shown here, matches the first and second ones. This colouring of variables that are being iterated over is a very helpful feature in getting the iterators right and not using variables outside of their domain of definition; for example, the colours in               x Table[x, {x, 0, 5}]      make it abundantly clear that the `x` inside the `Table` will evaluate to a specific number, while the one outside it won't. However, an iterator of the form shown in the first code snippet above is incorrect and will usually return an error, so the colouring should reflect that and not put it in the same colour (pale blue for me) as iterated over variables. In a slightly more curious turn, I can think of one example where the first construction is valid, such as with               Module[{x = 5}, Table[x, {x, 0, x}]]      or simply               x=5;     Table[x, {x, 0, x}]      which indeed work, but the colour of the third `x` inside `Table[x, {x, 0, x}]` should match the first one (pale green and black, respectively, for me). Is this a bug, or simply a curious corner case?
