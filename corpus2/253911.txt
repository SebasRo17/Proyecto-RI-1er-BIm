What is the problem that git submodules solve well? When should I use them? Or rather what is their use case? The only use of submodules that I have seen 'in the wild' has been when used to share code between multiple repositories. From what I have experienced, submodules do not appear to be ideally suited to this use case. You run into `git update submodule` woes and your history gets filled with `updating submodule pointer` commits. If the 'sharing code' use case is not best solved by submodules, what problems are?
