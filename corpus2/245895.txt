I searched around a lot, but couldn't find it. I know what server-side programming is and I've done it myself-- getting user's data, storing it in a database etc. using a server-side programming language. My question is: is this what we call "programming a server"? Or it's some other, more complicated task? Thanks. :) EDIT: This is NOT a duplicate of the other question. This question seeks a different answer than what is given in the question claimed to contain the answer. Okay, crystal-clear question: (it's getting kindda funny now :D ) Is there a difference between "server-side programming" (from my understanding: handling user input got via POST, GET, databases and all) and "programming a server"?
