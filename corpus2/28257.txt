I'm searching for a web site to start a new open source project. I want to start the developing of a "SPORT training log". I have some developing skill but not all I need (I dont know web coding). Anyone know a good starting point to meet some people, propose the software and then (in another place also) start the development all together? For example, I have python, c, c++ skills and a little training experience, but I want to make it in web, so I can't do all the stuff alone. I dont think I'm the only one who wants to make a training log but dont have necessary skills. I'm searching for a site to manage the idea behind a training log and get interested people to contribute in the idea and then eventualy contribute also in the code. What I mean is a step before actualy FOSS approach. The question is: Why start to code software I need if I can start global software requirements about a "sport traning log" and after a useful and global review, we can start all together to developt it? Why should I need to start developing the software with XYZ features and other people who need features YZQ need to start to write another one? Why not put the opensource comunity a step before in a more professional way starting an opensource project with a collaborative approach also in software requirements?
