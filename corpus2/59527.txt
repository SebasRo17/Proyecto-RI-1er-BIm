I want solve $$ 2\sqrt{|\gamma|}x = \int_{1}^{t} dy \sqrt{\frac{1+2|\gamma_2|y}{y^2(1-y)}} $$ where $0<t\leq $1. I'm using a for cycle to evaluate t, calculate the integral and the assign the $x$.               SfereDure = {};      For[t = 0.1, t <= 1, t = t + 0.1,         x = Integrate[Sqrt[(1 + 2*0.4*y)/(y^2*(1 - y))], {y, 1, t}];       (*Print["t=",t]      Print["x=", x]*)           SfereDure = Prepend[SfereDure, {x/2, N[t, 1]}];          SfereDure = Prepend[SfereDure, {-x/2, N[t, 1]}]]      I aspect $x=0$ at the last value of $t$ (i.e t=1), instead it isn't. I think that the problem is the precision of the calculus, in fact in the list "SfereDure"               {{-0.108449, 1.}, {0.108449, 1.}, {0.435952, 0.9}, {-0.435952, 0.9}, {0.635334, 0.8},      {-0.635334, 0.8}, {0.804738, 0.7}, {-0.804738, 0.7}, {0.965468, 0.6}, {-0.965468, 0.6},      {1.12849,0.5}, {-1.12849, 0.5}, {1.30375, 0.4}, {-1.30375, 0.4}, {1.50526, 0.3},      {-1.50526, 0.3}, {1.76102, 0.2}, {-1.76102, 0.2}, {2.15692, 0.1}, {-2.15692, 0.1}}      there is "1." that is 0.9999999999999999` and thus the integral $$ \int_{1}^{0.9999999999999999`}... $$ is not $0$.
