NASA provides a visualization software called Panoply. There is a Credits and Acknowledgments page that acknowledges and lists the licenses of software dependencies, but provides no information about its own license. I have looked at other software produced by NASA, including the source code for GISS and can not find any information about a licence. The closest information that I can find is in the FAQ for the global climate model EdGCM Global that says the code is in the "public domain"   * is it standard practice at NASA to release code into the public domain?      * are there exceptions?      * Can I assume that Panoply is public domain and can be used without restriction other than than those imposed by licenses of software dependencies?     * Is the absence of specific permission to reuse the code a concern (this issue was raised in the answer to a separate question)    * How common is this practice across government agencies?
