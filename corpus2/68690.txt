I have question about using .Net 3.5 or 4.0 I know that .Net is more productive then Qt but i am afraid of problems when my client leave my product because he cant run e.g demo of my app with lack of appropriate framework version. I wish to ask experienced persons in that matter. Is that many users that doesn't have .net 3.5? It worth to make app in .Net 3.5 or better use Qt c++ because .net is not that much productive and more important is that every could run app coded in Qt ?
