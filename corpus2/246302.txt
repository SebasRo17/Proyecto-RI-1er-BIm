I'm designing a library that binds to html elements on a page. In this particular case the input[type='checkbox'] will be checked if the likeItem property returns true and unchecked if the likeItem property returns false. What's the best practice for naming properties? input { check: likeItem } or input { checked: likeItem } This would also apply to other things like enable/enabled, disable/disabled, etc.
