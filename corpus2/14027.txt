I have a differential equation which I solved using NDSolve. I can easily plot x[t] vs. t, x'[t] vs. t, but.... how do I plot x[t] vs. x'[t]? I tried using the Evaluate function to simplify things, but I still have no luck. Here's what I mean:               x1 = Evaluate[x'[t] /. sol];     x2 = Evaluate[x[t] /. sol];          Plot[x2, {x1, 0, 50}, PlotRange -> Automatic, AxesLabel -> {x[t], x'[t]}]      How can I plot these? This approach also did not work:               Plot[x[t]/.sol, {x'[t]/.sol, 0, 50}, PlotRange -> Automatic,      AxesLabel -> {x[t], x'[t]}]      Help!
