The report of this issue, which itself relates to code of my answer here, exposed a behavior I cannot explain. If I use `StringMatchQ` in combination with `Alternative` inside the `init.m` a message is thrown on start of the kernel. You can test this by putting this line in your `init.m`               StringMatchQ["name", "noMatch" | "name"];      and when you start the kernel you see two messages saying > Throw::nocatch: Uncaught Throw[False] returned to top level. Surrounding the statement by `Catch` does not help. The solution is to substitute this regex-alternative into a logical `Or`               StringMatchQ["name", "noMatch"] || StringMatchQ["name", "name"]      but that doesn't explain the issue. What am I missing here?
