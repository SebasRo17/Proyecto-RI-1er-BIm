I am working on some code, and have found it easier to use a _Mathematica_ package because   * it is easier to run via command-line (lightweight)   * it allows for easier source versioning (Git), and    * it allows me to use another text editor for indentation alignment (for me, the FrontEnd does not behave too well in this regard). I notice that it parses the package files and substitutes symbol escape sequences `\[MathSymbol]`, but it does not parse out subscripts. I can add subscripts in when editing via the FrontEnd, but once I save it and reload it, the subscripts are simply represented as `InputFormat[]`. I looked through the Option Inspector for parsing options and found the `DefaultPackageStyleDefinitions` at               $InstallationDirectory/SystemFiles/FrontEnd/StyleSheets/Package.nb
