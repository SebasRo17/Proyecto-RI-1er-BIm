I really don't know how to realize this method. The examples in internet and the reference aren't helpful for me. 1) I have the values for today:                x[0] == 0, y[0] == 0.84, r1[0] == 0.39, r2[0] == 0.39, z[0] == 0      Now I need the initial conditions at t=-20 that reproduces the values today.               alpha = 0.5     beta = 1          sol = First@NDSolve[{           x'[t] == -x[t]*a[t] - 3*x[t] + alpha*y[t]^2 +         1/2*beta*(r1[t]^2 - r2[t]^2),      y'[t] == -y[t]*a[t] - alpha*x[t]*y[t],       r1'[t] == -r1[t]*a[t] - 3/2*r1[t] + beta*x[t]*r1[t],       r2'[t] == -r2[t]*a[t] - 3/2*r2[t] - beta*x[t]*r2[t],      z'[t] == -z[t]*a[t] - 2*z[t],      x[0] == 0, y[0] == 0.84, r1[0] == 0.39, r2[0] == 0.39, z[0] == 0},      {x, y, r1, r2, z},     {t, 0, -20}];     a[t_] = -1/2*(3 - 3*y[t]^2 + 3*x[t]^2 + z[t]^2)      Most of the examples are integrated in a plot. First I don't want that. 2)Is it maybe also possible to say that I have the conditions at the present as follows:                 x[t]^2 + y[t]^2==0.5       r1[t]^2 + r2[t]^2==0.5      PS: This topic can be deleted: boundary problem
