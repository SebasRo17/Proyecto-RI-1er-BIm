In other words, is DRY (don't repeat yourself) applied at a class level a subset of SRP (single responsibilty principle)? What I mean is that while SRP states that each class should have only a single responsibility ( ie. class should only have one reason to change ), is it the application of DRY at class level that prevents two classes from having the same responsibility ( thus it is DRY that prevents the repetition/duplication of same responsibility in two different classes )? Thank you
