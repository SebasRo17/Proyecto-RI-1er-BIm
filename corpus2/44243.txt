I have a list of 4 dimensional data points which are sum to one and always positive. These points are the fixed points of the 4 dimensional nonlinear ODE. I also found the stable points of the system using fixed point analysis. (I found the Jacobian at the fixed points and looked at the eigenvalues to decide the stability). Now, I am trying to visualize the fixed points and stable points in 4D. I am not sure whether this is doable but at least I am trying to get 3 dimensional phase planes, trajectories or basin of attractions type graphs if it is possible. Let say as an example, I have the following data points:               {{ 0,0,0,1}, {0,1,0,0}, {0,0,1,0}, {0.0740741, 0.925926, 0, 0},      {1,0,0,0}, {0.444444, 0, 0, 0.555556}, {0.333333, 0, 0.154762, 0.511905},      {0, 0.483592, 0.491029, 0.0253783}, { 0.10009, 0.431624, 0.468287, 0},      {0.137688, 0.283838, 0.389616, 0.188858},      {0, 0.5, 0.5, 0}}      After the fixed point analysis I found that {0,0,1,0} and { 0.0740741, 0.925926, 0, 0} are only stable fixed points. For now, I would like to plot these points as I explained above. Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much.
