We are looking for a way to tokenize some text in the same or similar way as a search engine would do it. The reason we are doing this is so that we can run some statistical analysis on the tokens. The language we are using is python, so would prefer a technique that works in that language, but could probably set something up to use another language if necessary. # Example **Original token:**               We have some great burritos! **More simplified:** (remove plurals and punctuation)               We have some great burrito **Even more simplified:** (remove superfluous words)               great burrito **Best:** (recognize positive and negative meaning):               burrito -positive-
