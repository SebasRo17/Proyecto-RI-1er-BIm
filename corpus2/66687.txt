As a rule of thumb, generalisation is used only in specific circumstances. For example, when we can say that X is literally a subclass of Y. So, we can happily say that a Horse is a subclass of Mammal. I have always been lead to believe that we should use generalisation and inheritence here. If we do not have this strict correspondence between two objects then we should not. A Horse is a Mammal. However, it is also literally a mode of transportation. So what happens in a world of single inheritance where horse cannot inherit from both? Do we then subjugate the fact that a horse is literally a mode of transportation to realisational, i.e., an interface such as ITransportable?
