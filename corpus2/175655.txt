In Python, I often hear that it is better to "beg forgiveness" (exception catching) instead of "ask permission" (type/condition checking). In regards to enforcing duck typing in Python, is this               try:         x = foo.bar     except AttributeError:         pass     else:         do(x)      better or worse than               if hasattr(foo, "bar"):         do(foo.bar)     else:         pass      in terms of performance, readability, "pythonic", or some other important factor?
