I'm confused to find a set of differential equations of motion of a pair of masses, `m1` and `m2` joined by a spring of constant `k`. The unstretched length of the spring is `L`, and the initial conditions are; `x1[0]=0, x2[0]=L+a, x1'[t]=0, x2'[t]=0`. `x1[t]` and `x2[t]` are the positions of the masses `m1` and `m2` at any time `t`. I used Lagrangian dynamics to find the differential equations of motion, but I'm not sure my codes are correct. And I have no idea where I need to put the initial conditions to find the differential equations. Can someone help me?               Needs["VariationalMethods`"];     T = 0.5*m1*x1'[t]^2 + 0.5*m2*x2'[t]^2;     V = 0.5*k*(x2[t] - x1[t] - L);     lag = T - V;     eqn[n_] = EulerEquations[lag, {x1[t], x2[t]}, t];
