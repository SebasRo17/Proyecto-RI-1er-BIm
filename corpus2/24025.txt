I have a function that is defined on a specific domain for example the function $$f(x,y)=(x-0.5)*(y-0.5)$$ defined on $\Sigma$ which is the circle $(x-0.5)^2+(y-0.5)^2=0.5^2$ How to plot $f$ over $\Sigma$? I tried something like               Plot3D[(-0.5 + x) (-0.5 + y), {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1},      RegionFunction ->      Function[{x, y}, 0.5^2 - 0.01 <= (x - 0.5)^2 + (y - 0.5)^2 <= 0.5^2 + 0.01]]      but I am looking for something better.
