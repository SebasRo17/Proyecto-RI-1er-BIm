According to the wikipedia page for the MVC architecture, the view is free to be notified by the model, and is also free to query the model about its current state. However, according to Paul Hegarty's course on iOS 5 at Stanford, lecture 1, page 18 all interaction must go through the controller, with Model and View that are never supposed to know each other. It is not clear to me if Hegarty's statement must be intended as a simplification for the course, but I am tempted to say that he intends the design as such. How do you explain these two opposite points of view ?
