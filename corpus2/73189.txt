I guess it isn't that common but occasionally there are some software developers who didn't actually go to college and just spent their teens hacking away at pet projects and learned enough to work out of high school. My question is if you were hiring a candidate how would you determine if someone who didn't go to a university but is claiming to be (more than)proficient and fully able to develop software just as well as a student with a degree? What do you look for? What would you want to see from this person that would put them at or above the level of a college grad when it comes to hiring?
