I want to calculate Hermite normal form of a matrix. But I do not want the unimodular transformation matrix. Is there any way to stop the calculation of unimodular matrix? HermiteDecomposition function return both matrices. The reason I want to stop calculation of unimodular matrix is I think It will save some memory and computation also may little faster. My matrix size is around (45000 * 3000) Any comment appreciated.
