One common style for density plots is to have a vertical legend that is the same height as the plot itself. Some example density plots from Google Image search: ![Density plots from Google Image search](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ClayN.jpg) How can we make DensityPlots with legends whose height matches the height of the plot? By default the heights are different:               DensityPlot[Sin[x] Sin[y], {x, -4, 4}, {y, -3, 3},       PlotLegends -> Automatic]      ![Default DensityPlot with legend](http://i.stack.imgur.com/n4ona.png)
