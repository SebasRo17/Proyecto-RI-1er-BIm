I know there was a **technical term** for this. I'm just can't remember what it was. If the title needs clarification, here is what I mean; If this is the old code:               Result foobar(Param1,Param2,Param3) {       code that does abc       code that does xyz       code that does asdf       more code that does something     }      and it's changed into:               SomeResult do_xyz(SomeParams) {       code that does xyz     }     Result foobar() {       code that does abc       do_xyz(args);       code that does asdf       more code that does something     }
