How can I move a library inside a project's source tree and compiling static binaries? I want to use a particular tool that utilizes ANCIENT binaries without upgrading it's API usage. This way I can use the old libraries inside the single binary without wrecking the local host environment. I am on nix with netbeans/eclipse/code::blocks. I don't have a problem reading, just looking for a starting point. Any thoughts?
