I've been looking around but I haven't been able to find any way of solving this conceptually simple problem.   In short I am trying to find the charge density in a dielectric in an external electric field given, \begin{equation} \overline{p}(\overline{r})= \int \rho(\overline{r}_{0},\overline{r}) \ \overline{r}_{0} \ dV_{0} \end{equation} In my case $\overline{p} = \alpha \overline{E}$ where $\alpha$ is the polarizability and $\overline{E}$ is the applied electric field. I'm not sure really how to approach this. I've looked into solving integral equations using _Mathematica_ but nothing I've seen seems quite like the problem I have.
