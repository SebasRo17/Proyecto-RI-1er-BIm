I have a course with the following description: > The purpose of this course is the study of programming language security > features and languages designed to support it explicitly. Static and dynamic > constructs for security in languages and systems, as well as software > engineering security principles/patterns. > > Topics: > >   * Basic Programming Language security framework. >   * Designing secure programming languages >   * Access control in programming languages >   * Information flow languages >   * Capability Languages >   * Mobile programming languages >   * Software Engineering and Security >   * Basic software vulnerabilities in systems >   * Secure Software Engineering life-cycle >   * Patterns, and Practices for software security > I'm confused - How is PL security different from regular security? I'm looking for possible textbooks/books to study, or websites that are good in this topic, or any advice/tips. The professor told me to know C and Java well, that's all I know so far. I appreciate any tips or advice.
