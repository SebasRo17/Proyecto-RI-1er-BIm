I'm working on the use case model of a web design application something like Dreamwaver, I'm little confusing about to which level should I write the use case model. ex: when the user insert a text should I provide a use cases of:     1. select font     2. select size     3. color     4. Italic     5. bold   ..   ..   ..   or it's enough just providing a use case called "modify text properties"?
