As an avid fan of tablets, I finally bought a Nook Color a while back. Since it's based on Android and I have Java experience, I'm intrigued by the possibility of developing for it. I've seen that it has an estimate of a few million units shipped (those stats were fairly recent), and the app market is rather small at this time (which I presume would be an advantage to a new app). What I'm wondering is, what are the advantages and disadvantages of developing for such a small, reading-based market - in terms of app popularity and use? Am I wrong in assuming the small app market is an advantage? Does developing for a niche tablet have any synergy with the larger phone market, in terms of cross-development or promotion?
