I would like to copy some parameter from the main Kernel of Mathematica to the parallel kernels available. So I'm running now a command like:               LaunchKernels[]     ParallelEvaluate[var = 10, #] & /@ Kernels[]      Now running this is not a problem. But say I have another variable `var2` and I want to copy its content to all other kernels or a specific kernel. How can I do this?
