I haven't done any serious web development stuff since last year because of family/time issues. I need to get back into it because it's my career choice and I'll be finished with my associates degree soon. I decided to revamp a previous website I helped the owner build. After deciding what to change, I couldn't make up my mind if I should continue with writing procedural code or move to a framework. I know without a doubt I can do it with procedural code but I'm undecided between it. I guess I'm looking for a second opinion, what would you do if you were in a similar situation?
