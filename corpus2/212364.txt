I'm learning C# using visual studio express 2012, and I cannot find a source online that explains window content convention. What I mean by this is, what's the appropriate way to change the context / pass variables from the main window to different contexts? I've been able to change the content of my window by creating and editing new UserControl classes. As for parameter passing, I've experimented with having a static mainwindow with public fields and passing mainwindow field values through action functions (with little success). Is the appropriate way to handle changing the main window's context creating multiple usercontrol classes? If this is the case, should I be creating a tree with the main window as the root and the usercontrol classes as child elements? Most of the questions I find when searching for an answer revolve around forms or new windows, which lead me to question whether usercontrol is the correct item for changing context. If I'm missing a tutorial or simple explanation I apologize in advance :D
