What will happen if someone wants to be a web developer but not interested to learn the client side scripting or programming. I am asking this question, because I think it is not possible, but a few days back, I had an argument with one of my rigid programmer friend. I could not make him understand. Do you guys agree with me? I believe that without the good client side knowledge, it is impossible to be a good web developer.
