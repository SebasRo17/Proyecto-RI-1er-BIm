Lets assume we have a system model:               tf = TransferFunctionModel[{{          (s^3 - 2.841 s^2 + 2.875 s - 1.004)/           (s^3 - 2.417 s^2 + 2.003 s - 0.5488)}}, s];     ss = StateSpaceModel[tf]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/kVJCE.png) **My question is:** How to calculate $H_2$ and $H_\infty$ norms of this system or transfer function? Is there a built-in function for it? **Some notes:**   * In MATLAB `norm(ss,2)` or `norm(ss,inf)` does that.   * Mathematical calculations can be done as in this link. From the `LyapunovSolve` examples one can compute the $H_2$ norm of an asymptotically stable continuous-time system as below:               {a, b, c} = {{{-1, 2, 3}, {0, -2, 2}, {0, 0, -3}},                  {{1, 1}, {1, 1}, {1, 1}},                  {{1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 1}}};          x = LyapunovSolve[a, -b.Transpose[b]];     h2norm = Sqrt[Tr[c.x.Transpose[c]]] // N      > 6.12917
