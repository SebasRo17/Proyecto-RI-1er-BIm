For example: an MIT-licensed project wishes to simplify the build process for its users by including part of the GNU toolchain (which is of course GPL) as a Submodule.   * Could that be interpreted as making the MIT project a "derived work" of the GNU toolchain?    * Does including a project as a Git Submodule (or some similar mechanism - maybe even just a Bash script that downloads it) count as "redistributing" that project?    * What about if the Makefile also built the sub-project? In my opinion (and probably most peoples') the answer to those questions is a clear "no". I'm more interested in hearing the precedents and norms surrounding this issue than discussing our own interpretations of copyright law. Do you know of any open-source projects that have Submodules under incompatible licenses? Do you know of anyone who has deliberately avoided them, and why they did that? * * * Just to clarify for non-Git-people: Submodules don't cause the actual content to be included, they're like "pointers" to a different repo. In the example I gave, when you cloned the MIT project and ran `git submodule init`, Git would automatically download the GNU code from a GNU repo.
