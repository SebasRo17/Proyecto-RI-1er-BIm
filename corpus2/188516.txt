Right now creating a new service that will integrate into our company's existing platform. The service will be responsible for tracking "points" that a user can generate over time through certain activities. I am caught between two different methods of approach. I'm not sure whether to choose one of the following structures to continually manage points:   1. Create a "log" of points and instead keep one running total in the database, like a key/value field, where the value is the current points balance that is simply adjusted during each transaction.   2. Create a "ledger" system where each time the points are recalculated after a certain condition, but the _entire_ ledger is assessed to determine the most up-to-date points balance. Don't think it's relevant, but the backend DB is Riak. Which has the least drawbacks, or is there a better way? How does the StackExchange point system work in relation to the above? Many thanks for the input!
