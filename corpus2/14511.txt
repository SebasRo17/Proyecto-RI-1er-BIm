I'm getting results that are sensitive to where I place parentheses with respect to operations that are associative1 (and should thus be insensitive to such placement). For example, if I define2               << Units`; << PhysicalConstants`;     stellarDayTextbook = 1/(1/Day + 1/Convert[SiderealYear, Day])      and then calculate               1/stellarDayTextbook - 1/Day - 1/Convert[SiderealYear, Day]      I get precisely zero, as expected. But if I add parentheses               (1/stellarDayTextbook - 1/Day) - 1/Convert[SiderealYear, Day]      I get               -(3.03577*10^-17/Day)      What's causing this? * * * 1. Remember, this isn't C, it's math: "subtraction" of $x$ is just the addition of $-x$. Check `TreeForm`. 2. I realize this isn't the definition of a "stellar day", but merely a textbook approximation. The distinction is not material to the question.
