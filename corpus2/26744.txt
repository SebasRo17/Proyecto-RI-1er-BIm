Upon building documentation in Workbench, Workbench sometimes converts the output of examples on function pages into rasterized images, and sometimes not. Does anybody know what controls this behavior? For example, say if we have a package containing the following code:               MakeBoxes[tensor, StandardForm] = InterpretationBox[         StyleBox@GridBox[             {{                 "T",                  StyleBox@GridBox[{{"a"}, {"b"}}]             }},              ColumnSpacings -> 0.05         ],          tensor     ];          TestSymbol[n_] := Table[tensor, {n}];      And let the documentation notebook of TestSymbol contain the following examples:               TestSymbol[1]     TestSymbol[2]     TestSymbol[3]     TestSymbol[4]     TestSymbol[5]     TestSymbol[6]      The output of the first 5 examples are left untouched by the documentation build process, but somehow output of the 6th gets rasterized. (And for any `TestSymbol[n]`, with `n > 5` for that matter). The culprit seems to be the `ColumnSpacings` option; if I remove that then none of the output gets rasterized. I tried digging through the documentation tools source code, but unfortunately that was like searching for a needle in a haystack. Does anybody have a clue what's causing this behavior?
