Currently, I am working on a project where I would like to find symmetries of points plotted on a sphere. One example would be to rotate the sphere 180 degrees about the x-axis and the picture would look the same. I am looking through many different formations of points and am wondering whether or not there is a way to speed it up and to increase the accuracy. Is there a function to find rotational symmetries about different axes (as they are not limited to x,y, and z)? If relevant, my points are currently in cartesian form, but I also have them available as spherical coordinates. Thanks! -Chase
