**Save any unsaved work before trying as it may crash Mathematica and other programs by filling up the memory!** In v9.0.1.0 on OSX 10.8.5, if I start a new session and define two functions               f1P = Sin[#^Sin[Sqrt[Gamma[#]]]] &;      and               f2P = Sin[#^Sin[Gamma[(# + 1)]]] &;      they both work fine. Now, if I quit the kernel and define _the exact same functions_ but removing the `;`s when I evaluate the cell with `f1P`:               f1P = Sin[#^Sin[Sqrt[Gamma[#]]]] &      I get some output (`Sin[#^Sin[Sqrt[Gamma[#]]]] &`). Then if I try to evaluate the cell with the second function definition the kernel hangs indefinitely. In fact the kernel can't handle the definition of `f1P` without `;` at all (if I try to give it values nothing happens). Strangely, this isn't the case with `f2P`: I remove the semicolon, evaluate and it runs fine. But with `f1P` the kernel consumes more and more ~~CPU~~ memory. I have not idea why CPU usage spiked yesterday - I tried this today and it increased to ~35% but not more. The memory demand keeps growing though until the Kernel gets terminated or until Mathematica crashes. This seems to be a bug with Mathematica on OSX as other people confirmed and I have now reported it to WR so I will edit again once I have confirmation from them. Still, if anyone has any idea what might be happening I'd like to know. **\---EDIT---** This issue has been resolved in version 10. WR have confirmed the bug which _"causes unusual memory usage on a Mac because of the Predictive Interface"_
