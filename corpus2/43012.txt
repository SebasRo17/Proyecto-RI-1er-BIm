I started to explore this on a whim and hasn't succeeded yetâ€¦ Some introduction for the icon is found here but I can't understand it very well. (I admit that, though playing with `NDSolve` a lot, I suffered my unstable foundation of knowledge for PDE. ) A matlab code sample for the icon is found at the end of the document here and I have no doubt that it can be translated to _Mathematica_ code mechanically, but it'll be so boring! Can we plot it in a _Mathematica_ style? Has anyone tried it before?
