I'm trying to get an idea as to how what I currently do (implementing enterprise services in Java) would be done in a .NET environment. In .NET, would it typically be done using:   * IIS as the server?   * C# as the language and WCF as the framework?   * BizTalk as the enterprise service bus, with MSMQ as the gateways? Has anyone implemented services in both Java and .NET, and if so, are there any major paradigm differences or is it pretty similar?
