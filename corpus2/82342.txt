I have a question in writing my resume. I am looking for a career in Java/J2EE etc., I had worked as a teaching assistant for Data Structures in Java. This was from Aug 2009-May 2010. I got internship on PHP during May 2010 and as PHP developer in my univ as RA during Jan 2011 to May 2011. Since I am looking for a long term career in java should I mention the teaching assistant position i.e., Aug 2009- may 2010 at the top or the most recent experience at the top in my experience list.
