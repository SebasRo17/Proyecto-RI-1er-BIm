Is it possible to import Excel text markup such as underlines? For example: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zGGZ6.jpg) Yet               Import["/Users/alancalvitti/Dropbox/Understars/text.is.lyte/litany.of.\     duals/litany.of.duals.xlsx"][[1, 1]]      returns a list with the plain string:               {"nyt 7.23.12", "question for a ceo: what is yahoo?", "17 years after \     the company was founded, you still have to wonder whether the frothy \     trademark yahoo! should be replaced with yahoo? to convey the \     uncertainty of purpose", "david carr @nyt"}      Note that the formatting is partial, not a global formatting selection (such as font) that affects the whole cell.
