As the data is migrated via the object level, there has been a slow upwards trend in memory usage. I can see the periodic gc activity, but the memory trend is still going up slowly. I have currently for my application set the starting and max heap at 14GB in production, however if we might need a large data set, my concern is the we will eventually hit the limit and then the application will slow down (which was what happened). What are some effective ways and proving strategies to help identify and remedy a potential memory leak in a running Java process?
