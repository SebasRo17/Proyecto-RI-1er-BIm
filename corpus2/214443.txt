I would like to develop a re-usable component of horizontal Slidable tool bar. I would like to try to develop a custom view instead of ActionBar.   My Custom-View extends VieGroup contains and custom image button class as child views. The custom-view contains multiple tool buttons. Is it recommended approach please? or do we have any better approach without using ActionBar. Minimum android version should be 4.0 and target is 4.x and one of the screen resolution is 480X640 in 4.7 inches screen. The re-usable toolbar would be used in different screens/views with in same and multiple apps. I understand that Action bar comes with many standard features of a tool bar including various gesture features.
