I'm new to _Mathematica_ yet have coded a lot in MATLAB. Currently I'm working on a network simulation. My model is implemented in MATLAB, but I need to port it to _Mathematica_. **Here is my question** : Given a graph `g` and coordinates `x` and `y` for each node. I want to plot the network with nodes at the corresponding coordinates. How can this be done? In case you are also used to MATLAB, there is the function `gplot`, which does the job. Is there a similar plotting function in _Mathematica_?
