I have a somewhat large number of 3-dimensional unit vectors ( ~ 100 000 unit vectors), and I am trying to visualize their distribution. First thing I tried was `ListPlot3D`, but it doesn't look too good. Now, I would like to make a density plot on the surface of the unit sphere using this data. For example, the sphere would be bluish in the regions with little or no points, and reddish in regions with many points (you can use any colors you want). Can I do this with _Mathematica_?
