I'm new to MVC and I'm not using a framework (and I'm not going to). I'm designing my new web application using MVC. I have the user input received in Controller. Suppose I have form `data` and an `action` to do with it, which can be "insert", "delete" or "update". Must I have process that action in Controller or in the Model? That is: must I do:               # Controller     if (action == "insert") Model.insert(data)      or               # Controller     Model.process(data, action)          # Model.process     if (action == "insert") self.insert(data)      (language-agnostic example). What is the "MVC way" to do it?
