Please share your knowledge about these Crystal Reports concepts.   1. I want to know what is difference in section and sub report? I know about default sections and we can add new sections into report.   2. What is purpose of a subreport? when should we use a subreport instead of a section?   3. Where should we use multiple detail sections in report?   4. Are sections used to carry a "Can grow" field that will be bringing data dynamically?
