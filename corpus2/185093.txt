This question is asked on SO and this site often it looks like. "How do I do a dynamic enum?" Answers range from you shouldn't to possible compile time solutions. Now my question is do I want a dynamic enum that is generated from look up tables in the DB, or do I want something else that is similar? I have a solution using T4 at build time to generate enums from DB tables, that works fine. But now some of the look up tables have an 'active' flag on them. Does this mean they are not look up tables anymore? If that is changed I want to somehow regenerate my code without having to redeploy. These tables will not change often. Currently the app when it wants to populate a dropdown or something will query the DB. But if the values mostly remain static, why go to the DB every time, hence the use of enums. It also has the added benefit of getting rid of magic strings and numbers. Would static structs be better? Some sort of caching for the look up tables? Any advise welcome.
