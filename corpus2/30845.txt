I study sigularity specification and MaxRecursion in NIntegrate. And find something unusual. first I define a function               δ[x_, y_: 1/100] := 1/π*y/(x^2 + y^2)      Plot δ[x - 2]               Plot[δ[x - 2], {x, 0, 4}, PlotRange -> All]      gives ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/V8kq4.png) Now NIntegrate δ[x - 2] from -∞ to +∞，I control the MaxRecursion option, and plot the sample points using the `plotrecur` function. I will give `plotrecur` in the end.               Table[{"MaxRecursion" i,      plotrecur[δ[x - 2], {x, -\[Infinity], \[Infinity]},      MaxRecursion -> i]}, {i, 4, 9}]      this gives ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/f7IXu.png) the above picture shows that how reducing `MaxRecursion` step by step will affect sample points used in NIntegrate. then I exclude 2 as a singularity in the integration interval. through 2 is actually not a singularity, but it is sharp.               Table[{"MaxRecursion" i,      plotrecur[\[Delta][x - 2], {x, -\[Infinity], 2,\[Infinity]},      MaxRecursion -> i]}, {i, 4, 9}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cniFm.png) we can see that the `MaxRecursion` doesn't affect the sampling until `MaxRecursion` reduced to 4. **It's hard for me to understand this. I think the only effect after specifying a singularity manually is to let _Mathematica_ trigger a singularityhandler(e.g. IMT or DoubleExponential) at that point. Is this view right? Why will specifying singularity makes `MaxRecursion` invalid? Can somebody give a explanation** * * * Finally, the `plotrecur` function here:               plotrecur[integrand_, {x_, low_, singularity___, high_},      opt___] := {Length@#[[2, 1]], #[[1]],      ListPlot[      Transpose[{Transpose[#[[2, 1]]][[1]],         Range[Length@#[[2, 1]]]}]]} &[     Reap[NIntegrate[integrand, {x, low, singularity, high}, opt,      EvaluationMonitor :> Sow[{x, integrand}]]]]
