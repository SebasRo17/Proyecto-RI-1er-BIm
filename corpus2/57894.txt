I often see programmers advise non-tech people that they should 'just learn to code' if they want to execute their big idea, saying it's not that hard to get the ball rolling. However, while as programmers we can be adept at writing websites including backends and CMSs etc., there's still a great need for the thing **to look nice.** Usually we can leverage clipart and templates etc. and do some image editing to get by. But being able to draw original art yourself would be a big advantage I'm guessing. So my question is has anyone here tried to brush up on their art skills to help with the design aspects of their projects? I know some people have 'always' been good at art, or at least been good at drawing since their highschool days, but I'm curious about anyone who went from being bad at drawing, to regularly completing original art work that went into production on a site or application front-end.
