The W3C spec on the `class` attribute says > There are no additional restrictions on the tokens authors can use in the > class attribute, but authors are encouraged to use values that describe the > nature of the content, rather than values that describe the desired > presentation of the content. Reference I work on a massive website that has many disparate pages. We have a default stylesheet that is shared across practically all pages. I find it useful to have CSS rulesets such as these:               .center { text-align: center; }     .red { color: red; }      However, these classes do not semantically describe content. I'm sure you can understand that there are an enumerable number of cases where I need to center text or color it red, and each of these specific instances may have nothing to do with one another. For example, the class `warning` may be useful in one spot, but in another it may just be `aside`. I wouldn't necessarily want _all_ warnings to be red either. I realize that this is a hyper-technical question, but I do want the hyper- technical answer. Is there any correct way to reconcile having general style rules that express no semantics with the HTML spec? Is this a case for _shudder_ inline styles?
