I hope I am going insane and the I'm not seeing the snake about to bite me... How does one view the code in the demonstration projects that one can download from wolfram.com? It seems like all of them come down as an 'Authoring Notebook' and I cannot always get the notebook to show a view of the code the author used. Some of the notebooks have the cells 'docked' and you can view the code by double clicking the cell. Others, do not show the icon on the cell brackets to open their content, but the demonstration still functions. It appears the code is definitely available by looking at the plain text of the file. Are authors encouraged to obfuscate the code in their demonstrations? If not please direct me to the snake...
