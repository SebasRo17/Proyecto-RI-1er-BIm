Without getting into too much detail, the following (very complicated) function recently appeared as a solution to a combinatorics problem I've been thinking about: $$P(n) = \frac{52!}{52^{52}} \cdot \sum_{1=i_{1} < i_{2} < \ldots < i_{51} < i_{52} \le n} \left[ \prod_{k=1}^{51} \left( \frac{k}{52} \right)^{i_{k+1}-i_{k}-1}\right]$$ I'd like to plot this sucker in Mathematica but as it stands I don't see how that's going to happen. If there's a way to simplify this expression or some sort of efficient way to evaluate it I'd really appreciate any help. I know that $P(n)=0$ for $1 \le n < 52$, $P(52)=\frac{52!}{52^{52}}$, and $P(n)$ should grow quickly towards 1 and then plateau, so it should look something like the CDF of the normal distribution centered around 52 when all's said and done. Thanks!
