I'm currently working with Java / C++. I'm interested in web development and am planning to shift my stream. I heard that PHP is a good platform to start off and also it does not require that much of knowledge in technologies like JSP / Servlets or frameworks like springs / struts / hibernate. I have basic ideas about HTML and Javascript as well. I have gone through previous posts in SO and found out the relevant resources as well:   * http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/php/the-best-way-to-learn-php/   * http://www.webhostingtalk.com/archive/index.php/t-1028265.html   * http://www.killerphp.com/   * http://phpforms.net/tutorial/tutorial.html   * http://www.php5-tutorial.com/ etc. Now, my question is: I heard of PHP frameworks like CodeIgniter, Zend Frameworkd and Yii.   1. Doesn't learning PHP & MySql implicitly makes us aware of these frameworks?   2. Am I making a good choice in stating with PHP?   3. Is it a good idea to shift streams?
