I've been developing using frameworks since the last year, and is true that those pieces of software really help me and improve my development, that's until you need to fulfill your client's dreams, like, the app needs to fly to the moon and back and collect information about the sun. Or he has an app that needs a basic crud functionality but doesn't need the other 90% of the framework. I know I can handle dependency management using composer, but what if the client has an specific need to be coded over the previously developed app? That's why I'm asking here if anyone of you guys knows a minimal MVC framework?, that can be improved as needed. I just need some base to start my new projects, and the cleanest and minimal, the better. Main charasteristics I'm looking for. \- Obviously mvc design. \- Database integration. \- Built in basic Crud operations. \- Security. \- Code readability Would like: \- Template engine (like smarty) integration. \- Helper classes. Also it has to be easily expandable. I've looked at yupp, but I don't find it complete and also a little bit buggy for development purposes. Thanks.
