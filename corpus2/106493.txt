How true should (or does) this statement ring for developers? Many people I've talked to say "it's like this everywhere", while a similar number treat it as practically an invitation to resign. It's a bewildering statement, and I'm curious if anyone has experienced this and has ideas on how to approach a manager that holds this viewpoint.
