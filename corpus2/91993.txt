I have several certifications, MCPD, MCTS, MCAD, etc and I've learned that MVP is an award (just a title), not a certification. So if I wanted to get one of these, I'd have to spend valuable time on communities, sharing knowledge and providing answers to others for free, consistently, for _years_ , until finally someone special notices and rewards me. I imagine there'd be some personal benefits along the way, but supposing I achieved this goal and became an MVP, would this pay off financially in any way (career opportunities, higher pay scale, etc.)?
