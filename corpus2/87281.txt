I was wondering if there are any studies (formal or not-so-formal) that show correlation between a developer productivity and the workstation used to develop software. It is often heard as argument that the high spec workstations increase the productivity (or the low spec machines impact productivity to the greater extent). To me it sound reasonable, however I'd like to verify the statement with some studies if such exists. Can you help me with that?
