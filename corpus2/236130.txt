I need a class where this can be done:               // user program     elder_tales.Player p = elder_tales.generate_player();     elder_tales.level_up_player( p );      but not:               // user program     elder_tales.Player p = new ...whatever     p.set_stats();     p.set_server();     p.calculate_experience()     elder_tales.level_up_player( p )      Basically, I want the package to do the instantiating while not allowing the user to do their own instantiating; because instances of type Player are constructed in a complex manner, I decided not to put too much strain on the user to create them with a public constructor.
