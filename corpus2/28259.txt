I am plotting a number of functions (at least 4 in one plot) with a legend. Needless to say, it is important that it is clear from the legend which line belongs to which function. I tried to play around with the `PlotStyle`, but I'm not getting them to look all that different. The paper it will be published in demands grey-scale pictures, so I can't use different colours. I was hoping to use `PlotMarkers` instead, but I found that these only exist within the `ListPlot` but not in `Plot`. In theory I could overlay a `Plot` with a `ListPlot`, but then it wouldn't show in the legend. What is the best way to add the markers in both the plot and the legend? This is a minimal working example of something to which I'd to add `PlotMarkers`.               Needs["PlotLegends`"];     Plot[{Sin[x], Sin[x + π/4], Sin[x + π/2], Sin[x + 3π/4]}, {x, 0, 2π},          PlotLegend -> {"#1", "#2", "#3", "#4"},          PlotStyle -> {DotDashed, Dashed, Dashing[0.01], Dotted}]
