Functions are not only used to minimize duplication of code - they are also used to split up a long function into smaller ones to increase readability, as well as making the code self-commenting. Yet this gain is not directly inversely proportional to the number of LOCs per function or method; otherwise we would have tonnes of functions, all of which only contains a single line or two of code. This lead me to wonder: **Does there exist an optimal number of LOCs per function? If so, what is it, and does it deviate between languages?**
