I'm trying to get a list of words from a string. Sounds like an easy task for Mathematica. I have the following code:               text = "Merçi d'avoir pris le temps.";     ToLowerCase[#] & /@ StringSplit[text, Except[WordCharacter] ..]      However, the output is               {"merçi", "d", "avoir", "pris", "le", "temps"}      and not               {"merçi", "d'avoir", "pris", "le", "temps"}      because the `'` is not a word character. Hence, I'd like to ignore the `'`, just like the `-`. Any idea on how to do that?
