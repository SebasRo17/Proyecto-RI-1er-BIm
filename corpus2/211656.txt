Where should the Models be instatiated in a MVC arhitecture? I understand the preferred way would be outside controllers, in a bootstrap file and injected using a Dependecy Injection Container. But most of the models I'm working with depend on run time parameters.               //PHP Example     class UserController {        protected $objUser;        protected $objDictionary;             public function Show() {            $objUserMapper = new UserMapper();            $this->objUser = $objUserMapper->FindById($_GET['id']);            $this->objDictionary = new Dictionary($this->objUser->Language);        }     }
