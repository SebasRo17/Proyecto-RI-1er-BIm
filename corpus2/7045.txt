why does the following instruction ok in mathematica, and it returns a boolean value               In[398]:= catenary[x, 1, 0, 0] == catenary[-x, 1, 0, 0]     Out[398]:= True      and not this one?               In[406]:= catenary[-x, 1, 0, 0] == -catenary[x, 1, 0, 0]     Out[406]:= Cosh[x] == -Cosh[x]      I wanted to have a boolean value too.. to prove the symmetry.. Thanks for your help!
