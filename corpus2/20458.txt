I encounter this problem in _Mathematica_ 9.0.1, I'm not sure if it ever happens in other version.               Plot[{x, x + 1}, {x, 0, 10}, PlotStyle -> {Red, Green}]      This will show a red curve and a green curve, which is as expected. But               Plot[{a, b} /. {a -> x, b -> x + 1}, {x, 0, 10}, PlotStyle -> {Red, Green}]      will give me two green curves. Since               {a, b} /. {a -> x, b -> x + 1}      will give you               {x, 1 + x}      , I don't understand why there is difference in the results given by the two plot statements.
