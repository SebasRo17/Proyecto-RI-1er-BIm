I am a Test/QA manager in an organization that gradually moves to Scrum. I don't appear in daily Scrum meetings because I don't want to interfere with the self-organization of the team. The problem with this is that I am becoming too disconnected with what the 5 testers who report to me do in the day to day. How can I coach and evaluate these testers? What if they don't do good work, or do too little work, how can I know this in a timely basis and act on it?
