I am using the MIT License for a particular piece of code. Now, this license has a big disclaimer in all-caps:               THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY     OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT     LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF...     ...      I've seen a normally capitalised disclaimer on the zlib license (notice that it is above the license text), and even software with no disclaimer at all (which implies, i take it, that there is indeed a guarantee?), but i'd like some sourced advice by a trusted party. I just haven't found any. GNU's _License notice for other files_ comes with this disclaimer: > This file is offered as-is, without any warranty. Short and simple. My question therefore: Are there any trusted sources indicating that a short rather than long, and a normally spelled rather than capitalised disclaimer (or even one or the other) are safely usable in all of the jurisdictions I should be concerned with? For the purposes of this question, the software is released in the European Union, should it make any difference.
