I'm currently working on a pet project with two of my buddies. This web service will provide basic functionality such as Login/Password Modification/Registration etc. All of us are comfortable with jQuery and ASP.NET. My friend's idea is to - `Set up a web service on the same domain and send it data for registration, validation and password retrieval through jQuery ajax.` This same process is going to be used for other CRUD ops as well. I'm not sure though, isn't this a huge security risk? Couldn't a normal person write some code that could create thousands of dummy users in our application? Would setting up a secondary web service that handles authorization (OAUTH 2.0 or something like that) and calls the web service that connects directly to the database reduce the security risk?
