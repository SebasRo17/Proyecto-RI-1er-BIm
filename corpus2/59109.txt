When I try to save a `Graphics` object using the menu File â–¶ Save Selection As... or via right click and Save Graphic As... the Messages window pops up with the following error message:               The specified setting for the option WindowSize cannot be used.      Than I tried to use WindowSize, but I can't get any output if I add WindowSize to               Graphics3D[{Arrowheads[Small],        MapThread[Arrow[{#1, #2}] &, {tockez0, 10^(11) poljez0 + tockez0}]},       BoxRatios -> {1, 1, 1.5}, Axes -> True, AxesLabel -> {x, y,}]      Anything I can do? :/ I want to save it in any format that LaTeX can work with, I prefer .PNG
