I can't seem to find the right set of patterns to independently match two different lists. Simplified versions of the lists are as follows:               list1 = {{2}, {2}, {20}, {2}, {10}}     list2 = {{2}, {2}, {2}, {2}, {2}, {2}}      In general, the second list will always have the same number inside the parentheses. They can have different lengths. Both will have just a single number inside the parentheses. I am trying to find two patterns (`p1`,`p2`):               p1 = {{s_?NumericQ} ..};     p2 = {{_?NumericQ} ..};      Such that               {MatchQ[list1,p1],MatchQ[list1,p2],MatchQ[list2,p1],MatchQ[list2,p2]}      Gives               {True, False, False, True}      My test patterns give `{True, True, False, True}` instead. I'm sure the answer is easy, but I just can't get it right...
