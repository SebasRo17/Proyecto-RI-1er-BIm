I want to apply non-geometric transformations to polygons etc, the goal is to have a `Manipulate` objects that behaves like that famous mÃ¶bius transform video. Since I was unable to apply non-geometric transformation to a polygon I went ahead and created a bunch of points in the plane and did appropriate transforms to them               (* plane region *)     region = {-1, 1};     d = 0.07;     (* Some points in plane *)     pts = Flatten[Table[{xi, yi, 0},         {xi, First@region, Last@region, d},         {yi, First@region, Last@region, d}]        , 1];     col = ColorData["Rainbow"] /@ Rescale[pts[[All, 1]], region];     (** Projections from plane to sphere on line going through north pole \     of sphere centered at {0, 0, 1} **)          (* Plane to sphere *)     f[vec_] := With[{t = 4/(4 + vec[[1]]^2 + vec[[2]]^2)}, vec*t + (1 - t) {0, 0, 2}]     (* Sphere to plane *)     g[vec_] := With[{t = -(2/(-2 + Last@vec))}, vec*t + (1 - t) {0, 0, 2}]          rt = RotationTransform[2.1, {0, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 1}];     Graphics3D[{       {Black, Opacity[0.3], Sphere[{0, 0, 1}]},       Point[(rt@f@# &) /@ pts, VertexColors -> col],       Point[((g@rt@f@# &) /@ pts), VertexColors -> col]       },      PlotRange -> {{-10, 10}, {-10, 10}, {0, 2}}]      ![output](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DVADU.png) I wish that I could instead do something like:               Graphics3D[{      {Black, Opacity[0.3], Sphere[{0, 0, 1}]},      SomeTransformation[Polygon[{ {-1, -1, 0}, {-1, 1, 0}, {1, 1, 0}, {1, -1, 0}}], rt@f@#&],      SomeTransformation[Polygon[{ {-1, -1, 0}, {-1, 1, 0}, {1, 1, 0}, {1, -1, 0}}], g@rt@f@#&]      ]      And end up with a smooth output, not just a few points here and there. Is there already a function like this that I have missed? If not are there other ways to arrive at the same result? How about for more advanced transformations?
