What is the most portable way to assign keyboard shortcuts unique to each notebook? To clarify I would like to have the keyboard shortcut change when simply changing the current `InputNotebook`. Currently I'm have the following code which allows for me to essentially have the defined function be defined in a notebook and execute in the Global` context.               FrontEndExecute@      FrontEnd`AddMenuCommands[       "DuplicatePreviousOutput", {MenuItem["Ctrl &q",          FrontEnd`KernelExecute@ToExpression@MakeBoxes[            F2[]            ], MenuKey["q", Modifiers -> {"Control"}],          System`MenuEvaluator -> Automatic]}]      I would like to somehow attach functions to notebooks without changing the context(most ideal). Alternatively I might be able to use something like a custom `FrontEnd'NotebookExecute` instead of `FrontEnd'KernelExecute`.
