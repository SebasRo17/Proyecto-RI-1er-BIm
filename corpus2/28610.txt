I would like to be able to define two arrays, one containing symbol names and one containing the values of those symbols, for use in constructs such as `With`. For example:               params = {a,b,c,d};     vals = {1,2,3,4};     With[{a=1,b=2,c=3,d=4},Print["Do something fancy"]]      I would like to construct the local variable assignment array {a=1, b=2, ....} automatically. The wishful thinking solution of `With[params = values, ...]` doesn't work and I've tried a random selection of Mapping, Threading and Holding, all to no avail. It looks like a similar question has been answered before however the function proposed by Leonid doesn't work in the `With` block. I suspect my issue focuses on an attempt to manipulate Symbols in a non-trivial manner (and by non-trivial, I simply mean anything beyond a = 1).
