I am trying to take data that I request from an access database and put it into and excel file on the client computer. I usually use ajax to request a summary of the data I need. It is formatted into an html table. I need that table to be in an excel format for the user to download. What I have tried already is to use the vb.net code to open excel and silently save the data to a file, however I realized it's the server side that opens excel, not the client side, in my locally testing of the code, excel would open on my machine and create the file. When running this on the network, I realized excel isn't on the server, I am not sure if I should just install it or try stream the file?
