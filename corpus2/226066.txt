I've just been involved in a debate regarding semantics of how to define approaches to the software development lifecycle. As far as I have been concerned, waterfall and agile are not methodologies, they are vaguely defined approaches/models. The definition of a methodology being a set of tools and techniques used to exactly define the steps taken to develop a successful software project. In my understanding, the following statements are true: -   * SSADM (Structured System Analysis and Design) is a waterfall methodology   * Scrum is an agile methodology   * XP is an agile methodology Thus, it would not make sense to write: -   * Waterfall is a waterfall methodology   * Agile is an agile methodology Since you would get into a recursive mess. The issue is, whenever I get into this debate with anyone, they seem to be certain that waterfall is a methodology and so is agile. An example of what I see as being incorrect is the following article: - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_methodology > Methodologies Waterfall Prototype model Incremental Iterative V-Model Spiral > Scrum Cleanroom RAD DSDM RUP XP Agile Lean Dual Vee Model TDD FDD DDD These are listed as methodologies on the wikipedia page and I find that this is just plain wrong. Can someone please correct me and/or let me know what terminology I should be using?
