I like the GPL license but the project I'm working on is a more general purpose one that will be used inside other programs. It doesn't run independently like a CMS or application would. So I'm looking around at other projects to see what they've done.   * JQuery has an interesting MIT/GPL license   * Zend framework has New BSD license   * Symfony framework has MIT license  As developers, is there an established preference that we expect from libraries. I rarely cared because I never build applications that were sold or distributed, which eliminated the possibility that I would be in conflict with the license of a library I'm using, but I want to know what others are thinking. Will you avoid using a library or a framework if it's GPL? I'm a bit torn. I'd like to use GPL and as the only license (unlike JQuery for example) but I also worry that this will scare developers away who want to use the library to build distributable code. The other thing is I'm seeing that many libraries are frameworks are released as MIT, but I find the MIT license, well, a bit too "loose" for my taste.
