I'm trying to construct a GUI that changes depending on what's chosen in certain popup menu's. For example: The default state of the menu is condition one, but when the first PopupMenu is selected other menu configurations are displayed. To keep the GUI simple each popup menu has a function attached and the menu change allows the user to use a different set of functions. Data input is done by importing so non of these menus provide variable input to functions. I have reviewed this code: Manipulate with a variable number of sliders but have not been able to figure out how to modify it to produce the results I need. Thanks very much for your help! Bad code example follows:               DynamicModule[{n = 1},      Column[{Dynamic[     Grid[Table[       With[{i = i}, {i,          PopupMenu[          Dynamic[data[[i]]], {a -> "one menu" ,            b -> "Add another Menu" }], Dynamic[data[[i]]]}], {i,         n}](*Table*)]](*Dynamic*)}, Center](*Column*)]      I would like the menu to produce a second menu when "Add another Menu" is selected. So for example "Add another menu" is selected and it produces a "New Menu" Popup Menu below it, but remains showing the "Add another menu" selection and does not revert back to "one menu".
