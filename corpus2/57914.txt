I have the following code to show a red area defined by inequalities:               ClearAll["Global`*"];     p = Reduce[y <= 3/10 x + 18 && y > x^2/8, {x, y}]     r = RegionPlot[p, {x, -15, 18}, {y, -5, 25},         GridLines -> {Table[i, {i, -15, 18}], Table[j, {j, -5, 25}]},         PlotStyle -> Directive[{Opacity[0.5], Red}]];     bg = Graphics[{Opacity[0.2], Yellow, Rectangle[{-16, -6}, {19, 26}]}];     range = First /@        Differences /@ (PlotRange /. Options[r]); target = 1; Show[{r, bg},       AspectRatio -> (Last[range]/First[range]/target)]      which shows: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7KHXQ.png) How can I count those integer grids and highlight them with colored dots?
