I am testing the "Power Law with finite-time singularity" hypothesis for world population growth for a project. The data I'm using (same behaviour should also be exhibited by the stock market, thats why I am trying this with financial data):               raw = FinancialData["GE", All];     fraw = Flatten[raw];     data = Table[fraw[[4*i]], {i, 1, Length[raw]}]; (*extracting just the prices*)      I was trying the following regression model:               model = A + B*(c - x)^z;      And then the following curve fit method:               FindFit[data, {model}, {A, B, c, z}, x]      But I always get the result: > Power::indet: "Indeterminate expression 0.^0. encountered." FindFit::nrjnum: > "The Jacobian is not a matrix of real numbers at {A, B, c, z} = {1., 1., 1., > 1.}. " > > {A -> 1., B -> 1., c -> 1., z -> 1.} If I do a normal Power law regression, `FindFit` works perfectly, but the title of the project being "Power Law with finite-time singularity" I need to have the singularity `c` in the model and the main aim is to find when this singularity occurs. Is there a way to use `FindFit` to get the correct answer? Or should I be using some other function? I have seen other articles on this site concerning issues with `FindFit`, but none of them has helped me resolve this problem. Remark: I have already tried the version belisarius has stated below, but the problem with that is that it gives me a `z > 0`. What I need is `z < 0` for `x = c` to be a singularity. So I also tried the following models: `A + B*Abs[c - x]^(-z)` and `A + B*(c - x)^(-z)` with `-z` instead of `z` but those just gave me like 15 other warnings.
