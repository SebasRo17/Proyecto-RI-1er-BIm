Now, there can be many things that can be containers:   * A `Flight` is a `Container`. It can hold `Users`. In such a case the concrete `Assignment` is a `Booking`.   * A `Dinner` is a `Container`. It can hold `Users`. In such a case the concrete `Assignment` is a `Reservation`.   * And many more. You get my point. So I have Abstract notions of `Container` and `Assignment`. `Containers` hold `Assignments` and I also have concrete implementations of them, with each concrete implementation of `Container` matching a concrete implementation of `Assignment`. The straight forward design is as above. My main problem with it is that it doesn't express the relation between each concrete container and the concrete assignment. Any ideas how to better design this?
