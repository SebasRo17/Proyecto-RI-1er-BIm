I'm trying to symbolically evaluate a lot of equations that can consist of up to 10 parameters. The form of these expressions is a product/quotient of rational powers of the mentioned parameters, where the exponents are rational expressions containing a unknown number `p`. Here is a simplified example (containing parameters `Bcr` and `Ft`):               ( (Ft Bcr)^(2 p + 4) * Ft^(23 p - 4) )     / ( Bcr^(1/(2.5 p - 4)) * Ft^( (24 p + 4)/(3 p - 1) ) )^( 3 p - 6)      I would expect, that using `Simplify`, `FullSimplify` or another, similar function I could reduce this expression to a product like this:               Ft^F[p] *Bcr^G[p]      where `F[p]` and `G[p]` are some rational functions of `p`. Now I understand there is a problem with considering complex numbers, multiple roots etc. However, even if I use assumptions:               $Assumptions = p > 0 && Bcr > 0 && Ft > 0      Mathematica still does not evaluate the answer neatly. A follow up question would be: why such calculations take so much time, considering this seems to be the simplest of symbolic expression manipulation - something Mathematica should excel at? So is there a way to simplify such expressions e.g. with a function similar to `FullSimplify`, but which ignores problems concerning domains of variables and multiple values?
