Lets say I have 2 2D arrays where each cell contains a list of values: Example:               data_1[[1]][[1]] = {1,2,3}      data_1[[1]][[2]] = {1,2,3}      data_1[[2]][[1]] = {1,2,3}      data_1[[1]][[2]] = {1,2,3}           data_2[[1]][[1]] = {2,4,6}      data_2[[1]][[2]] = {3,6,9}      data_2[[2]][[1]] = {4,8,12}      data_2[[2]][[2]] = {5,10,15}       What's a neat way to make a discrete 3D plot of the ratio between medians of these data sets (assuming that the indices always mach, but can represent any value, not only consecutive natural numbers).For the following data I would expect a plot of:               x,y,z     1,1,2     1,2,3     2,1,4     2,2,5
