I am going to make an online judge platform. I have looked for some online judge platforms on the Internet for reference (I mean the platforms which have the source code available, and can be hosted my others, not something like Codeforces). Most of them have a web interface written in PHP (or something else). When users submit the solutions of the problems, the submissions are sent to another programs (a server side program written in C++, Java or something else), which is hosted on or not on the same server, through socket. What is the benefit of this design? Why not doing so through PHP, with functions like `exec()`? Which design will you appreciate more?
