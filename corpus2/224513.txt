In a 8X8 chessboard, I was wondering how to implement the symmetry of the board. A lot of positions are just **mirrors** or **rotations** of one another (with no pawns or castling capabilities left the directions are indistinguishable). By using a combination of **vertical, horizontal** and **diagonal mirrorings** of the board it is always possible to fix the position of a piece within the `a1-d1-d4` triangle. How to implement these symmetries on chess board? How does implementation depends on choice of board representation chosen(Bit-boards, 0x88, 8x8 array, and so on) ? **Edit 1:** The main goal is the implementation of the endgame engine generator and compress its results
