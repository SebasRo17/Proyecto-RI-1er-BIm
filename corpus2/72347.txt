It is really frustrating to find that every other open source project's source code and documentation etc., follows slightly or hugely different directory structure and naming conventions.   1. How do I quickly orient my self to the directory/naming conventions?    2. Get to the overall architecture of the app without going through a bunch of source code files?    3. How do I make reaching to the relevant code (that I am interested in) quicker?
