I have this script, which does a bunch of image aligning in parallel: https://gist.github.com/8848a25a15da013ed1ad However, on EVERY print, Mathematica also prints from what Kernel the message came and what the kernel's status is, etc. Is there a way to supress these debug messages? Edit: The messages in question are these: https://gist.github.com/e8ae961dc46c66ed809f And example images are available here: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10190786/done.zip
