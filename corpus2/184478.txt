Here's the thing: I have been learning to code in jQuery (not raw JS) and PHP for about 3 months now. During this time, I have learned a lot of different things, discovered how a web application is built, how web servers work, how databases work, and how I should really learn JavaScript rather than leaning on jQuery. But, I have found myself depending on tutorials and online guides to accomplish a given task; and this really affects my sense of accomplishment, so to speak. I'd never be content with myself, even after building the whole script, because someone had to point it out to me. Because I couldn't get it right by myself. Basically, I have no clue how to "begin" building something from scratch unless I see someone else's implementation first. How do I achieve such a mindset where I will be able to recognize which steps do I have to take in order to go about coding an idea, application, function, etc., without any need of tutorials or examining foreign code. How to move on to the next step, so to speak. TL;DR: How to stop depending on tutorials and write code without someone telling you what to do.
