I've been looking to get into research, but I'm not sure I can do when I've only taken two quarters of Computer Science. I go to the University of Washington, if it's relevant. This is a page on research. I find that I'm not able to judge what is possible for a first year looking through the website. Most things look intimidating, but I'm sure I could somewhere on some problem if I actually attacked it.
