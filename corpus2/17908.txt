For a given function:               Plot[Sqrt[Abs[x]], {x, -Pi, Pi}]      I have the code to draw the function (with its Abs remove), partial sums and cesaro means as:               f[x_] := Sqrt[x]     s[k_, x_] := \frac{2\sqrt{\pi}}{3}+(-Sqrt[2] FresnelS[Sqrt[2] Sqrt[n]] + 2 Sqrt[n] Sin[n \[Pi]])/(n^(3/2) Sqrt[\[Pi]]) Cos[n x], {n, 1, k}]      partialsums[x_] = Table[s[n, x], {n, {4}}];      c[n_, x_] := (1/n) Sum[s[m, x], {m, 0, n - 1}]     Plot[Evaluate[{f[x], partialsums[x], c[4, x]}], {x, -Pi, Pi},     PlotLegends -> {"f(x)=x", "Fourier, 4 terms", "Cesaro, 4 terms"},      PlotStyle -> {{Blue}, {Dashed, Thickness[0.006]}, {Red, Thickness[0.006]}}]      This code fails on my computer and hence I resolve to manual computation. Updates: It turn out that I can easily solve this issue by removing the k with any number rather than letting it to be indefinite. Although I am not certain the graph is right for k=4 as both graphs(Partial and Cesaro) coincides with each other.
