I have a function defined as follows:               fourVertIsoHamilt[x11_, x12_, x13_, x14_, x21_, x22_, x23_, x24_, x31_, x32_, x33_, x34_, x41_, x42_, x43_, x44_] :=        fourVertEnrgy[x11, x12, x13, x14, x21, x22, x23, x24, x31, x32, x33, x34, x41, x42, x43, x44]      + fourVertPenIso[ x12, x21, x22, x23, x24, x32, x33, x34, x44];      Where,               fourVertEnrgy[x11_, x12_, x13_, x14_, x21_, x22_, x23_, x24_, x31_, x32_, x33_, x34_, x41_, x42_, x43_, x44_] :=      1 + 2 x11 x12 + 2 x11 x13 + 2 x11 x14 + 2 x12 x13 + 2 x12 x14 + 2 x13 x14 - x11 - x12 - x13 - x14 +      1 + 2 x21 x22 + 2 x21 x23 + 2 x21 x24 + 2 x22 x23 + 2 x22 x24 + 2 x23 x24 - x21 - x22 - x23 - x24 +      1 + 2 x31 x32 + 2 x31 x33 + 2 x31 x34 + 2 x32 x33 + 2 x32 x34 + 2 x33 x34 - x31 - x32 - x33 - x34 +      1 + 2 x41 x42 + 2 x41 x43 + 2 x41 x44 + 2 x42 x43 + 2 x42 x44 + 2 x43 x44 - x41 - x42 - x43 - x44 +      1 + 2 x11 x21 + 2 x11 x31 + 2 x11 x41 + 2 x21 x31 + 2 x21 x41 + 2 x31 x41 - x11 - x21 - x31 - x41 +      1 + 2 x12 x22 + 2 x12 x32 + 2 x12 x42 + 2 x22 x32 + 2 x22 x42 + 2 x32 x42 - x12 - x22 - x32 - x42 +      1 + 2 x13 x23 + 2 x13 x33 + 2 x13 x43 + 2 x23 x33 + 2 x23 x43 + 2 x33 x43 - x13 - x23 - x33 - x43 +      1 + 2 x14 x24 + 2 x14 x34 + 2 x14 x44 + 2 x24 x34 + 2 x24 x44 + 2 x34 x44 - x14 - x24 - x34 - x44;      and,               fourVertPenIso[ x12_, x21_, x22_, x23_, x24_, x32_, x33_, x34_, x44_] :=      x12 x24 + x12 x34 + x12 x44 + x22 x44 + x32 x44 + x21 x32 + x21 x33 + x21 x34 + x22 x33 + x23 x34;      I would like to minimize it using NMinimize with Simulated Annealing options. So, Mathematica the code is:               NMinimize[{fourVertIsoHamilt[x11, x12, x13, x14, x21, x22, x23, x24, x31, x32, x33, x34, x41, x42, x43, x44],      x11 \[Element] Integers, x12 \[Element] Integers, x13 \[Element] Integers,    x14 \[Element] Integers, x21 \[Element] Integers,    x22 \[Element] Integers, x23 \[Element] Integers,    x24 \[Element] Integers, x31 \[Element] Integers, x32 \[Element] Integers, x33 \[Element] Integers, x34 \[Element] Integers, x41 \[Element] Integers,    x42 \[Element] Integers, x43 \[Element] Integers,    x44 \[Element] Integers,      0 <= x11 <= 1, 0 <= x12 <= 1,    0 <= x13 <= 1, 0 <= x14 <= 1, 0 <= x21 <= 1, 0 <= x22 <= 1,    0 <= x23 <= 1, 0 <= x24 <= 1, 0 <= x31 <= 1, 0 <= x32 <= 1,    0 <= x33 <= 1, 0 <= x34 <= 1, 0 <= x41 <= 1, 0 <= x42 <= 1, 0 <= x43 <= 1, 0 <= x44 <= 1},      {x11, x12, x13, x14, x21, x22, x23, x24, x31, x32, x33, x34, x41, x42, x43, x44},   Method -> "SimulatedAnnealing"]      The global minima is zero which I am getting correctly. The problem is the only configuration my code is suggesting for the global minima is:               x11 -> 0, x12 -> 0, x13 -> 1, x14 -> 0, x21 -> 0, x22 -> 0, x23 -> 0, x24 -> 1, x31 -> 0, x32 -> 1, x33 -> 0, x34 -> 0, x41 -> 1, x42 -> 0, x43 -> 0, x44 -> 0      I repeated 10 times and got the same configuration all the time for the global minima 0. Why isn't my code ever getting other solutions like:               x11-> 0, x22-> 0, x34->1, x43->1
