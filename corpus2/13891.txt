`PopupWindow` objects can be clicked multiple times, opening multiple popup windows for the same object. How can I prevent this? A bit more detail: I have an application which displays a graphic. The user can click on elements of the graphic to call up an information panel about that element using `PopupWindow`. The user might have several of these popups open at once. To prevent confusion, I would like to make sure that the user cannot open more than one popup per object. I can't see a straightforward approach to doing this, so I'm hoping for some ideas from this fine community. Example code:               DynamicModule[{col = ConstantArray[Blue, 5]},      Graphics[{Table[With[{i = i},          PopupWindow[           Dynamic[            col[[i]] = If[CurrentValue["MouseOver"], Red, Blue];            {Dynamic@col[[i]], Disk[{i, 0}, 0.5]}],           Dynamic[            col[[i]] = If[CurrentValue["MouseOver"], Red, Blue];            Framed[Style["Disk " <> ToString[i], White, 20],              FrameMargins -> 80, Background -> Dynamic@col[[i]]]],            WindowSize -> 280]          ], {i, 5}]}]]      _Here I have clicked on disk 4 twice, opening a duplicate of the information window. I want to prevent that:_ ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0NZ5L.png)
