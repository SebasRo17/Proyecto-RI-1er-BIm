I need to set categories for interviewing candidates for Windows Mobile Development. Like for ASP.NET, we can have   1. OOPS    2. .NET Framework (CLR, BCL, MSIL etc)   3. Javascript, jQuery   4. Data Controls    5. ADO.NET   6. SQL Server For Windows Mobile, which are categories that should be included? Being specific to our current product, it has not UI and will run in background. Security is the first thing to take into account. It is a SPY kind of application that will keep track of user activity. It can be used by companies to monotor their employees.
