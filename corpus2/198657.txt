Before starting on a current project I was wondering if there is a terminology for what I am planning on doing? Basically what I want to do is map out every object in layers such as all the controllers and what they'll be called, the methods that will exist under the controllers and their purpose; Including, the models that the methods will be interacting with and the views that will be displayed based on certain actions. This way I've created a detailed to-do list and can catch any duplicates and make them as one call. I've heard of something called doctrine but I'm not sure if it will be what im looking for since i dont know how to use it but have heard of it having to do with documentation.
