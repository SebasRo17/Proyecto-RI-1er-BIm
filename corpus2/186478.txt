I don't have much real life experience with project development and testing, apart from small collegeprojects. During my software engineering lecture, from a bunch of notes, a simple statement caught my eye: > Myths of testing: > >   1. I have been put into testing, what is wrong with me? >   2. .. >   3. .. > I was like: Is this really a myth? Is this not for real? Don’t people in testing team want to be developers? Won’t they think why I am into testing, but not in development? Or people in development are better than me? **Why I think in this way:** because after all these years, in the end if I don't get to write my own software, but have to debug other people's code, won't someone be disappointed? But, on the other hand, maybe I am wrong. It's not just only to sit and debug other's code... There's much more. **Am I missing something?**
