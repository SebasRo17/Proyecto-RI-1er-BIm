I'm an enthusiastic university teacher willing to exploit _Mathematica_ for teaching purposes. I would like to know what kind of _Mathematica_ license would let me:   1. create notebooks and cdf documents to distribute to students   2. and put those documents on my academic page at the university so that my students can interact with the cdfs online. My university does not hold a license, so I'm willing to buy one but I need to be sure it will cover my needs, that's why i'm asking. I would be very grateful for any answers or suggestions on this matter.
