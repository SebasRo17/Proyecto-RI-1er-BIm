In every industry there are two verticals `Product Vertical` and `Service Vertical`, so my question is:   * How does design approach changes while designing Software for Product Vertical as compared to developing Software for Service Vertical ? What are the pros and cons for each case ? Also, in case of Product Vertical,   * How you go about designing Product or Features and what are steps involved ?  Lastly, I was reading How Facebook Ships Code article and it appears that Product Managers have very little influence on how Product is developed and responsibility lies mainly with the Developer for the feature.   * So is this good practice and why one would go for this approach ?    * What would be your comment on this kind of approach ?
