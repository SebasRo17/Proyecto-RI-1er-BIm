I need to know how can I count the number of operations performed during a calculation of a `CompoundExpression`. In some of these expressions there are `Dot` products between matrices and I want to count how many additions a multiplications are performed in each of these calculations. In other words, I need a functions that does the same as the function `cost` of Maple (http://www.maplesoft.com/support/help/Maple/view.aspx?path=codegen/cost) Does anyone know how to do it?
