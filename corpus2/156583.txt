Given that mobile app analytics reporting can cost a customer data traffic that, unlike a web app, use of the mobile app may otherwise not require, should a mobile app provide a user accessible setting to allow customers to opt out of app analytics collection or reporting? If and where should a customer be notified that running a given mobile app might capture and transmit analytics data on the app's usage? Are there any app stores where either of the above is a requirement?
