Hey I have problems reading my mathematica notebooks due to the small fonts. I'd like to change their default values for the input and output. I already figured out that everything seems to be defined in core.nb but I couldn't find any definitions inside. It just states things like: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/URduf.png) But I don't see any definition, also I couldn't find them in the FormatType Styles section that looks like: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KUOjY.png) An easy solution to my problem is to change the magnification but this is only possible in too huge steps. I also played around with the Option Inspector, but I could't find any place that effetcs the font size of my input/output. Changing the FontSize in Global options also didn't change anything: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/j8T6T.png) Any ideas? I know there are many similar threats already but I couldn't find a working answer. And I doubt that the solution has to be super complicated. Edit: Just realized that the last way changes the fonts as expected but only inside the documentation center.
