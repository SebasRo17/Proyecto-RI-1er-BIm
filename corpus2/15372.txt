I wish to use a different version of R than what is provided by _Mathematica_ 9. For example, I want to use the Macports version of R, where `R_HOME` is `/opt/local/lib/R`. When I type:               Needs["RLink`"]     InstallR["RHomeLocation" -> "/opt/local/lib/R"]      I get the error:               InstallR::fail: Failed to install R.      The following error was encountered: Unable to load dynamic libraries >>      (I tried to doctor up my `~/.MacOSX/environment.plist` with `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`, but no luck.)
