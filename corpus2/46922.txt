I am writing a webapp where I use MM via NETLink to process user inputs. In one example, the user will have a textbox in which they can write some simple numerical expression, and using MM together with MathJAX, I'll return this expression as nicely-formatted math. In this example, the user content gets wrapped up in               TeXForm[HoldForm[ ... ]]      My question is this: what are **sufficient** sanitization checks for their input? I want to ensure that I don't end up with something like               TeXForm[HoldForm[1+1]]; BoringCommand[PowerfulCommand[malicious code]]      For example, I could check the input against having either square bracket character and any capital letter, which would work in all the cases I can think of, but I don't know enough to be sure that will work in all cases.
