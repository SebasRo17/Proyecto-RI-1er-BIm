I have a dataset in format `.txt` of a directed network, containing a matrix `A` of dimension `m x 2`, where each row gives the labels of two nodes showing a direct link. For example, when the network has $4$ nodes, the matrix `A` could be               A = [1 2; 1 3; 2 1; 2 4; 3 2; 4 1; 4 2]      where the first row means that there is a link from `1` to `2`, the second row means that there is a link from `1` to `3`, etc. Could you suggest me a way to draw the network specified by `A` in _Mathematica_?
