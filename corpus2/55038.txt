I have 4 different items `{1, 2, 3, 4}`. I want to obtain all possible pairs of two of the items. I have written:               n = 4;     x1 = Tuples[Range@n, n];          Cases[x1, {a_, a_, b_, b_} /; a != b]      gives the desired result: > {{1, 1, 2, 2}, {1, 1, 3, 3}, {1, 1, 4, 4}, {2, 2, 1, 1}, {2, 2, 3, 3}, {2, > 2, 4, 4}, {3, 3, 1, 1}, {3, 3, 2, 2}, {3, 3, 4, 4}, {4, 4, 1, 1}, {4, 4, 2, > 2}, {4, 4, 3, 3}} Now I choose               n = 6;     x2 = Tuples[Range@n, n];          Cases[x2, {a_, a_, b_, b_, c_, c_} /; a != b && a != c && b != c];     % // Short      > {{1,1,2,2,3,3},{1,1,2,2,4,4},<<116>>,{6,6,5,5,3,3},{6,6,5,5,4,4}} again gives the desired result. How would you automate this (for even `n`)? Are there better alternatives?
