I'm currently developing a web-based XML managing program for a client (though I may 'market' it for future clients). Currently, it reads an XML document, converts it into manageable Javascript objects, and ultimately spits out indented, easy to read XML code. **Edit:** The program would be used by clients that don't feel like learning XML to add items or tags, but I (or another XML developer) may use the raw data for quick changes without using an editor. I feel like fundamentally, its ready for release, but I'm wondering if I should go the extra mile and allow support for remembering (and perhaps making) comments before generating the resulting XML. Considering that these XML files will probably never be read without a program interpreting it, should I really bother adding support for comments? I'll probably be the only one looking at raw files, and I usually don't use comments for XML anyway. So, are comments common/important in most XML documents?
