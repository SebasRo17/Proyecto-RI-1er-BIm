I have general understanding that what thread safety means , but I don't know much about threads in context of a java webapplication. I am just curious to know that do I need to concern about thread safety while working with web application. Can their be chances that my web application will cause some problems if I have written codes without concerning about "Thread safety"? Do I need to think about that whether I am using a thread safe collection or not?
