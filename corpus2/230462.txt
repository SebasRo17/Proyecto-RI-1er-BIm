I'm the technical founder of a startup and I'm currently looking to hire a second developer for our product. Since I've been the sole developer, there is no formal organization for the project and I wanted to know what would be the minimum organization required to incorporate this second developer. Right now the code only under source control (a kind of chaotic git repo) but it lacks unit tests and other things that are required for serious development. I was willing to go without those for a while for the sake of speed, but now that the company is growing, we feel that delaying those might be problematic. How to incorporate this second person to work with the code?
