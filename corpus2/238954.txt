With Java 8, I've seen more and more articles about the use of Option/Optional. I understand what they trying to represent, and I see many examples of them being used as returns. However what I don't see is them being used as method/function arguments in languages that don't have the syntax for default/optional parameters. Is there any reason not to use `Optional` as a method argument in the case where you know the argument is something that may or may not be needed? Here's an example I could think of:               Optional<Customer> lookupCustomer(String firstName, Optional<String> middleName, String lastName)
