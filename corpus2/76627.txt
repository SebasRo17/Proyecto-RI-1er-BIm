When we say that "Dennis Ritchie developed C language", do we mean that he has created a compiler (using an 'already' developed other language) which can compile the source code written in C language? if yes, what was language he used to write first C compiler? I understand a compiler is a program and we can create another compiler for C language using presently available C compiler. Is that correct?
