I'm interested in stories where **office bureaucracy** has had direct effect on the final **code quality** result. For example, a friend just told me that at his previous work place the version control system was so bulky that programmers were not allowed to create new "modules" (root directories in the source tree) without asking permissions from the VCS gods. The result was that programmers were unwilling to go through the extra bureaucratic step and instead of properly componentizing their services they ended up piling unrelated functionality on top of existing modules even when functionality was just remotely related to the current definition of the module or the module's name was way in the past. (not to mention renaming a module...) I'm interested in similar stories of office, operational or any other bureaucracy that eventually, perhaps unintentionally affected software quality
