I was playing a bit with the stylesheets to make my own. In the process I have created and installed a few stylesheets but now I would like to remove some of them. First, how do I remove an entry from the Format > Stylesheet menu? Second, where are the stylesheet files kept? I have deleted the files from the `$UserBaseDirectory/SystemFiles/FrontEnd/StyleSheets`, reloaded _Mathematica_ , even rebooted the computer, but my styles are still working! Apparently _Mathematica_ keeps a copy of my files somewhere I don't know about.
