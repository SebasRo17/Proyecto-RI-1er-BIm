I have the following expression:               expr=(Sqrt[2]r Sqrt[(4+r^2) (2+r (r+Sqrt[4+r^2]))])/(4+r (r+Sqrt[4+r^2]))      Then               FullSimplify[expr, r > 0]      just returns the expression. However               Plot[expr, {r, 0, 10}]      shows that it is just r in disguise. Is there any way I can tell Mathematica to be smarter? Which tricks should I use in cases like that above?
