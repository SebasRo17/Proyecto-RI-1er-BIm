I'm learning Scala at the moment via Odersky's Programming Scala (2nd). I'm upto chapter 10 where he starts introducing parameterless and empty-paren methods. I just can't get my head around it. So far, all I understand is that I should use empty-parens if a method has side-effects and parameterless methods otherwise. I can't figure out what is the advantage of this convention. I read the posts on Stack Exchange, but to be honest, when the posts start discussing this topic in some depth I was lost. I'm looking for a simple explanation of what are typical use cases for this language feature and what are the advantages to help me understand it better.
