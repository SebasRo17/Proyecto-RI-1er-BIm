I have a server and many clients (around 50 clients) who connect to that server based on a web application, which is of course based on HTTP protocol, which in turn uses TCP/IP (correct me if I'm wrong, cause I'm not really good at networking). The problem is that, I should develop an alert mechanism, in which, when somebody submits a form with dangerous values, the manager (who is also connected via the same web application) should receive an alert pop-up on his screen, almost real-time (instantly). However, since the HTTP protocol is stateless, I' a little puzzled here. I don't know how I can implement this. One of the solutions could be to use JavaScript alongside `setInterval()` function to **pull** data each second from server. But this seems a little dirty to me and unprofessional. Do you guys have any idea of implementing another solution?
