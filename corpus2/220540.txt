I was recently in a job interview that was mostly technical. One of the things that stood out was my difficulty explaining ideas and concepts. During the interview I decided not to use UML to explain those concepts, because I thought it can be too time consuming and I will make a mess on paper. So how can UML be used to explain ideas in a situation like an interview, where you need to be as concise as possible when explaining technical concepts and ideas? If you think UML is not a good solution for situations like this, then an alternative will be appreciated.
