I have a text file, its content is(for example):                388, 399, 100      *Nset, nset=All, internal, generate       1,  48,  1     *Elset, elset=All, internal, generate       1,  35,   1     ** Section:solidplane     *Solid Section, elset=All, material="rigid body"     *End Instance      Now I want use Mathematica read the above content and modify it; for example, (1) I want the number "48 (3rd line)" to change to number"388 (1st line)", (2) I want the word "All (4th line)" to change to word "Whole", How can I realize it? So the output is:                388, 399, 100     *Nset, nset=All, internal, generate       1,  388,   1     *Elset, elset=Whole, internal, generate       1,  35,   1     ** Section:solidplane     *Solid Section, elset=All, material="rigid body"     *End Instance      I have used the function "ReadList" but failed... Hope someone can help me
