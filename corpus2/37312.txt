Hope there is a solution besides the tedious generation of nested loops. (Trying to avoid reinventing the wheel.) Here is an example with $N = 3$ objects. There are $13$ needed orderings (first `{}` means first place, second `{}` means second place, ...):               1. {a}, {b}, {c}     2. {a}, {c}, {b}     3. {a}, {b, c}     4. {b}, {a}, {c}     5. {b}, {c}, {a}     6. {b}, {a, c}     7. {c}, {a}, {b}     8. {c}, {b}, {a}     9. {c}, {a, b}     10. {a, b}, {c}     11. {a, c}, {b}     12. {b, c}, {a}     13. {a, b, c}      How can I get all such orderings for a given $N$? **UPD:** I also wonder how to get same orderings in binary relations notation, i.e., considering orderings as sets of ordered pairs (also neglecting here such pairs as $(a,a)$, $(b,b)$, ... since they don't make further difference). I found out that this notation is much easier way to further operating with rankings in _Mathematica_. Here are the above $13$ orderings in new notation:               1. {(a,b), (a,c), (b,c)}     2. {(a,c), (a,b), (c,b)}     3. {(a,b), (a,c), (b,c) (c,b)}     4. {(b,a), (b,c), (a,c)}     5. {(b,c), (b,a), (c,a)}     6. {(b,a), (b,c), (a,c), (c,a)}     7. {(c,a), (c,b), (a,b)}     8. {(c,b), (c,a), (b,a)}     9. {(c,a), (c,b), (a,b), (b,a)}     10. {(a,b), (b,a), (a,c), (b,c)}     11. {(a,c), (c,a), (a,b), (c,b)}     12. {(b,c), (c,b), (b,a), (c,a)}     13. {(a,b), (b,a), (a,c), (c,a), (b,c), (c,b)}
