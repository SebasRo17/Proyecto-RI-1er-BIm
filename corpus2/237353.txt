My team are using Scrum and we are new to this methodology. I use Essential Scrum as our guideline but I haven't finished it yet. On a chapter, it says the team should focus on idle tasks, not idle workers which I somewhat agree with it. Anyway, it doesn't say (at least on that chapter) what to do or how to solve it. What are some good suggestion about how to tackle idle tasks? **Update** Idle task in this context means a task that has been in progress for a lot longer than we expect, for example, if a task is estimated to be finish in 2 hours but it has been taking 6 hours and not sure when it will be finished.
