I was asked this question in an interview. I'm somehow supposed to "read" a file into my C program as input without using a file pointer (including "f" functions, e.g. fgets, fscanf etc.). I'm also not allowed to redirect it using the terminal, i.e. no system or exec calls. The program will not get the file during runtime (that's what he said). The interviewer did not answer the question even though I requested him a lot, and I'd like to know how it'd be possible to do this.
