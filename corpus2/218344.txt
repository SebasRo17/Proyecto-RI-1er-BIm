In essence, I'm wondering how licenses affect the legality of using source code **as data**. By that I mean _literally_ storing code in a database as strings and using it e.g. for some syntax highlighting experiments, or other such pursuits. I can think of a couple of scenarios:   * My project is closed-source, and I want to use open-source code as data. If I store code that is under GPL, does the GPL license apply to my project? What about other licenses?   * My project is open-source, but licensed under e.g. MIT. Again, if I store GPL code, does that affect my project? I was thinking about GPL specifically because of its viral nature, but if other licenses would have applicable effects, I'd be interested in hearing about them as well.
