When I was originally learning about SQL I was always told, only use triggers if you really need to and opt to use stored procedures instead if possible. Now unfortunately at the time (a good few years ago) I wasn't as curious and caring about fundamentals as I am now so never did ask to the reason why. What's the communities opinion in this? Is it just someone's personal preference, or should triggers be avoided (just like cursors) unless there is a good reason for them.
