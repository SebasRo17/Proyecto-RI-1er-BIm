I am trying to make surface plots of squashed spheres. The spheres are defined by a list of points. For simplicity, consider the round sphere:               pts = Flatten[        Table[{Sin[θ] Cos[ϕ], Sin[θ] Sin[ϕ],           Cos[θ]}, {θ, 0, π, π/14}, {ϕ, 0,           2 π, 2 π/14}], 1];      One way to plot this is               ListPlot3D[pts,-pts,BoundaryStyle -> None,ColorFunction -> "Rainbow",InterpolationOrder      -> 2]      `ListPlot3D` has the nice feature that it interpolates the data to make a smooth surface. However, the northern and southern hemispheres are shaded differently, so there is a clear break at the equator: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/A7jdx.png) An alternative is to do               ListSurfacePlot3D[pts]      Now the shading is uniform (there is no break at the equator). However, the data is no longer interpolated (and interpolation is not an option for `ListSurfacePlot3D`), so the surface looks rough and lumpy: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xkfXr.png) I am trying to find a solution that combines the best of both world: the smooth surface of `ListPlot3D` with the uniform shading of `ListSurfacePlot3D`.   Any suggestions? Thanks!
