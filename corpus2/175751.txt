I have to debug an issue which requires me to print all the values of a Value Object that is returned by a web service call. The Value object is a complex object in the sense, it has another object as its member which in turn has another object. Printing all the values by using get methods is cumbersome. So I was wondering if there is a way to break down the value object by any way to get to a primitive level like String or int or Date and print them all using one API? I had a look at the below question but my prob is that I don't have access to the source code of the value object. The sources are in obfuscated jar. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2413001/how-to-print-values-of-an-object- in-java
