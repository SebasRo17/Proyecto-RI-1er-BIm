Here is the corresponding code First the equations setup               Vcl[x_, y_, z_] := (-G*(Mcl/a))/Sqrt[(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)/a^2 + c^2];     V[x_, y_, z_] := Vcl[x, y, z] + 1/2*(κ2 - 4*ω^2)*x^2 + 1/2*v2*z^2;          G = 1;     Mcl = 2.2; a = 0.182; c = 1;     ω = 1; κ2 = 1.8; v2 = 7.6;     cl = -3.264444506;     ch = 0.1;     E0 = cl*(1 - ch);      Then the DO loop with the `Solve`               data = {};     Do[       Vx = V[x, 0, z0];       sol = Solve[Vx == E0 && -1.01 < x < 1.01,x];       xmin = x /. sol[[1]];       xmax = x /. sol[[2]];       AppendTo[data, {xmin, xmax, z0}],       {z0, 0, 0.6, 0.001}       ]      And finally the plot               neg = data[[All, {1, 3}]];     pos = data[[All, {2, 3}]];     L1 = ListPlot[neg, Joined -> True,           PlotStyle -> {Black, Thickness[0.003]}];     L2 = ListPlot[pos, Joined -> True,           PlotStyle -> {Black, Thickness[0.003]}];      L0 = Show[{L1, L2}, Axes -> False, Frame -> True,           PlotRange -> {{-1, 1}, {0, 0.6}}, ImageSize -> 550]      which produces this ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6dUga.png) The plot has several issues: (i) it should be a continuous line from -1 to 1, while we observe a gap near 0 and also it never reaches +1, (ii) the lower horizontal line it should not be there; probably `Joined` joins two extreme points. I suspect, that both issues are related to the `Solve` inside the DO loop. There z0 belongs to the interval [0, 0.6] but the equation does not have solutions for all these values. The `data` list should somehow store only the correct solutions and reject the cases where there are no solutions at all. Many thanks in advance.
