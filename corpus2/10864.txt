I need to insert a very large expression in a _Mathematica_ program. So I first Put[large expression,"file"] and then use               Block[{}, Get["file"];...]      to implement the function. But the variables here is not local variables and may interact with other programs. I have tried to use               Module[{},Get["file"];...],      but it does not work. Do you know a clever way to do this?
