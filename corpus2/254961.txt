I started learning Java EE 7 and I am frequently coming across this term "standard", and I don't understand what it means. So, for example, here is a quotation from this book: > Contrary to SOAP and the WS-* stack, which rely on W3C standards, REST has > no standard and is just a style of architecture with design principles. REST > applications rely heavily on many other standards: HTTP, URI, URL... I have some idea of what that might mean, but I'm not sure. The best explanation that I have come across is the definition from here.
