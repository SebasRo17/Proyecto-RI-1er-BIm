I want to plot a function in a `Manipulate` in which the number of terms varies and a `Manipulator` for the coefficient of each term is created or deleted as the terms increase and decrease. For example, when I have three terms, I should get the equivalent of               Manipulate[       Plot[a0 + a1 x + a2 x^2, {x, 0, 10}],        {a0, 1, 10},        {a1, 1, 10},        {a2, 1, 10}]      I want to let the number of terms vary and but still control each coefficient with a `Manipulator`. I tried to do it in the following way:               Manipulate[       Plot[Total[ToExpression["a" <> ToString[#]] x^# & /@ Range[0, n]], {x, 0, 10}],       {n, 1, 10, 1},       Dynamic[Sequence @@ ({ToExpression["a" <> ToString[#]], 1, 10} & /@ Range[1, n])]]      It did not work. Can anybody suggest what I should do to make it work?
