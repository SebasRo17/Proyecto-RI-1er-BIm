I have been specifically asked to give line by line (or as appropriate - for example, image by image, etc.) explanation or commentary which my boss wants to be able to read and follow. Since he is not a programmer, he can not follow the code so wants it all translated into English. Has anyone been asked to do this before? I have commented on all of the source code and used JSDoc to generate full documentation of all functions, variables, etc... and included an implementation example, and full working demos with comments throughout. Is there anything else I can do to comment the code for non-programmers? This isn't a reasonable request, is it? * * * ### UPDATE In the end, I managed to explain why it was not a good use of time to do what he was asking. He is a reasonable guy, and just did not have an understanding of what my job involves. Once he saw this post, I think he quickly understood that it was not a normal request. I did provide documentation that is suitable for another programmer to follow (JSDoc and inline comments - as well as some extra notes on technical issues), and a very broad flow chart diagram of the main logic of the program for my boss to follow. In the end, all parties were satisfied and we have moved on.
