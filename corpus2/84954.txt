I am from the UK. I have about 4 years experience working for a large European IT outsourcing company. This company was split into two; professional service and managed service. I only worked in the managed services and there was a lot of resources issues concerning reaching customer's expectation and there was a lot of conflict priority. I didn't enjoy may experience as a lot of arguments were involved with all internal parties and conflict of interest with external customers, legal matters etc. I do think now that perhaps, as a employee, I do not want to work in IT outsourcing company and just work for a company that handle its own IT services. I am wondering what has your experience been like? Are you or have you worked in the professional services or managed services? what was your experience like? Have you worked in both services and what is your preference? Look forward to your responses.
