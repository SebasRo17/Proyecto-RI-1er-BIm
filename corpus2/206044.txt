This is my first project related to SMS verification. How to implement SMS verification in online ordering web application? For example:- when we try to reset the password in amazon's website, it sends an sms verification code and after entering the code it proceeds with changing the password. I want to implement the same function in my application, where users will place order, but before the final step it will send an sms verification code to the users mobile and verify the same. The main requirement is SMS Gateway(Transactional Quality). But as I'm completely new in this, so any idea how to proceed, or how can I implement it.
