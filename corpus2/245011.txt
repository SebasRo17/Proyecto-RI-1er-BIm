When you have some process that has several steps and you multiple entry points the code gets ugly pretty fast. I encountered this with Facebook integration in my mobile app: User wants to share something. Before that can happen, I need several things:   1. a session (if there's no FB session, start one, get access_token ...)Â¨   2. load permissions I have (or take from cache)   3. check if I have publish permissions for this user (if not, ask for it) With all these ready I can finally make the call to Facebook. The way I want this functionality to work ideally is just call something like `Facebook.post( ... , successCallback, failureCallback)` But with these four asynchronous operations it just looks really messy. Do you have any good patterns that might be useful in this situation?
