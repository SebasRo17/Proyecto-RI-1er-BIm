I want to read (temperature) values from plotted (cooling) curves and visualize them in layered circles. I have an example made manually for clarification: 3 plotted curves, at certain time steps the value of all plotted curves are read out -> I made a scale assigning (temperature) values to colors. These colors are used further to color the inner circle ( _value from curve "center"_ ), the mid-layer ( _value from curve "half radius"_ ) and the outer layer ( _value from curve "radius"_ ). Data can be found here (csv-file) Thank you for helping me! ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Pb4IH.jpg)
