I would like to expand $\frac{x}{1- \frac{1}{x}}$ as $$\frac{x}{1- \frac{1}{x}} = x \left( 1+ \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x^2} +\frac{1}{x^3} + \cdots \right) = x + 1 + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x^2} + \cdots $$ However, I tried               Series[1/(1 - 1/x), {1/x, 0, 2}]      it doesn't work or               1/(1 - 1/x) /. 1/x -> t          Series[%, {t, 0, 3}]          % /. t -> 1/x          Expand[x*%]      it ends up to $x \left( 1+ \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x^2} +\frac{1}{x^3} + \cdots \right) $ cannot be expanded to break the bracket. How should I do to arrive at $x + 1 + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x^2} + \cdots $?
