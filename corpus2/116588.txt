I'd like to know the Agile stance on the following situation:   * A contractual, payable milestone states a working version must be installed and run at customer's location;   * Development is still ongoing, not all user stories and issues are addressed;   * A later deployment will be required My understanding was that the product owner would view the software in its development environment until final QA is done, and then (and not before) would it be deployed into the final production environment.
