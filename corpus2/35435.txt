I have the following expression in Mathematica                   -((E^(2 - 2 Sqrt[(x[1] - x[2])^2]) (x[1] - x[2]))/Sqrt[(x[1] -         x[2])^2])      I want to replace anything of the form `Sqrt[t^2]` to `t`. I tried               -((E^(2 - 2 Sqrt[(x[1] - x[2])^2]) (x[1] - x[2]))/       Sqrt[(x[1] - x[2])^2]) /. Sqrt[(t_)^2] -> t      But it just does the changes in the numerator and not in the denominator. What is that I am doing wrong here? Thanks in advance! -dbm
