I have been working on asp.net applications for 6 years but almost all of it has been extending and maintaining existing applications. I now have the need to develop a new application and I am scratching my head :( There is a lot of material on Software Design principles and patterns but not much content on organisation. Should the various layers be in separate namespaces, folders or projects? I do have plan to create WCF in future so having Service layer as project makes sense but I am unsure of how many projects I should have? By default, MVC 3 web site has Models and Controllers in the same project does it make sense to separate them to different projects? I would be very very appreciative if someone can post screen shot of well organised MVC 3 solution. I understand this probably depends on personal preference and project size but I need some kind of guidance. Our main application has over 70 projects in a mammoth solution...Please help me avoid this. Many thanks.
