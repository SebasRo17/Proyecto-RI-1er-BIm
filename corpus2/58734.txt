I have a sequence given by an explicit formula for n-th term:               seq[n_] := FullSimplify[LerchPhi[1/2, 2, -n] - 2^(-2-n) (π^2 - 6 Log[2]^2)/3];     Array[seq, 10]     (* {1, 3/4, 35/72, 11/36, 347/1800, 149/1200, 9701/117600, 209/3675, 8093/198450, 6031/198450} *)      I am trying to find a recurrence relation for this sequence (e.g. in a form of `DifferenceRoot` object). An invocation of `DifferenceRootReduce` does not produce a desired result:               DifferenceRootReduce[LerchPhi[1/2, 2, -n] - 2^(-2-n) (π^2 - 6 Log[2]^2)/3, n]     (* LerchPhi[1/2, 2, -n] - 2^(-2-n) (π^2 - 6 Log[2]^2)/3 *)      Are there any other ways to find a recurrence relation for a sequence?
