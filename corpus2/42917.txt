I am trying to solve very simple system of coupled differential equations using the `NDSolve` function, but I am getting `"Infinite expression 1/0.^(1/4) encountered."` Any idea how to solve the problem? I was looking for solutions where people suggested to shift the `"Initial boundary point"` or by using the `Method -> {"Shooting", "StartingInitialConditions" ->.....`. Could not manage to resolve it. Thanks in advance. The code is as follows:               alphaphi = 2*10^-13;     MX = 1.15*10^-12;     Mphi = 10^13;     alphaX = 10^-2;     gstar = 200;     HubbleI = Mphi;     Mpl = 1.22*10^19;          phiI = (3/(8*Pi))*Mpl^2/Mphi^2 *HubbleI^2/Mphi^2;          T[x] = (30/(gstar*Pi^2))^(1/4)*Mphi*R[x]^(1/4)/x;     Xeq[x] = MX^3/Mphi^3 *(2*Pi)^(-3/2)*x^3*(T[x]/MX)^(3/2)*     Exp[-MX/T[x]];     c1 = Sqrt[3/(8*Pi)]*Mpl*alphaphi/Mphi;     c2 = c1*Mphi*alphaX/(MX*alphaphi);     c3 = c2*Mphi/MX;          sol = NDSolve[{D[phi[x], x] == -c1*x*phi[x]/Sqrt[phi[x]*x + R[x]],      D[R[x], x] ==       c1*x^2*phi[x]/Sqrt[phi[x]*x + R[x]] +        c2*x^-1*(X[x]^2 - Xeq[x]^2)/Sqrt[phi[x]*x + R[x]],      D[X[x], x] == -c3*x^-2*(X[x]^2 - Xeq[x]^2)/Sqrt[phi[x]*x + R[x]],      phi[1] == phiI, R[1] == 0, X[1] == 0}, {phi, R, X}, {x, 1, 10^5}];          Plot[Evaluate[{phi[x], R[x], X[x]} /. sol], {x, 1, 10^5},      PlotRange -> All]
