I have a file that contains binary strings like               01011     00101     01011      I want to import the file to Mathematica as a list of strings, but               Import["test.dat", "Table"]      gave me               {{1011}, {101}, {1011}},      which is a list of numbers rather than strings. What should I do to make sure that the binary strings are read as strings rather than numbers?
