I have a project written using Swing, and I want to make it more smoothly (like JavaFX is) by adding animation to some components(`JButton`, `JScrollPane`, `JSplitPane`) using `javax.swing.Timer`. **UPD:** That is not a game. I want to use the Timer for short animations like mouseHover events or dropdown, or scroll. But the problem is, a lot of Timer objects should be created. **Question:** What action does it perform for JVM? I would start and stop a lot of Timers during app session.
