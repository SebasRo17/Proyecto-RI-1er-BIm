I'm programming in Objective-C. I want to include a camera library, DLCImagePicker, in my project. There is a variable I need to change, but it is private and I have no access to it. I've thought of a few way to get around this, but am not sure on the best practice way to do it.   1. I can just copy the code into my own class and alter the variable.   2. I can alter it directly in the original class. However, I have included this code as a git submodule and I'm thinking that touching the source code is a bad idea in this case, and in general.   3. Subclassing. I can't imagine how this would work, as the variable is private.   4. I can perform some action with git that would create my own fork/branch of the project, and alter it there. I have never done this and am very primitive with git.
