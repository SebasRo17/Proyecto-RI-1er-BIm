At my school there is apparently a Computer Science degree, which is located under the "department of natural sciences", while Management Information Systems is considered "business". Besides the usual descriptions that can be found about both jobs, I was wondering how the job of MIS actually differs from say, that of a software engineer or programmer. Just curious, thanks
