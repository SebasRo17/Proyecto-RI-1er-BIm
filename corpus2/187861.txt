I'm probably missing something here, after searching I couldn't find an answer. I've explored quite a few Python projects and one thing I keep noticing is the fact that the majority of them continue to use the **`%`** operator for formatting strings rather than the newer, recommended **`.format()`** method. Is there a reason for this? it seems like a trivial change, unless I'm missing something entirely. For example:               # count how many times the % operator technique is used     find . -name "*.py" -exec grep -HE "\"[^\"]+\"\s\%\s\w+|'[^']+'\s\%\s\w+" {} \; | wc -l          # and the same for format()     find . -name "*.py" -exec grep -HE "\w+\.format\(" {} \; | wc -l          # Results:     #     #               % operator        format()     # iPython          670               63     # Django           977               8     # Tornado          91                0     # requests         25                1      No real reason for this question, just curious. Cheers guys!
