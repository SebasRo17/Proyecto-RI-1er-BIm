How to use Savitzky-golay filter on csv file? I have file.csv in this format:               0.1,1.6,2.8,0     0.2,1.2,2.3,1     0.7,1.5,2.4,2     0.6,1.2,2.7,3     0.4,1.4,2.9,4     0.3,1.3,2.5,5      description               number1,number2,number3,id      I need to load CSV, use savitzky-golay filter on numbers1, numbers2 and numbers3 seperatly. And then save it into csv again. Can you help? EDIT: I've already tried to parse csv, try filter from example and plot it:               table = Take[Import["file.csv"]];     first = table[[All,1]];     c = SavitzkyGolayCoefficients[20, 20, 4];     c = N[c];     filterOutput = SavitzkyGolayFilter[test, c];     ListLinePlot[{filterOutput, first}]      How to save it to CSV again in same format. What does `SavitzkyGolayCoefficient` menas?
