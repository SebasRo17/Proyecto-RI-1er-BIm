I'm planning on using scripting for automated UI testing. Main application is written in c#, and I want it to be scriptable, so I can do everything end-user can do, but programmatically. I'll avoid opinion-based questions like "What do you think of software that provides an interface for scripting, like VBA macros in Excel?", or "Can this be future of all programming, big and small?" although some inside would be great. Here goes the question:   * Which is most suitable to the purpose of building such an interface for your own application, dll-based approach or by parsing own scripting language?
