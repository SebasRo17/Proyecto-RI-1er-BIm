Why do we use to talk about addresses and memory of variable in C, where in other languages (like in Java, .Net etc) we do not talk about variable address and memory in a program, we will directly use the variables. But in C Language we are listening the word address and memory. How to explain this? I hope C is high level language designed over the assembly language. So C is a thin layer over assembly language (in assembly language we will use memory locations to store a variable and track a variable). But in other languages these addresses and memory related things are wrapped in that specific language, so that we will not listen these words.
