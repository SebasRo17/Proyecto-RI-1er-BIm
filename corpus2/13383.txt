I am trying to plot a vector function of a fluid flow given by $\vec{V} = (\frac{-\cos(\theta)}{r^2},-\frac{\sin(\theta)}{r^2})$ I am trying to plot it in Mathematica using the command below, I converted to Cartesian coordinates by the way. But this does not run in Mathematica. Without the `Exclusions` option, I only get one arrow at the origin. Can you help me with this plot?               VectorPlot[           {-(x/(x^2 + y^2)^(3/2)), -(y/(x^2 + y^2)^(3/2))},            {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1},            Exclusions -> {(x^2 + y^2)^(3/2) == 0}       ]
