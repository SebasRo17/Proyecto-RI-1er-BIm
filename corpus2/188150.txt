I am developing an application for Android in JAVA which calls GPLed C-code via JNI. I have modified & capsulated a GPL-software under a JNI-interface and compile it as a shared library (.so) which I can use via JNI from my JAVA-part (the commercial part with closed source). Because I have stripped the original GPL-software from everything which is not needed by my software, that GPL-software has no more other GPL-dependencies which explicitly forbid using it as a shared library in a closed-source software (like SecretRabbitCode for example forbids it). I have no problem to set my modified version of the GPL-software online, but I cannot do this with my commercial software. Because I need the modified version of the GPL-software in my software, I have to bundle it in one package (a APK-file in Android). Sadly, the GPL-software has 1 or 2 more dependencies to GPL-code (just C-files like aes.c), so it's not as easy as just ask the author of this GPL-software. Because the Android-way of "packing JAVA and .so-files together, bundle it and distribute it" is quite new, it's not as easy as with pure JAVA or pure C code. Who can help out?
