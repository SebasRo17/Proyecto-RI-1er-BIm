This is a more of a problem report than a question. When merging the two cells Cell1:               foo     (*foobar*)     bar      and Cell2:               foobar      the line immediately before the comment together with the comment line embark on a journey into another universe, leaving nothing behind than a vicious red box and the farewell greeting "A RowBox with an invalid first argument was encountered. The first argument to RowBox must be a list." _Mathematica_ 9
