Imagine I have some list:               listA = {"a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j"};      I'd like to randomly select `k` positions in the list, for example `k = 3` and we select positions `{1,9,10}`, then randomly shuffle the elements at these positions e.g. giving us ONE of the following five possible outcomes:               listApartialscramble1 = {"a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j"};     listApartialscramble1 = {"a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","j","i"};     listApartialscramble2 = {"i","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","j","a"};     listApartialscramble3 = {"i","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","a","j"};     listApartialscramble4 = {"j","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","a"};     listApartialscramble5 = {"j","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","a","i"};      Is there a simple way to do this, perhaps with `RandomSample`?
