I have a `Manipulate` where a portion of the calculation that ends up displayed is dependent on a subset of the `Manipulate` control variables. It would make sense to cache that portion of the computation, only updating it if those controls are altered. Here's an example to illustrate:               ClearAll[preCalculateStuff]     preCalculateStuff = (#1  #2 ) & ;          Manipulate[ DynamicModule[{f},       f = preCalculateStuff[a, b];       Plot[(f t) Sin[  t + r ], {r, 0, 2 Pi}]],      {{a, 0.5}, 0, 1},      {{b, 0.5}, 0, 1},      {{t, 0.5}, 0, 1} ]      My real `preCalculateStuff` builds a big table, each element requiring a 4x4 `Eigensystem` call. I'd like to restrict that calculation to only do it when the control variables it is dependent on change. I've been pointed to `TrackedSymbols :> {var1, var2}` as a mechanism to avoid re-evaluation of the display. However, I still want to re-evaluate the display here (when any variable changes, including any that I would track), so it's not obvious to me how that would be applicable (unless it was to implement a `calculate` button, which wouldn't be terribly elegant).
