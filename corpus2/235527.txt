I've searched about this here and on StackOverflow and found some differences between the two. But I'm still not sure _in what cases one would prefer a Singleton, and in what cases one would choose to use a static class_. (In languages which don't support 'static classes', like Java, I'm obviously referring to classes containing only static methods and fields). Please give me concrete examples of cases where you would pick each one, and explain why.
