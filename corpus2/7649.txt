Let's say I have a matrix, $\mathbf{M}$, that is polynomially dependent on a single variable, such as               M = {{15 + a^2, a + 5 a^2}, {a - 5 a^2, 2}}      and I want to find the individual matrices, $\mathbf{A}_i$, such that $$\mathbf{M} = \mathbf{A}_0 + a \mathbf{A}_1 + a^2 \mathbf{A}_2 + \ldots$$ How do I do this? What do I use if there are multiple variables? Also, can I specify that certain symbols are not to be treated in this manner, e.g.               M = {{15 + a^2, a + 5 a^2}, {a - 5 a^2, 2 c}}      where the constant matrix would be `{{15, 0}, {0, 2 c}}`? Ideally, this should be applicable to vectors and tensors, also.
