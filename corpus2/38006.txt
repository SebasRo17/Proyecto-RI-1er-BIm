I would like to know how to perform numeric integration for the following type of integrals in _Mathematica_.   For the following integrand, we can not get the symbolic result.               NIntegrate[ y * Integrate[ 1/x * HankelH1[1, k*x] * HankelH2[1, x/k], {x,1,y}],                {y, 1, 2}]         The aim of the integration is to find the real and imaginary parts of the result. Your views and inputs are greatly appreciated.
