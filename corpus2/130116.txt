My production database is SQL Server 2008 R2 Express. It has limited features and I am testing it in a production environment. To better handle reporting queries in a highly concurrent environment, I want to use any open-source RDBMS with tables that will be acting as temporary tables to frequently fill recent records and delete them after use. The only problem is that I need to keep two connections for each RDBMS, but I feel, Firebird or PostgreSQL can give me better performance of reports in a highly concurrent environment. What are your suggestions? Is this approach used in any commercial scenario?
