I have been working on a project comprising of databases, and I recently received a bug report for the remote execution of some queries. Usually, you try to find out the actual cause for the bug to occur and then fix it.   But sometimes what I do when I'm fed up of doing some research (and can't find suitable information on the internet) is just change the logic, which takes me much less time compared to the other option. Is this approach correct, or should I try to fix the original bug involving more R&D?
