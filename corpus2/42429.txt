I have an equation set `Ax=b` and `A(n*m),n<m` . To lower down the dimension, I express some vars by other vars, which gives `By=c`. After some calculation, the values of `y` is achieved and I want to get `x` back. How can I accomplish this work? **The main aim is to get the substitution and back substitution, instead of solving the equations.** Remark: `n` and `m` are not fixed, the code need to be general for different scales. For example:               x[1]+x[2]+x[3]==1&&x[2]+x[4]==1      Then we have:               x[1]==x[4]-x[3]&&x[2]==1-x[4]      And after some calculation, I get `{x[3],x[4]}=={0,1}` and I want to get:               {x[1],x[2],x[3],x[4]}=={1,0,0,1}      I know it's silly to use `x[i]`, as I can't handle matrices well. I believe there is a way to finish all these in the language of matrices.
