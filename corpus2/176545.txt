While the core of requirements development and acceptance criteria would ideally take place during the planning meeting in order to create a better estimate, Scrum encourages continuous interaction with the product owner throughout the sprint to validate and refine user stories.   * What kind of criteria is used to judge if there is too much change being imposed on a user story mid-sprint?   * When is it appropriate to change the requirements of the user story?   * When is it appropriate to cancel the user story / sprint in order to re-evaluate and re-estimate a user story in question?
