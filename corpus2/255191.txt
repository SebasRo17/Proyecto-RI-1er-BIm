I've been stuck on a concept for a while. I've been writing toy-languages that are interpreted recently. I've decided I want to move on and to try and create a compiler. I don't really want to use something like LLVM, but instead I want to create my own Stack Based Virtual Machine to generate code for. My question is, how would I go around this? Or rather, what are some good references for building a compiler, which generates code for a custom virtual machine, and finally -- what's the formal term for such a compiler?
