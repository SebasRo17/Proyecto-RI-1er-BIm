Sorry for the blunt question, I will try to explain further. I am going to have a website which uses jQuery, and I feel that at some point in time, there will be A LOT of jQuery code, meaning A LOT of functions, jQuery selectors, etc. Is there a way to limit the availability of jQuery code for specific pages? Perhaps using objects? I'm looking for the best approach here so I don't just run off into a storm and can't find my way out. Thanks.
