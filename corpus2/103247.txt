I am an Electrical Engineering undergrad. I've reading many technical papers about Signal and Image processing algorithms (reconstruction, segmentation, filtering, etc). Most of the algorithms shown in these papers are defined over continuous time and continuous frequency, and often give the solutions in terms of complicated equations. How would you implement a technical paper from scratch in C++ or MATLAB in order to replicate the results obtained in said paper? More specifically, I was looking at the paper "A general cone-beam reconstruction algorithm" by Wang et al (IEEE Trans Med Imaging. 1993;12(3):486-96), and I was wondering, how do I even start implementing their algorithm? Equation 10 gives you the formula of the reconstructed image at . How would you code that up? Would you have a for-loop going through each voxel and computing the corresponding formula? How would you code functions of functions in that formula? How would you evaluate functions at arbitrary points? I've read the book "Digital Image Processing" by Gonzalez and Woods but I'm still at a loss. I have also read about the Numerical Recipes book series. Would that be the correct way? What are your experiences programming algorithms from research papers? Any tips or suggestions?
