In _Mathematica_ 7 I was accustomed to a certain workflow:   1. Paste an image into a Notebook   2. Select **Actual Size** from the context menu, if necessary   3. `Ctrl`-drag the control points on the sides of the frame to soft-crop the image   4. Use **File** > **Save Selection As...** to save the cropped image to a file This workflow is broken in version 10 because in it the entire _uncropped_ image is saved whether I select the image itself or the enclosing Cell frame. I can use the Crop Tool to crop the image, and that does allow me to save a cropped selection, but it hard-crops the image so that I cannot in the future change my crop selection. (Of the Image in the Notebook.) If the soft-cropped Image is part of a larger selection (but not merely a Cell containing only the image) the cropped part is indeed saved. This works for saving sections of Notebooks but not images alone. The only work-around I have found to both keep a soft-cropped Image and save a matching copy is to copy the Image and crop it again with the Crop Tool, then delete the copy. This adds significant time to my workflow. **Is this change a bug or a feature?** **Is there another way to accomplish what I want interactively?**
