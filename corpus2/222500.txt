For one project, I needed to find a solution to avoid code like this:               if ([self.desiredColor isEqualToString:@"Red"])         [self constructRedMenu];     else if ([self.desiredColor isEqualToString:@"Blue"])         [self constructBlueMenu];      So I decided to create an category of NSObject. You can find the open-source code here: https://github.com/JeanLebrument/NSObject-MethodCallDependingType But I have only been developing on iOS for a few months and I would like to have opinions from more experienced iOS developers. Is there any risk to the stability of the app using this Category? Any constructive comments or opinions are welcome! Edit : Change the exemple of using this category in this post and on GitHub.
