> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  How does Mathematica integrate? Mathematica can perform the following integral with apparent ease (returning _very_ fast with the result)               Integrate[(1 - a Tan[b x]^2)^(-1/2), x]       The answer happens to be               (ArcTan[(Sqrt[2] Sqrt[1 + a] Sin[b x])/Sqrt[  1 - a + (1 + a) Cos[2 b x]]] Sqrt[1 - a + (1 + a) Cos[2 b x]]   Sec[b x])/(Sqrt[2] Sqrt[1 + a] b Sqrt[1 - a Tan[b x]^2])      Is there a way to have Mathematica show what sort of substitutions it made along the way?
