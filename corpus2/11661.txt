I created this progress bar to use in my codes:               progressBar1[var_,total_]:=Row[{ProgressIndicator[var,{0,total}]," ",                Row[{NumberForm[100. var/total,{\[Infinity],2}],"%"}],"% ",var}]      But to use it I have to implement like this:               Module[{n = 10, i = 0},         Print[Dynamic@progressBar1[i, n]];         (i++; Pause[0.1]) & /@ Range[n];      ]      I tried to implement like this, but with no success.               progressBar2[var_,total_]:=Print[Dynamic@Row[{ProgressIndicator[var,{0,total}]," ",                Row[{NumberForm[100. var/total,{\[Infinity],2}],"%"}],"% ",var}]]          Module[{n=10,i=0},         progressBar2[i,n];         (i++;Pause[0.1])&/@Range[n];     ]      The idea is to change `progressBar2` to make it usable inside Module without necessity to call Dynamic and Print. I've seen this similar post How to create a progress bar? , but didn't get how to upgrade my code. Some clue?
