So I am trying my hand at this whole tiered application thing with ASP.NET 4. The software I've developed is a maintenance nightmare and it isn't very well organized. I've done some looking around the web and can't seem to find an example of what I'm looking for here. Someone please pick this design apart. My Data Access Layer will be an assembly with LINQ to SQL. I will have a Business Logic Layer that references the DAL assembly and does what BLLs do. Very general and basic stuff. Then I will have a business objects class that does some that is data-related but is more "work" type stuff - like generating documents, etc. The web site will interact with the BLL and the business objects. So:                   DAL          |          |          |         BLL----------BO          |           |          |           |          |           |         Web----------|      Am I making this way too complicated? Should I just put my business logic right in there with the LINQ classes in the DAL? I'm not sure how a DataContext would work in a separate assembly with classes that inherit from LINQ classes. Thoughts?
