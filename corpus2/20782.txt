So currently I have ![Graph](http://i.stack.imgur.com/lWmcl.png) via combining 3 Plot3D's in a show. My question is how can I make it so that the ONLY portion of that border highlighted green, is the "curving portion" in the xy plane, rather than the whole border...? Related Code: Code is a variation on               Show[Plot3D[{x^2 + y^2}, {x, 0, 1}, {y, 0, 1},        RegionFunction -> Function[{x, y, z}, x + y < 1]],       Plot3D[{0}, {x, 0, 1}, {y, 0, 1},        RegionFunction -> Function[{x, y, z}, x + y < 1],        BoundaryStyle -> Green]      ]
