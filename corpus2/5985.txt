When plotting a slow function, it would be nice to know how much of the work has already be done. However due to the refinement algorithm, simply monitoring the integration variable doesn't give an useful estimate unless `MaxRecursion` is set to 0 (and it's clear that the best I can hope for is an estimate). For example, consider               Monitor[Plot[Pause[0.01];Sin[x],{x,0,100}],x]      This goes through the interval dozens of times, although the number of points in each iteration goes down. Therefore my question: Is there any way to get a reasonable estimate of how much of a plot is already done?
