It appears that native support for the Klingon alphabet has been removed from version 10:               \[KlingonA]      > Syntax::tsntxi: "\"!(\\[ KlingonA])\" is incomplete; more input is > needed.!(\"\")" (Curiously `"Klingon"` remains in the `$CharacterEncodings` list.) As an exercise I wish to restore support of this character set but the underlying character system has been modified; specifically I cannot find the `UnicodeFontMapping.tr` file and I assume it no longer exists. Quoting `TechnicalNotes.nb` found in the `Prerelease` folder: > On all systems, the Mathematica family of fonts (Mathematica*1-7) has been > replaced with a single Mathematica font. > > On Windows, the single Mathematica font is no longer installed under > "c:\windows\fonts". Instead, the user interface loads the font from the > installation directory. > > For prerelease testing, we are interested in learning about any issues > related to this change. `UnicodeCharacters.tr` does remain and the format appears unchanged so I should be able to restore recognition of `\[KlingonA]` etc., but without being able to map these characters to font glyphs that is largely pointless. (Though it would correct unrecognized syntax in legacy code.) ### How can one create named characters and bind them to specifc glyphs in v10?
