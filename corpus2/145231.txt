If i create this method               public void foo()      And then i create an overloaded version like this               public void foo( string bar )      Do we say that the second functions overloads the first, or are both methods equally "overloaded". This would imply ( i think ) , that there is a base type function, that is being overloaded, by another function. ( somewhat like inheritance, but not really ) Assuming that one method can "overload an other", would also imply terms like "overloader" and "overloadie", if that is a word at all. But that doesn't feel right at all, especially since you can have several overloads. I got to this question when i wanted to write down the process of creating an overloaded method and i wanted the most correct way of writing it down. Examples:   * I am overloading `foo`   * I am overloading `foo` with `foo( string bar )`   * I am creating an overloaded method    * I am making foo overloaded So yeah, this kind of got my thinking, i am not sure what to make of it. There are hundreds, if not thousand, descriptions of function overloading online, but at a first glance i couldn't find any addressing this.
