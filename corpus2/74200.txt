So my teacher tells me that it is very important to not encapsulate the program code and the graphical interface code in the same classes, But to keep them completely independent. Im currently writing an iphone game with a grid in it. to me it makes much more sense to Create both the graphical grid and the technical code in the same "Grid" class. Will other programmer frown upon this? Is it indeed very important to keep the graphical interface and code independent. What problems will arise if I don't? Thank you! EDIT: thanks guys! Would it be ok for me to write up the project first and then copy code around to form the separation of concerns design. I know that this may totally defeat the purpose, but just as practice...So that next time I can apply this design pattern from the start?
