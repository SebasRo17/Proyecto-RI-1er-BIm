I have a website that stores all users in a database. A user can log on to the website and if they have sufficient privileges can add/delete users, as well as change their privileges. How do I ensure there is always at least one Administrator (to create/edit/delete users) in the system or that an administrator can easily be added to the system. Surely I can put rules in place so that the Admin can't delete himself, or other rules like that. But what if someone deletes all the users in the SQL table. The passwords are hashed so it's not as if the DBA can just go in and add a new user with Admin rights. Do I hardcode some special username/password that automatically gets added to the system if no Admin exists?
