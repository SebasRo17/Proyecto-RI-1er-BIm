I work at a Fortune 500 company as a Windows software developer in R&D. Corporate IT is currently gearing up for a company-wide Win7 deployment and as a part of it they are looking to completely lock down admin rights on all boxes (including our dev workstations). I've been tasked to work with them to make the transition as smooth as possible. Lucky me. I'd like to know if there are any published or other highly respected resources out there that I can use to:   1. figure out where to draw a line in the sand    2. back up my position.  Personally, my take is that we're R&D and our job is to do things that are 'out of the box'. Thus we need admin rights. However, having started my career as a Windows Admin, I'm aware of their goals and what they need to achieve. What I need to figure out and back up is a way to build the environment in a way that both IT and R&D can live with it and continue to perform their jobs productively. Development VMs with local admin rights will definitely help a lot, but not in all cases since we interface with lots of custom hardware. The CIO pushing these changes is definitely a 'pure IT' kind of guy with limited knowledge of the development process so I need some references that would be appropriate to share with someone like that. I'm not looking to gather a lot of personal opinions (a lot of which have already been shared here), I really need whitepapers, magazine articles, scholarly works, etc to use to make a strong case to upper management.
