I'm fairly new to Mathematica but I'm in the process of setting up some basic analysis based off someone else's work. They had a number of shared functions stored in a shared code directory and were using `Get` to import them; however, their code was stored in `.txt` files. I'd like to replicate that setup but use `.m` files instead to take advantage of Mathematica formatting / debugging, but when I try to import the code from my files the function definitions don't seem to come through. `Get` isn't returning any errors, but my functions seems to remain undefined (e.g. name in blue, returned as symbolic). Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks!
