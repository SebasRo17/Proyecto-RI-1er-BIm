I am writing code that uses one library with GPL (not LGPL) license, and one with the 3-clause BSD license. Since I link to GPL-licensed library, my code will need to be GPL as well. How should I, in practice, deal with the original LICENSE.txt from the BSD-library? (A) Can I distribute a project so that the main source code is GPL-licensed, and then some subdirectory is BSD-licensed? (B) If I were not only to link to libraries, but to use and combine the BSD and GPL code in a more involved manner, what to do with the LICENSE.txt then? The 3-clause BSD text tells: "Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer." so apparently I should retain the copyright notice, and that list of conditions, somewhere. But then I'll also need to put the GPL license txt-file somewhere. Further, apparently I don't need to retain the "Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:" part of the BSD license text, since it only tells me to retain the other parts. So, how, and in which text files, should I in practice organize the GPL license text and the parts of the BSD license and copyrights that I retain? EDIT: So in case B, I would be taking 3-clause BSD licensed code, and redistributing it under GPL, which is permitted, as 3-clause BSD license is (one-way) compatible with GPL. I am just asking how to deal with the license texts and textfiles in practice.
