Do you think it's a good practice to implement a possibilty to allow an administrator user to login in as another user, by-passing password? This could by implemented by a master password or a function inside the user administration, "Login as this user". Administrators are asking for a such function to be able to try to reproduce a reported problem or to check if grants are ok, for example.
