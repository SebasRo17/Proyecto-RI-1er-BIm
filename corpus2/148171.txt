Sometimes I'm such a nerd that not even nerds understand me, or rather, sometimes I cannot put stuff in understandable and simple-enough terms... and sometimes I can but cannot really tell until after. I like the details on technical stuff, I enjoy writing about them, but sometimes I cannot stop or tell when it is too technical or too abstract to understand. I often end up putting too much detail into stuff thinking that it will help the understanding of some concept, but it sometimes it backfires. These are all edge cases, I'm not that bad at writing (I hope), but, what would be a good rule of thumb to know when you are probably going to make people dizzy when reading your stuff?, how do you test your analogies?, I'm looking for one or more rules of thumb to know if I'm writing technical explanations right, knowing what to reference and what not, etc. **What is your golden rule for writing about technical stuff to technical people who are not necessarily familiar with what you are writing but are also not noobies in your area?, where is the line?**
