I have an extremely long result in polynomial form following some matrix operations. However, given the symmetry of the problem, I can safely say that the solution will reduce much further than is being displayed here, especially if it can be expressed in summation notation. When I look at simple cases I can see many obvious simplifications that are not being done, primarily with z variables being left in denominators instead of being divided out. Is there any way I can have mathematica simplify all the way? Can it perform the summation contraction?               a = {{a1}, {a2}, {a3}}/za;     b = {{b1}, {b2}, {b3}}/zb;     c = {{c1}, {c2}, {c3}}/zc;     d = {{d1}, {d2}, {d3}}/zd;     k = {{k1}, {k2}, {k3}};     s = {{s11, s12, s13}, {s21, s22, s23}, {s31, s32, s33}};     G =        a.Transpose[a] + b.Transpose[b] + c.Transpose[c] + d.Transpose[d];     MatrixForm[      Simplify[Transpose[k].s.Inverse[G].Transpose[s].k]] (*Answer is not a matrix but calling like this gives a simpler looking output.*)
