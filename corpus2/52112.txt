I have obtained the graph, ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zF1jj.jpg) I would like to know its equation. The graph seems to be a hyperbolic spiral which, its equation reads, $r = a/\theta$. I read here and also, but these are concerning the Cartesian coordinate system. How could one implement these methods for my case, i. e. the polar coordinate system? ### Edit (1) Here is the code:               ParametricPlot[       {Im[(4.85263 + I 1.15883) Exp[(-0.455 + I 1.099) t] +            (-2.21527 + I 2.36121) Exp[(0.455 + I 1.099) t] +            (-2.35438 + I 1.36651) Exp[(0.455 - I 1.099) t] +            (0.717016 - I 0.836553) Exp[(-0.455 - I 1.099) t]],         Im[(4.85263 + I 1.15883) (-0.455 + I 1.099) Exp[(-0.455 + I 1.099) t] +            (-2.21527 + I 2.36121) (0.455 + I 1.099) Exp[(0.455 + I 1.099) t] +            (-2.35438 + I 1.36651) (0.455 - I 1.099) Exp[(0.455 - I 1.099) t] +            (0.717016 - I 0.836553) (-0.455 - I 1.099) Exp[(-0.455 - I 1.099) t]]},        {t, 0, 4.47}]      ### Edit (2) Actually, by the above approach, I would like to obtain an explicit equation from some given parametric equations. I do not know whether there exist other approaches or not.
