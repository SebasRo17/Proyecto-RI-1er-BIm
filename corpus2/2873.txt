I have found an alternative way to express an old solution:               PwD = (1/(4*Sqrt[Pi])) Integrate[(Exp[-(0.25/t)]/t^1.5)*         Sum[Exp[-((n^2*Pi^2*t)/40000)]              Integrate[                 Exp[-((z^2*Tan[45*Degree]^2 + (200*n - z)^2)/(4*t))] +                  Exp[-((z^2*Tan[45*Degree]^2 + (100 + 200*n - z)^2)/200)],                  {z, -50, Plus[50]}             ], {n, -4, 4}         ], {t, 0, y}       ];      Solving a partial solution, I have:               PwD = (Exp[-(0.25/t)]/t^1.5)*Sum[Exp[-((n^2*Pi^2*t)/40000)]*         Integrate[             Exp[-((z^2*Tan[45*Degree]^2 + (200*n - z)^2)/(4*t))] +              Exp[-((z^2*Tan[45*Degree]^2 + (100 + 200*n - z)^2)/200)],              {z, -50, Plus[50]}         ], {n, -4, 4}     ];      Now, for plotting the indefinite integral in time (`t`) I had used the following codes:               function[y_] := (1/(4 Sqrt[Ï€]))*NIntegrate[PwD, {t, 0.01, y}];     tabulate = Table[{y, function[y]}, {y, 0, 100000, 1}];     finalfunction = Interpolation[tabulate];     LogLogPlot[{finalfunction[y], y*finalfunction'[y]}, {y, 1, 1000000},         PlotRange -> {0.01, 10}, Frame -> True]      I used this same code on other similar solutions and had positive results. But for this specific solution I couldn't get it to work. Or it's seems that would take a very long time for it. Could someone provide an alternative way to help _Mathematica_ along?
