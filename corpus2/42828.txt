I have plotted the the PDF for a Gamma Distribution with various parameters (e.g. 3 and 5) using `Manipulate`:               Manipulate[       Plot[PDF[GammaDistribution[α, β], x], {x, -1, 20}],        { α, -1, 8}, { β, -1, 6}]      However, the plots that I get are quite different to what I get using R and which I know to be correct. For example the `PDF` with $\Gamma(3,5)$ should have a peak in the curve at 0.4. The plot that _Mathematica_ produces gives me a peak that is more like `11`. Does anybody have any ideas what I am doing wrong here?
