I've come across quite a few sites that either limit the length they allow passwords to be and/or disallow certain characters. That's limiting to me as I want to widen and lengthen the search space of my password. It also gives me an uncomfortable sense that they might not be hashing. Are there _good_ reasons for either setting an upper length or excluding characters in passwords?
