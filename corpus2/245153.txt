In an oft-cited (if dated) reference for C# coding standards (pdf; from Lance Hunt), the statement is made, > 33\. Avoid invoking methods within a conditional expression. I've not seen this recommendation elsewhere, including in the .NET guidelines (here or here). Unlike the other very reasonable guidelines in Hunt's document, this suggestion seems unintuitive to me. Can someone provide a justification for it?
