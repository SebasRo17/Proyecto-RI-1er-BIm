I wrote a small multiplatform app and I am considering publishing the osx version in apple store. I've licensed the app under a GPLv3 license. I sort of like the GPLv3 license but I also like the easiness of apple store. I'm worried about the GPL's "freedom to distribute a copy" requirement - which seems to be incompatible with apple store policies (I think there is a line that states that downloads are for personal use only). Is this a valid concern? Can I meet the requirements of the GPL by distributing the osx binary at the same place as the source, since I can't do it in the apple store? Or is this forbidden by the apple store policy (it seems to require that apple store software be downloadable only from apple store)? **edit** By apple store I mean mac app store (gpl is not compatible with iPhone's app store). **edit 2** I add a good clarification to the accepted answer from the comments by Abhi Beckert: > So, if you wrote all the code yourself then you do whatever you want > including releasing it on the Mac/iPhone App Stores.
