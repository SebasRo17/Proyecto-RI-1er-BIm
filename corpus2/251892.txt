I started working in a relatively big company that unfortunately has its share of quite a lot of legacy code and I ended up spending an extra ordinary amount of time in maintainance and bug fixes. I would like to switch project as on the surface there are other project that "seem" interesting. The issue is I am not really sure if it is any better there either. I have asked some colleagues to see what's going on and they "claim" that they are involved in cool things but I don't really believe them as in one of the cases I know for sure he is the same situation as I am. So my question is the following: If I don't have someone I can really trust to make a good choice about swapping to another project is there a way I could find out myself (I mean if it is the same everywhere)? One idea would be to do some "reverse" engineering i.e. start tracking each persons commit in the repository to figure out what he's been up to. But this approach seems to me irrational. Surely there must be a better way?
