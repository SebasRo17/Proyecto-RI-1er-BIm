I saw on a article that put forth this statement: > Developers love to optimize code and with good reason. It is so satisfying > and fun. But knowing when to optimize is far more important. Unfortunately, > developers generally have horrible intuition about where the performance > problems in an application will actually be. How can a developer avoid this bad intuition? Are there good tools to find which parts of your code really need optimization (for Java)? Do you know of some articles, tips, or good reads on this subject?
