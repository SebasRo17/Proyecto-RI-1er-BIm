Please, tell me the things I must use for modeling an (Enterprise Architect) activity diagram of               object1.method1() calls object2.method2()      I'm able to dragndrop a method of a class from model tree-view to my diagram, and it appears as new action there. But there is no hint about its belonging object. Also I don't get it which arrow type I must use to model that one calls the other. My feeling is it's not very appropriate for constructing documentation of typical call scenarios of my application. You know I want to create UML docs for what we've programmed until now.
