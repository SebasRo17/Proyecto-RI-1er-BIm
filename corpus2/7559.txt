Let us say I want to show how the Taylor's series for Sin behaves:               In[94]:= Plot[Normal[Series[Sin[x], {x, 0, 3}]], {x, -\[Pi], \[Pi]}]          During evaluation of In[94]:= General::ivar: -3.14146 is not a valid variable. >>         During evaluation of In[94]:= General::ivar: -3.14146 is not a valid variable. >>         During evaluation of In[94]:= General::ivar: -3.14146 is not a valid variable. >>         During evaluation of In[94]:= General::stop: Further output of General::ivar will be suppressed during this calculation. >>      However, if I just evaluate               In[95]:= Normal[Series[Sin[x], {x, 0, 3}]]          Out[95]= x - x^3/6          In[96]:= Plot[x - x^3/6, {x, -\[Pi], \[Pi]}]          Out[96]=      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Thm8t.png) It works fine. What is going on? I am doing this because I want to insert the plot in a Manipulate and then see how the functions behave with more terms of the series. **Update:** Using the answer, I can do               Plot[Evaluate@Normal[Series[Sin[x], {x, 0, 3}]], {x, -\[Pi], \[Pi]}]      However, if I try to compare as in               Plot[{Sin[x], Evaluate@Normal[Series[Sin[x], {x, 0, 3}]]}, {x, -\[Pi], \[Pi]}]      it doesn't work while the explicit `Plot[{Sin[x], x - x^3/6}, {x, -\\[Pi], \\[Pi]}]` does.
