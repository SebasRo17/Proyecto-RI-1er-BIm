Eventually, I would like to generalize this solutions to work with a Tuple of any length. I think recursion is required for that, but I haven't been able to do it.               def combineRanges(maxValues) :         for x in range(0, maxValues[0]) :             for y in range(0, maxValues[1]) :                 for z in range(0, maxValues[2]) :                     print (str(x) + '-' + str(y) + '-' + str(z));          m = (6,9,20);         combineRanges(m);      http://repl.it/WiZ
