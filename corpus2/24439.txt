I am continuing my **quest on B-splines**. The code below builds a 5x5 matrix out of B-splines, using the BSplineBasis[] routine. I now want to evaluate the polynomials that are stored in each matrix element. The problem that I am facing is, however, that each matrix element corresponds to a different position on my xy-grid. For instance, B[[2,2]] corresponds to the grid-pint x=-1, y = -1 . B[[2,3]] corresponds to x=-1, y = 0 and so forth. At the moment I do x = smth and then evaluate the polynomial manually. This works for a small system, but it is not optimal for larger problems. **So my question is** , is there some notation that does something like **B[[2,3]](put out the value of this matrix element at (x = smth,y = smth))**? I tried it with Evaluate[], but didn't get it to work.               knots = {-1, -1, -1 , -1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1};     B1 = Table[        D[BSplineBasis[{3, knots}, i, x], {x, 2}] BSplineBasis[{3, knots},           j, y], {i, 0, 4}, {j, 0, 4}];     B2 = Table[        BSplineBasis[{3, knots}, i, x] D[          BSplineBasis[{3, knots}, j, y], {y, 2}], {i, 0, 4}, {j, 0, 4}];     B = B1 + B2;     (*set boundary conditions*)     B[[1]] = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0};     B[[5]] = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0};     B[[All, 5]] = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0};     B[[2, 1]] = BSplineBasis[{3, knots}, 2, x];     B[[3, 1]] = BSplineBasis[{3, knots}, 3, x];     B[[4, 1]] = BSplineBasis[{3, knots}, 4, x];      Here is a plot of what I'm doing, just for nurturing the eye.               Plot3D[Evaluate[B], {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1}, Mesh -> None,       PlotStyle -> Directive[Opacity[0.8]], PlotRange -> {-2, 2},       ColorFunction -> Function[{x, y, z}, Hue[z]]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jcico.png)
