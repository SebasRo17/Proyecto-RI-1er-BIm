I am referencing to this question on mathunderflow:   What is the average of rolling two dice and only taking the value of the higher dice roll? Now I tried:               Mean[Max[DiscreteUniformDistribution[{1, 6}], DiscreteUniformDistribution[{1, 6}]]]      and               Mean[Max[DiscreteUniformDistribution[{{1, 6}, {1, 6}}]]]      but both only give me the wrong answer $\frac{7}{2}$. What shall I do to get the right result:$$E[X] = \sum_{x=1}^6\frac{2(x-1)+1}{36}x = \frac{1}{36}\sum_{x=1}^6(2x^2 - x) = \frac{161}{36} \approx 4.47$$
