I'm trying to create a conditional table. Let's say I want to have such result: {1,2,3,4,5,0,0,0,0,0}. The idea is to create a table of n elements (10 in a given example), but when one element takes a specific value (5 in my example), then all of the remaining elements must take provided value (let's say zero). It's important not to use IF checking every element whether it satisfies provided condition.
