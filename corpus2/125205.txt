I am developing a system that is designed for multiple forms of interfacing. There is a website, but that is connected through an SDK, as well as an HTTP query interface to access data. But to improve speed and quality, I was thinking of creating a system inside IIS that get any message sent to the server, any response, but still let IIS manage SSL and normal socket connections. Is there a way to host my project in IIS without ASP or any other kind of script with extra behavioral events?
