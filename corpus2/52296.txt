I am using the `Plot` function in a usual way. I use Mathematica 9.0.1.0 in English (I do not know if it is available in other languages, but I do not mind), and as a result of that, the numbers that appear in the frame tick labels use _dots_ as decimal markers. I need all numbers in the plot to be shown with a _comma_ as a decimal marker. Is that possible? Here you have a MWE â€”nothing special:               Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 10}, PlotRange -> Automatic, Frame -> True,       Axes -> False, AspectRatio -> 1/GoldenRatio, ImageSize -> 600,       Frame -> True, FrameTicks -> Automatic,       LabelStyle -> Directive[FontFamily -> "Calibri", FontSize -> 12]]      This is what I get: ![Minimum Working Example](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dLrmP.png) This is a minor issue, as I can export the image and change its labels outside Mathematica, but in case I would like to do this inside Mathematica, how could I get it? ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: I've tried it by using `$Language = "Spanish"`, with no success.
