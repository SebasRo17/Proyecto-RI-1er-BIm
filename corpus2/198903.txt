Someone proposed to me this pattern which I have never heard of before and can't find any information on it. The basic idea is, when building a library for other developers to use; if the developer includes my library along with a 3rd party library the behavior of the API calls to my library changes. An example:   1. I have a library/API for inserting, getting, updating, deleting on a database.   2. Developer includes a 3rd party database encryption library.   3. My library/API changes to require a "unencrypt(password)" call to be made before inserting, getting, updating, deleting. Is this a safe practice? Is there anything else out there like it? What advantages and disadvantages are there to this pattern?
