I've been asked this in a few interviews. And it always catches me off guard.My professional and academic background are already in the resumé, which the interviewer has obviously looked at. What more to tell him/her? Should I start with my hobbies? I like gardening, or looking at NSFW pictures on reddit in my free time? What and how do you answer to this specific question? Do you have a prepared answer for it? Am I wrong if I think this question is a bit silly? **UPDATE** There have been a lot of great answers to this question. I'm in pickle which to choose as the 'correct' answer, because most of them are very insightful. I found a great writing on this subject matter. It's a bit crazy for my taste, but it's interesting: How To Introduce Yourself… I Mean Practically
