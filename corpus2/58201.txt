I have an urgent question for my program because I get always an error output for it. I have a partial differential equation that I want to solve with `NDSolveValue`. I have two starting conditions for the time t, and two boundary conditions for the position x (Dirichlet and Neumann). Here is my program:               gamma = 0.08; tMax = 10000.; xMax = 1; xMin = -xMax;           First[s = NDSolveValue[{Derivative[0, 2][q][x, t] ==                 -(gamma*D[q[x, t], {t}]) - Derivative[2, 0][q][x, t] -                   q[x, t]^3 - q[x, t], (D[q[x, t], t] /. t -> 0) == 0,          q[x, 0] == 1,               DirichletCondition[{q[xMin, t] == 0, q[xMax, t] == 0}, True],               WhenEvent[D[q[x, t], {x}]{xMin} == D[q[x, t], {x}]{xMax},                 True]}, q[x, t], {t, 0, tMax}, {x, xMin, xMax},             MaxSteps -> Infinity]]      I would be really happy, if there is someone who can help me. I'm trying to get some useful results for some days. And I'm frustrated because no trial has been successful.
