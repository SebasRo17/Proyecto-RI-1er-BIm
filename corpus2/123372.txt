In Pro C# 2008 it is stated > Using constructs such as AppIDs, stubs, proxies, and the COM runtime > environment, programmers can avoid the need to work with raw sockets, RPC > calls, and other low-level details. It then demonstrates a VB6 call where a COM object is instantiated by passing in the AppId. Then, a method call is performed on said object. Does this mean COM allows IPC directly with objects? Is this secure? Why does .NET disallow this behavior?
