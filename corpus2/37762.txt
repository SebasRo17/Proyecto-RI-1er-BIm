As far as I can see `PrincipalComponents[data]` just gives data in the principal component basis. The problem is that after this, I would like to transform new data into the same basis, which requires that I know the actual principal components. There is the option of calculating `Eigenvectors[Covariance[data]]` (given the data is centered on the origin) but for the eigenvectors I get this way the signs are usually different from the ones that the `PrincipalComponents[]` function uses. Is there an easy way of getting the actual transformation used or transforming new data into the PC basis of the previous dataset?
