I'm writing my thesis project in GNU Octave. My project basically consists of a bunch of ".m" files that are written in Octave. I'm also using a proprietary (and unreleased) shared library developed by my supervisor. To be able to access the library, I've written an OCT-file wrapper (dynamic extension for Octave). My question is: am I allowed to distribute my ".m" files that depend on both Octave internals and the proprietary library? I'm not going to distribute any dependencies nor the wrapper files, just the ".m" files. Is it illegal to distribute these (I don't mind being forced to release them under a specific license) if they depend on a proprietary piece of software to be fully functional? Even if it's just to document my experiments? I've already asked at the Octave forums, but they were too passionate and aggressive and didn't give any useful arguments. I would like to hear facts, not ideology. PS: I know I could use MEX, which is the only explicitly allowed means of communication with proprietary libraries in Octave. However, it's not possible for technical reasons to use MEX in my case.
