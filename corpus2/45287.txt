Is there a simple one-liner to convert a given base 10 integer to a string representation of this integer in some desired base 'b'? Is there a way to do this avoiding the subscript indicating the base, for example the small 2 if we ask for a binary string? The best thing for my purpose, despite the danger, would be have a function that takes a decimal integer and returns what appears to be the binary, ternary, etc. representation of this integer, but which Mathematica still treats as a decimal integer value.
