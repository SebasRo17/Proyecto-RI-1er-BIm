How do I plot only one component in ContourPlot when specifying a height. For example,               ContourPlot[       Sin[Sqrt[x^2 + y^2]] Exp[-x^2 - y^2] == 0,       {x, -10, 10}, {y, -10, 10}     ]      produces concentric circles. How do I plot only the innermost one? That is the component going through (Pi,0).
