Can this position (Developer Advocate) be considered as a Software Engineering position in terms of interview questions they will likely ask me? Anyone else been interviewed for this position? I am just trying to gauge what they'll ask me for Developer Advocate position. Thanks. **EDIT:** This is just the first phone interview.
