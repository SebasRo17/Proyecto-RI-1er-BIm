So, I've just realized that some employers may ask an interview question that is relative to some complex mathematical algorithm. It seems like answering these questions is a skill in its own right. After all, I'm quite good at developing algorithms when the need arises, such as graphical algorithms, generic problem solving, or basic pattern matching, but I am not a mathematician. These problems require a completely different type of algorithmic thinking not necessarily had by most programmers, so where do I develop these skills? Is there a book I can read on this subject?
