$\{A\leqslant x\leqslant B\}$      Copy the code into Notebook, and you'll lose the `less sign`, this can be rendered well in Mathematica.StackExchange $\\{A\leqslant x\leqslant B\\}$ * * * And you can also `ImportString["$\{A\\leqslant x\\leqslant B\\}$","TeX"]//CreateDocument`, Here is the problem, the `leqslant` was removed, are there any options of `ImportString` or are there any other methods to Import some latex codes without losing some information?
