There are interactive examples in the documentation in Wolfram Mathematica. Thus to compile them we just need `Shift`+`Enter`. I want to develop such examples for functions from my own package, how can I do this? * * * Thanks a lot for comments..I use W. Workbench 2.0 to build documentation. But here is the problem, while building, even the examples like NumericalAnalysis it failed with errors: > BUILD FAILED > > C:\Documents and Settings\NumericalAnalysis\docbuild.xml:132: The following > error occurred while executing this line: > > C:\Documents and Settings\NumericalAnalysis\docbuild.xml:97: The following > error occurred while executing this line: > > C:\Program Files\Wolfram > Research\WolframWorkbench\2.0\configuration\org.eclipse.osgi\bundles\10\1.cp\MathematicaSource\DocumentationBuild\SystemFiles\ant\Build\notebook.xml:71: > Failed to launch or connect to Mathematica kernel: Connected MathLink > program has closed the link, but there might still be data underway. > > Total time: 3 seconds If anyone has any suggestions, please , write!!
