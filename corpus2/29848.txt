I calculate a set of morphological components:               Components = MorphologicalComponents[Binarize[image,0.1]];      We can now use SelectComponents to filter for components satisfying some metric, for example:               ChosenComponents = SelectComponents[Components, "Elongation", # <= 0.5 &];      However, is there a way to use SelectComponents to select for components that have a pixel within a certain RGB range in their convex hulls? For example, could we select for only the components that have a pixel with a "red" component of 0.2?
