So I've ran into a couple of companies that requires completing coding assignments before they give you a phone interview. I'm curious, do these coding assignments account for anything after the interviews? Or are these assignments just there to see if you're worthy of their time to be phone- interviewed? I'm more interested in hearing from those who had involvement in an actual hiring process that included a coding assignment. I would appreciate if you can mention your involvement (e.g., you were the hiring manager or one of the people on the team that did the hiring). Thanks!
