I'm with an org that is trying to transition to Agile. One thing that I've been struggling with is what they call user stories. In my experience, a user story would be this: > Use should be able to accomplish task x using tool y During the sprint, we'd then design a solution to enable this. However, this is what we're writing: > User should click on button A to go to page B to read text C where they will > then select option D which will then redirect them to page E. Data F will be > saved to the database. To me, this reads as a solution, which is what the sprint is for. Are the scenarios where the latter is actually a proper user story? Or, if not, is there a proper term for that type of detailed "solution description" within an Agile process?
