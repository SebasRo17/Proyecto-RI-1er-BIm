We are putting together some distribution software, selling about 150K SKU's. Some of our items have additional requirements in order to be sold that are dictated by our vendors. For instance one type of product that we sell are prosthetic feet. Some vendors require that we capture the users weight, activity level, and some other information. This is just one example there are many different kinds of products that might have this kind of requirement (a custom set of information collected from the customer to complete the sale). The direct approach is to just create custom forms for each requirement and create new forms when new requirements are needed. This works. It's straightforward, but its also a PIA. I would like to be able to kick this back to our product team that handles entering in new items rather than having to have them always come back to us. The project is a web application based on python (Turbogears). Not sure if this was relevant as the question is more general than this but put it here just in case. How would you approach this situation to minimize or remove your involvement with creating/adding these forms after site moves to production?
