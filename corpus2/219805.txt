I am volunteering my time to update a website for a local business. The current website they have is not up to date and it fails quite a few "web tests". For example, the pages are too large, the images are not compressed, and the site is not mobile friendly. All of these things are measurable - eg. the time taken to load (in seconds), bandwidth (in kb), and a list of the devices the site displays correctly on. It is my intention to note these benchmarks before starting the project, and upon completion. My question is: what benchmarks do web developers present to their clients?
