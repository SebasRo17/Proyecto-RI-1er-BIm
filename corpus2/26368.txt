I started using SVN about 9 months ago and it's been a game changer to say the least. Although, I feel I'm still a bit lost. I feel like there is a lot more I need to take advantage of to really step up my application development. **For example** I would like to be able to quarantine any volatile/major changes into some kind of 'sub-repository' or something. I'm finding that major changes are impeding minor bug fixes that are quite urgent. How can I push one simple update without pushing incomplete or broken code?
