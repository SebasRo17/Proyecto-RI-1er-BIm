We've currently got a small team of programmers (3 people) but are expecting to add more soon and are starting to keep documentation on things that need to be interacted with a lot, or reusable generic classes we've written. Originally we were storing all this information on writeboards @ backpack, but it doesn't support code highlighting or much other formatting. My current choice has to been to install Media Wiki along with a javascript based syntax highlighter and it seems okay except for lack of being able to put things in a nested structure (the plugins I've found are either broken or too lacking in documentation). While this solution seems suitable now, I'm wondering what other approaches other teams take to storing/organizing large amounts of documentation to an ongoing, ever growing project.
