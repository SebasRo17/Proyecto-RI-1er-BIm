So, I have the following equation:               y[t]^-3 == w^2 y[t]/t^2 + y''[t]      where               w^2 = (t0 k0)^2.      Analytic solution is easy to obtain:               y[t] = a Sqrt[t]      where               a = 1/Sqrt[t0 k0]      Since the solution is singular in `0`, am I not sure how to specify the initial conditions for `NDSolve`. When I put this in `NDSolve` I expect to get a solution that behaves like `~t^(1/2))`, but I get a `~t` solution which doesn't make sense.               NDSolve[{-y''[t] - y[t]/t^2 + y[t]^(-3) ==                      0, y[?] == ?, y'[?] == ?}, y, {t, ?, ?}]      I don't have any constrains for `t0` and `k0` from physics (yet), I just want to understand better how the `NDSolve` really works. Edit: When I try with: w=1, k0, t0=1, it works fine: NDSolve[{-y''[t] - 1(y[t])/(t^2) + (y[t])^(-3) == 0, y[1] == 1, y'[1] == 1}, y, {t, 1, 100}] -> ~t^1/2 behaviour. But when I try with: w=10, k0=1, t0=10 NDSolve[{-y''[t] - 10*(y[t])/(t^2) + (y[t])^(-3) == 0, y[10] == 10, y'[10] == 0.045}, y, {t, 10, 100}], I get some kind of crazy periodic functions. Why? (IC for y'[10] == 0.045 follows directly from derivative.)
