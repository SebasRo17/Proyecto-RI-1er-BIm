Like all the undergraduate students, who are studying in a college. They have to learn many things in one semester. For example right now I am having Java, DBMS, Operating-Systems and Computer architecture in my syllabus. I am concentrating more on Java but DBMS and OS are also important subjects. So how can one master all the subjects? Should one go for only one subject and leave others to study only in exam time or study all subjects with same interest and give all subjects the same time. If one give same time to all subjects then he/she would not be able to be master in all but if he concentrates on only one subject then he/she can be a master in that. What do you guys suggest?
