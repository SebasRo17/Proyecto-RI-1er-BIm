I have been searching the web for best practices, but don't see anything that is consistent. If you have an excellent development process that includes successful releases of your product as well as hotfixes/patches and maintenance releases and you use git. I would love to hear how you use git to accomplish this. Do you use branches, tags, etc? How do you use them? I am looking for details, please.
