How do you deal with different project environments? Every project might require a different database (oracle, IBM db2, mysql & etc), a different server (tomcat, IBM WAS, weblogic & etc) or some other new technologies. Every time a new database or new server comes in, I install them on to my workstation for my convenience. Right now I have more than one database and server on my workstation and it has caused my workstation take some time at startup. I have to wait a period of time for my workstation to be ready for me to start working. Sometimes when I install database A, it causes my previous database B to have issues. I found that this will take a lot of my cpu usage although I'm not using them at the moment. In this case, I can think of only one method, I can install the databases on to one virtual machine and the servers on to another virtual machine. Or one project environment one virtual machine. Then I can start just the one that I need it. What do you think?
