The following has no solution:               FindRoot[x == 1, {x, 0.25, 0, 0.5}]      And Mathematica correctly warns us: > FindRoot::reged: The point {0.5} is at the edge of the search region > {0.,0.5} in coordinate 1 and the computed search direction points outside > the region. If we use `Quiet`, we correctly suppress the message. The following is exactly the same system, but here we ask for a specific numerical method               FindRoot[x == 1, {x, 0, 0.5}, Method -> "Brent"]      And we receive a similar warning: > FindRoot::bbrac: Method -> Brent is only applicable to univariate real > functions and requires two real starting values that bracket the root. But this time, if we add `Quiet`, we still receive the same warning. Why isn't `Quiet` working (is it a bug)?
