I am a asp.net mvc programmer and if I want to start a project I do this:   1. I make a class library named `Model` for my models.   2. I make a class library named `Infrastructure.Repository` for database processes   3. I make a class library named `Application` for business logic layer   4. And finally I make a MVC project for the UI. But now some things are confusing me. Am I using 3-tier programming? If yes so what is n-tier programming and which one is better? If no so what is 3-tier programming? Some where I see that the tiers namings are DAL and BIZ. Which one is correct according to the naming convention?
