I am looking for some help with a Poisson solver I am writing in Mathematica. The code is quite long with Arrays plugged in, so the full details can be found at http://pastebin.com/uSrSDcW6 I am calculating voltages given charge densities using the central difference method derived from Poisson's equation. After calculating the voltage, I test the data set for convergence. I am setting convergence thresholds on the order of 10^-1000+. I have the loop set up to kick out after 10000 iterations in case something goes awry, as a fail safe. I have a loop counter in place for sanity. The program seems to run fine as long as the convergence threshold is set to 10^-10. My question is this: No matter what I update the threshold to, for example, 10^-100 or 10^-150, the computation stops after 633 iterations and kicks out of the loop. I would appreciate any help with this, I am completely stuck. I've added comments to the program that should be explanatory for anyone on this forum. * ** _Update 10/9/12_ **** I've narrowed my problem down to Machine Precision. I need to expand the Machine Precision to my Max Machine Precision of ~10^-309. How do I set this globally within my program when Im using 10x10x34 arrays initialized at ~15 digit precision?
