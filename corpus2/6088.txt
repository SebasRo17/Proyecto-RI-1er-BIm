I have a function, which plots the given function array `f`. This is a part of the function:               Plot[-f, {x,0,2}, Filling->{1->{2}}, PlotStyle->Green]      When I specify `{x^2, 2x}` as the function `f`, I get the errors `"2 must be an integer between 1 and 1. "` and `"{2} is not a valid Filling specification."`. I get this error because I have a minus sign in front of the argument `f`. If I plot `{-x^2,-2x}` then everything is fine. So how to multiply everything in `f` by -1 without getting these errors?
