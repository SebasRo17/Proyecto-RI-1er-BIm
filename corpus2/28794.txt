I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction please. I have this data points: https://www.dropbox.com/s/5hflg2nvko26hpz/question.nb When I plot the data points I have this: ![datapoints](http://i.stack.imgur.com/MjZH5.png) Then I use a Rice (Rician) Distribution Curve as model for fitting. For this, I used $$\frac{x \exp \left(-\frac{v^2+x^2}{2 \sigma ^2}\right) I_0\left(\frac{x v}{\sigma ^2}\right)}{\sigma ^2}$$ But when I plot both curves together I get something like this figure where the fit is the very tiny one below: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5t9Iz.png) I checked the Residual fit and I got something really disturbing. Showing that my fit has a large error margin: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gSZN3.png) Honestly, I'm not sure what's wrong. I've spent some time on this and I think I need an outside eye to help look at it. Any idea will be much appreciated. Thanks friends.
