I typed and evaluated an expression, but deleted it from the notebook. For instance, suppose it was               In[1]:= Round@SessionTime[]     Out[1]= 2      I now want to retrieve the input so that I can edit it again. I know Mathematica keeps the history of evaluated expressions in `In`. But if I try to access it directly `In[123]`, rather than giving the unevaluated input expression, it evaluates it again:               In[2]:= In[1]     Out[2]= 10      If I use `Hold` to suppress evaluation, then `In[...]` doesn't get evaluated, so I don't see the input:               In[3]:= Hold[In[1]]     Out[3]= Hold[In[1]]      How can I retrieve the input expression in an editable form, without evaluating it?
