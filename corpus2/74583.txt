There are numerous questions on this site regarding questions to ask a potential employer during an interview. However, I was wondering if there were specific questions that should be asked when having an interview at a small start up? Working at a new start-up is different from any employer I've had to date, and I wanted to know if there was anything that one should consider asking the CEO and CTO of a start-up during an interview. I'll be interviewing for a statistician/analyst position. EDIT: I've had two one hour phone conversations with both the CEO and CTO. These weren't referred to as interviews, but we talked about why I wanted to work there, how my skills could contribute to the company, and so on. We also talked about some things on my resume, including my education, work experience, and programming knowledge. After the second phone talk, they bought me a plane ticket to fly out to their company, which is headquartered in a different state. I assume they wouldn't fly me out to their company in a different state if I wasn't a serious candidate.
