Most probably my boss didn't write a single word on a keyboard in his entire life. He saw computers and he has a cell phone. He is a smart man. **How can I explain to him what a 'virtual machine' is?** (VM as in VMWare + virtual Box, not the VM as in Java, LLVM, .NET) One of the reasons for asking this is that I want to tell him that having a Linux VM to connect to internet with a Windows host is safer than connecting directly to Windows.
