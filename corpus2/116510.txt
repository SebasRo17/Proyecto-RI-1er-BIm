I am a junior developer who living in Korea. I think I am quite passionate and active. and I want to be one of famous developer all over the world. For spreading my area, I try to join Open Source Projects. But the problem is always _English_. I often can't understand what the member are speaking at the IRC channel. As all you know, for resolving an issue We have to discuss in detail. So English is a big problem for me. And there's no oriental among my Opensource members. How can I solve this communication problem? if you know someone who can overcome this problem, please give me your opinions. Thanks in advance.
