I was asked to create for a freelance project a Monopoly game in Java. After finishing it the same guy asked me to create four UML diagrams from which he could understand how the game works. Everything went well this far but his third request presented me with some problems. He now wants me to write for him in about 20-25 pages, how the game's code works, so he can understand it. I have been programming for about a year and I was never asked to do this before. I don't even know where to start to do this, from which portion of the code should I start to explain it? I basically suck at writing. Is there any guide that could help me achive what I need? I've already created the use case diagram sequence diagram, class diagram and activity diagram.
