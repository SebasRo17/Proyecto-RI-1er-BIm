I found that many senior developers refuse to do paper exams in interviews. They regard the exam as a kind of humiliation, because they think that "They don't trust my programming ability even if I have five years working experience... only junior staff need take a paper exam...". However, Joel insists: > **11\. Do new candidates write code during their interview?** > > Would you hire a magician without asking them to show you some magic tricks? > Of course not. Is it justifiable if a senior developer refuses to take a paper exam in an interview?
