I am trying to figure out the best way to accomplish this so feel free to criticize my thought process. My tool has different locales and each locale can have different settings for the tool. For example, Arizona could have the top 5 stats turned on where as California does not. I pull all of the settings based on the locale and have an array of the data:                   SimpleXMLElement Object     (         [settings] => Array             (                 [0] => SimpleXMLElement Object                     (                         [settingName] => Home Page Stats                         [settingDescription] => Show the Top 5 Teammate / Teamleader stats?                         [requireValue] => 0                         [localeID] => 14                         [status] => 1                         [value] => SimpleXMLElement Object                             (                             )                              [settingID] => 3                     )                      [1] => SimpleXMLElement Object                     (                         [settingName] => Test                         [settingDescription] => Testing                         [requireValue] => 1                         [localeID] => 14                         [status] => 1                         [value] => 66                         [settingID] => 5                     )                  )          )      What I need to be able to do though is get information based on a current setting. They will never be in the same order so I can't do it by location in the array. I need to be able to access the data based on the setting name. I have tried a few things with iterating over the array and getting the value I need at that time but it seems like its not a great way to do it. Is there a better way to store / access this data? I just need to be able to say `If setting name "Home page stats` has a status of `1` then then get me its value. I feel like I may be making this more complicating than it should be.
