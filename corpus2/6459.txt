When running the following in a notebook (not a deployed `CDF` file), it can sometimes be annoying that accidentally pressing `Shift`-`Return` breaks out of the user interface:               Panel@DynamicModule[{input = ""}, InputField[Dynamic[input], String]]      I would like to know if one can (programmatically) prevent such a cell from being "evaluated" when `Shift`-`Return` is pressed, so that the user stays in the `InputField` instead of being thrown out of it while seeing a new generated cell appear.
