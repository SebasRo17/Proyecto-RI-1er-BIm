iam a newbie in programming , focusing on web development with PHP. I have tried several IDEs Nusphere,PHP storm, all IDEs i tried doesnt load fast (ofcourse because of all extra features) i always liked Notepad++ as its fast even though it doesnt have features. Does notepad++ meets all requirments for professional PHP development? Should i invest time on learning IDEs? Should i learn any PHP IDEs to be a professional PHP Developer?
