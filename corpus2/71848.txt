I've got method naming paralysis! Say I've got one class - "System", and another class "User". Now, if I want to notify user(s), I can call:               // this method can notify individuals and collections of users     System.notify(User,message)      but if I want to simply notify the specific user               // this notifies the user     User.notify(message)      My dilemma is that in the case of "System" - the subject of the **notify** method is the User(s) argument. In the case of the "User" implementation, the User itself is the subject. So, the classes have the same method, arguably performing very similar jobs - but the "direction" of the methods are contrary. Do you suffer from naming paralysis? How do you deal with it? What naming pattern would you use here?
