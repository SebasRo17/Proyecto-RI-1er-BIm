As I write, we're 10 days into 2012. I bet many programmers are editing the copyright string at the top of their source files to something like:               // Copyright 2008, 2010-2012 Some Company Unlimited      Your version control system knows when files were modified so surely it can help write or rewrite these strings. So my question: is there a script that can examine git logs for each file and output (or better insert) a string like that about? I'm using git so that's of primary interest but do let me know if such scripts exist for other systems. **Update:** We need a script that does this:   * Walks all source files in our working copy   * Locates existing copyright string and identifies years e.g. 2007,2009-2011 would be {2007, 2009, 2010, 2011}   * For each year that is not mentioned, diff between 1 Jan and 31 Dec (or today if current year). Examine diff and decide if it's worthy of a mention in the copyright string   * Insert new copyright string.
