What I would like to do is create a mixture distribution that has a specified mean by varying one parameter in the distribution. To do this I've written the following code;               dist := MixtureDistribution[{0.1,0.9}, {UniformDistribution[{39.3, 40.5}],     TruncatedDistribution[{40.5, 104}, NormalDistribution[a, 11.4]]}]          NSolve[Mean[dist] == 82.63344, a]      Which just returns a "PolynomialGCD::lrgexp" error. What I ended up doing is putting values in using trial and error until it gave me the correct mean (so it does have a solution). Is there any way so solve this equation without resorting to trial and error? I think the TruncatedDistribution / Mean combination is what is causing problems. When I remove the TruncatedDistribution NSolve quickly returns a solution. The following link discussed this issue; Calculating the Mean of a Truncated Multinormal Distribution When I replaced                NSolve[Mean[dist] == 82.63344, a]      With               NSolve[NExpectation[x, x \[Distributed] dist2] == 82.63344, a]      All I got was an execution that seemed to go forever (I aborted after 10 mins). Any advice on how to solve this equation efficiently would be greatly appreciated.
