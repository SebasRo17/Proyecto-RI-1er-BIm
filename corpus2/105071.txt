I'm currently in discussions with my boss about getting a new pc since my old one is getting ... old... I am the only "real" developer in the company (it's not a software company) and as such they haven't really bought any pc's with these kind of specs before. So, I made a list, because building my own, is cheaper than buying finished. http://www.prisjakt.no/product_list.php?do=lista&k=10529 And he thought it was kind of overkill. And I can admit, I may have gone a bit far on some choices (the raided SSD's for example), but I though it was better to go out high, then come down a bit during discussions. But what would you say is a comfortable platform to do .NET development on? I currently use Visual studio 2010, local SQL Server 2008 R2 (Developer Edition), 1-3 local VM's for doing testing, and I use Windows 7 Enterprise x64 as OS. I myself don't feel that this list is very overkill, not to mention that it's very future proof. I put on 240Gb of system-disk, and 4Tb of storage, so I won't run out of space anytime soon. It's a i7 quadcore, 16Gb memory... It's not the bare minimum, but it's not very exaggerated? 10000 NOK is about $1900 USD.
