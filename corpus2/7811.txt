I've been struggling to create a DotPlot like the one shown in Cleveland's The Elements of Graphing Data. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jHhjh.jpg) Using the following dataset               data = Sort[{#,       WolframAlpha[       StringJoin["Number of native speakers ", #], {{"Result", 1},         "ComputableData"}]} & /@ {"Mandarin", "French", "English",      "Spanish", "German", "Hindi", "Malay", "Arabic", "Portuguese",      "Russian", "Korean", "Italian", "Cantonese", "Telugu",      "Urdu"}, #1[[2]] < #2[[2]] &]      What is the best approach to replicate this chart with its two axis, dot, dashed lines , etc?
