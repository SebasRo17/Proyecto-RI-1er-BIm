By default, I want all my local variables and method parameters to be final. Unfortunately, the Java language designers chose a different default: variables&parameters are by default non-final, and final variables&parameters need to be declared with the `final` keyword. So I need to add lots of finals. (And obviously I don't do this manually, but have my IDE add them for me.) So I end up with source code where every default case is marked, whereas exceptions to my preferred default are barely visible. For readability, I would like it to be the other way round, i.e. only non-final local variables and parameters should be marked/highlighted/annotated/... Is this possible? I'm open to solutions that integrate at different levels, e.g. folding within the editor, style checkers, build steps, etc...
