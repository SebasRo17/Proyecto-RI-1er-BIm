I was reading the 12 factor app manifesto. The manifesto recommends storing the configuration data for the application in environment variables. Does this mean that properties like the DB username / password, resource URL should be stored as a part of Java Env variables rather than as property files?   Is this a secure way of storing the information? To me this seems to be a pretty clunky way of storing the information. One option that I can think of is to have a separate configuration service running in the landscape, and use env property to connect to the config service and then query the config service for further detailed configuration data.
