Can we create a program that print out its source code what if we (or the program itself) compile than the new program would have the **same exact functionality** what the original program has? So somehow it would reproduce himself in perfect clones that can reproduce too.   The program **shouldn't use any external files** othervise it would be realy easy to implement: we just need to create a program that reads a file than writes it out, than copy and paste the source code to the external file.   My first attempt was to write a program that has a print function than copy- paste the source code to this print function, but this program can reproduce himeself for only once, and doesn't have the same functionality because the second program cant print out the source code.
