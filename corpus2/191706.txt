In the Software testing book from Koirala, Sheihk, they say: > A positive test is when you put in a valid input and expect some action to > be completed in accordance with the specification.   >  A negative test is when you put in an invalid input and receive errors. Part of my question: Let's say there is a requirement: If the customer name=="James Bond", do something. Is `name<>"James Bond"` negative or still positive test, verifying the requirement? Or a login function:   Is correct login positive test case and incorrect negative?   Or Login failed is just confirmation of requirement that a password must be correct ->confirming invalid pass will not work. > For example, if the program is supposed to give an error when the person > types in "101" on a field that should be between 1 and 100, then that is > positive then if an error shows up. If, however, the application does not > give an error when user types 101, then you have a negative test.
