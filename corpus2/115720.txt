I need 2 capabilities:   * calculating mutual friends distinguishing between different types of edges, (e.g. FRIEND, ENEMY and other)   * getting relationships distinguishing between different types of edges as over My problem is speed: If I use a database as MySQL, I can get thousands of relationships in few moments, but if I need to calculate mutual friends, it costs a lot for my server, doesn't it? I've about 100,000 accounts on my site, and I want to introduce a relationship system, but obviously I have to decide the right way to develop it. Do you have any idea?
