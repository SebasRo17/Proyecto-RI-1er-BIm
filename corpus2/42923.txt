This question is similar to Numbering nested list according with Depth (or Level) I have a list like               list = {"A" -> {"a1", "a2"}, "B" -> {"b1"->{"z1","z2"},"b2" -> {"z3","z4"}},"C" -> {"c1" -> {"cc1"-> {"x","y"}, "cc2" -> {"x1", "x2"}},"c2" -> {"xx", "yy"}, "c3" ->{"u","v", "w"}}};      And I would like to build a function that help me navigate it, according to the depth, like in               Navigate[list,1] = {"A","B","C"}     Navigate[list,2] = {"A" -> {"a1", "a2"},  "B" -> {"b1", "b2"}, "C" -> {"c1", "c2", "c3"}}     Navigate[list,3] = {"A" -> {"a1", "a2"},  "B" -> {"b1" -> {"z1","z2"}, "b2" -> {"z3","z4"}}, "C" -> {"c1" -> {"cc1","cc2"}, "c2" ->{"xx", "yy"}, "c3" ->{"u","v", "w"}}}      and so on. By hands I have a solution for small depth, but since the list can be arbitrary nested I think I need a nested approach
