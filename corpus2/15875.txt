I have a similar problem as posted in Difference in Plot when using Evaluate vs when not using Evaluate, however due to a numerical evaluation I cannot use `Evaluated->True` as a `Plot[]` option. Her a small example which gives errors:               f[y_, a_] := NIntegrate[y^2 + x, {x, 0, a}];     Plot[Table[f[y, a], {a, 1, 3}], {y, 0, 3}, Evaluated -> True]      The desired output should be equal to               Plot[{f[y, 1],f[y, 2],f[y, 3]}, {y, 0, 3}, Evaluated -> True]      How can I fix this example ?
