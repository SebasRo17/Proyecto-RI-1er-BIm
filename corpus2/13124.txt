I am a non-technical person in the imageProcessing side,so I don't have any idea how can I make polygon in the below shape... ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YiNQc.png) the above polygon is a 3D `Graphics` ,if I click on any face of the polygon it will show some message. I am still working on it,but i didn't get which function is better out of this `Cuboid` and `Polygon` can you give any suggestions on this?
