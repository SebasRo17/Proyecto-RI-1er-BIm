I am exporting an animation created using `Manipulate` in the `.avi` format. However the video runs very fast (I am putting it in Keynote). Its speed seems independent of how small I choose the step in `Manipulate`. Is there a way to control how fast the `.avi` will run or some other way to show the animation slower?
