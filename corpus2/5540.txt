How should code in version control be stored? **Developer friendly**? so that programmer can quickly take the latest and able to run from his editor without doing many changes? (like config files pointing to dev DB..etc) or Should it be **production friendly**? source should be in a manner which is easy to deploy on production environment and when developer takes the latest, he should perform changes as per his development needs.
