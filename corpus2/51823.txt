I have to render a chart with an axis that has ticks with the following values:               250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000      I first thought it was a logarithmic scale. But then I realized the pattern here is simpler (a tick has the value of the previous tick * 2). ![custom scale](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7IUct.png) Does this type of scale have its own name, or is it simply a logarithmic scale with a "special" base?
