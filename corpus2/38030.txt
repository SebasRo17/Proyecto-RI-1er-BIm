More about getting variables out of `Manipulate`: If I execute the following:               Manipulate[{xb1, xb2, xb3},        {xb1, 0, 1},        {xb2, 0, 1},        {xb3, 0, 1},        LocalizeVariables -> False]      I get 3 sliders and the list `{0,0,0}`. If I ask for the value of `xb1`, I get `0`. If I execute the similar form:               Manipulate[{xb[1], xb[2], xb[3]},        {xb[1], 0, 1},        {xb[2], 0,  1},        {xb[3], 0, 1},        LocalizeVariables -> False]      I get $3$ sliders and the list `{0,0,0}`. HOWEVER, if I ask for the value of `xb[1]`, I just get `xb[1]`. Why? `LocalizeVariables->False` seems not to work in this case. More importantly, how can I get a list of the values of the `Manipulate` variables as `Global` variables? The actual case I'm using has multiple lists of `Locator` variables, which seems to be even more difficult to get at than, say, multiple lists of `Slider` variables.               inputgraphs[inputrangex_List,                  inputrangey_List,                  name_String, indexnumber_] :=        DynamicModule[{         pts = {{0, 0}, {inputrangex[[2]]/4, 0}, {inputrangex[[2]]/2, 0},                 {3 inputrangex[[2]]/4, 0}, {inputrangex[[2]], 0}},          locatoricon},         locatoricon =            Graphics[{Red, PointSize[Medium], Point[{0, 0}]}, ImageSize -> 18];         Column[{           LocatorPane[Dynamic[pts],              Dynamic[Plot[               InterpolatingPolynomial[pts, x], {x, 0, inputrangex[[2]]},                  PlotRange -> {inputrangex, inputrangey}, Frame -> True,                  ImageSize -> Medium, Axes -> True, FrameLabel -> name]],              Appearance -> locatoricon, LocatorAutoCreate -> True],           Button["Save", With[{p = pts}, points = p]]}]]      I would like to have used the argument `indexnumber` to be an index for each use of manipulate variables (one for each graph), but that doesn't work, probably because for the same reason the example using indexed variables in `Manipulate` given above doesn't work.
