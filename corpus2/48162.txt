I have a list of strings representing different types of data               {{"gw12-26b-pl1", "63.6512", "0.0076", "--", "Al2O3", "%", "23.4002"},      {"gw12-26b-pl3", "65.1182", "0.1257", "--", "SiO2", "ppm", "76.3388"}};      I want to convert the 'numerical strings' to expressions so that I can work with them. I want to end up with something like:               {{"gw12-26b-pl1", 63.6512, 0.0076, "--", "Al2O3", "%", 23.4002},      {"gw12-26b-pl3", 65.1182, 0.1257, "--", "SiO2", "ppm", 76.3388}}      I tried to convert the whole list using `ToExpression` and then convert non- numeric elements back to strings but this doesn't work because it is trying to evaluate elements like `gw12-26b-pl1`as an expression. Can anyone suggest an easy way to do this?
