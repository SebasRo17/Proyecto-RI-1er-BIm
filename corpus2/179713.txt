I am fighting about a web application script optimization. I have an ASP.NET web app that reference jQuery in the master page, and in every child page can reference other library or JavaScript extension. I would like to optimize the application with YUI for .NET. The question is, I should put all the libraries reference in the master page or to compress all the JavaScript code in a single file, or I should create a file for every page that contains only the code useful to the page? Is there any guidance to follow?
