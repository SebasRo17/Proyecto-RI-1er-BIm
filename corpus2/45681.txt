I'm currently writing a job requirement for a software engineer position for my company, in which we are looking for a developer to work on client-side web application work. How should I title the job title / position? I don't necessarily want to call it a "Web Developer", for fear that it might attract more designer-y types. On the other hand, "Software Engineer" doesn't really give the indication that the work, while application based, will be web-based. Is "Web Application Software Engineer" a valid position title? Also, I'm somewhat torn on what the required skills set should be. I don't necessarily think that the ideal candidate should have x years of experience in say, JavaScript or ActionScript, but rather am just looking for someone who has experience in developing client-side applications, and is willing to learn and develop web applications. My current attempt at this, is that I have a section in which I state: > Experience in the following frameworks and technologies are a plus, but not > necessarily required for the position:
