We are reviewing our JEE web application for some planned refactoring and one of the suggestions is to replace `log4j` with `logback` or `slf4j` The team is not clear on whether we should do this - because currently we want to follow _if it ain't broke, don't fix_ in this area. **Edit:** I'm not asking for a comparison of the logging frameworks, but whether it is a valuable _refactoring_ element to change the framework when we're quite happy with log4j
