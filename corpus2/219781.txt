Perhaps the question might be tied to a theoritical or mathematical forum, but since it is for programming purpose, i ask here first: In a computer vision context, i write a couple of interfaces intended to be the "read-only" part of vectors. So i define "IVector2R" and "IVector3R" that only contain getters. The question is: does IVector2R extends IVector3R (and the "y getter" always returns 0), or is it the opposite: IVector3R extends IVector2R? I would like a conception as close as possible to the mathematic/sets theory... Thank you for your attention
