I am curious about the Google Closure Compiler. Why did they name it that? Does it have anything to do with lexical closures? **EDIT:** I tried researching it in the FAQ and documentation, as well as doing Google searches such as "closure compiler name". I couldn't find anything definite, hence the reason I am asking. I don't think I will get a profoundly helpful answer but I was hoping that I could at least satisfy my curiosity. I am not trying to solve a specific problem. I am just curious.
