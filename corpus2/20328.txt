Since Mathematica deals with `Head[a, b]` as an expression in this way   * The first Part of `Head[a, b]` is `a`   * The second Part of `Head[a ,b]` is `b`   * The zeroth Part of `Head[a, b]` is `Head` it is natural to look at the expression in a `List[]` way as `List[Head, a, b]`, which contains all the information the _Mathematica_ Kernel requires. Based on such thinking, I want to construct, from any _Mathematica_ expression, a list of this form so said expression is a list that can be manipulated easier providing we have sufficient knowledge of list manipulation. For example, if I have a list               list = {{x, 1, 10}, Plot, Sin[x]}      I thought I could construct a plot-command `Plot[Sin[x], {x, 1, 10}]` by evaluationg               list[[2]][list[[3]], list[[1]]]      or               Extract[#, {2}][Extract[#, {3}], Extract[#, {1}]] &[list]       But these are invalid for reasons that I have no knowledge about. Could anyone explain the reason why my ideas failed in _Mathematica_. By the way, the expression               f[Extract[#, {3}], Extract[#, {1}]] &[list] /. f -> Extract[#, {2}] &[list]      works. Why do the former two examples before this one not work?
