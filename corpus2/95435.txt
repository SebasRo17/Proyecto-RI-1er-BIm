I love the whole user experience/interface thing and put a lot of jQuery and JavaScript (pure JavaScript for HTML5 stuff, like canvas, file API, etc). The problem I face now is that my codes are growing large, 3-4 files per project with each file around 1000 lines of code, and maintaining and extending them is becoming a headache. I know that Object-Orientated JavaScript coding can solve a lot of my problems. I know the basic concepts of Object-Orientated Programming, have done a decent amount of it in C++, Java and Python in school and college projects. I want to read some good examples large scale OO programming in JavaScript (and jQuery), or if possible, some book specifically on writing big OO programs in JavaScript. EDIT1: Checked out backbone.js, guess thats what i needed, will be sure once i use it in my next project, thanks Raynos, also, my question should have been about handling large js projects, and not what it is, sry
