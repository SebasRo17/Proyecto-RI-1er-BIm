I've been a software developer for 10 years. I like being a developer and no surprise I strive for sense of achievement. However, I normally find myself doing stuff that needs to get done regardles of it's my job or not. My experience of various managers I've worked with shows a terrible score of like 20% of those that I find competent for the work they do. This makes me think that demand must be high for no-nonsense managers. I'm seriously considering a career shift from a developer position to one of those positions, but my question is: -Is it worth it? I'm assuming that it's more or less undestood what each of these positions mean. The question is only if an above average developer normally earns more than an average manager or not?
