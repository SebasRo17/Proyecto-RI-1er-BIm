Okay, this is one of those little things that always bugged me. I typically don't abbreviate identifiers, and the only time I use a short identifier (e.g., `i`) is for a tight loop. So it irritates me when I'm working in C++ and I have a variable that needs to be named `operator` or `class` and I have to work around it or use an abbreviation, because it ends up sticking out. Caveat: this may happen to me disproportionately often because I work a lot in programming language design, where domain objects may mirror concepts in the host language and inadvertently cause clashes. How would you deal with this? Abbreviate? (`op`) Misspell? (`klass`) Something else? (`operator_`)
