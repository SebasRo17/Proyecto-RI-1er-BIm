If you are designing a function which should conver a string to an integer, how would you convert an empty string? The question is only about this one particular input value (empty string). Between throwing an `ExcStringIsEmpty` exception and converting to `0` options I prefer the first. It seems more logical to me. Because when you perform an opposite conversion from integer `0` you will hardly convert it to an empty sting but to a string `0` instead.
