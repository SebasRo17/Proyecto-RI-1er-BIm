I just talked to a friend. He said that in his company, QA persons get higher salary than developers, that on average it is 2 times higher. I'm quite surprised because I have thought that QA persons will get lower salary than developers (on average). (true confession: my company does not have QA department) So, how is your company's QA salary compared to developer's? Is it reasonable for QA department to get higher average salary than that of development department?
