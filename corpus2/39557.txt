Given this image I would like to measure how much (in percentage relative to the square area) of each black delimited square is filled with green:               i = Import["http://i.imgur.com/62buGws.png"]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8gBm6.png) I am a bit lost with the usage of the image processing functions. It seems like `MorphologicalPerimeter`and `PixelValuePositions`or `ImageData`could be useful. If I can find a way to detect each square then it is a matter of calling `ImageData` on that area and count the number of green pixels. Any tips please?
