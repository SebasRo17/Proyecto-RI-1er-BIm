I have a number of algorithms that depend on uniform random reals in half-open intervals such as $[0,1)$. In particular, I need a (pseudo) random-number generator that produces machine-precision numbers in the range $0.0$ to $1-\epsilon$. It can return $0.999...$, but will never return exactly $1.0$. I haven't found in the Mathematica documentation whether Mathematica's `RandomReal` satisfies this requirement. The documentation does state that `RandomInteger[{xMin,xMax}]` produces values in the double-closed interval $[x_{min}, x_{max}]$ inclusive of both ends, but I haven't found an equally clear statement about the real-number generators. The documentation that I've read just says "between 0 and 1." I could read this as double-open, but it really isn't precise enough for me. I would be grateful for an authoritative answer.
