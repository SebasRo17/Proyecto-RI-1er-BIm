> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  How Can I Know Whether I Am a Good Programmer? There are a number of questions here about recognising or considering someone as a good/bad programmer. These are all subjective. What I'd like to know is if there is a way to measure this. I realise there will and should be a subjective element to it. But is it also possible to have some actual numbers to back up (or contradict) such an assessment?
