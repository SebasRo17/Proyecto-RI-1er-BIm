I want to use the Rayleigh criterion to find the resolution of an optical system. I have two functions `f1 = Sinc[x]^2` and `f2 = Sinc[x-T]^2`, `T` being the translation. I want to change the value of `T` until the first minimum of `f2` coincides with the maximum of `f1` (Rayleigh criterion). That being achieved, the value `x` and `T` should be returned. Pseudocode: for `x=100` translate `T` till the first min of `f2` coincide with peak of `f1` print `{x, T}` repeat the same procedure for `x=105`...upto `x=200`. so, what i would like to do is basically start the programm and have a table with the values `x` and `T`. Thanks in advance everyone, have a nice one.
