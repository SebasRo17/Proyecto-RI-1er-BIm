Since I'm learning Java in this period and I just finished with the tutorials I think I'm ready to start contributing to a project (since I know from experience this is the best way to really learn). I've seen GWT, looks interesting so I thought I should give it a try. I'm thinking however, since GWT deploys Java applications in JavaScript why should I learn GWT when I could learn the actual thing instead (this being JavaScript). My question: is it worth it? Wouldn't someone be better of learning JavaScript if they want to build JS applications, instead of using Java and GWT? I realize that it might be easier to build certain things with GWT but in the end is it worth it? Thanks.
