Background: consider the following two snippets.                 GeometricTransformation[{Cyan, Polygon[{{0, 0}, {.2, .6}, {.8, .2}}]},          Table[RotationTransform[2 \[Pi] k/6], {k, 0, 5}]] // Graphics      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/m1f93.png)                 Table[GeometricTransformation[{Opacity[.15*k], Cyan, Polygon[{{0, 0}, {.2, .6}, {.8,.2}}]},          RotationTransform[2 \[Pi] k/6]], {k, 0, 5}] // Graphics      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OdLnw.png) I make most of my graphics as in the first example. Because that is ( supposedly ) the most efficient way. But I have to add gradient colors ( and other options later ), I found no other way to do it as in the second example. What I in fact want is this:                 GeometricTransformation[g, {ListOfTransformations}]       where g is some geometry. I want to be able to apply different colors to the transformed g's. But not in the way as done in example 2. **Question: How can I apply a different color to the result of a geometric transformation?**
