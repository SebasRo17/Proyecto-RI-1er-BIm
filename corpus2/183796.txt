I realise this might be offtopic here - but I couldn't find a better place in the stackexchange family. And this question has simply been bugging me for years.. What I wonder is: can an eula define WHAT you use an application for? IE: if I write a text editor, can I say "You can't write fantasy novels with it". I'm wondering this because many applications have clauses like "you can't use XY to make something illegal". And actually wondering if this has any use? It is like saying that when you buy a car you lose the rights to drive it once you drive through a red light, or go speeding. I see it as "non of the car designer's business".
