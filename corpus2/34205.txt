I have data `{x, y}` where x starts at -25 degrees and goes up to +25 degrees in 1 degree steps, and then comes back down to -25 degrees in 1 degree steps again. I want to plot this sinusoidal-type data without the y-data overlapping in the ranges -25 - +25 degrees. I have attached an image of the kind of graph I am after. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3O6SS.png) How does one do this?
