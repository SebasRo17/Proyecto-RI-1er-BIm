When thinking on the workaround for this `LogLogPlot` bug suggested by halirutan I noticed that `CompiledFunction` actually can return machine numbers smaller than `$MinMachineNumber`. Consider:               f = Compile[{{t, _Real}}, Exp[-9 t^2]];     num = f[8.872]     num < $MinMachineNumber     MachineNumberQ[num]     MachineNumberQ[num2 = ToExpression[ToString[num, StandardForm]]]      > 2.191864698767832`*^-308 > > True > > True > > False As you see, `num` is smaller than `$MinMachineNumber` BUT `MachineNumberQ` returns `True`. Conversion of this number into `String` and backward returns arbitrary-precision number. Moreover, `CompiledFunction` accepts such numbers and works with them correctly:               f2 = Compile[{{x, _Real}}, Sqrt@x];     f2[num]      > 1.480494747970364`*^-154 How this behavior could be explained? Does it mean that `CompiledFunction` actually CAN work with arbitrary-precision numbers? P.S. I use _Mathematica_ 8.0.4 under Windows 7 x64.
