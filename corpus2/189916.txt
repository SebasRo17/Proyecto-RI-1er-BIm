This is a rather philosphical / theoretical question. I am interested in the question, how language (in this case programming languages) and thoughts (= solutions of problems) are connected. I want to know, whether the programming language influences the solutions, I can come up with. For example: I program something in Haskell (functional) and in Java (OOP). Do the general solutions differ fundamentally or are they - aside from syntactic sugar - the same? Do I not just use different algorithms and a different software design, but do I fundamentally change my whole point of view, my concept and my view of the software, depending on the paradigm I am starting from? _(Note: "I" stands for a generic programmer)_ I know, that this question is pretty hard to answer, but I find it very interesting, so I wanted to know, whether somebody has (and might share) a opinion about this.
