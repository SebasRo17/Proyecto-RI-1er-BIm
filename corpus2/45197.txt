How do I make several different `Manipulate` controls appear on a single line? I currently have both a `Slider` and an `Animator` controlling different variables and they appear one underneath the other. Is there a way to make them appear on the same line? I've read this question, but that deals with control elements of a single variable. How do I do the same for the different control elements of two or more variables?! ![Two variable controls appearing on different lines](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nU73u.png)
