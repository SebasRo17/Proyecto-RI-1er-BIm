So I'm trying to make my Unit Tests as by-the-book as possible, but it becomes troublesome when I'm testing some simple Add/Delete methods. For the add method, I basically have to create a dummy object and add it, then after the test is successful, I have to delete the dummy object. And for the delete test, I obviously have to create a dummy object so that I can delete it. As you can see if one test fails, the other will fail too, as they're both kinda needed. Same with a system where you would need to write a test that "Cancels an Order"...well some dummy order would be needed to cancel first, doesn't this go against the guidelines of unit testing? How are cases like this meant to be handled?
