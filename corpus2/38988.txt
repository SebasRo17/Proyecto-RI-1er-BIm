I was trying to make this               L1 = {{2, 1}, {6, 4}, {8, 7}, {9, 5}};     L2 = {{2, 9}, {9, 6}};     L = Union[L2 , L1]      And I used this:               Cases[L, {{a_, _}, {b_, _}} /; a == b]     Complement[L,L2]      And this:               DeleteCases[L, MemberQ[L1, {#[[1]], _}] & /@ L2]      But, both fail. The answer must take from L1 only the elements where the first element appear in L2. For L1 and L2 above, must return               {{2,1},{9,5}}       And {6, 4} and {8, 7} must be dropped from L2! Thanks,
