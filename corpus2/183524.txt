I want to understand how web accessibility experts deals with websites if they want to confirm that those sites are compatible with accessibility guidelines. Do they have to understand any server-side language? or just HTML and CSS? For example, if there is a company website which provides services for other sites to ensure the accessibility for them, do they have to have a look at the server side code or only the output HTML and CSS?
