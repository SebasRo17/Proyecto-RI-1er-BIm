On "hammerprinciple.com" website there are programming languages, statements about them and voting that associates languages with statements. In particular, there are statements:   * "This language is built on a small core of orthogonal features"   * "This is a mainstream language" Why they are so opposed to each other? Is being incoherent, history- encumbrant, ridden with extra special cases a must for being popular, "mainstream" programming language? Maybe is it similar reason as why beautiful and coherent artificial natural languages (like Esperanto) are not that popular?
