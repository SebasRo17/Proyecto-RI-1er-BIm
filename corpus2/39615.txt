I am a learn-by-example person. I have no idea to change every `{` and `}` to `(` and `)` respectively. Could you let me know which concept in Mathematica is related to this problem so I can learn it much faster? The objective is to convert the output of               Tuples[{{a, b, c}, {1, 2}}]      which is > {{a, 1}, {a, 2}, {b, 1}, {b, 2}, {c, 1}, {c, 2}} to LaTeX-friendly output as follows. I have learnt `TeXForm` but it must be called at the last phase.               $\{(a, 1), (a, 2), (b, 1), (b, 2), (c, 1), (c, 2)\}$
