For simplicity, my database has entities and transactions. Each transaction has a DateCreated and a foreign key to the entity. I'd like to have the ability to find entities that have had a recurring number of transactions within a close time proximity of other entities. Simply, if entity A has had a transaction within 10 minutes of entity B, 5 different times. The more I research on this topic, the more confused I'm becoming. I ran through the Data Mining Algorithms and their AdventureWorks data mining tutorial. I _think_ I need a clustering approach. Mostly I'm looking for guidance on how this type of problem is typically approached. In the end, my goal is to allow the user to select X minutes and Y occurrences, and display the result data back to them. If I can offer any more information please let me know.
