I'd like to solve this equation for $A = B$ where $B = I$, which represents 3 systems of 3 linear equations, for $a, b, c, d, e, f$, without writing `LinearSolve` 3 times. What is a simple way to accomplish this? Input:                  A = {        {a + b, -a + b, a + 2 b},         {c + d, -c + d, c + 2 d},         {e + f, -e + f, e + 2 b}        };     MatrixForm[A]     B = IdentityMatrix[3]     (*want to solve A == B, but probably wrong...*)     M = LinearSolve[A, IdentityMatrix[3]]     MatrixForm[M]
