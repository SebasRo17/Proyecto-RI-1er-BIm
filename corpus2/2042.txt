I've been working in the enterprise space for the past 4Â½ years and have noticed that generally speaking, enterprises are not conducive environments for the test-first style of development. Projects are usually fixed-cost, fixed-timeline and waterfall style. Any unit testing, if done at all, usually comes after development in the QA phase and done by another team. Prior to working for an enterprise, I consulted for many small to medium sized companies, and none of them were willing to pay for a test-first style of development project. They usually wanted development started immediately, or after a short design stint: i.e., something more akin to Agile, though some clients wanted everything mapped out similar to waterfall. With what types of shops, companies, and clients does test-driven development work best? What types of projects tend to be conducive to TDD?
