Is there a simpler way of performing Gaussian Elimination other than using RowReduce? Such as a single built in function? **Edit:**   Look at the example from our simulation class. Not too difficult, but using this method to solve problems of the sort is new to most of us. We are solving for P# of course.      ![Example ](http://i.stack.imgur.com/y8ClB.png) Also, to those asking... While I can see what is going on below, I really don't understand what it all means. Asking why not RowReduce? I guess not everyone is at that level of use yet, and I don't like just cutting and pasting internet code without understanding it. I simply wondered if there was a function that would do what the code did, but be built in.                 GaussianElimination[m_?MatrixQ, v_?VectorQ] :=         Last /@ RowReduce[Flatten /@ Transpose[{m, v}]]
