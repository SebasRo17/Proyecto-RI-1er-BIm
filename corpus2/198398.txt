After reading for what seems days on the specifics of GPLv3 and more specifically AGPLv3, I have one question as far as distributing and to whom. If I create a web app (server and client) for a client. They pay me, I hand over all source and ownership. The web app is currently only accessible to employees and contractors; but for the sake of argument, it could be anyone since it's on the internet. The AGPLv3 code is not modified (in this case iText), it is used to generate a PDF from other text (and all this [could] happen in its own project/dll completely separated from the main web app). To who does the source have to be released and shared with:   1. Employees   2. Any user of the app   3. Any non-employee user (clause for distribution within an organization's employees)
