The Hurst exponent is related to the fractal dimension by noticing that the fractal dimension $D$ is equal to $2-H$, where $d$ is the intrinsic dimension and $H$ is the Hurst exponent, for 1-D fractional Brownian motion. I can generate an fBm series in _Mathematica_ as follows:               tlow = 1;     thigh = 1000;     tinc = 1;     hurst = 0.4;         dataz=RandomFunction[FractionalBrownianMotionProcess[hurst], {tlow, thigh, tinc}, 1];      However, using the method described here to compute the fractal dimension, I am unable to get close to recovering the Hurst exponent used to generate the fBm. For example:               stdev[{x__}] := StandardDeviation[{x}]     stdev[{x_}] := 1     dataf = RotateRight[Mean[R /@ #/stdev /@ #] & /@ (Partition[dataz, 2^#] & /@ Range[10])]     Fit[Log[dataf], {1, x}, x]      Is this a numerical error or are there better ways to compute Hurst exponents and fractal dimension in _Mathematica_?
