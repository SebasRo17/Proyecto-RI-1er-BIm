**Update** Since more and more issues are revealed as I venture deeper into the world of CDF, I decided to make this thread more general and hopefully more useful. I know posted my findings as an answer, but please feel free to edit this post or my answer below if you know something useful. **Questions** I have a quite large project that I want to deploy to the web. I expect users to only have the browser plugin or _Mathematica_ Player, but not Player Pro.   1. Can I use `DynamicModule` in a CDF that is to be viewed by the plugin or the _Mathematica_ Player? Does it always have to be a `Manipulate` in focus in the dynamic interface that is generated?   2. Can I deploy the dynamic output somehow without piling all the used functions and data into the `DynamicModule`-s body or `Initialization` option? `Manipulate` has the option `SaveDefinitions` but `DynamicModule` does not. Does `SaveDefinitions` work with packaged functions as well?   3. What exactly happens when only the dynamic output is selected and deployed (and not the whole document) to CDF via the wizard? What is the difference between deploying only the output or deploying the whole notebook, but with all the code cells being hidden? What is the technical difference between demonstrations and CDFs?   4. Is there any difference (and if so, what) between _Mathematica_ Player, Player Pro and the browser plugin?   5. What are the differences between CDFs intended for _Mathematica_ Player or Player pro, i.e. free CDFs and non-free CDFs (see discussion here)?   6. How to overcome security issues (discussed here and here): when the deployed CDF shows up as a gray box because dynamic updating is disabled for security reasons?
