Is there a way to extract the arguments of a function? Consider the following example: I have this sum               g[1] + g[2] + g[3] + g[1]*g[3] + 3*g[1]*g[2] + 6*g[1]*g[2]*g[3]      Now, what I want to do is exctract the function arguments and apply them to another function `func` which takes the arguments as a list.               func[{1}] + func[{2}] + func[{3}] + func[{1, 3}] + 3*func[{1, 2}] + 6*func[{1, 2, 3}]      I know there is `Extract[g[1]*g[3], Position[g[1]*g[3], _Integer]]` but that does not work if I have a multiplicative constant. Is there a way to do this?
