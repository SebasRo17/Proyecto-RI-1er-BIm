Is it possible to set the number of columns in _Mathematica_ 's text-based interface? Or disable word wrapping in the text-based interface ? Specifically, my concern is output from `MatrixForm` and `TableForm`, which wraps output at about 85 columns. It seems as if the values were hardcoded in 1992. I use the text based interface within an emacs shell buffer. EDIT: The answer below that I checked green solves this problem in a few tests of commands that give long output, such as MatrixForm.
