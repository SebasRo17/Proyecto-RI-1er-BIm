I find myself reworking my code quite a bit, especially when learning to write algorithms that involve keeping track of multiple attributes and labels. I feel that having the pseudo-code written up, having a small numerical example worked out, and a few test cases is usually a good approach. Yet, I find myself making mistakes and reworking code constantly. Is there a better approach or a structured methodology that I should follow? Greatly appreciate the advice.
