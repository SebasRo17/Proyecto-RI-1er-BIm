I am preparing for a telephone interview. I am thinking that instead of trying to memorize SOLID or ACID for example I could have some cheat notes ready. So:   1. Any tips on how to organize them?   2. Where to find material for .NET, OO, DB (Both Oracle and SQL Server). It should be easy to find/read the information by looking at the paper/screen, also I need some way to look it up. (Cheat Sheets in IT context seems usually to be something else - like condensed information to keep next to you while you are working.)
