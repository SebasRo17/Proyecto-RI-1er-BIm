There are a number of questions on this site that give plenty of information about the benefits that can be gained from automated testing. But I didn't see anything that represented the other side of the coin: what are the disadvantages? Everything in life is a tradeoff and there are no silver bullets, so surely there must be some valid reasons not to do automated testing. What are they? Here's a few that I've come up with:   * Requires more initial developer time for a given feature   * Requires a higher skill level of team members   * Increase tooling needs (test runners, frameworks, etc.)   * Complex analysis required when a failed test in encountered - is this test obsolete due to my change or is it telling me I made a mistake? **Edit**   I should say that I am a huge proponent of automated testing, and I'm not looking to be convinced to do it. I'm looking to understand what the disadvantages are so when I go to my company to make a case for it I don't look like I'm throwing around the next imaginary silver bullet. Also, I'm explicity _not_ looking for someone to dispute my examples above. I am taking as true that there _must_ be some disadvantages (everything has trade-offs) and I want to understand what those are.
