Let me start by saying that I am a computer security researcher. Part of my job is to create malware to deploy on a controlled environment in order to study or evaluate several aspects of computer security. Now, I am starting to think that using an online code hosting service (such as BitBucket, Github, etc...) to have all my code in 1 place, would allow me to work on my projects more efficiently. My question is: **Are there any issues with this?** I have studied those companies' privacy policies, and they state that they allow usage of their services for lawful usage. Since I am not distributing malware, but I am only using it on my machines and machines that I am authorized to use, aren't I allowed to use the service? For the usage that I am doing, malware is the same as any other software. **I recognise that I should be extremely careful with code hosting** , as any mistake from my part could hold me liable for damages and leave me open against legal action. As such I am recognizing that I should use private repositories, so the code is not available to the public. **But how private is a private repository?** How can I trust that companies like them will not leak or sell a potential (electronic) viral weaponry that I may have created in the future?
