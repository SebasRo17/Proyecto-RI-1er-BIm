I've been reading John Hull book (Options, Futures and Other Derivatives) mostly on curiosity. I've read other books about financial markets in the past (like Elder's Trading for Living and the novel Reminiscences of a Stock Operator). But I'm really hooked by the John Hull book. My background is mostly scientific computing: number crunching, visualization and image processing. Mostly in C++, with some C, Fortran, Python, Ruby here and there. I've been thinking on moving on to quantitative finance - I'd like to do that. What would be the best way to start? Any tips?
