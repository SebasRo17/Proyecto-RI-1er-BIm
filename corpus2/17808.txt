I'm getting this error in Wolfram Workbench, and I don't know where it comes from: "Syntax error: newline character interpreted as multiplication" This error happens around an If[] function, in a custom function, defined as               myFunction[x_,y_] :=          Module[{variable},          (* some code *)     variable = 1     If[x==2,x=3,x=4]          (* some code *)          ]      No matter where I try to put my If[] function inside myFunction[], I get this error, but I don't get it if I put it outside myFunction[]. Maybe the problem comes from the Module[] function, as when I take it out the error disappears. Any idea what's going on?
