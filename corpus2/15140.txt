I want to compute the inverse of matrix, say with dimensions $100 \times 100$, defined over a large finite field extension such as $GF(2^{120})$. I am using the package **FiniteFields** , but Mathematica's computation time is exponential with respect to matrix dimensions. The following code illustrates the problem:               << FiniteFields`;     Table[         With[{ext = 12},            First@AbsoluteTiming@                Inverse[                    Array[GF[2, ext][RandomInteger[{0, 1}, ext]] &, {n, n}]                ]         ],         {n, 1, 11}     ]      I am using an Intel Xeon X5680 @ 3.33GHz (64-bit OS) and Mathematica v8.0.4.0. I have received the following timing results:               {0.0030, 0.0080, 0.0210, 0.0630, 0.1860, 0.5110, 1.3350, 3.3840, 8.9340, 23.0090, 57.4660}      I believe the source of the problem is that the **FiniteFields** package defines many UpValues, DownValues and SubValues of `Times` and `Plus` for head GF and, consequently, the pattern matching of arguments is degraded. Does anyone know if a patch for the **FiniteFields** package or a faster substitute providing a similar interface? Many thanks!
