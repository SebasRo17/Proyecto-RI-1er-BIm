For example, I have the following expression :               A( 2 x1 + B(y1 + y2) + 2 x2 )      How do I make the output look like this (grouping `(x1 + x2)` and `(y1 + y2)` terms together) ?               2A (x1 + x2) + A B (y1 + y2)      I don't know why `Simplify` doesn't group `(x1 + x2)` together but just gives:               A (2 x1 + 2 x2 + B (y1 + y2))      I can use `Collect` to get `(y1 + y2)` after `Simplify` but how about `(x1 + x2)` ? Remember this is just a simple example, I would have a much more complicated terms involving `(x1 + x2)` and `(y1 + y2)`, so a method with no operation on the constants (`2A` and `A B`) would be great.
