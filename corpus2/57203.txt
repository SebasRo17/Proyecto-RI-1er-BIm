I am doing a project on the Allee Effect. I am able to successfully create a stability analysis. That is, I can find the relevant equilibrium points ($y_e = 0,\ y_e = \alpha$ and $y_e=k$) and draw approximation curves. However, I am having trouble plotting the solution. The differential equation is $$ \frac{dy}{dx} = r y \left( 1 - \frac{y}{k} \right) \left(\frac{y}{\alpha} -1 \right) $$               sol = DSolve[y'[x] == r y[x] (1 - y[x]/k) (y[x]/a - 1), y, x]      Will produce the output: > >     {{y -> Function[{x}, >         InverseFunction[ >           Log[#1]/(a k) + Log[-a + #1]/(a (a - k)) + Log[-k + #1]/( >             k (-a + k)) &][-((r x)/(a k)) + C[1]]]}} >   where `a`, `r`, and `k` are constants depending on the population. When I try to plot `sol` using the code               Plot[Evaluate[y[x] /. sol /. {C[1] -> 1}], {x, -7, 7}, PlotRange -> All]      It will output an empty.I was told to use the manipulate function for the constants. Please can someone help.
