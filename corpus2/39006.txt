Converting between revolutions per minute (RPM) and revolutions per second (RPS) is not straightforward for me in Mathematica. I know that $1\; \text{RPM} = \frac{2\; \times\; \Pi\; \text{Radian}}{\text{Second}\; \times\; 60}$. To get RPS then, it is just a matter to remove the factor of $60$ in the denominator. Taking a numerical example, I can convert say $500$ RPM to Hertz as follows: $[\text{Convert}[\frac{500\; \times\; 2\; \times\; \Pi\; \text{Radian}}{\text{Second}\; \times\; 60}, \text{Hertz}],9]$ which gives me $52.3597776\; \text{Hertz}$ But now if I want to convert $500$ RPM to RPS, the following does not work as in the `Convert` command, the second argument has also **numerical values** in it: $[\text{Convert}[\frac{500\; \times\; 2\; \times\; \Pi\; \text{Radian}}{\text{Second}\; \times\; 60}, \frac{2\; \times\; \Pi\; \text{Radian}}{\text{Second}}],9]$ which gives me as output: $\frac{52.3598776\; \text{Radian}}{\text{Second}}$ instead of the desired answer of about $8.33\:$ . The factor of $2\; \Pi$ is the troublemaker. So how to do an appropriate conversion from RPM to RPS? **update** : I am using version `9`. Thank you.
