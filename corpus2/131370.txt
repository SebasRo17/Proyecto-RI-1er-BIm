> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  What are effective interview questions? I'm currently looking to recruit a .Net developer and we've decided to take a graduate straight out of university. The job role will (eventually) be mainly web development. Does anyone have experience of recruiting graduates straight out of university? How do you go about recruiting someone when they have very little in the way of hard skills that you can test directly? What kind of interviewing techniques can you use (telephone/technical test/question and answer/whiteboard session etc.)? What skills or personality traits should you look for?
