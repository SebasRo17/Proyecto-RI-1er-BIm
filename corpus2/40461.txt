I'm having trouble with setting up a particular range in a loop for my programming. Now I have a defined range of data (not continuous numbers) that needs to be applied in a loop. Since the aim for my code is to generate functions/expressions with the range automatically, I need to figure out a way to applied those data. The code is               MapThread[(Subscript[C, #1][x, y] :=           Subscript[q, 2 #1 - 1] +            x*Subscript[q, 2 #1] - (Subscript[q, #2] +              y*Subscript[q, #2 + 1])) &, {Range[], Range[]}];      data for #1 is: 3, 4, 5, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6. data for #2 is: 1, 2, 4, 3, 1, 2, 3, 5. As u can see from the code, I cannot simply define the range in the loop. My idea is to create a list for the data and maybe apply it in the loop? thx for ur help!
