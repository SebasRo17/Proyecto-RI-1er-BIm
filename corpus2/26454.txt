Any idea which Cases statement will work for both A^2 and CA^4X^36 to find the powers? If I set sym to these two expressions, one requires a curly brackets around the first argument and the other doesn't.               (* Sample 1.  Returns {} *)     Clear[x]; Clear[y];     sym = "A^2";     Cases[ToExpression[sym], x_^y_ -> {x, y}]          (* Sample 2. Returns {{CA,4},{X,36}} - as required*)     Clear[x]; Clear[y];     sym = "CA^4X^36";     Cases[ToExpression[sym], x_^y_ -> {x, y}]          (* Sample 3. Placing brackets around the first argument of the Cases \     function returns {{A,2}}  - as required *)     Clear[x]; Clear[y];     sym = "A^2";     Cases[{ToExpression[sym]}, x_^y_ -> {x, y}]
