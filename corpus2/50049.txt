I had no internship a few months ago, so I basically went on a 'resume mailing' spree and emailed a _lot_ of companies that I was interested in working for and that had my line of work. This didn't prove futile until a company accepted me into their internship program but said that I would be working remotely. I had no problem with that, the project was good and I was interested. Now I have another internship at a company that is close to my home and I don't want to miss it at all! I can manage both internships side-by-side. In the day, I will do the internship that is closer to my home and at night (and other times), I can manage the remote internship. My question is -- should I both? I am particularly interested in how two internships at the same time are viewed. Would it look good or bad? PS: Neither is paying me anything, so money is not a factor.
