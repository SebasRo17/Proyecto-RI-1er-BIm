I have this list saved in matrix 6x2: \begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1.216 \\ \frac{\pi }{3} & 0 \\ \frac{2 \pi }{3} & 0.1351 \\ \pi & 0 \\ \frac{4 \pi }{3} & 0.04863 \\ \frac{5 \pi }{3} & 0 \\ \end{array} Now i have saved this matrix in a variable called myList: { { 0 , 1.215 } , { π/3 , 0 } , { (2π)/3, 0.1351 } , { π , 0 } , { (4π)/3 , 0.04863 } , { (5π)/3 , 0 } }    if i use the comand:               ListPlot[myList, AxesLabel -> {\[Omega], Subscript[C, n]},       Filling -> Axis]<br>      the result is this:   ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/No8nt.png) The problem 1 is:   i would like to see the blue points and the line under them with RED color.      The problem 2 is:   I don't see the first coordinate on the plot `{0,1.1215}`   there is a way to set the range of y for example (from 0 to 2) and of x for example (from0 to 5) ??? in this way i can see all points.      The problem 3 is:   i would like to see the $\omega$ axe with the Trigonometric value instead of the natural number.   thanks
