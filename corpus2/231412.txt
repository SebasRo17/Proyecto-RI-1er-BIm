We are developing a web application using Java EE. The stack is heavy, the deployment is complex and now we want to include a purely CSS designer in the team. We want to include this designer without having him have to understand the build and deployment of our application. We want him to be included in the projects version control. What is an effective way of allowing a designer to work without being exposed to to the rest of the project? Simply working from browser inspectors is insufficient, as it does not give him the ability to upload images.
