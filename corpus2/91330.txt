I've not yet started working on a new project where everything is done with "Eclipse RCP" which I never heard of until last week. We'll use lots of Java and SWT for GUI. I'd like to get up to speed on this new technology ASAP. (Or else I'll be the company "coffee boy" for the next several months...) Given a starting point of zero Java experience, zero use of Eclipse and zero use of SWT, zero computer science background (I'm into physics, engineering and art) and only modest experience working on the applications level in any sense, but OTOH, years of low-level programming and doing various neat cutting-edge things in areas that don't overlap at all with the Java or Eclipse worlds, how big a chunk of learning curve do I need to climb? To be clear, while I need to become more fluent in Java, and learn the end user basics of Eclipse and beyond, I don't need to learn the fundamentals of programming, OO, what a "compiler" is, etc. and am an old pro at Linux, C++, event-driven GUIs and much more. How to guesstimate how many days I'll need to become competent at working on Eclipse-RCP based apps? (No need to become a master guru. Of course that comes with time.) How to judge my level of skill along the way? How might I come up with a checklist of topics I should cover? What to tell the boss about when I'll be ready to work on this thing? What books, tutorials, etc are good for this learning curve climb? (No budget for classes, workshops, or books pricier than what I can get at Barnes & Noble.) (Actually I do have some modest experience in Java, but let's pretend it's zero, to make the question and answers more fun and useful to others.)
