I was looking at Code Complete on the shelf, thinking, "Outside of the Mythical Man Month, this may be one of the few mass market Software Engineering books to stand the test of time." For this reason, I'm thinking of jumping in to reread it. I'm curious - has anyone else given it a second look recently? I so, did you see anything he got very wrong? This isn't an attack, and not a request for a book review - I am more interested in which ideas have changed over the years. And please - no comment about, "Demarco/Spewak/Zachman stood the test of time..." I am specifically interested in Code Complete because of the breadth of ground it covers, and breadth of impact it had in the field.
