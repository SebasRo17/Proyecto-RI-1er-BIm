I have been given a file with several records. I have also been given business rules that determine how to process those records and produce an output file. The business rules are relatively simple:   1. If record is of type A, use methodology A.   2. If record is of type B, use methodology B. However my client emailed me with a problem: There is one "special" record in the file. It's a type A record, but it needs to be processed with methodology B. How does one deal with these exceptions to business rules? Some options I have thought of so far:   1. Hard-code the exception into the software: `if record.id == "some_id" && record.value == 123.45 then methodology B`.   2. Manipulate the file by hand, run the program, and then correct the output by hand. My coworker is astonished that I would even consider option 1. It's messy, and next year (when I have to run this process again) the file could be different. It will turn out to a nice hidden "gotcha" that could cause problems long after I forgot about the exception. However option 1 is easier than option 2, and if the exception to the rule stays the same for next year, I won't have to even think about it. It's already been handled. Besides, it's easy to change if I need to change it later. How do I deal with random exceptions to business rules? EDIT: This is very targeted software - written to specifically do one job for one client.
