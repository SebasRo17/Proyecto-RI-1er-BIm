Let's assume $ x^{10}+x^5+1 $ has a factor $x^2+ax+b$ Then, If $x^2=-ax-b$, $ x^{10}+x^5+1 =0$. If we successively apply $x^2=-ax-b$ to $ x^{10}+x^5+1 $, we can make $ x^{10}+x^5+1 $ to degree 1, such as $ mx +n $ and it should be that $m=0, n=0$ So having it on my mind, I tried,               x^10+x^5+1 //. x^2-> -a x -b      Didn't work.               x^10+x^5+1 //. x_^2-> -a x -b      Didn't work. So, any suggestions? Thanks ahead!
