I have been working to find an equilibrium solution for a Hamiltonian dynamical system. I have reduced the problem to the simultaneous solution of 3 equations:               1/(4 Sin[x]) - (a Sin[x])/(Sqrt[1 + a^2 + 2 a Cos[x]])^3 == 0          r^3 - 3/a^3 + (2 (a + Cos[x]))/(Sqrt[1 + a^2 + 2 a Cos[x]])^3 == 0          r^3 - 3 + (1 + a Cos[x])/(Sqrt[1 + a^2 + 2 a Cos[x]])^3 + 1/(4 Sin[x]) == 0       The conditions on the variables: $r>0,\,a>0,\,x\in[0,\pi]$. Can anyone see a way to simplify this even further? Mathematica brute force style on my lowsy pc just sits there. Is there an effective way to analyze this system with Mathematica?
