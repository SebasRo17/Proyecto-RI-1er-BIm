I'm writing documentation for some software that I wrote. Specifically, I'm writing a guide to installing the software. I'm delivering the source-code to my client, so I expect that they will want to be able to build from source. I explain to open the solution in Visual Studio 2010 and to right-click on the project and select "Publish". There doesn't seem to be a clear and straight-forward way to explain that they must build it in "Release" mode or what the simplest way to explain how to do that is. What's the best way to explain this? **Edit:** In response to the comments asking me to be more specific, on my setup of Visual Studio 2010, there is a drop-down list next to the green icon that starts the debugger. It doesn't have any label next to it. That's how I'm familiar with changing the setting myself, but I don't want to write in my documentation, "Click on the drop-down list next to the green button and select "Release". There's got to be a better way. I am particularly concerned that if I get in wrong, it could result in someone changing the setting at the project level instead of the solution level.
