I am wondering what exactly are the differences in using `NotebookEvaluate[filename]` **vs** `FrontEndExecute[FrontEndToken[nb, "EvaluateInitialization"]]`; to evaluate cells in a given notebook. In particular, I am referring to the discussion: Evaluate Initialization Cells of another notebook. Given my new status here, I couldn't see how I could continue with that conversation directly, so I decided to post a new queston. The comments in the referenced question proposed these two solutions to the problem:   * method 1.              filename = SystemDialogInput["FileOpen"];     NotebookEvaluate[filename, EvaluationElements -> "InitializationCell"]        * method 2.              filename = SystemDialogInput["FileOpen"];     nb = NotebookOpen[filename];     FrontEndExecute[FrontEndToken[nb, "EvaluateInitialization"]];     NotebookClose[nb]      I am trying to solve the same problem. Taken at face value, it seems both approaches are valid. Are there any subtleties that make one preferred to the other, issues of scope/context, etc.?
