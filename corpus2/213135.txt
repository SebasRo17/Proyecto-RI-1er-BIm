I am sending a huge amount of data to server. Now while I have sent the data and waiting for server response, suddenly my android device gets internet connection lost.   So what I used to do is, showing an alert dialog of connection lost, but at server side the data was already processed and it updated somewhere e.g. on any URL. But my android phone does not know this as it did not get response ever. How to resolve it.   Whether it could be done on server side or on android itself How?   How server would know that android phone is not going to listen the response?   It may be client-server communication optimization perspective.
