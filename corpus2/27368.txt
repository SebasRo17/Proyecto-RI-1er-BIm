I have a macro (is that what you call it?) set up in _Mathematica_ and it runs fine. What I want to do now is set up my notebook to look through an Excel document (.xlsx) and pick out a certain set of cells that I named in Excel using the name manager. How do I get _Mathematica_ to import that Named Range? Also I have noticed that _Mathematica_ will not recognize every excel document and I have checked to make sure that the file is an xlsx file and still _Mathematica_ tells me that the file can't be opened as an xls. So two problems.   1. _Mathematica_ doesn't accept every file name I give it and reports the it cannot be imported in XLS format.   2. How to I import a named cell from Excel without having to use row and column descriptors? Per request here is what I have tried so far               Import["NajaK5uLData.xls"]      > Import::nffil: File not found during Import. >>   >  $Failed               Import[NotebookDirectory[] <> "NajaK5uLdata.xlsx"]      > Import::fmterr: Cannot import data as XLS format. >>   >  $Failed
