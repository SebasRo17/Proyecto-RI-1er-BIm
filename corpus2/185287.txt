I have a web application to be developed using RESTeasy API and for this I have to implement security (Form based authentication). So i am not sure about the most appropriate fit for this. As I googled, I found Apache Shiro, Spring Security, etc. Also I have read something about Rest provided authentication jars. Please help me with this. EDIT: My requirements:   1\. I should be easily able to use framework with RestEasy API.   2\. It should provide authentication and authorization at least
