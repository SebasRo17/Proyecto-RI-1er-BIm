I have limited experience when it comes to build and version control systems. I feel like I've run into a common problem but I'm having trouble uncovering how it is typically handled. Say you have four source code projects:   * fooLib - Shared library   * fizzLib - Shared library   * buzzApp - Application that depends on fooLib   * barApp - Application that depends on fizzLib and fooLib Now, say you have two products:   * ProductA - only needs buzzApp   * ProductB - only needs barApp If my task were to make bug fixes to ProductB, how would I go about checking out the projects? Am I supposed to figure out the dependencies (or look them up) or is there some automated way of doing this? Also, how could this be automated for nightly builds for each product?
