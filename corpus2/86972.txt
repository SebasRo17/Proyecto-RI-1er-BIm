I am studying Software Engineering and I am currently in 4th semester. I was asked represent my college as a Microsoft Student Partner. I refused because it was mostly organizing event. Later I was selected by Microsoft to be in Microsoft Developer Community. I know little about my role, if I have any, and do not know what I have to do or learn for this selection. I know that I was selected because of my GPA. I have been told to excel at Microsoft technologies by my professor and nothing much information is yet made available. Also I have been told that Microsoft has my information! I am asking here in advance because I do not want to get caught in a situation where Microsoft comes asking me to compete at a programming event or show up some relevant work and I am still not prepared for such a event. What is the role or expectation from students who are selected in Microsoft's Developer Community. Can I contact Microsoft directly to ask about it, how can I do that. Also do I get an account or some ID from Microsoft to access some website?
