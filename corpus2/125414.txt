> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  How do you deal with an information hoarder? Often, in IT teams knowledge equals power. This is fine as long as (IT-)knowledge is equally accessible by all members of the team and company specific know-how is well documented. Sometimes personnel in an IT department build up a tremendous amount of know-how _without_ documenting it. By doing so they think that they ensure their position. Often these people like it when people specifically have to ask them how to do a job. How do you get these programmers, database administrators or other IT staff to **_DOCUMENT_** their work and make it accessible to the company they work for? EDIT: It's a relief that so many of you _know_ this type of person. That it is not me bumping into them everywhere I do projects. On the other hand it makes me sad, such talented people but in many ways behaving as a child. I have seen the behavior in men and women btw. It is hard to pick one answer as the best and accept. Will do after more re-reads.
