I have two products I hope to compare symbolically and I am hoping to use `Mathematica` for this. They are as follows: $$ \prod_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} {(a_i + \cdots + a_{j-1}) + j - i \over j- i} \tag{1} $$ and $$ {\prod_{\ell = 1}^{n-1}\left(\prod_{j = \ell}^{n-1}\left[\sum_{i = 1}^j a_i + j - 1\right]\right) \over (n-1)!\cdot (n - 2)!\cdots 2!\cdot 1!} \tag{2} $$ However, I'm not very familiar with the `Mathematica` syntax required to do this.
