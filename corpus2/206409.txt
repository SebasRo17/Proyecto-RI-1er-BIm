I am trying to solve the following kind of problem. I do not know if there is already a name for this, or a solution; however, I'm willing to bet there is. I was hoping someone could point me in the direction of implementing a solution for it, or at least tell me the name of the problem? Suppose a traveler has a certain amount of Gold coins, and some Bronze coins. He must start a city A, and go to city B, then city C, and finally city D. There are two (or more) roads that pass from A to B, labeled AB1, and AB2 (etc.). Road AB1 has a toll of 5 gold coins, and AB2 has a toll of 5 bronze coins. Roads from city B to C: BC1 has a toll of 10 coins, which can be either currency. BC2 requires 8 gold coins. Roads from C to D have some sort of similar setup. Assuming that we know how much money the traveler has, and that there is no possible exchange between bronze and gold coins: is there a method to determine if the traveler has enough money to pass through from A to B, to C, and finally to D? This is the kind of problem I need a solution to... Is there a name for this problem? Is there a solution to this problem (other than brute force)? I'm assuming this is a similar problem to flow problems, but I don't know quite how to approach it.
