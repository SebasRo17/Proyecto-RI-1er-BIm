Currently I have been asked to propose an automated release management solution for a large oracle SOA project. All code is stored on SVN repository and it would be nice if I could suggest something that would build, deploy, run test cases and produced reports for all projects on trunk. I know that I could do that by creating ant or maven scripts, but I would like to know if there is an open source alternative that handles all these complex stuff, without the need of so much coding.
