When I have a programming assignment or some program that I have to start on I sometimes have this feeling of despair, I just do whatever to starting and then I just start feeling like crap, and that makes me not start even more...it's like a vicious circle. All my friends seem to just get things done...Is it just me or are there others that have this problem? Am I not a in "love" with programming? If there are others, how do you overcome this feeling and just start? EDIT: @Kennith it's actually kinda hard to describe but it kinda like very mild depression, i think it may be because the work required of us is so challenging. I remember in high school I loved programming because after learning the synthax of a language(ie java) you felt like an expert and could do a lot of programming. But in university the there is just so much complexity to programming and so many little things that I never considered before, log time, data structures, insane algorithms, graphs, np problems, etc.that I think I've lost that confidence that I once had. I don't think I've had to do any programming over the last 3-4 years where I knew much about what I was doing (had an overview but it was all new territory), every single project I work on is new material, new concepts, language, theory, etc. It's good for learning...in hindsight, but when your learning it's hard and frustrating. But you sort of never feel like your progressing or actually accomplishing anything. You feel good for a little while after finishing one proj, but as soon as you look the next one...its back to ground zero. What I love(d) about programming is that feeling of mastery, that was motivation enough, now when you're always doing something new, its really hard to get that feeling back.
