In software engineering, what's the name of a development process like the waterfall model, but with more cycles? Does something like this exist? In my case, I developed the parts of my application separately and went through all the steps in the waterfall model (requirements, analysis, design, implementation, testing). At the end I put everything together. Is it wrong to call it waterfall process with 4 cycles?
