I have around 15 templates (this will grow) and each template will have around 10-15 questions. Each question can have answers in different format like text box, list box, dropdown, radio button etc. I need to show one template in a page, at a time based on the input I am getting. What would be the best design approach for this?   1. Put questions data in database and Create dynamic control?    2. Putting in xml and display using xslt?    3. Creating static set of templates? Or any other approach? I don't have too much time to do this. I am going to use Silverlight for this.
