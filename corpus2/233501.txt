I am preparing to write a database system using PHP and MYSQL which will store every piece of info sent to it as an individual row. Each row will store several piece of meta data (time stamp, who created it, version number, attribute number) and one piece of 'true' data (file name, phone number, username, etc.) Rows my also be used to store serialized data. The goal is to create a system that is easy to incrementally back up, search on single rows, and review based on its state at a particular date. Is this an effective design or should I alter my approach? The database will be used to drive a custom CMS system which is intended to store a interconnected system of data. It will involve customer data, location data and job data. We want to be able to track individual database changes based on time so that we can maintain an on-site backup (the system will be cloud based) which we can use in the event that we lose internet connectivity. The system will be strongly permission based, only allowing people to see/change information that they are authorized to see. Most of the data will be viewed in a timeline format, based on the time that the info is entered into the system.
