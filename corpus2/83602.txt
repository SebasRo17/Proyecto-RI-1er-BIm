I am working on a project/application that I feel is not very well organized, and parts of it intertwine in different ways. Everything works, but I can see things are not very modular. _Is it reasonable to split up an application into various libraries, even if they might not be reused by another application?_ Just the mere thought of splitting it up into libraries reveals many problems with the current system. I feel it will encourage better design, and future reuse (There are talks of a new project that seems it could benefit from at least some of these libraries). My concerns are   * How will it affect perfomance?   * How far should I go in splitting things up?   * If three libraries all depend on each other, is there a point in making them libraries? (perhaps it suggests a re-architecture of the modules) My question seems to go against the wisdom of this answer, in that _Dynamic libraries should never be created for a single app_. Then the question becomes- how to ensure modularity in a large application? Thanks! **EDIT:** It seems I have used the term "shared library" too much, so I removed it to imply any kind of library (either static or dynamic). The essence of the question is whether to split stuff up into any type of libraries.
