I'm not sure which SE site this belonged on, so I figured I'd try this one. Whenever I browser the Mac Developer Library at developer.apple.com, on the top right of the window, there's a link for a PDF version. Has anyone ever downloaded them all and combined them into one file? I want to download the Mac Developer Library for my Kindle, and I figure there's no .mobi versions, so I'm trying to look for a PDF version. Thanks in advance and sorry if its not the correct site.
