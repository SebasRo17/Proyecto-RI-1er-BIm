Is there a way to use the physical constants in calculations and have Mathematica 10 figure out the final unit and numerical magnitude? When I try               pcM = N[Quantity[1, "PlanckConstant"]]      I simply get `1\. h` without the numerical value of Planck constant. Subsequently, using this in all further steps, keeps the answer in h and does not work out units. However, if I define the planck constant by hand and use it in a calculation, everything works as expected. I am curious as to why the internally defined constants do not show up with numerical values. Thanks,
