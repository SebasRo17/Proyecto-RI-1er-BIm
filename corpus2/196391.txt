I'm an aspiring programmer, I really wish to be great at multiple programming languages. I began programming from my school where they didn't teach me well, they didn't follow the standards, they didn't even tell the difference between an IDE and a compiler, they kept calling the Turbo C++ IDE a compiler, which sucked. And at that time I didn't have good internet access. But I do have internet, now I can learn new things and how to do them properly. The problem I'm having now is how to relearn everything and at the same time learn new things. I'm trying to do JavaScript and Ruby at this time but I can't concentrate on any of these because I'm worried about the one I am not learning (and also when I find something interesting, I get attracted to that and not the one I'm looking for, eg. attracted to C function pointer while I'm trying to learn callbacks in JavaScript) . How do I manage this? Make a routine? And many of us recommend practicing by making, but I have no idea what to make or making what would be better as a programming practice. Really need help. Edit: How is my question a duplicate? The mentioned question asks whether it "is" better to learn multiple languages simultaneously or not. What I'm asking here is how to be able to concentrate and manage on learning languages properly. Therefore it is not a duplicate, plus the answers I'm getting here are great (which are not there in that question, I'd like to point out the moderators to quit judging like that).
