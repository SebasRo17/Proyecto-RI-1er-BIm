I have a very simple question which appears not to have already been answered on this forum. Is there built-in functionality that returns the degree of a multivariable polynomial? For example if the polynomial is               s1 + s2^2 s3 + s3^2 s4^7      I want _Mathematica_ to return 9. If there is no automatic solution, could somebody please suggest a simple (and fast) implementation? EDIT: I removed my "solution" because it actually only works for simple examples. I tested out the four solutions presented so far on a degree 20 polynomial in 6 variables (`ByteCount[poly] = 2006352`). I used `AbsoluteTiming` to determine that the answer I chose is the fastest, with a run-time of 53.06 s for 1000 evaluations. This is quite a bit faster than the closest competitor's run-time of 283.76 s for 1000 evaluations. UPDATE: I tested the improved version of the solution (the one with random reals) and found that the run-time is now slightly worse but still far better than the competition at 90.52 s for 1000 evaluations.
