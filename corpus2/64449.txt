Whenever I find myself writing the same logic more than once, I usually stick it in a function so there is only one place in my application I have to maintain that logic. A side effect is that I sometimes end up with one or two line functions such as:               function conditionMet(){        return x == condition;     }      OR               function runCallback(callback){        if($.isFunction(callback))          callback();     }      Is this lazy or a bad practice? I only ask because this results in a greater number of function calls for very tiny pieces of logic.
