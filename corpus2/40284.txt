I'm working on a normal Java/SWT desktop application I'm planning on distributing to the three primary PC platforms (Windows, OSX, Linux). Obviously, there are slight differences between them, mainly having to do with files. What's the best way to keep those differences separate? I'm thinking three different SVN branches (win, osx, linux), and trunk for development, but then how do I update the branches without overwriting the differences? Do I need to define a platform constant instead at compile time? And then, of course, there are different versions of libraries (i.e. SWT in my case). How should those be handled? Where should I keep the compiled byte-code ".jars" files?
