I want to make a `Polygon` with straight border lines. For that purpose I wrote the following code, but it doesn't show straight borders.               Graphics3D[{Style[Polygon[{{20, 0, 10}, {50, 0, 10}, {50, 0, 25}, {20, 0, 25}}],       Lighting -> {{"Ambient", LightBlue}}]}, Boxed -> False, RotationAction -> "Clip"]      How can I make a polygon with straight lines? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GrXgX.png)
