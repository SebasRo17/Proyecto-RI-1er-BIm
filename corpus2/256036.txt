guys, I am a data miner, most time I use R, SAS to do modeling and data mining work. But some times the packages in R are not what I want. It will be perfect If I could develop my own packages. But my background is not Computer Science and I always want to learn some coding techniques or dig deeper in computer science, which might help me better understand how to code and do data mining. Could any one give a comprehensive book/course list for me to learn, which will be helpful for data mining? thanks
