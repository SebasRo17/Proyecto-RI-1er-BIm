The Mathematica 10 documentation was updated for FindInstance adding support for regions. In my use case I'm trying to sample points in a set of disks:               region = DiscretizeRegion@RegionUnion@Table[Disk[RandomReal[4, {2}], RandomReal[1]], {10}]     FindInstance[{x, y} \[Element] region, {x, y}, Reals, 2] // N      However the above code fails and generates the following error:               FindInstance::elemc: "Unable to resolve the domain or region membership condition {x,y}\[Element]"      What's going wrong here?
