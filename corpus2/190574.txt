I can remember a very Very long time ago (pre Y2K) , reading an article by some "expert" that theorized that software communicating over the internet, especially video games could get mixed up with Military communications meaning that a user could inadvertently mobilize a B52 nuclear bomber with a click of his mouse on a video game. This theory sounds ridiculous enough as it would be very unlikely that packets of data from different software going to different Hosts on different ports could get mixed up. PLus the recipient would have a hard time interpreting the data that may only be understandable by the application it was meant to be read by. However I digress, does anyone know about this theory and if it had a name, and has anything like this happened in software. Apologies if this seems like a Networking question but since its ultimately about Application data then I felt it would suit this Stack site. Thanks Any other info would be welcome on similar theories or ideas.
