I want to generate plots showing dependence of a function on another parameter, and automatically add correct PlotLegend that says which graph is which parameter.               f[x_, a_] := x + a ; Params = {1, 2};     Plot[Evaluate[f[x,#] & /@ Params], {x, 0, 1},           PlotLegends -> {StringForm["a = ``", #] & /@ Params }]      But this doesnt work, Mathematica complains that functions and legend are not the same shape.
