I have the following equation:               p = 1/(1 + E^(-51.179 + 0.849 x1 + 2.3649 x2 + 1.155 x3 + 1.46 x4 + 1.31 x5))      and I want to find the set of values for x1 to x5 such that the fraction be equal to 0.5.In other words, I want x1-x5 values for which `p==0.5`. I tried `NSolve` and `Reduce` but those didn't work. All x1-x5 are between 0 and 10. I searched the list but I couldn't come up with a solution. Any help is appreciated.
