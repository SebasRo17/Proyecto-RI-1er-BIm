Expertise: 11 years PHP programming I'd like to get into simple Windows programming for a kiosk project. What language should I choose? **My criteria:**   * easy to learn, "higher"-level language (e.g. not C++, I don't have a year to learn this)   * quick to get up-and-running (that's what I loved about PHP)   * well-documented & lots of community resources   * easy GUI creation   * client wants windows machines so Linux is not an option **What I've gathered from other Stackexchange answers and Google, but have no experience using:**   1. QT + Python (wish PHP-Qt was more mature -- it doesn't seem to have much of a community)   2. C# (seems like overkill for a simple kiosk)   3. Firefox + kiosk extension + AMP for GUI, and macro software to manipulate windows, files, lower-level stuff.
