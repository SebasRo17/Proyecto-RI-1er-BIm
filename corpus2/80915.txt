Suppose I have two lists of N 3 by 3 vectors of integers. I need to find a quick way (say of running time at most N^(1+epsilon)) to find the vectors of the first list that have the same 1st coordinate with a vector of the second list. Of course, I could do the following naive copmarison:               for u in list_1 do     for v in list_2     if u[1] equals v[1] then     print u;print v;     end if;end for; end for;      This, however, would require N^2 loops. I feel that sorting the two lists according to their first coordinate and then look up for collisions is perhaps a fast way. Bubbleshort, etc., would probably take logN time, but I can't really see how to code the search for collision between the sorted lists. Any help would be appreciated.
