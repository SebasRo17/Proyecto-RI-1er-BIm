I've been working the same software development job for a few years now but the culture (or lack of proper culture) of the place has finally gotten to me and I have given my notice. To be brief: The bosses created an environment/culture where developers had no incentive to produce quality work. And not only that, any attempts to improve things were actively dismissed by several layers of management. Eventually this became very stressful. I felt like I was fighting someone at every corner just to get things done properly instead of hacking it together like we've always done. Because of this it seems like I haven't learned anything new there for a long time. And now I worry that my skills are becoming less and less relevant on the job market. So, my current plan is to take 3 months off to shake off the stress and to do some major nerding. The idea is to start two or three small projects to learn and apply new technologies/patterns/tools/etc... Essentially, to do everything I didn't have the chance to at my previous job. **The question:** Am I shooting myself in the foot if I take a 3 month break between jobs? Is it always bad to have a break between jobs even if that time is spent improving your skillset? *** UPDATE *** I ended up taking 9 months off. Finding work near home turned out to be harder than I expected, but nobody seemed to even notice the long break in my CV. When I eventually expanded my search to nearby cities as well I quickly found something interesting. The best part is that this new place is happy to let me work from home half of the time :)
