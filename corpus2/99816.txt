I have worked for the past 4 years as a programmer and research assistant. It is my second major job out of college(CS degree). It was a good position at the time, but I grew frustrated at the slow pace and decided to enter the private sector. My question: what skills are academic programmers lacking compared to those that have been in the general workforce? I want to minimize any deficiencies while I search for new work.
