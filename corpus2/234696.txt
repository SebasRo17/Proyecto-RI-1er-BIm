I hear that Abstraction is a technique that helps us identify which specific information should be visible, and which information should be hidden. Encapsulation is then the technique for packaging the information in such a way as to hide what should be hidden, and make visible what is intended to be visible. I understand Encapsulation well... A simple example would be a Method that calculates calories based on the parameters we provide. CalculateCalories(x,y,z) Here I don't know how this method calculates calories but I can call it to calculate the calories. Abstraction is what I am confused about. What are those techniques that Abstraction uses to help identify which specific information should be visible, and which information should be hidden? Or am I misunderstanding the concept? Could anyone give an intuitive example?
