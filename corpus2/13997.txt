I've had Mathematica crash on me a number of times, and have had to recreate notebook contents from the last save point. I was looking for something in the preferences like an autosave frequency configuration parameter that I could use to automatically save all my notebook content at some regular frequency to minimize losses due to crashes. I found `NotebookSave[]`, and a `NotebookAutoSave -> True` attribute for `CreateDocument`, but both these appear to be for manipulating external notebooks. Is there a way to do this systematically and by default?
