The situation: Person X, who already has a full-time job, applies to Company A. Money is good at A, but the real reason X had applied is 'cause the work at A really excites X. Next someone from the technical dept. from A calls up X, gives some assignment and holds a round of technical interview over phone. X does very well in all of it so far. Finally, X asks the tech guy from A "What's next?" The guy says we'd get back to you in 3-4 days time and then doesn't call up in the next 3-4 days. X is confused. He's got the mail-id of the tech guy but not sure if he should inquire -- this is no HR after all. In fact HR was never anywhere in this process. What should he do? **My Take** : Don't mail. You already have a full-time job and this shows desperation. **The Problem** : This isn't me and people tell me that some companies wait for candidate to get back just to double check their interest level. * * * **Update** Mailing the engineering team proved very useful, they apologized for being busy and now I am told the next round is early January.
