I have a nonlinear control system               system = {x'[t] == u[t] m[t],       WhenEvent[And[Mod[t, 9], x[t] < 100], m[t] -> x[t]],       WhenEvent[u[t] == 0, m[t] -> 10],  x[t /; t <= 0] == 0,       m[t /; t <= 0] == 1, u[t /; t <= 0] == 0};          control = {e[t] == xref - x[t],       WhenEvent[Mod[t, \[Tau]],       u[t] -> kp (k1 Sign[e[t]] - k2 Sign[e'[t]])],       e[t /; t <= 0] == xref};      params = {kp -> 1, td -> 1, \[Tau] -> 0.5, xref -> 810, k1 -> 11/2, k2 -> 9/2};      which I simulate using `NDSolve`                sol = NDSolve[{system, control} /. params, {x, m, u}, {t, 0, 60},        DiscreteVariables -> {u, m}];      I would like to add random noise to the system, but so far nothing seems to work. Using `RandomReal[NormalDistribution[]]` is problematic, as it only samples once for `NDSolve`. Using `WienerProcess` with `ItoProcess` also does not seem to work, as the system contains discrete variables. I cannot convert it to a state space model, as `StateSpaceModel` only works for linear systems.
