I'm trying to set up my new Windows 8.1 tablet to compile Mathematica (9.0.1) functions to C, using the MinGW-64 compiler. I have it set up so that the following works:               greeter = CreateExecutable[StringJoin[         "#include <stdio.h>\n",         "int main(){\n",         "  printf(\"Hello MinGW-w64 world.\\n\");\n",         "}\n"],        "hiworld"];     Import["!\"" <> greeter <> "\"", "Text"]      However, function compilation to C fails, as follows:               zeroC = Compile[{         },        0,        CompilationTarget -> "C"        ];          CreateLibrary::cmperr: "Compile error: collect2.exe: error: ld returned 1 exit status          Compile::nogen: A library could not be generated from the compiled function.      On an older computer that I had previously set up for compilation, this same function definition works fine. Any clues as to what is going wrong? It would of course be helpful if I could see exactly what commands Mathematica is passing to the shell, and what complaint ld makes. `CreateExecutable` has an option `"ShellOutputFunction" -> Print` that shows what it's doing, but I can't figure out how to pass this to `Compile`.
