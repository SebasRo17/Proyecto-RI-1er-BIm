I have a notebook I wish to set up where the sections are conceptually related to each other. But, I wish to isolate them from each other programmatically, so that they do not interfere with one another. A built-in method of doing this is to set the default context to `CellGroup` so that each group of cells has its own context. However, each section relies on the same set packages, and because one of them is quite large, I do not wish to reload the packages for each section. An option is to put each section in its own context manually using `Begin` and `End`, but I would rather avoid that if possible. Ideally, though, I would like to be able to load the packages in their own separate section and elevate them to the `Global`` (or equivalent) context. Any thoughts on how this can be accomplished?
