When I first started to learn programming I remember having an argument with my teacher about If Else statements. I was arguing that:                if {           ...      } else if {           ...      } ...      is basically the same as:                if {           ...      else {           if {                ...           } else {                if {                     ...                } else {                     ...                }           }      }       but he said they were completely different. After a while of arguing I accepted they are different. Now, over the years I have come back to this and looked over them to see the apparent major difference but for the life of me I cannot see it. Can someone please clarify why exactly they are different (apart from the obvious nesting)
