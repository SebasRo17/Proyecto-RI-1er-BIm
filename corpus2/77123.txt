Data persistency has recently become a really grip for me, especially how long to maintain database connectivity and how many connections are feasible for a given request. I've been using .NET; however, this is a generic question related to any lanaguage. From a .NET perspective, I'm connecting to database using EF4 and for a given website page I might create 6 connection per-request to render a page. The page might consist of news, stock prices, etc, and needs to be constantly updated. I've recently been looking at unit-of-work (i.e. per request) approach. So basically when a request starts, if required a database connection is opened and destroyed upon end of the request. I'm not convinced it's the best approach yet. I'm looking for opinions and experience on it.
