I would like to display numbers like `9.0001` and `10.0001` in the fixed-width form of `xx.xxxx`. This seems like a perfect job for:               NumberForm[#, {6, 4}, NumberPadding -> {"0", "0"}] & /@ {9.0001, 10.0001}      But this returns `{009.0001, 010.0001}`, which has one extra leading zero. Reducing the number of digits doesn't fix this.               NumberForm[#, {5, 4}, NumberPadding -> {"0", "0"}] & /@ {9.0001, 10.0001}          {09.0001,010.0000}      Why is at least one copy of the left NumberPadding always being added, even when this makes the total number of digits exceed `n`, the desired total number of digits?
