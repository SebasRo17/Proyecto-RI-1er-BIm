I am trying to find the lengths of different contours in the following plot: ![ContourPlot of interest!!](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6qsD1.jpg) It is a complicated piecewise function evaluated on the unit disk. I am hoping there is an easy, generalized way to numerically approximate each of the contours' lengths. Essentially, I am looking for a way to solve for the length of a homogenous equation bound by a region. Given a function `f(x,y) - f* == 0` on a region `R`, where `f*` is the value of the contour of interest, is there a way to find the length of the curve that satisfies that equation? For concreteness, the above is the `ContourPlot` of               q[r_] := Piecewise[{{25/(0.1*1), r < 0.1}, {25/r, r >= 0.1}}]     phi[r_, t_] := (Pi/2) + q[r]*t     v[r_, t_] := q[r]*r*Cos[phi[r, t]]     s[x_] := Piecewise[{{x = -1, x < 0}, {x = 1, x >= 0}}]          f[x_,y_] := s[x]*v[Sqrt[x^2 + y^2],ArcTan[y/x]/q[Sqrt[x^2 + y^2]]]      How does one numerically find the lengths of each of those contours?
