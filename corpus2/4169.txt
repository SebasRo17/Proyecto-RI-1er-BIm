In a Package I am writing, I'm trying to define a function with an `Optional` parameter in it that is set to a global variable.               PlotIndex[IndexLoopPlotMtx_:IndexLoopPlot]:=ListPlot[.....      However, the `Optional` value `IndexLoopPlot` is not set until after the package is loaded and other functions are run. Therefore `PlotIndex` is read in as,               PlotIndex[IndexLoopPlotMtx_:{}]:=ListPlot[.....      In other words, `IndexLoopPlotMtx` is set to `Null`, and when the function is run later it tries to `plot {}` instead of the matrix `IndexLoopPlot`. Is there a way to get it delay setting the `Default` until the function is called for the first time from the package?
