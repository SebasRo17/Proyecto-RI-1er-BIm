I have three childViewController views inside my ContainerViewController and these three views are inside a horizontal scroll view. My intention is to build an app that has a custom camera on one ChildViewController view, a tableView which will display JSON data on another view, and a page which will show a list of the users friends. The reason I am building it this way is to achieve a dragging/sliding effect between the three different child views. Although I get the result I want from a UI/UX perspective, i'm not sure how this will effect memory and performance. If i'm not mistaken my containerViewController will be handling a lot of activity. Would there be an alternative way to architect this type of application? I understand I could have three separate view controllers using a Navigation Controller but than I wouldn't achieve the UI/UX experience I want. I'm really after the dragging/sliding between different pages experience, similar if not the same as Snapchat/Tinder
