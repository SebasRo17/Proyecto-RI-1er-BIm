I have a spiral pattern that I would like to fill, which self-intersects. My desired behavior is to have filling between neighboring lines only, and to represent this figure as a single polygon. The default behavior is somewhat different, producing an alternating color pattern: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/H3S2i.png) The outer parts of the spiral are filling properly (only between the neighboring line), but the inner parts are not. There is probably a particular ordering of points that can be passed to Polygon that would produce the desired behavior, but I am not sure how to accomplish that. The data is here, here's the code I use to currently generate the figure:               bhpl = Graphics[{Black, Circle[{0, 0}, 3.22823*10^11]}];     streampl = Graphics[{Red, Polygon[polydat]}];     Show[streampl, bhpl,        PlotRange -> {{-9.68468*10^11, 9.68468*10^11}, {-6.45645*10^11, 3.22823*10^12}}
