What makes writing documentation unpleasant for some people, and what can be done to make it less unpleasant? Current thoughts:   1. Ensure the program being described makes sense (eg doesn't have too many fudges or +1s or -1s in it). You feel bad, and it's more difficult, describing a program that doesn't make sense!   2. Conquer your fear of writing. Improve your writing skills, possibly on pleasant tasks.
