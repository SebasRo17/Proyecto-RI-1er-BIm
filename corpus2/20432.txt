I know that I exported Graphs to PDFs before but it doesn't seem to work any more. I tried               K5 = GraphData[{"Complete", 5}]     Export["K5.PDF", K5]      And I get a PDF with a grey rectangle in it. Even exporting to TIFF doesn't seem to work. When I right click the `Graph` object I can do a "Convert to Graphics". Then exporting this converted Graph to PDF works. Why doesn't it work directly? If it's not possible ... How can I convert a `Graph` to `Graphics` programatically before calling a export to PDF? I'm using Mathematica 9.0.0 on Windows 7 x64 UPDATE: Problem solved by Szabolcs I checked if dynamic evaluation was checked and it was. However when I restarted Mathematica it did work as expected. I realize with hindsight that this morning going through some help files a warning was issued about dynamic evaluation. I didn't really pay attention to it but probably it got disabled automatically but did not show that change in the evaluation menu option. Also Show[] is nice to know that it effectively converts the Graph to a non dynamic graphics object!
