Insofar as I understand it, tools like Git and Mercurial derive checksums from their data, and those checksums are used to derive other checksums used in aggregate, leading to a kind of accumulative checksumming (checksums being the input to other checksums), that ensures a high level of integrity. Is there a name for that, and if so, what is it? (Other than "accumulative checksumming" (which, according to Google, is not well used, or I just made up.) My Google foo is failing me here... Another way to put it, is there a name for the way a Git repository ensures its integrity? Sorry for the vagueness - grasping for terminology I sense should exist but I can't actually find.
