I want to write an application that can be used to burn CDs (music). I know I should test it with real CDs anyway, but I don't want to do this every time I make a small change. But I do want to know and test if the right data will be burnt, so you don't get corrupted CDs. I am using a library which only exposes APIs to directly burn to a physical drive; it doesn't allow you to write to a disk image (which would be much easier to test). How could I test this without wasting CDs and time for every change/few changes I make?
