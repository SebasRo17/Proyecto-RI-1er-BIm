I am using the TFS 2010 SCRUM template. So, let's say I have these user stories: As a user I want the ability to add contacts directly from the Partner page. As a user I want the ability to add contacts directly from the Project page. Design wise the contact forms should be the same and so should the functionality. So, if a user clicks the add contact button from either page, a pop up window will appear allowing the user to add a new contact. Should both those stories share similar tasks since the development and design are similar? Should I break up the features into separate stories? Update: So, is it more acceptable to write this: As a user I want to add contacts from any area in the site so that I don't have to keep going back to a speicifc contact entry page. Then I could supply the features we need for that story?
