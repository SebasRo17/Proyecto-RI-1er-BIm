Say I have two lists,               list1 = {a, b, c}     list2 = {x, y, z}      and I want to map a function f over them to produce               {f[a,x], f[a,y], f[a,z], f[b,x], f[b,y], f[b,z], f[c,x], f[c,y], f[c,d]}      I would assume I map the function over the first list to produce a "list of functions", which then run over the 2nd list, something like:               Map[Map[f[#1, #2]&,list1]&, list2]      but I can't figure out how to leave #2 "empty" until the 2nd map kicks in. How can I separate them to generate all combinations of arguments?
