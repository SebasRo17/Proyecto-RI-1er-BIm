I've noticed that Node.js has become very popular, and I've seen several instances of people doing small-scale projects in it. I've also looked at pros and cons lists to get an idea of what Node.js can do, but I'm still not clear on how it differs from other, more mature server-side tech like PHP, Perl, or Ruby on Rails. What, specifically, differentiates Node.js from the current alternatives, and why?
