I have five applications residing on servers. Some of these applications are socket (C/C++) based, others are web based (Java, PHP). I need to give licenses to these applications on the basis of the number of users that can access, the type of functionalities and type of users. What kind of business model should I use? I have a few in mind:   1. Create a java webservice that will be mounted on a license data, and all the servers will communicate with it when a user logs in any of the above applications.   2. Do a socket based server.   3. Mount a lisence file on each server and make each one communicate with its file individually and act as the license rules. If you have other solutions please shoot.
