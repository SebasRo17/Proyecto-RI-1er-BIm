I have a Matlab function which accepts a 3 dimensional vector and returns a single number. I want to use this through MATLink to make a 3d plot. A unit sphere:               ContourPlot3D[      Norm[{x, y, z}, 2]^2 == 1, {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1}, {z, -1, 1}]      I now want to replace the Norm with my function:               myfunc= MFunction["myfunc"];     ContourPlot3D[myfunc[{x, y, z}] == 1, {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1}, {z, -1, 1}]      but I get errors: > MSet::unsupp: Unsupported data type. The expression "x" can't be converted. > MFunction::args: The arguments at positions {1} to "myfunc" could not be > translated to MATLAB.... I am fairly certain I'm missing something obvious but I this is my first time with MATLink.
