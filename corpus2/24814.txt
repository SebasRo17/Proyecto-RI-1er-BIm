I have a solution to an ODE (which I call `sol`), which I would like to expand in terms of Log[1+x] around x=-1. I thought that:               Series[y[x] /. sol, {Log[1+x], -1, 6}]      would do the trick, but it doesn't seem to work. That isn't too much of a problem, because if I just do:                Series[y[x] /. sol, {x, -1, 6}]      and I can spot the Log terms myself. It would be very useful though if rather than having an analytic expansion (I get constants in terms of Bessel functions and so on) if I could just get numerical values (i.e. approximate decimal representations) of the terms in the expansion. For concreteness rather than: $\frac{2 (\log (x+1)+\gamma -\log (2))}{\pi }-\frac{(x+1)^2 (\log (x+1)+\gamma -1-\log (2))}{2 \pi }+O\left((x+1)^4\right)$ i'd like something like: 1.234 Log[1+x] + 23.321 (1+x)^2 Log[1+x] etc. Thankyou
