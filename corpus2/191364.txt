The way I did it was to loop through each at the same time and add the current value to a separate set for each of the lists. Also, check if the current element is already in the other list's set. I have no idea if this works though and if so, why? I know it finds a common element but does it find the first common element? I can't think of counter examples but I'm having trouble convincing myself it's definitely correct. Also, even if it is correct, is there a better way of finding the first common element?
