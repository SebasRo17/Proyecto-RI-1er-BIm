My situation is this. I will be graduating soon with a degree in Computer Science. I did have a job for a while working as a Web Developer for a small graphic design company. During this time, we did work on a few large scale projects for the local university. I eventually had to leave that job after the economy crashed due to a lack of available work. Since then I haven't had any jobs related to my field as there aren't usually many available in the area I live in. I have been actively searching for jobs for the last 4 months and have had very little if any positive feedback. This has left me wondering if perhaps my qualifications are what they should be. I would say in general I have a basic to intermediate understanding of many languages and systems. I'm not sure I could say I'm specialized in anything, though web development using PHP/MySQL would be the closest thing I have to a specialty. That being said I'm not sure at this point that I want to pursue only web development as I would prefer to get more into desktop application development. Do employers look more for people with specialties than they do those that have broad general abilities?
