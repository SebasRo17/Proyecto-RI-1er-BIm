I have a list of several hundred images, and I want to average the list to get a single image. Each image is 12bit TIFF with 2048*2048 pixels, and I am using the following to do the job:               result=Mean[Map[ImageData[Import[#]]&,imagelist]];      The problem is that the data becomes huge. I tried to do the task with about 400 images with 2048*2048 resolution. The computer ran out of ram, created a 25GB of virtual memory, and could not finish the task. Is there any other alternative that I can use to do the task? I would greatly appreciate your help.
