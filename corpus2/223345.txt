In this answer of mine, I used `_t` at end of types, which ended at best, controversial. This is the practice I use in my current projects.               typedef struct {         int x;         int y;     } point_t;      This was intended to be consistent with C types from `stddef.h` like `size_t` or `ptrdiff_t`. However, according to certain comments in my questions, `_t` postfix appears to be reserved for POSIX. What should I use instead of `_t`? Or should I continue using `_t` anyway? This question is for both C and C++. If these languages have different conventions, feel free to answer so.
