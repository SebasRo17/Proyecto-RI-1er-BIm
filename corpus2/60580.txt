I've been doing website programming for 15 years and PHP for the last 5 years or so. I've always written solid code. HOWEVER, I have a client that is insisting on 80% of the code being unit tested. Since the client is ALWAYS RIGHT, I am planning on using PHP_CodeSniffer to make sure my code looks right and PHPUnit to do my unit testing. I'm hoping to learn something through this experience. Are these the right tools to use? How much time is involved in setting up PHPUnit and writing the additional code? It should take me around 8 weeks to write the webpages and self-test as I have done in the past. If I add 4 days additional (10%) for unit testing (PHPUnit), is that enough? Thoughts? Suggestions? Thanks.
