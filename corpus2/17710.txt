A question on software specialties inspired this question. How valuable is a software generalist compared to a specialist? When I say generalist, I mean someone who can take a project from requirements to deployment, and is competent with all phases of the software development lifecycle. Someone who can put all the specialties together into a cohesive whole. An expert generalist knows his or her weaknesses and fills them by relying on specialists - example: Oracle specialists or UX specialists. What do you see as the ultimate career path of the software generalist?
