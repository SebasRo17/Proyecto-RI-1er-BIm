## Scenario A clustered environment running N identical application nodes interacting with a single relational database. ## Problem Is it possible to upgrade the nodes to a new application version, which requires a new database schema **and** maintain data integrity in the database **without** any downtime in the application and **without** losing any data or ending up with data in an inconsistent state?
