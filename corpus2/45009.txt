I want to program a code in MATHEMATICA in order to calculate some values in different iteration. For example, assume this list: `list={1,2,3,4,5}` Now assume that the function is : `f1=Function[u,3+u][x]` I want to use a `Do` loop to orderly put each integer from the `list` into `f1` function and `Do` loop uses 5 iteration (`{i,1,5}`) and gives 5 answers using the values in the list. For this example, The results will be : `4 5 6 7 8` I wonder if anyone could help me with this problem.
