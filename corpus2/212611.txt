I'm a Java developer, mostly doing Spring stuff. I understand the patterns, OOP, bean injection, multithreading and everything that goes with it. I don't feel like I'm a bad developer, I get my stuff done. So let's say I go to some developer interview. It shouldn't be a problem to get a job, right. No. I go on an interview, and usually I pass the interview where they ask about my dreams, salary and all that personality stuff. Then they give me a technical assignment, something to program, some tricky question, a codility test in limited time. I fail. I get below average results. I don't understand why? Am I that bad? It even pisses me off, that I have to prove myself and fail. In general I've been programming for four years. It's not like I'm writing some crap, that barely somehow works; it's structured. I got the current job by showing something I had done in my spare time, and it impressed. It's impossible for me to get a developer job by passing all those tricky hoops. Also, the actual work is not that hard, all the sorting algorithms, cryptography and somewhat difficult problems are usually encapsulated. Why are the interviewers asking you to do something you did once back in university many years ago? Is this normal? Is there something I can do to improve myself? How do I get the job?
