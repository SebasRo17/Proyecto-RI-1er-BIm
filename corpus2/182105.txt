My supervisor is the CTO of the company that I work at, he is the jack of all trades master of none. I have inherited a codebase of about 400,000 lines of PHP from 2 previous developers. The state of the code could be compared to that of a dumpster behind an italian restaurant, a mess and full of spaghetti. I have been in my current position for about 7 months and have been trying to get approval to refactor parts of the codebase as I am given bugs/features to work on. My attempts to get permission to dedicate time to this task has been met with little more than a passing 'no' in response. What are some steps that I can take to explain to my superior why we need to clean up this spaghetti mess of a codebase and see if we can't get it refactored into a manageable, scalable, and secure state. I am looking more for how to explain the need to someone who will say they understand, but truely have no idea so they shoot it down to avoid trouble later.
