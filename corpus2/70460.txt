I know some Ruby, but could never make anything great, or even good. I just know that I am interested in programming and that it's what I want to do. What kind of programmer? No idea. I will be going to school for Computer Science and I don't know what I should do in order to feel more comfortable in my classes. What should I learn? There is so much that I don't know. All I know is HTML, CSS, and some Ruby. I don't know ANY Java nor do I know anything about Apache, MySql, or PHP. I would like to learn something that would (hopefully) help me in school. I don't want to start out and drown right away because I don't understand basic concepts in **___ _**. <\--- Anything CS related can fit in that space. What should I learn next? One problem I face is that I have absolutely NO idea what kind of programmer I want to be. I know that I don't want to program video games and I am not sure I want to do web dev (although I'm sure I don't know enough to really know WHAT to do.) Can anyone offer advice on some things I should be learning now in order to prepare?
