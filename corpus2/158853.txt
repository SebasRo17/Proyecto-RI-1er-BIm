I was reading about Assemblies (modules, which Microsoft CLR works with). The Assembly contains so called Manifest, which by definition describes a set of files in the Assembly. I know that Android applications also contain a file called Manifest, which also describes a set of files contained in the application. Is this simply a coincidence? Or are there some commonly accepted rules in software development to name "special" files?
