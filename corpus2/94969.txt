I am into programming since last 3 years. But I seems to be lost in it. I am not able to get good at it even though I code everyday. suppose I solve one problem, I will wander from solution to solution and implement some other solution. I cant focus much. I get many defects for the code I write. I afraid of code I dont know why if I dont finish it on time my boss will fire me etc. I enjoy coding but not all the time. How to increase patience? I always wonder how do I become the best coder like many exceptional programmers. I know this sounds subjective but I think this will help programmer community to get good at it especially for average like me or beginner programmers.
