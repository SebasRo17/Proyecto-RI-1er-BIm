I am reverse engineering a data file (from a synthesizer). It seems that e.g. -1 is written as FF FF FF FF, so in four bytes. while +1 is written as 00 00 01 (--), so only three bytes. Is something like this common? I only heard about either a 3 or 4 byte format, but not 3 OR 4 depending on the sign. And is there some way to handle this in C#? BitConverter class is a bit too limited for this.
