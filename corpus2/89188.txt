I need advice from people who might understand where I'm coming from. I'm the lead engineer on a software product. The company I'm working for recently expressed serious interest in having me blog about it (much to my dread). They even had someone set me up a blog. I have Asperger's disorder. I'm really good at taking complex software problems and finding wonderfully elegant solutions. I don't know the first thing about writing interesting and engaging text. Writing for me is a difficult problem, one that doesn't have a defined solution. I'm really struggling with this and it eats into a lot of time I could spend getting things done. I love the company I'm working for, but I'm worried what it'll mean if I tell them I can't do it. I don't know how to tell my employer that what they are asking for is something that's totally beyond me. Help or advice anyone? **Update** Thank you everyone! Wow, such great responses, lots of great advice!! It was very hard and took a long time, but I was able to do it. I'm going to stick with it a bit longer in hopes that it gets easier (the first post is probably the hardest, because it sets the tone and such). Thanks for the kind words, all the advice, and even for the kicks in the pants!! =)
