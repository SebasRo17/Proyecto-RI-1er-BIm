When designing a delegate to represent the state of a UI (java swing) what is cleaner: to manipulate the delegate directly from the custom event handlers defined in the UI code, or to register the delegate as a change listener on the UI elements? (expunging basically all logic from UI code) I'm more for the second design, but I'd like some feedback before churning out a load of (bad) code.
