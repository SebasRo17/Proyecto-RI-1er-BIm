Can people please share their experiences, preferably the surprising ones, with using ItoProcess? I am a big fan of ItoProcess and have already used it for several finance- related tasks, though I suspect that I'm just seeing the tip of the iceberg. I'll kick things off by supplying one answer about a bug that must be worked around before you can use ItoProcess with a correlation matrix. Wolfram Support have responded to my bug report by saying it will be fixed 'in a future release of Mathematica'.
