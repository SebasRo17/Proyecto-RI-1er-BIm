What is the best approach for creating a singleton API class, where different requests could call different api providers and how to manage this? For instance you might have a singleton class 'API' that could have a couple of methods such as               getProduct     getImage     getUser      What is the best way to manage this, but in theory getProduct needs to call api.website1.com getImage needs to call api.website2.com/v1/ getUser needs to call api.website2.com/v2/ But there's nothing to say that getImage might end up using website1.com in future or that getUser might end up using /v3/ I'm trying to think of a good way to manage this where the endpoints (and credentials) could potentially change for the different request, but for a developer just consuming the singleton API class, they aren't fussed where it actually comes from. I think the right approach is to make sure the requests conforms to a particular interface (regardless of where it comes from e.g type User) but I think it's the config around instantiating the correct API request type and the right credentials that I'm struggling to get my head around. I'm guessing a factory that returns the correct provider would be a good way to go, but instructing that factory to return the correct provider is proving difficult. This is iOS based, but any conceptual ideas would be appreciated thanks
