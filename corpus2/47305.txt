I need to stack three objects on top of each other and align the first two to the center and the third one to the left. I've been trying to do this with `Column`, but it won't let me align the objects differently. The code below should make clear what I'm trying to do:               Column[{Style["Title", FontSize -> 20, "Title"],Graphics@Disk[],Style["Footnote text..."]},        {Center, Center, Left}]      I want the title and the disk to be centered, but the footnotes aligned to the left. Anyone know how to do this?
