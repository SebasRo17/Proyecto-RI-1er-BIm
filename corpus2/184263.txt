I am currently working on an MVC 3 Web app project where I need to display a lot of information on the front page. I am relatively new at web page layout and design so I have hit a wall in terms of how to structure the code behind for this page. My first thoughts were to split the page up into as many partials as possible so the View Models are smaller and easier to manage. Although I am not sure if this is the correct way of going about it. Or should I try to fit all the needs of the page into one view model that will display all the information I need? My question: **Should I split my pages up into a lot of small partials or just make it one big page?**
