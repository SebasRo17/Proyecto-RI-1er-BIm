> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Design and Development Methodologies for the single developer I'm a web developer who mostly works with the LAMP stack when it comes to my own projects. Most of the time I just start coding on a project and fixing bugs and adding features as I go along. Often I'll try to use an existing solution such as Wordpress or Drupal. Now that I'm thinking of creating my own web application with businesses as the target group, I feel there's a **need for proper analysis and design**. Something lightweight for a **one person project** and still solid enough to handle requirements, user interfaces, security, etc. If you could **recommend methodologies and literature** I would be grateful.
