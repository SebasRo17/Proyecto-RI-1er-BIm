Sometimes I see code samples in the document or in this site using `Directive`, but I haven't yet find a case that `Directive` is necessary. Usually it can be replaced just by `List` (except for `Graphics` and `Graphics3D`, in which `Directive` can be replaced by `Sequence`) and their visual appearance won't change at all, though their `FullForm` structures will be different:               (* These samples are all modified from the examples in the document. *)          p[1] = Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 10}, PlotStyle -> Directive[Orange, Thick, Dashed]];     p[2] = Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 10}, PlotStyle -> {Orange, Thick, Dashed}];     p[2] === p[1]     p[3] =        Plot[2 Sin[x], {x, 0, 10},          Frame -> True, FrameLabel -> {x, 2 Sin[x]},          LabelStyle -> Directive[Medium, Italic]];     p[4] =        Plot[2 Sin[x], {x, 0, 10},          Frame -> True, FrameLabel -> {x, 2 Sin[x]}          LabelStyle -> {Medium, Italic}];     p[4] === p[3]     p[5] =        ParametricPlot3D[{Cos[φ] Sin[θ], Sin[φ] Sin[θ], Cos[θ]}, {φ, 0, 2 Pi}, {θ, 0, Pi},          MeshShading -> {{Directive[Red, Specularity[White, 10]],            Directive[Green, Opacity[0.5]]}, {Blue, Yellow}}];     p[6] =        ParametricPlot3D[{Cos[φ] Sin[θ], Sin[φ] Sin[θ], Cos[θ]}, {φ, 0, 2 Pi}, {θ, 0, Pi},          MeshShading -> {{{Red, Specularity[White, 10]},            {Green, Opacity[0.5]}}, {Blue, Yellow}}];     p[6] === p[5]     p[7] =        Graphics[{Purple, Arrowheads[Large], Arrow[{{4, 3/2}, {0, 3/2}, {0, 0}}]}];     p[8] =        Graphics[{Directive[Purple, Arrowheads[Large]], Arrow[{{4, 3/2}, {0, 3/2}, {0, 0}}]}];     p[8] === p[7]     p[9] =        Graphics3D[         Directive[Black, Thick, Dashed],           Line[{{-2, 0, 2}, {2, 0, 2}, {0, 0, 4}, {-2, 0, 2}}]}];     p[10] =        Graphics3D[{Black, Thick, Dashed,          Line[{{-2, 0, 2}, {2, 0, 2}, {0, 0, 4}, {-2, 0, 2}}]}];     p[10] === p[9]     Grid[Partition[p[#] & /@ Range@10, 2]]      > False   >  False   >  False   >  False   >  False ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UzqFp.jpg) `Directive` was added in version 6, so its existence can't be a issue left over by history, so what's the significance of `Directive`? Is there a case where `Directive` is required? Does `Directive` give any advantage over `List` or `Sequence` that I haven't noticed?
