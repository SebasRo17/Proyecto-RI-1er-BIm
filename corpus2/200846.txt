I create web applications most in RoR and PHP. About a year ago a company wanted to use my app but in a stand alone browser window in Linux, so I wrote one in python using webkit, locked it down to just accessing the target web app, easily done. Now what options do I have to do the same for Windows? I want basic browser functionality such as going back and forward pages and to stop the script from loading. It will have to run stand alone or maybe install via .exe file. Sorry for my ignorance on this but I very rarely enter a Windows Environment.
