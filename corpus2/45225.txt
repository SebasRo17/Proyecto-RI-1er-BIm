I have data in the form of a sparse array of lists. For example:               {{76, 17} -> {17803}, {24, 14} -> {18625, 311571, 440371, 818848,         2010244, 2317818}, {64, 99} -> {19421, 269349, 397997, 440343,         503977, 511172, 1600938, 1656131, 1849185, 1849187, 1974513,         2045184, 2065062, 2319929}}      The indices are pairs of integers in the range `{0,...,S}^2`. It seems as it is not possible to store this as a sparse array in Mathematica, as I get the error > SparseArray::valnl: "The value specified by the rule {76,17}->{17803} should > not be a List. " How would I create an object which provides:   * quick access to the list corresponding to an entry - for example something like `a[[i,j]]` (default is the empty list).   * create a (dense) matrix with the largest list element (default 0)   * create a (dense) matrix with the largest list element not bigger than a given constant **Update** : Example regarding the last point. If the constant would be 500000, than the entry for `{76,17}` should be `17803`, for `{24,14}` `440371`, for `{64,99}` `440343` and for all other it should be 0.
