I am trying to import data from multiple web pages hosted by a single online source. The data is posted by the source as one data set per web page for each week of the year. I would like to import the data for all 52 weeks in a year at the same time rather than modifying my code for each of the weeks and importing one at a time. Here is my code to import one week's data:               week012012 =        Import["http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2012&wknd=01&\p=.htm", "Data"]      If it is of interest or relevance here is the further processing I do with the data after it has been imported:               week012012B = Cases[week012012, {_, _, _, _, _, _, _, _, _, _, _, _?NumericQ}, âˆž];          Grid[week012012B, Frame -> All]      The site uses a consistent naming scheme for each week of the year and indeed from year-to-year as well. If I were looking to get just a few weeks data I could manually change the URL for the weekend from 01 to 02, 03, 04..., but I want all 52 weeks for 2012. The approach I have been playing with is to use string manipulation to modify the URL and then import and save the data for each of the weeks. Any suggestions?
