It's the end of the semester and I have a prof who wants me to turn in a printout of the nb files ive worked on. I have 33 separate files, and I was wondering if there was any easy way I could combine all of these files in batch to another nb or a document format to print out (pdf/rtf/doc/html anything really). Nothing fancy needs to happen here, basically i just need to make this into a printable file and preserve any plots i've made, and I wanted to have it all in a single file so that it's all contained to just that file. The data in these files is very simple, mainly just evaluating a problem using mathematica instead of by hand. There are no dependencies between any of the files to each other or any external libraries.
