I am planning on creating an open source project, however, I was wondering if developers tend to steer away from projects that are coded in VB.net, even if they know VB.net. From what I have read, more professionals use C++/C# and don't like VB.net, but beginners tend to like VB.net more. I am trying to make my project as beginner friendly, however, I still want some more experienced programmers so I don't have to carry the bulk of the load of the harder stuff. **Will I have much more contributions (to code, not money) when I chose either C++ or C#? Will more developers "play around" with my code?** I'm not worried about people who don't bother looking at the code, I just want to know would my project be more likely to prosper if I use a more popular language, or if I have a good idea, it will succeed no matter what language I use? By the way, no matter the language I chose, I will use the .net framework for ease of use. **If I do chose to use some form of C, do you recommend C# or C++? I have some experience with C (Arduino) and I plan on getting a book at the library if I use it for my project, so that is not a problem, but I really don't want my project to become abandon-ware. In fact, I hope someday, if I can, have it not dependent on me at all. (Not saying I won't contribute, but I don't have to spend all my time working on it.) * * * **EDIT:** So far, almost everybody thinks I should use either C# or C++. **Which one is more popular? Is there a benefit of one over the other?** * * * **EDIT 2:** ## **Please provide your answers with facts (like number of open source projects that use __ language, etc. so it can show trends).**
