The CCompilerDriver documentation explains that to use visual studio express on 64-bit targets, it's necessary to install the windows SDK after installing visual studio. I have done this, first installing visual studio express 2010 and then installing v7.1 of the windows SDK. However, I still have a problem due to a missing LIBCMT.LIB > >     Compiler`$CCompilerOptions={"ShellOutputFunction"->Print}; >     cFun=Compile[{{x}},x^2, CompilationTarget->"C"]; >                 C:\Users\lev\AppData\Roaming\Mathematica\ApplicationData\CCompilerDriver\BuildFolder\lev-think-5052\Working-lev-think-5052-7032-1>call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Bin\SetEnv.cmd" /x64           Setting SDK environment relative to C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\.

How about with visual studio express 2008 and v7.0 of the SDK? It took me several tries to get even this far, because I made the mistake of letting windows update install SP1 for visual studio express and this prevented installing the SDK, and I had had uninstall and reinstall everything a few times (it's not possible to simply uninstall SP1), so it's possible I've messed up my installation somehow. I can see that there is a LIBCMT.LIB in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\lib` which I presume is a 32-bit version of the library and not what the linker is looking for in this case.
