I am using Mathematica 8. In Mathematica, there is a default `PlotStyle` coloring in `Plot` and `ListPlot`. For example, suppose I have a series of nine functions stored in the list `functions`. Mathematica styles the different curves in a cyclic way (I think that the default is cycles of **"blue", purple, dark yellow, green** ), as in this example:               functions = Table[a*Cos[x], {a, 0.2, 1, 0.1}]     Plot[functions, {x, 0, 2 Pi}]      > >     {0.2 Cos[x], 0.3 Cos[x], 0.4 Cos[x], 0.5 Cos[x], 0.6 Cos[x], 0.7 Cos[x], > 0.8 Cos[x], >      0.9 Cos[x], 1. Cos[x]} >   > > ![plot1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Z46qR.png) This is nice, but now suppose that I want to color the multiple curves using some sort of gradient (perhaps one of the gradients in `ColorData`). Is this possible in `Plot` and `ListPlot`? I could do this somewhat manually. For example, if I wanted a blue gradient, I could write the following (although this choice of colors could somehow be improved):               Plot[functions, {x, 0, 2 Pi}, PlotStyle -> {        Lighter[Lighter[Lighter[Lighter[Blue]]]],        Lighter[Lighter[Lighter[Blue]]],        Lighter[Lighter[Blue]],        Lighter[Blue],        Blue,        Darker[Blue],        Darker[Darker[Blue]],        Darker[Darker[Darker[Blue]]],        Darker[Darker[Darker[Darker[Blue]]]]        }]      > ![plot2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mGczA.png) However, this becomes complicated if I have many curves or if I want to use a more complex gradient such as rainbow (e.g., `ColorData["Rainbow"]`), temperature map (e.g., `ColorData["TemperatureMap"]`), etc. Do you have any suggestions?
