Assume we have the following elements \begin{equation} F_i{}^j \;and\; S_{ij}{}^k, \end{equation} which represent the components of tensorial objects of ranks 2 and 3 respectively, with Complex coefficients. Let the components of $F$ be given by $F_1{}^j$ = \begin{matrix} 0 \\\ -x-iy \\\ -i(-1+x^2+2ixy-y^2+z^2)/2z \\\ (1-x^2-2ixy+y^2+z^2)/2z \end{matrix} $F_2{}^j$ = \begin{matrix} x+iy \\\ 0\\\ (1-x^2-2ixy+y^2+z^2)/2z\\\ i(-1+x^2+2ixy-y^2+z^2)/2z \end{matrix} $F_3{}^j$ = \begin{matrix} i(-1+x^2+2ixy-y^2+z^2)/2z\\\ -(1-x^2-2ixy+y^2+z^2)/2z \\\ 0\\\ -x-iy \end{matrix} $F_4{}^j$ = \begin{matrix} -(1-x^2-2ixy+y^2+z^2)/2z\\\ -i(-1+x^2+2ixy-y^2+z^2)/2z\\\ x+iy\\\ 0 \end{matrix} ($j=1,2,3,4$). We would like to solve for the components of $S$ if they satisfy the following equation \begin{equation} S_{li}{}^jF_k{}^l-S_{lk}{}^jF_i{}^l=0, \end{equation} where $l$ is summed over, all the indices run from 1 to 4, and $S$ is symmetric in the lower indices. Would it be possible to write a code that find the components of $S$? The code provided in my previous question Solving antisymmetric tensorial equation would work well for simple examples of $F$, but not for the example we have here.
