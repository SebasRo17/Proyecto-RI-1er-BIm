I am using _Mathematica_ to go through the examples and exercises on the book _Modern Control Systems_ , 6th edition by Dorf. On page 605, there is a table (Table 8.5) with the Bode plot for several transfer functions. In what follows there is a piece of code that attempts to build the very same table. Here is the code:               With[{ τ1 = 20, τ2 = 2, τ3 = 0.4, τ4 = 0.05, τa = 10, τb = 1, k = 10},           Grid[            Partition[              Table[ BodePlot[ sys, PlotLabel->sys, GridLines -> Automatic], { sys,                      { k/(s τ1 + 1), (k(s τa + 1))/(s(s τ1 + 1)(s τ2 + 1)),                        k/((s τ1 + 1)(s τ2 + 1)), k/s^2, k/((s τ1 + 1)(s τ2 + 1)(s τ3 + 1)),                       k/(s^2 (s τ1 + 1)), k/s, (k(s τa + 1))/(s^2 (s τ1 + 1)),                        k/(s(s τ1 + 1)), k/s^3, k/(s(s τ1 + 1)(s τ2 + 1)),                       (k (s τa + 1))/s^3, (k (s τa + 1)(s τb + 1))/s^3,                       (k (s τa + 1))/(s^2 (s τ1 + 1)(s τ2 + 1)),                      (k (s τa + 1)(s τb + 1))/(s(s τ1 + 1)(s τ2 + 1)(s τ3 + 1)(s τ4 + 1)) }                                                                               }                   ],  2], Frame->All, Spacings->6] ]      ![a bunch of Bode plots](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DyGQX.gif) All the transfer functions with `1/s^n` `( n > 1 )` give the wrong result as far as the phase plot is concerned. Is there a simple way to fix this? _Wolfram_ does not have a time line to go through the problem and sort it out.
