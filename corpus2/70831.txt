I have read the controversial article Teaching FP to freshmen posted by Robert Harper who is a professor in CMU. He claimed that CMU would no longer teach object oriented programming in the introductory course sine it is “unsuitable for a modern CS curriculum.” And he claimed that: > Object-oriented programming is eliminated entirely from the introductory > curriculum, because it is both anti-modular and anti-parallel by its very > nature. Why consider OOP as anti-modular and anti-parallel?
