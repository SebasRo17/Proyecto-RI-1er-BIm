Given a function `f[x]` and a region M in the complex x-plane, how can I find singularities of `f` in this region, i.e., issue a command to _Mathematica_ which returns the type of singularity and its parameters? Let me be more specific   1. discontinuities (jumps)   2. poles   3. branch points Examples               f[x_] := Sin[x] Sign[Cos[x]]     g[x_] := 1/(a - x)^2     h[x_] := Sqrt[x + b]        **EDIT 11.09.14**   The restriction to real x in my first version of the text was not a good idea. I have changed it.
