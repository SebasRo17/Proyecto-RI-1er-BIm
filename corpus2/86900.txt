I am trying to write a massive online multiplayer client for a poker site, where one user can be on a Flash client and the other on say an iOS client (iPhone / iPad), and would like to know how can interaction between two users be visible on both clients. What would be better to use?   * Should I use MSMQ?    * AJAX?    * Something other?  I need the messaging layer (client interaction messages) to scale up to 100K+ online users to begin with. In other words; What scalable technology can I use to make game interactions between online users visible to all game participants?
