I am just beginning with _Mathematica_. I have received this code to study. I am not able to follow this particular section. I have tried looking it up on many forums, with no answer. Can you help?               Clear[CSfunc];     CSfunc::usage="CSfunc[n_] returns {Cn,Sn} up to degree n >= 0";      CSfunc[n_] :=        Module[{cn,sn},          sn = Table[Sin[k*x*Pi/2], {k, n}]; (* anti-symmetric in x *)             cn = Table[Cos[k*x*Pi/2], {k, n}];  (* symmetric in x *)           cn = Join[{1/Sqrt[2]}, cn];          {cn, sn}];            << JavaGraphics`;           doplot = False;          doplot = True;          If[True,         (* check classic orthogonality: 2 on [-2,2], not yet on [-1,1] ... *)       ntest = 6;        xmax = 2;       csn = CSfunc[ntest];       If[False && ntest < 5 && doplot,         Plot[Flatten[csn], {x, -1, 1}, Axes->True, Frame->True]];      In the above portion of the program, I see `If[True etc.. If[False etc..]`, but no flag variable associated with it. So what condition is it checking?
