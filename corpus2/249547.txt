HDD Failure Paranoia I tend to make small programs for myself. Whenever I make an application I use a database application like MS Access or MySQL. I can CRUD my data as I want. No problem in finishing a task. The problem is when I try exploring more into File IO. I have heard of HDD crashes due to high read/write operations. I used to think that these happened only on server machines. But then I came to know that it happens on desktop machines too! So I now I have this huge mental blockage. Whenever I try converting my former software into ones with raw FILE IO, I lose the "mental drive/motivation" and freeze. I get thoughts like "OMG this task will cause this many reads/writes to the disk". I fear for loosing my hard disk. My goodness! It has happened so many times that I wish that the computer engineers had redesigned the internals of the computer to fix the problem and so I curse them a lot. A lot of my time gets wasted remotivating myself and the projects never get completed. Ya, ya, I know that behind the scenes the database applications use raw File IO to do their work! But who thinks of that when using them. All you are mostly thinking of is SQL and the resulting table in the resultset/recodset. The database applications are like a black box to raw File IO. Does anyone else think the same? Are my fears valid? What should I do? Any views/ consolations? Help! This makes me mad and unproductive!
