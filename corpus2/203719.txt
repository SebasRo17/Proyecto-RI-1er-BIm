When building a REST service with the HATEOAS constraint, it's very easy to advertise the existence of resources through linking. You make a `GET` to the root of my site and I respond with the root document listing all the first- tier resources:               {         users: { href: "/users" }         questions { href: "/questions" }     }      Clients which understand how to read these `href` values could perform `GET` requests on those and discover all the current resources available in the application. This works well for basic lookup scenarios, but doesn't indicate whether a resource is queryable. For example, it may be reasonable to perform:               GET /users?surname=Smith      Are there any formats that could express this query ability with enough information that a client could form a coherent query without needed prior knowledge of the resource? Additionally, is there any way to express that a client is allowed to perform a `POST` to a given location with an expected location. For example, it could be expected that a client perform the following to create a new question resource:               POST /questions          {         title: "Are there strategies for discovering REST services using HATEOAS?",         body: "When building a REST service with the HATEOAS constraint, it's very..."     }      When using HTML as the format for human consumption, we can express a lot of this through use of forms and written prompts to allow a human to discover the operations they are allowed to perform on a service. Are there formats which are capable of similar things for clients?
