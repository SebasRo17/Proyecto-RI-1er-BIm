I am looking for a method to highlight certain cells in a table/Grid based on meeting some user defined conditions. As an example:               M = {{-0.6, 0.04, 22}, {0.1, 0.3, 1}, {0.4, 0.05,0.01}}; (*can be much larger *)      As purely an example, the data could be formatted as:                TableForm[M, TableHeadings -> {{"x", "y", "z"}, {“correlation", "pValue",      “tStatistic"}}]  (*number of rows and columns can be very different *)      ![sample data](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PAi0k.png) I’d like to automatically highlight data which meets a certain user defined criteria say:               Abs@Correlation > 0.5 && Abs@pValue ≤ 0.05       So the highlighted table would look like: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/66JAw.png) Ideally, I’d like a function that I can apply to a Table/Grid….
