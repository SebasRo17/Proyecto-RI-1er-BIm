Recently I installed _Mathematica 10_ on _Windows 8 x64_ machine. Before that I had a prerelease version of _Mathematica 10_ installed on my laptop. I observed very annoying bugs in the FrontEnd on both machines: at some random moment during editing a notebook, some keybord shortcuts (e.g. `Ctrl+Z`, `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+S` etc) start doing things completely different from they are supposed to do: change the notebook stylesheet, open new windows, comment out the selected text etc. The menu items corresponding to those shortcuts do the same crazy things. To save the current notebook I have to invoke `NotebookSave[]` function because there is no way do it using graphical interface. Restarting _Mathematica_ solves the problem for a while, but soon it reappears. Does anybody else observe this behavior?
