I am working on making a system for the automated testing of student assignments. The biggest hurdle I am facing right now is figuring out how to sandbox the testing of the code yet still get and process the results of the test. I need to run it on a VM as there is no guarantee the code will not be malicious. I would like to have a process similar to the following:   1. Student submits assignment   2. VM is created and is given the source code submitted by the student   3. VM runs the tests on the source code   4. VM returns results of the test back to the host operating system   5. Results are processed Steps 2 and 4 are the ones I am looking for a good solution for. I am not sure what would be a good way automate the passing of files to the VM and the passing of results back from the VM. It seems like this is a problem that might have a solution already and I would rather not reinvent the wheel.
