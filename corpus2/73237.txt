Recently, Here at the company, more than one programmer was appointed in charge for a LightSwitch(C#) software development project and immediately there was a need of some sort of source control/sync. We have never used Team Foundation Server but we'd gladly use it if it's worth it.   * Is it the right tool to use for   synchronising code between   programmers?   * Does it have the needed features?   * Do you have any other tool in mind? (I have used TortoiseSVN but   it was too simple and 'texty' if you know what I mean, we need a   professional tool)   * What other features does Team Foundation has that we can use? (if you did not understand any of the above please ask me to clarify further)
