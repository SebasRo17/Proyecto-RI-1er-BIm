This is a very simple problem. It can be solved by nested `For`loops that exhaustively test every possible case, throwing out all non-solutions. > Find all the distinct positive integer solutions $0<a_i \leqslant 100$, such > that: > > $$\sum\limits_{i=1}^{10}\dfrac{1}{a_i}=1$$ There are 69014 solutions in total. But it will take a long time to find them all by nested `For`loops. Is there an efficient method for this problem, i.e, one that will find all the solutions in less than 20 minutes?
