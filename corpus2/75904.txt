I've been approved by management to begin taking the MCPD exams (re-imbursed by them). I've been developing in .NET since 1.1, but just to make sure I'll be going through the training kits so that I don't miss any areas that I haven't had much need to use in the past. The first exam I'll be taking is WCF and I must admit, I've only developed some simple services in the past and it's probably one of the weak points of my development repertoire. There is also currently no book available for WCF on .NET 4. Aside from there being no practice exams, would this: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd456779.aspx be sufficient/efficient for studying to take the exam? If not, could you suggest any resource that might be? I have a copy of Lowy's Programming WCF Services that a friend lent me, but it's for .NET 3.5. Note: If you're suggesting resources, keep in mind that I'm looking to learn and understand WCF full and not looking _just_ to pass the exam, though the latter is definitely a focus/goal.
