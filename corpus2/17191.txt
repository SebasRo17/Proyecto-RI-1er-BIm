When I insert an `InlineCell` into a `TextCell` that is too long for the whole `InlineCell` to fit on the current line, _Mathematica_ pushes the whole `InlineCell` to the beginning of the next line. That is, _Mathematica_ seems to prefer dropping the `InlineCell` to the next line over inserting a line break within it. Can I force _Mathematica_ to fit as much of an `InlineCell` on a line as possible and put as little as possible on the next line? I have played around with `LinebreakAdjustments` for the `InlineCell` and the containing cell by setting various values to `0`, but have not been able to produce the behavior I would like. **Edit:** If I do not modify `LinebreakAdjustments` for the inline cell or modify any element besides the first (leaving the first element untouched), I get results like this (blue is an `InlineCell`): ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rHoMJ.png) If I set the first element of `LinebreakArguments` (of the `InlineCell`) to `0` I obtain somewhat predictable behavior: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zvP3q.png) **Below is the behavior I am trying to produce**. I've just styled the text rather than use an inline cell: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/eWGFp.png)
