**Problem Statement -** ![Problem Statement](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Weq4m.png) Given a NxM grid of 1s & 0s (1s mark walls, while 0s indicate empty chambers), the task is to identify the number of chambers & the size of the largest. And just to whet my curiosity, to find in which chamber, a cell belongs. It seems like an ad hoc problem, since the regular algorithms just don't fit in. I just can't get the logic for writing an algorithm for the problem. If you get it, pseudo-code would be of great help! Note - I have tried the regular grid search algorithms, but they don't suffice the problem requirements. Source - INOI Q Paper 2003
