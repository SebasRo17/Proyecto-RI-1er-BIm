`Color fill`, the ability to apply a desired color to an enclosed area, is one of the basic functions provided by most graphic applications. Is there a similar function provided in Mathematica? For example, how to obtain a _red_ , _green_ , _blue_ and _yellow_ horses silhouette from the picture below in Mathematica?               im = Import["http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZDeYq.jpg"]     ReplacePixelValue[im, {924, 221} -> Blue]      `ReplacePixelValue` seems only work on one pixel only. `Colorize` seems provide no controls on obtaining a specific color. `ColorReplace` seems only work on a bundle of the same color all together . ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HSmRb.gif)
