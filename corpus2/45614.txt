I used to program in Visual Basic, but in _Mathematica_ I have not seen some kind of restore default values after any user modification command in the `Manipulate` environment. For instance, in               Manipulate[x + y, {{x, 1, "First"}, 1, 6}, {{y, 40, "Second"}, {40, 50, 60}}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dscU5.png) The user modify the slider for `x` to `5`. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/D0rat.png) After that, when the user pick other value for `y`, there is a way to restore `x` to the initial value? such that: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/aRi3y.png) And also by modifying the slider `x` again restore the value `y` to `40`. In other words, by detect a modification in the controllers, could `Manipulate` restore the default values?
