I'm not a programmer, but financial analyst by profession who is learning how to code (Python, Django, C w/ ctypes when I need something to go really fast) in a virtual Ubuntu setup on my work laptop. Question: I just assumed that coding on a Virtual machine was no different from if Linux was my main OS. Is this a bad assumption? Is there anything I need to watch out for? Thanks, Mike
