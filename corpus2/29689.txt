I want to find out when a function has a real root. I first made a `RegionPlot3D` when the function is zero.               Manipulate[       RegionPlot3D[(A*x)^(1 - s) -          NSum[B^(n)*(x^((1 - s)*z^n))*           Exp[(1 - z^(2 n))*(1 - s)^2*v^2/(2*(1 - z^2))], {n, 1, Infinity}] -          NSum[B^(n)*(y^((1 - s)*q^n))*           Exp[(1 - q^(2 n))*(1 - s)^2*p^2/(2*(1 - q^2))], {n, 1, Infinity}] == 0,          {x, 0.95, 1.05}, {y, 0.95, 1.05}, {z, 0.95, 0.99}],        {q, {0.95}},        {v,{0.0035}},        {p, {0.0035}},        {s,{2}},        {B,{0.95}},        {A,{0.96}}]      I got a blank cubic. As a check I plotted the function in 2D. However, the 2D plot shows that the function has a zero when `M = x =0.9528` and `K = y = 1.0396`.               Manipulate[       Plot[(A*M)^(1 - s) +          NSum[(B^n*(K^((1 - s)*(q)^n))*           Exp[(1 - (q)^(2*n))*((p)^2)*(1 - s)^2/(2*(1 - (q)^2))]), {n, 1, Infinity}] -          NSum[(B^n*(M^((1 - s)*r^n))*           Exp[(1 - r^(2*n))*(v^2)*(1 - s)^2/(2*(1 - r^2))]), {n, 1, Infinity}] ,          {r, 0.95, 0.99}],        {q, {0.95}},        {M, {0.9528}},        {K, {1.0396}},        {v,{0.0035}},        {p, {0.0035}},        {s, {2}},        {B, {0.95}},        {A, {0.96}}]      Further, I tried to zoom into the area where the 2D plot shows that a zero may exist and found that it is no longer a monotonic function (its zigzag and crosses the horizontal axis many times). What do I make of this? Does it mean that a zero exists in the complex plane?
