Lately, my installation of Mathematica has decided not to highlight any symbols loaded from packages. The picture below is a good representation of this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/AJEEY.png) where after loading both `PhysicalConstants`` and `Units`` `BohrRadius`, `Meter`, and `Angstrom` should all be black. Yet, they retain their "unknown symbol" color. This occurs for all packages and is persistent across restarting the front-end and rebooting the entire system. Any suggestions for correcting this? I am running the student version of 8.0.4 on MacOS 10.6.8.
