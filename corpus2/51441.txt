I type into mathematica:               Solve[2 Sin[(Sqrt[3] x - 3 y)/2] == 2 Sin[(Sqrt[3] x + 3 y)/2], {x, y}]      expecting it to return a list of pairs of solutions of the form               {{x->x1,y->y1},{x->x2,y->y2},{x->x3,y->y3},etc...}      as per the documentation. But instead it gives me ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ymBEJ.png) which is not quite what I was expecting. How can I get this function to return a list of the pairs of solutions. I'm confused. Thanks!
