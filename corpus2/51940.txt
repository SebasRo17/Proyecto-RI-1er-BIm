Suppose I have a list of data I can ListPlot:               { {x1,y1}, ... }      , and a list of y-errorbars:               {erry1, erry2, ... }      Is there a nice, high level way to make it into a list for ErrorListPlot:               { {{x1,y1}, ErrorBar[erry1]}, ... }      It of course easy to do it through iteration in Table, however I keep reading about, how it is not the right way in Mathematica to use iterations (at least over lists).
