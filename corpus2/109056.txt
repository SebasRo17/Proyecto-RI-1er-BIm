What are some strategies that could be used to automate the creation of unit test cases? What aspects would you need to look at in each class to be able to generate at least a decent test case skeleton? I realize a comprehensive automatic solution isn't practical, but I'd like to speed up the test creation a little at least by creating a skeleton. I'm not looking for code examples, just perhaps some suggestions for where to start or examples of where something like this has been done so that I can see how they approached it and what might be possible. I'm particularly interested in methods for creating unit test skeletons in PHP, which doesn't provide all of the tools that other languages afford, like complete type hinting, for example.
