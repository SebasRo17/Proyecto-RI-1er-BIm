I am trying to use Java's Robot class to type. This is what I have done so far.               Needs["JLink`"];     InstallJava[];     robot = JavaNew["java.awt.Robot"]      The mouseMove command for the robot works fine, but when I try               robot@keyPress["KeyEvent.VK_Y"]      I am given this error:               Java::argx1: Method named keyPress defined in class java.awt.Robot was called with an incorrect number or type of arguments. The argument was KeyEvent.VK_Y.      Calling the function for a robot object using this parameter works fine in a Java IDE, but I can not get it to work in Mathematica. What am I doing wrong?
