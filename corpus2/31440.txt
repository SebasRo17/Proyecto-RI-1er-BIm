I use the expression               N[(x - Sqrt[2] + Sqrt[3]*I + 10^-20*(1 + I))^50*(x - Sqrt[2] +           Sqrt[3]*I)^25*(x - Sqrt[2] + Sqrt[3]*I +           2*10^-20*(1 + I))^13*(x - Sqrt[2] + Sqrt[3]*I +           3*10^-20*(1 + I))^12, 5000]      to gernerate a highly ill-conditioned polynomial. Then I use               N[Expand[%, x], 5000]      to expand it. Finally, I want to use               NSolve[%, x, 50]      to solve it. However. the kernel breaks down after running thirty minutes or so, without indicating that it is out of memory. Is this a _Mathematica_ bug? Are there any bugs in the Jenkins Traub method? Or are there bugs in _Mathematica_ 's precision control?
