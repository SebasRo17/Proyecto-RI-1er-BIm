I find that the `Export` of `Manipuate` contains backforward play, see a simplified example:               Export["try.swf",       Manipulate[       Plot[Sin[2 x + φ], {x, 0, 10}], {φ, 0, 2 π}]]      You can see the problem in the SWF file. (I'm sorry that the exported SWF file cannot be uploaded here) Actually, I have two questions here,   1. Is there any simple way to get a animation with **only forward** play? I can find nothing about this in the help documents.   2. Why is GIF not working in `Export`? That is to say, if I use `Export["try.gif", Manipulate[...]]`,the exported file, otherwise an animation, is only a static picture actually.
