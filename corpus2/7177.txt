The normal way I reset the Mathematica kernel to its initial state is through the notebook interface: `Evaluation` menu, `Quit Kernel` item, `Local` submenu, then the `Quit` confirmer button in the resulting dialog box. I do this often enough that my fingers know the drumbeat: `Alt-V Q L Q`. But I really need a way to set things back to normal from code. I suppose I could go               ClearAll /@ Names["Global`*"]      or even               Remove /@ Names["Global`*"]      which does much of what I want, but seems really ham-handed to me, and doesn't really guarantee a complete system reset -- at least I don't think. There is also the ancient `CleanSlate` utility, which I can call from inside a notebook or package, but I have heard rumors that it's deprecated and unsupported: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zfUgV.png) My attempts to search the documentation and ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PchYh.png) for something resembling `Reset` or `Restart` or `Clean` yielded nothing useful. Advice? **EDIT** : In case you're wondering, I want this for unit-testing big Packages, where I want to Reset in the unit-testing scripts so that I can have deterministic values for results of certain `Unique[]` evaluations. **EDIT** : I found `Quit[]` and `Exit[]`. That may be as close as we can get. I do not see any difference in them ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ng4i2.png)
