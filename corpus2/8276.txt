I need expected values of a list where the random variable to take expectations over should be an input into expressions defined earlier. I suspect Set[] and SetDelayed[] tripped me. (Or Map and Table?) I hope the intention is reasonably clear from the code: I am interested in expressions of six numbers in [0,1] where I suspect (model) that they have been measured with error (errors being independent and uniform here, but answers truncated to lie in the meaningful range anyway). I don't get the solution I expect, only an expression substituted into. Input:               AList = {a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6}     answers := (Min[1,Max[# ,0]])& /@ (AList+errors)     dlist ={answers[[5]],answers[[6]],answers[[3]]/answers[[1]],answers[[4]]/answers[[2]]}      deltasbetas = Expectation[dlist,errors\[Distributed]Table[UniformDistribution[],{6}]]      (note that errors are defined within Expectation, as I think it should be) Output:               {Min[1,Max[0,0.8 +UniformDistribution[{0,1}]]],Min[1,Max[0,0.7 +UniformDistribution[{0,1}]]],Min[1,Max[0,0.5 +UniformDistribution[{0,1}]]]/Min[1,Max[0,0.8 +UniformDistribution[{0,1}]]],Min[1,Max[0,0.4 +UniformDistribution[{0,1}]]]/Min[1,Max[0,0.7 +UniformDistribution[{0,1}]]]}
