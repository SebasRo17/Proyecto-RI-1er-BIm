I have a class that I'm testing. The class has a function: `apply(List<IRule> rules, List<ITarget> targets);` In one test I want to ensure that each target has been passed to one rule, a la:               rule1.AssertWasCalled(fnord => fnord.Test(target1));     rule1.AssertWasCalled(fnord => fnord.Test(target2));     rule1.AssertWasCalled(fnord => fnord.Test(target3));      It seems to me that limiting myself to a single assertion statement would be quite the hobgoblin. Am I correct in this assumption, or is there some other way that I could assert that each target had, in fact, been tested?
