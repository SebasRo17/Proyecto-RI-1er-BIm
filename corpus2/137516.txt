We have a series of hardware and we have decided on a common API to be given to the customer for use. The customer will use this API in order to program the hardware. The API includes functions for establishing a connection with the h/w like X_Open,X_Close,X_SetConfig, X_GetConfig, no of hardware connected, error handling with the corresponding structs to be filled by the API or the customer. The hardware will ofcourse be validated independently also. What strategies can I use to validate this API ? We want to test this API i.e it works as expected for instance we are actually able to setConfig in the h/w or get no of devices on the bus or if the API function X_Open is called , the function is able to establish a connection to the hardware as expected or say API function X_GetNoDevices returns no. of present devices on the bus. We want to validate that all API functions work as described to the customer
