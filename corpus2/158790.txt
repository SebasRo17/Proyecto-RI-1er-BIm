I have just started using a NoSQL document based database (MongoDB) and i'm curious about the best practices for designing databases. I presume the architecture should be different from relational databases? Should I still aim for a normalized database? For example I have a particular use case; > I have a user with a rental history (array of addresses) should that array > be an array on the user or as a separate collection with a shared key?
