I am trying to show how a vector `M` varies over time. I have the following code:               Mx={4.74124,13.1038,33.0248,19.7323,24.5952,30.1253,27.9521,29.4089,28.0574,29.277};     My={-18.2975,-7.42215,-4.23518,-9.88457,-8.96098,-8.22531,-9.6019,-9.18352,-9.06551,-9.29939};     Mz={-0.12887,-7.57926,-1.4561,-1.59703,-4.53247,-2.09772,-2.91711,-3.56798,-2.6221,-3.48453};          Animate[          Graphics3D[{     Blue,Arrow[Tube[{{0,0,0},{Mx[[i]],My[[i]],Mz[[i]]}}]]     },Axes->True,AxesLabel->{"x","y","z"},Axes],          {i,1,Length[Mx],1}]      (In actuality, my lists `Mx`, `My`, and `Mz` are much longer, but the shorter lists above reproduce the error behavior.) I get the following error: > An improperly formatted option was encountered while reading a > Graphics3DBox. The option was not in the form of a rule. Do you know how I can fix this? I do not understand which option "was not in the form of a rule."
