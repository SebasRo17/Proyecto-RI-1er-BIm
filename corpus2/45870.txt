What is the syntax for connecting to a specific instance of a sql server database? Here's my code:               Needs["DatabaseLink`"];     conn1 = OpenSQLConnection[       JDBC["Microsoft SQL Server(jTDS)", "ARC-WEB/SKWSPATIAL"],        "UserName" -> "Mathematica", databasename = "XYZ_Database",        "Password" -> "xxxxx"]      I have no problem connecting to ARC-WEB but cannot connect to one of the other instances.
