I would like to determine the distance bewteen two representations of the Lorenz Attractor. I have two 3D representations for different initial conditions and I want to calculate the distance between those curves. The problem is that I have written this for the first and the second and there are only `x0`, `yo` and `z0` that are different.               NDSolve[{x'[t] == -10 (x[t] - y[t]),        y'[t] == -x[t] z[t] + 28 x[t] - y[t], z'[t] == x[t] y[t] - 8/3*z[t],       x[0] == y[0] == 1, z[0] == 2}, {x, y, z}, {t, 0, 200},        MaxSteps -> Infinity]     ParametricPlot3D[Evaluate[{x[t], y[t], z[t]} /. %], {t, 0, 200},        PlotPoints -> 10000, ColorFunction -> (ColorData["Rainbow"][#4] &)]      I can't use the `EuclideanDistance` since I don't have the expression of the curves and I'm blocked. I would like to draw the difference between `Sqrt(x^2+y^2+z^2)` of the 2 curves. Thanks !
