If I work for a company and write code for them but I choose to buy a tool for myself and use it to write code for the company, do I need a commercial or personal license? Specifically, in this case, I am asking about WebStorm IDE JetBrains have Commercial (For companies and organizations) and Personal (For individual developers). I am an individual developer working for a company!
