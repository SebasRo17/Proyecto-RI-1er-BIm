Lets say you're a web developer/programmer and you want to set up a personal portfolio site. Unfortunately, like most people with a full time job and a family, your time is hard to come by. You make the choice to, instead of building your own site from scratch, implement something like WordPress or Drupal. What effect (if any) might this have on people's (potential employers/fellow developers) perception of you as a developer?
