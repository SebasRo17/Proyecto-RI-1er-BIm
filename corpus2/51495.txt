I have this Manipulate:               Manipulate[Plot[Sin[a x], {x, 0, 2 Pi}], {a, 0, 3}]      ![Sin\[a x\]](http://i.stack.imgur.com/D3IgV.png) Now, I realize I had mistyped the expression and it's actually `x^2` instead. I go back and fix it, but when I evaluate the cell again, the value of `a` reverts to default/zero. ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/X8LE8.png) I've tried multiple things from various Q&A: adding `SaveDefinitions -> True`, saving parameter to a global variable within the `Manipulate` block, using bookmarks, but none of them achieved the effect of having the `Manipulate` start up with a previously-set control value. Interesting, I find that saving the parameter to a global variable, and then initialize the parameter with the same global variable solves the problem, i.e., `Manipulate` can remember the manipulated parameter from a previous run. If I add the option `SaveDefinitions -> True`, the value is also saved between sessions. Below is an example: `a` remains at the same value even when the expression in `Manipulate` was changed and the cell was evaluated. ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Dvuv3.png) ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/yKNMJ.png) I went to the chat room to ask people if doing this is OK. I was told that I should not do this. What kind of potential issues would I have with this method? And if it's bad, is there another method to achieve the same result, i.e., preventing `Manipulate` from resetting control values after each evaluation?
