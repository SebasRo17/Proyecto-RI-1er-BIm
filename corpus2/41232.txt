I want to sell software online and I need an easy to implement payment processing system. What I'm actually going to be selling is an activation code (one per purchase) that would activate the trial version of a product. I was about to use this one but I just found out that people without a paid email account (not hotmail or yahoo) can't process their orders, which I'm sure would discourage many, if not most, of the possible buyers.
