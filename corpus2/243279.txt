I want to create an application and maybe upload it to the play store but I am not sure if that what my app does is legal or not. I am downloading a page's source from a website to get some information I need. For example if I download a page about the song "Ramble On" by Led Zeppelin and parse this page source to get the song's name, maybe a link to an image and the lyrics. Would that be illegal or can I display these information to my users without getting any problem? Also the website says it's an "open 'wiki-style' [...].It's completely user built by people like you and used every day by fans and developers alike."
