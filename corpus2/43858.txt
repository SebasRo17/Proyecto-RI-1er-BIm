I have to analyze the complex regions of variable c which is define obtained with `InverseLaplace` help in the form               Re[c] + Im[c] == -10 s^2 - (1/(2 Pi)     NIntegrate[1/Q[k, s], {k, -∞, ∞}])^-1;          Q[k_, s_] := 5 k^4 - 3 (-k 2 + s)^2;      I applied the `RootLocusPlot` on this polynomial, but I am not sure what I got. Is this complex plane of `c` variable? I need to see what will happen with `c` when `s` goes to $∞$ or $0$, but in my figure I can not understand that? Is there another command to plot diagram depends on complex solutions?               RootLocusPlot[       TransferFunctionModel[Unevaluated[{{-10 s^2 - 5 k^4 - 3 (-k 2 + s)^2}}],                              s, SamplingPeriod ->None, SystemsModelLabels -> None],        {k, 0, 0.8}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9Rd5J.png)
