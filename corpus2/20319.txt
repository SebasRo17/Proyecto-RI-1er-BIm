Given the following `List`               lis =     {       {1, 2, 3}, {3, 2, 3}, {{3, 7, 5}, {7, 5, 3}, {6, 2, 1}}, {3, 2, 7},        {{3, 3, 5}, {7, 7, 8}, {9, 4, 2}, {9, 0, 0}}, {8, 5, 4}, {7, 4, 3}     }      I would like to get this `List`:               {       {1, 2, 3}, {3, 2, 3}, {3, 7, 5}, {7, 5, 3}, {6, 2, 1}, {3, 2, 7},        {3, 3, 5}, {7, 7, 8}, {9, 4, 2}, {9, 0, 0}, {8, 5, 4}, {7, 4, 3}     }.      `Flatten` is not doing it for me. Note that the actual List is huge and the List of Lists contained in this list can have variable lengths as in the example above one contains 3 inner list the other contains 4.
