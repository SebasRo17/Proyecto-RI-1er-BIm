I'm implementing a hashtable structure for a dictionary. Dictionary is in a text file. There are 2 words on each line. I'm generating the hashtable by using the first word as a key. I'm holding the hashtable on a list. I want to save the hashtable to a text file to use it every time. What kind of structure should I use? Is there a way to do this without reading the whole hashtable from text file?
