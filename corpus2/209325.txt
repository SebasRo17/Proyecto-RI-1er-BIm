I have developed a web site with a mysql backend, but am not satisfied with how I am getting one set of data and do not know how to get another dataset. The page in question is at: http://whistclub.org/test/ajax.php?vichill/results/1 The results are shown through October so there is some data to use. I am pulling the results from two mysql tables (see below), but the code I have used is too ugly for me to tolerate. Yeah, it works, but I have some standards! Think calls to the database for each team. I think joins should be used, but I can't get it to work.   Ideally (I think) the result array would convert the teamIDs to team names and use names for the winner and loser VP columns. The standings table on the page is not working at all--what you see is hand coded just to show what is needed. The tables are:               teams:          id--autoincremented     teamID--Asssigned to each team as part of the game     teamName          games:          id--autoincremented     gameID--I suspect this is not needed since it duplicates id.     teamA     teamB      date     winner     IMPmargin     winnersVPs     losersVPS      The game is bridge and IMP and VP are scores. VPs are derived from IMPs and the loser often gets a few VPs. See the webpage for the details, but I do not think that is relevant to my issue. Here is some data from the games table:               id  gameID  teamA  teamB  date        winner  IMPmargin  winnersVPs  losersVPs     1   1       11     18     2013-09-25  18      12         20          10     2   2       12     17     2013-09-25  12      22         22          8     3   3       13     16     2013-09-25  13      20         21          9     4   4       14     15     2013-09-25  14      0          15          15     5   5       19     99     2013-09-25  NULL    NULL       NULL        NULL      Team 99 is a dummy for a bye week for a team. If the tables are designed too badly, let me know how to make them work better. Hopefully, that is enough for someone to point me in the right direction.
