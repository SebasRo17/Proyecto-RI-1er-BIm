I'm new to Mathemtica and I'm trying to calculate Discrete Cosine Transformation FDCT. I found the FourierDCT built-in function, but not DCT, so I need to implement it. I have tried couple of ideas but no luck yet. Any ideas that can get me started will be really appreciated. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/oGSwG.png) Edit 1 **_*_ ** _*_ ** _*_ ** _*_ ** _*_ ** _*_ ** _*_ ** _*_ ** _*_ ** _*_ **** This is the result of FourierDCT on the same Matrix from the Wikipedia link above, and the values are different. I need Forward Discrete Cosine Trasnformation, not the FourierDCT: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pCkUu.png) From Wikipedia: "A DCT is **similar** to a Fourier transform in the sense that it produces a kind of spatial frequency spectrum." Edit 2 **_*_ ** _*_ ** _*_ ** _*_ ** _*_ ** _*_ ** _*_ ** _*_ ** _*_ ** _*_ **** This is the matrix I'm using as input in Mathemtica: b = {{52, 55, 61, 66, 70, 61, 64, 73}, {63, 59, 55, 90, 109, 85, 69, 72}, {62, 59, 68, 113, 144, 104, 66, 73}, {63, 58, 71, 122, 154, 106, 70, 69}, {67, 61, 68, 104, 126, 88, 68, 70}, {79, 65, 60, 70, 77, 68, 58, 75}, {85, 71, 64, 59, 55, 61, 65, 83}, {87, 79, 69, 68, 65, 76, 78, 94} }
