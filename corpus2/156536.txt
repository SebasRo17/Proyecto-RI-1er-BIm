As a long time PHP developer, I am now starting to explore the Python world. I have narrowed the choice of framework down to Django and Pyramid, probably no big surprise there. I have played a bit both both frameworks. I really like Djangos admin, and the fact that everything is already integrated. My concern with Django, however, is that it appears more difficult to break out of doing things the way that they want you to. For a large complex site, that could be problematic down the road. Is this a valid concern? What really caught my eye is that the community for Django seems MUCH larger. Let alone the massive number of docs and tutorials for Django (couldnt fine much for Pyramid outside the official docs?). Of biggest concern is the sheer number of apps that have been built specifically for Django: south, tastypie, multi-tenancy, registration, etc. Am I right to assume that these apps are (mostly?) Django specific, and that they cant be used in Pyramid? Where are the Pyramid specific apps? Or, will they interoperate just fine?
