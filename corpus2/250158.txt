I often question myself of where to put the logic that organize the data to a view that is not necessarily a business logic in a 3-layered architecture (DAO, Business, View). I'll put an example to be clearer: I have a UI in my aplication that shows pending tickets and answered tickets in two different tabs. To get the data from the database, I make a single query. Since there is no business logic, I'm returning the whole list to the Controller (View) and separating it in two lists to pass to the view template. Should I be separating this in the business layer? Or is it correct to separate in the controller, since the logic is attached to that single UI?
