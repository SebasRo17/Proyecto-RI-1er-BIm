I have a large $100 \times 4000$ element matrix composed of integer elements, `testMatrix`, and I was to use `Position` to find the indices of integers larger than some threshold value `thresholdValue`. The following works:               Position[testMatrix, x_ /; x >= thresholdValue, 2]      However it takes over $\approx 150$ milliseconds to execute. Given that the number of positions is typically around $10^3$, is there a way to achieve a significant speedup for this procedure?
