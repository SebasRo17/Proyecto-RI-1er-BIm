So I just got laid off from a company after 2 years, no fault of my own. It was a large, rather well known company that had been doing cuts for the entire year (almost 75% of our department was cut). I made it until the very end before they finally did a final budget cut. I realize this is probably skimming Career advice but I'm more concerned on the actual development side when looking for a job. When I'm looking for something, should I consider my 2 years as real experience? Or since it's so short, should I be looking like I just graduated college (since this was my first "real" job after college).
