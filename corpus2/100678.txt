I'm currently working on one part of a technical data heavy project. The project manager in charge of this project is what one might term "An Old- School Project Manager" in that he has absolutely no knowledge of the application domain or anything remotely technical whatsoever - in his own words "What he does is Delivers." As well as designing the technical specifications and developing the code to those specifications, my role is also quite client facing, so I need to interact with the people who will be consuming the data to help to get it in shape for when it is all finally deployed; most of the tasks that these clients are being asked to do is way beyond their job description and I think it is important to be respectful of that and realise any help that they give us is based on goodwill. The PM is an absolute control freak who rubs everyone he ever deals with completely up the wrong way. All emails must go through him (maybe he will forward them on, maybe he will let you know if there has been a reply), and all emails must be written in a language that he understands (he doesn't know what a database is, or the difference between a schema and data so...). He almost never reads anything he's sent, what he does read he sends back asking for it to be "more high level", and he never knows what he is asking for, he just starts rambling about "this must be simple right, this is how it is, no?" - not that he admits this, he just says that he needs me to make what I've said "more high level". I'm struggling to work out what he actually does all day except of course for Delivering and acting as postmaster. How do you work with a manager who has this kind of personality?
