It seems like most of the Scrum articles and books that I've read as well as the lectures I've heard have very little to say about the process of creating the items on the backlog. How should a team on a medium or large project (i.e. more than a few team members) go about creating and detailing the items on the backlog? When and how should the ideation and story writing occur? Who should be involved and when? When should team members (other than the product owner, of course) join the process? How much of the team is needed? Note that I am not asking about how a small group would create a user story or other backlog item from ideas. I'm asking more about when and how this ideation and story writing should occur and who should be involved. How can we be more Agile in the ideating/story writing stages?
