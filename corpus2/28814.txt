Using an older version of _Mathematica_ , I was used to the system automatically beginning each notebook line with `In[1]:=`. All I did was enter the expression and press enter on the keyboard to evaluate the expression. Now however, using the default _Mathematica_ Input (v.9), there is no initial `In[1]:=`. I enter the expression and press enter, and then the `In[1]:=` appears, followed by the value of the expression or the symbolic output. I would prefer to have each new line begin with a numbered `In[]:=`, I would like to know if it is possible to get back the old behavior that I was familiar with? If so, what preferences do I need to set?
