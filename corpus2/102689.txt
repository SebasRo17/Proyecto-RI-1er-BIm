One of the things I struggle with is not using Hungarian notation. I _don't_ want to have to go to the variable definition just to see what type it is. When a project gets extensive, it's nice to be able to look at a variable prefixed by 'bool' and know that it's looking for **true/false** instead of a **0/1** value. I also do a lot of work in SQL Server. I prefix my stored procedures with 'sp' and my tables with 'tbl', not to mention all of my variables in the database respectively. I see everywhere that nobody really wants to use Hungarian notation, to the point where they avoid it. My question is, what is the benefit of _not_ using Hungarian notation, and why does the majority of developers avoid it like the plague?
