I have a very simple program in Ruby that opens a dictionary file, `sorted- words.txt` and prints out all the words in pig-latin. I tested its speed, and the first time I ran it, the program finished in about **1.6 seconds**. The second time I ran the program, it took about **2.1 seconds**. Between the two runs, there was maybe about a 10 second wait, me looking at the results and running the program again. I waited a minute, ran it again, and it ran in **1.8 seconds**. Although the variation is slight, it is still there. Why is there this variation?
