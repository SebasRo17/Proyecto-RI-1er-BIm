I am wanting to run about 15 pages of initialization cells in a CDF, but can't seem to do so. I have set the InitializationCellEvaluation to True and InitializationCellWarning to False, but it doesn't work in the CDF. (works just fine in the .nb) I saw something about the NotebookDynamicExpression, but I wasn't sure how to run a ton of code through it. Are there any alternatives? I use no Manipulate or Dynamic functions in my code either. For example...               GenerateDisplayShotsFor :=        Quiet[Button[         Style["GENERATE", Bold, FontFamily -> "Terminal", 20,           Background -> LightBlue],          CreateWindow[          DocumentNotebook[DisplayShotsFor, WindowTitle -> "Shots For",            WindowFrame -> "ModelessDialog",            Background -> RGBColor[48/240, 164/240, 220/240],            Editable -> False, TextAlignment -> Center ,            WindowFloating -> False,            WindowMargins -> {{0, Automatic}, {Automatic, 0}}]]]];
