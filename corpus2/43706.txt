I am trying to build an IS/LM model with sliders for a few things including the slope of the IS curve. I am stuck getting the equilibrium ticks and dashed lines to properly follow the intersection of the two lines when the slope is changed. I have tried incorporating my variable `i` in as many ways as I can think of into the ticks and dashed lines, but continually come up short. I am a newbie at _Mathematica_ and the code is confusing the hell out of me and making the basic math more confusing for me. Help!               Manipulate[       Show[         Plot[Tooltip[s + .8 *q, "LM"], {q, 0, 150},            AxesOrigin -> {0, 0}, PlotStyle -> {Thick, Blue},            AxesLabel -> {"GDP", "Interest Rate"},            PlotRange -> {{0, 100}, {0, 100}}, PlotLabel -> IS LM,            Ticks -> {{{0.77*d - (0.77*s), "GDP"}}, {{d - i*(0.77*d - (0.77*s)), "r"}}},            BaseStyle -> {FontWeight -> "Bold", FontSize -> 12}],          Plot[Tooltip[d - i*q, "IS"], {q, 0, 200},            AxesOrigin -> {0, 0}, PlotStyle -> {Thick, Green}],          Graphics[{Dashed,            Line[{{0.77*d - (0.77*s), 0},                  {0.77*d - (0.77*s), d - i (0.77*d - 0.5 (0.77*s))}}]}],          Graphics[{Dashed,            Line[{{0, d - i (0.77*d - (0.77*s))},                  {0.77*d - (0.77*s), d - i (0.77*d - (0.77*s))}}]}]],        {{d, 75, "Fiscal Policy"}, 50, 100, 2},       {{s, 0, "Monetary Policy"}, 0, 100, 2},        {{i, .5, "Interest Sensitivity"}, 0, 5, .1}]
