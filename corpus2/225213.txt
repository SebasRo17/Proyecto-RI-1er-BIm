I work for a company that is moving heavily into mobile. We find the majority of our customers use our mobile app pretty regularly. We have tons of things we want to add to it -- as well as to deliver all these new features on Andriod- and iOS-native apps. But I wonder how big we could possible make a mobile development team without making it too big to be practical. Can we have a mobile team that's 5 people? 10? 50? 100? If it made sense for us to build that many new features, from an Engineering standpoint is it practical? Or is there some limit of the amount of Engineers that could support a single app (across multiple platforms)?
