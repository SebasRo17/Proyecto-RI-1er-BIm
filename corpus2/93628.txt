As a software development contractor I've worked on many projects with differing standards and conventions. Quite often these conventions go against the software best practices we know and 'love'. The question is, when you're working on an established project with specific ways of doing things that you know aren't the best ways, do you break the conventions of the project because you know its a better way of doing something, or do you stick to convention meaning that your work will blend into the existing code base? After all, you need to keep in mind someone else is going to stumble across your work one day and if its not consistent with the rest of the project they will have to take the time to work out what you've done differently. So, project convention consistency or best practices?
