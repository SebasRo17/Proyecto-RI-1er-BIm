# Symbolic solution(s) to Heat equation? **or more generally,(eventually) Green functions to known PDEs** I am interested in variations of the heat equation: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/z9UMw.png) or more generally ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Yp5IY.png) or even more generally (`r` a vector and `Δ(r)` a tensor) ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/15BI6.png) I understand that Mathematica cannot provide a symbolic solution:               DSolve[{eqn =         D[p[x, t], t] == Δ D[p[x, t], x, x],        p[x, 0] == g[x]}, p, {x, t}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SEDqF.png) > What I do not understand is why not? Indeed I can define a possible solution (wikipedia) as               sol = p -> Function[{x, t}, Exp[-x^2/4/t/Δ]/Sqrt[4 Pi Δ t]];      and check that it satisfies the PDE               eqn /. sol // FullSimplify          (* ==> True *)      I can even build a larger class of solution which satisfy the boundary at t=0               sol2 = p -> Function[{x, t},        Integrate[ g[y] Exp[-(x - y)^2/4/t/Δ]/Sqrt[4 Pi Δ t], {y, -Infinity, Infinity}]];      Which seems to satisfy the PDE as well, (though I don't really understand why it fails to conclude it does!)               eqn2 = eqn /. sol2 // FullSimplify      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/I9ekW.png) Indeed we can check by taking the limit at t-> 0 which would replace the Gaussian by a Dirac:               p[x, t] /. sol2 /. Exp[-(x - y)^2/4/t/Δ] -> DiracDelta[x - y] Sqrt[4 Pi Δ t]          (* ==> g(x) *)      **Question** Could you please explain to me why no attempt is being made (by WRI or by us) along these lines? I understand that my particular solution corresponds to a specific boundary condition, and that it might be difficult to cover all cases, but it remains surprising that this class of PDE is ignored by mathematica (e.g. those known solutions)? May be as a community we could build up a package which addresses this issue? I truly would like to know if (i) is there indeed no general solution (ii) there is something fundamentally wrong in collecting tools providing useful (if not fully general) classes of solutions. (iii) is there something I miss which would prevent success? > Eventually, it would be great to have a Mathematica function which say would > act as a lookup table and work as follow: GreenFunction[PDE,BCs] would > return the corresponding Green function if it is known in the literature.
