When I tried to present some pre-calculated density histograms inside Manipulate I noticed that the display of `DensityHistogram` is extremely slow. Here is a simple benchmark:               Second[x_] := x[[2]];     data = RandomVariate[BinormalDistribution[Abs@Random[]], {5, 10^4}];     histograms =        DensityHistogram[#, 30, PerformanceGoal -> "Speed"] & /@         data;     contourplots =        ListContourPlot[Second@HistogramList[#, 30],           InterpolationOrder -> 0] & /@ data;     rasterizedSmall = Rasterize[#, ImageSize -> Small] & /@ histograms;     rasterizedMedium = Rasterize[#, ImageSize -> Medium] & /@ histograms;          t = AbsoluteTime[];     histograms     AbsoluteTime[] - t     (* ==> 1.6410939 *)              t = AbsoluteTime[];     contourplots     AbsoluteTime[] - t     (* ==> 0.0860049 *)          t = AbsoluteTime[];     rasterizedSmall     AbsoluteTime[] - t     (* ==> 0.0390022 *)              t = AbsoluteTime[];     rasterizedMedium     AbsoluteTime[] - t     (* ==> 0.0280016 *)          So we see that it takes almost two seconds to display five pre-calculated density histograms, while five list contour plots are displayed in ~100 ms. **What is wrong and is there an easy way to fix it?** (I'm using mma 8.0.1 on Win 7 and I've already turned off antialising)
