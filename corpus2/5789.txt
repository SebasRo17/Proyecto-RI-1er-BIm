I am currently working solo on a project that consists of package files, munit tests, notebooks and .xls files. I use Wolfram Workbench as an IDE. I want to collaborate with others on this project. Ideally I would like to do this as I am used to do with Java: dump everything in cvs ( any system will do ) on the net and then check/out, check/in with one person as a repository admin. **Question: How should I do this with a Mathematica project? Do I need Workbench plugins? What are the particular pitfalls, if any?**
