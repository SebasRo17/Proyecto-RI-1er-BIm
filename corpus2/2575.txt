How often are the unfortunate stereotypes associated with older techies true? When people get settled into a career--Do people lose their passion to learn new things? Do people get comfortable and stuck with one skillset and incapable of change? **How common is this?** I don't mean to be offensive with this question. I know many skilled older programmers. But you do sometimes see a "failure mode" when people get too comfortable in their jobs, skills, and lifestyle--too much so that they get irritated at the thought of having to learn something new. I see this and I'm deathly afraid of it happening to me. I want to emphasize I think there is also a "failure mode" for youth -- not really having the experience to know how to get a project done. The "youth" failure mode may be worse then the one I'm describing. I think the best teams have both junior and senior members. Am I just rehashing old, wrong stereotypes? Is there something to guard against when one gets settled into a career? Or am I just another ageist young programmer keeping the old-(wo)man down?
