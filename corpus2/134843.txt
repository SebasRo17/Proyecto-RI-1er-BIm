I want to write an ASP.NET 4.0 application with IBM DB2 Express-C as its back- end. One thing that worries me, is hosting this application on a remote server. I don't know any hosting provider who provides ASP.NET DB2 hosting in the same price range as of SQL Server. I also want to allow the customer to select the database of their choice from this list:   1. SQL Sever   2. Oracle   3. DB2   4. PostgreSQL   5. Firebird There are the same hosting worries with Oracle and Firebird. Hosting issues aside, I want to know how to design an application so it is agnostic to the kind of RDBMS used and will work with any of the above mentioned ones. Are there any such applications around?
