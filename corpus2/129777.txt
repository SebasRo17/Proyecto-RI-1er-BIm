In order to get experience as a team lead, I was recently given the task of supervising a programmer. What I found out is that he is having a problem in writing a simple `if` condition. He has issues with `string`. And he doesn't know how to pass a variable in the `addClass` function of jQuery with an `if` condition. And he doesn't know when to use a `for` loop. Or even what a `for` loop is used for. **How to make him understand these basic concepts quickly?** I told him to Google for how to use `if` condition for `addClass` variable. But he didn't find it, then I told him to do it quickly in the early morning, when discussing he was giving reasons that it is what that, then I told him I show you how to do that, then he told me, you should have done it before. **What should I reply to him?** He is telling me that you should tell me everything or **Should I do it and show him every time?** It may take lot of time, and every time I have to do a task. I want him to be independent.
