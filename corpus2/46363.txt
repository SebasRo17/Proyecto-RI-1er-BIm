I have a folder that contains certain files I want to import. In my case those are .png files. As all the files I want to import contain the phrase "accum" in their filenames, I can use               SetDirectory[directory]; (*directory is string of the directory that contains the files*)     importString = "./*" <> "accum" <> "*";     files = Import[importString];      to obtain a list consisting of all the images I wanted to import. Of course this list is sorted by filename. What can I do to tell `Import` that the files should not be sorted by "name" but by other options like "date added" (which is what I want)?
