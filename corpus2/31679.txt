I have some chemical data that I am plotting using `ListLogPlot`.               data={{2776.37,2016.64,1483.51,1027.35,500.878,94.1385,310.402,282.548,            257.886,224.359,218.688,209.312,215.776,198.78},            {40.5063,24.633,12.069,8.3151,6.35135,15.0977,8.74372,15.5125,9.34959,            9.70696,11.125,12.1457,10.8075,9.7561},           {113.08,124.633,75.9698,59.5186,55.9459,7.81528,57.4372,69.5291,80.4878,            88.2784,105.563,127.935,148.571,148.78}};          ListLogPlot[data, Joined -> True]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/MCO17.png) I want to replace the x-axis tick values with the associated elements. e.g. replace 1,2,3,...,14 with               xaxis= {"La","Ce","Pr","Nd","Sm","Eu","Gd","Tb","Dy","Ho","Er","Tm","Yb","Lu"};      Any suggestions on how to achieve this? Is there another plot function that I should be using?
