My question is what is the subject area that covers web page execution/loading. I am looking to purchase a book by subject area that covers when things execute or load in a web page, whether it's straight html, html and Javascript, or a PHP page. Is that topic covered by a detailed html book, or should I expect to find information like that in a JavaScript of PHP book? I understand that PHP and Perl execute on the server and that Javascript is client side, and I know there is a lot of on-line documentation describing `<html>, <head>, <body>`, and so on. I'm just wondering what subject area a book would be in to cover all that, not a discussion of the best book or someone's favorite book, but the subject area.
