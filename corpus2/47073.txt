I'm trying to compute this function $y=\frac{1}{2}e^x+\frac{1}{12}e^{-3x}$ to get the volume of the solid of revolution when the area under the curve is revolved once around the x axis. And than get the curved surface area of the solid of revolution from the previous part. This is the equation needed to get the volume $\int \pi y^2dx$. And this is how I computed the function in Mathematica               Pi*Integrate[((1/2)*Exp[x] + (1/12)*Exp[-3x])^2, {x, 0, 1}]      What did I do wrong? Because the solution comes out without $x$ and I can't differentiate it and get the covered surface area with this equation $2\pi \int_{a}^{b}y \sqrt{1+(\frac{dy}{dx})^2}dx$
