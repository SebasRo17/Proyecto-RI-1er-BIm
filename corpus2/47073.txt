Sometimes I go for what I find interesting instead of what is considered important. Having this attitude has been educational and it has let me produce work that I'm exceptionally proud of but it has also made me miss deadlines and disappoint people. Sometimes I think that I do this because I don't want to _break_ my curiosity. I'm afraid that if I ignore it I may gradually lose it. Do you have any advice? * * * Meta: How can I make this a community wiki?
