class Vector {                public:                 Vector(int s) :elem{new double[s]}, sz{s} { }                double& operator[](int i) { return elem[i]; } //function 2                int size() { return sz; }                       private:                      doubleâˆ— elem;                       int sz;               };      Code snippet from : the c++ prog. language 4th edition , Bjarne IDE : Microsoft Visual Studio Professional 2013 My experience : Newbie , have learned a little using turbo c++ before. I noticed while typing function2 that operator is a keyword(shown in blue color) , but when whole function2 is declared , _operator_ turns white , that is it doesn't remain an keyword anymore. If i try using any other name other than "operator" , an error pops up , which says Error: array of function is not allowed It would be very helpful if someone can explain what is happening in function2, I want to know all that there is about the keyword operator , why,how and when to use this.Ofcourse from a beginner's perspective. Please refrain from overly complex answers , I am complete _newbie_ I tried searching on internet , couldn't find anything else apart from operator overloading , which is not my question.               double read_and_sum(int s) {                              Vector v(s);                     //line 1                             for (int i=0; i!=v.size(); ++i)                              cin>>v[i];                        //line 3                             double sum = 0;                              for (int i=0; i!=v.size(); ++i)                              sum+=v[i];                              return sum;                             }      Here line1 passes the argument "s" of int type needed by constructor of class vector , that's fine. But in line3 how can the statement "cin>>v[i]" be valid ? , since the object v isn't declared as an array of objects. Even if it is valid where does the value go..? Basically it is out of my knowledge , please explain line3 in simplest possible manner, and at the same time as exhaustively as possible , so that I can learn. PS: Do not tell me , that i shouldn't be learning c++ , or i shouldn't be using that IDE or anything else like that. If you can , then answer the question, I shall be very thankful.
