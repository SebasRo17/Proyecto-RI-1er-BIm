I got into a discussion with a coworker over an interview question that was asked of a potential employee. "Name some namespaces/what do they do/what namespace is involved with x". I'm of the opinion that programmers don't really need to know that kind of stuff, especially with the use of an IDE and extremely accessible documentation. He feels that a programmer with experience should be able to name namespaces. This is valid, I suppose, especially if you're looking to hire someone into a more experienced position. They don't particularly need to memorize namespaces, but anyone that has experience should be able to rattle off some namespaces and what their purpose is. What are your thoughts on this?
