I am beginner in algorithms. Last year I participated in Google Code Jam. One of the major issues I faced during the competition was my code was working fine on my test cases, but when I submitted on a large number of test cases, I failed to pass them causing some logical error. So, my question is basically how can I trace logical errors in my code in such situation where it fails to match some test cases?
