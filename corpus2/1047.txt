I asked this in chat and it turns out it would make for a good question make a posting for. I am writing up a handout type notebook and I'd like to have some clean output for presentation's sake. Say I have multiple functions I wish to evaluate in one cell. How can I force the output to a more condensed space/format such as one line? **What Is Happening** Input:               a = 1 + 1     b = 1 + 2      Output:               2          3      **What I Have Been Doing** I have been using the `List[]` command.               List[a = 1 + 1,          b = 1 + 2]      But this gives me some 'extraneous' curly braces.               {2, 3}      **What I Want** Output:               2, 3      **Other** The fix should keep the formatting of output functions (should not reduce functions to one-line input style syntax).
