I need to process all log messages from Postfix (`/var/log/mail/mail.log`), and print a summary/statistics (how many emails were sent/received and from/to which email addresses) The situation is made more complicated by the fact, that Postfix has multi- line log entries (in contrast, `Apache` for example, has single line entries and the task would have been much easier). A sample Postfix log might look something like this:               2013-12-03 14:40:45  postfix:  6F1AA10B: client=unknown[64.12.143.81]     2013-12-03 14:40:45  postfix:  6F1AA10B: message-id=<529DDF56.6050403@aol.com>     2013-12-03 14:40:45  postfix:  6F1AA10B: from=<martin.vegter@aol.com>, size=1571, nrcpt=1 (queue active)     2013-12-03 14:40:45  postfix:  6F1AA10B: to=<martin@example.com>, relay=local, delay=0.13, delays=0.13     2013-12-03 14:40:45  postfix:  6F1AA10B: removed          2013-12-03 14:52:07  postfix:  9DD9610B: client=unknown[209.85.219.65]     2013-12-03 14:52:07  postfix:  9DD9610B: message-id=<CANE3EAQUsGwj6ZBAU-awymzsG=76XZnHih@mail.gmail.com>     2013-12-03 14:52:07  postfix:  9DD9610B: from=<martin.vegter@gmail.com>, size=2388, nrcpt=1 (queue active)     2013-12-03 14:52:07  postfix:  9DD9610B: to=<martin@example.com>, orig_to=<martin@example.com>, relay=local     2013-12-03 14:52:07  postfix:  9DD9610B: removed      Every email message that was processed by Postfix has a unique message ID (in my example `6F1AA10B`). What would be the best approach to process the logs in Python? What data structure would you recommend to use for storing the entries?
