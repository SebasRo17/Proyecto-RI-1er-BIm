I have a `Mathematica` code for computing and plotting the density which corresponds to a given potential. The following code was written few years ago using version 5.2 of the `Mathematica`. Recently, I tried this code in the latest version 9 and I observed something very disturbing. Using version 5.2 it needs about 5.5 sec in order to produce the contours. On the other hand, in version 9 I have to wait about a minute (ten times longer than in 5.2!) using of course the same PC. Why this is happening? Do I have to make any modification to make it more compatible with version 9? Here is the code:               Clear["Global`*"];     Off[General::spell];          Vn = -(Mn/Sqrt[r^2 + z^2 + cn^2]);     Vd = -(Md/Sqrt[b^2 + r^2 + (a + Sqrt[h^2 + z^2])^2]);     Vh = v0^2/2*Log[r^2 + β*z^2 + ch^2];     Vt = Vn + Vd + Vh;     Vr = D[Vt, r];     Vrr = D[Vt, {r, 2}];     Vzz = D[Vt, {z, 2}];     ρ = 2.325/(4*π*100)*(Vrr + Vr/r + Vzz);     ρr = ρ /. {z -> 0};          Mn = 400; cn = 0.25;     Md = 5000; b = 6; a = 3; h = 0.2;     v0 = 20; β = 1.3; ch = 8.5;     ρ0 = ρr /. {r -> 8.5};          Print["-----------------"]     Print["ρ0 = ", ρ0]     Print["-----------------"]          S0 = ContourPlot[ρ, {r, -20, 20}, {z, -20, 20}, Contours -> 10,      PlotPoints -> 200, ImageSize -> 550]
