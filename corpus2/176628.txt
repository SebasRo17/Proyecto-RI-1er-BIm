I am building a moderation panel from scratch in a MVC approach and a lot of questions cropped up during development. I would like to hear from others how they handle these situations.   1. **Error handling** Should you handle an error inside the class method or should the method return something anyway and you handle the error in controller? What about PDO exceptions, how to handle them? For example, let's say we have a method that returns true if the user exists in a table and false if he does not exist. What do you return in the catch statement? You can't just return false because then the controller assumes that everything is alright while the truth is that something must be seriously broken. Displaying the error from the method completely breaks the whole design. Maybe a page redirect inside the method?   2. **The proper way to show a view** The controller right now looks something like this:              include('view/header.php');     if ($_GET['m']=='something') include('view/something.php');     elseif ($_GET['m']=='somethingelse') include('view/somethingelse.php');     include('view/foter.php');      Each view also checks if it was included from the index page to prevent it being accessed directly. There is a view file for each different document body. Is this way of including different views ok or is there a more proper way?   3. **Managing user rights** Each user has his own rights, what he can see and what he can do. Which part of the system should verify that user has the permission to see the view, controller or view itself? Right now I do permission checks directly in the view because each view can contain several forms that require different permissions and I would need to make a seperate file for each of them if it was put in the controller. I also have to re-check for the permissions everytime a form is submitted because form data can be easily forged. The truth is, all this permission checking and validating the inputs just turns the controller into a huge if/then/else cluster. I feel like 90% of the time I am doing error checks/permissions/validations and very little of the actual logic. Is this normal even for popular frameworks?
