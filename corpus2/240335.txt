As a developer I am fan of static methods. Recently I come across difference between OOP languages about this static methods. All OOP language use static method to access any method without creating instance of than class. So we can call this kind of method with just class name. But some language allow to access static method from instance variable also like Java and some don't like Objective - C. So what is the reason of this kind of difference between two OOP language? Which is correct OOP behaviour? I am just curious to know this.
