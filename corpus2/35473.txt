Suppose we have an array of color data               colorArray = ParallelTable[With[{v = RandomReal[]},     Append[List @@ ColorData["LightTemperatureMap"][v], If[v >= .8, .5, 0]]     ], {z, 0, .1, .005}, {y, 0, 1, .1}, {x, 0, 10, 2}];      And we use `Image3D` to visualize them               is = 350;     Image3D[     colorArray, "Real", ColorSpace -> "RGB",     ViewPoint -> {1.3, -2.4, 2}, SphericalRegion -> True,     Boxed -> True, BoxRatios -> {1, 1, 1},     Axes -> True, AxesLabel -> {"X", "Y", "Z"},     ImageSize -> is, ImageResolution -> 3*is]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SnTbx.png) The problem is that the ticks are the relative position of each `RGBColor` element in the array, not the actual range of `x`, `y`, and `z` (`{z, 0, .1, .005}, {y, 0, 1, .1}, {x, 0, 10, 2}`). My question is how can we change the ticks to show the actual range of `x`, `y`, and `z`? A direct implement seems impossible because in `colorArray` no data about the original `x`, `y`, and `z` values are stored (actually we cannot store them in `colorArray` due to the requirement of `Image3D`).
