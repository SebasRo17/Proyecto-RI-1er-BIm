I saw someone suggesting .NET Reactor once as a good obfuscator. I went to their website to check it out and saw they have a product called IntelliLock which is advertised as a pretty robust licensing system which has code protection/obfuscation built in. With that said, I tried to contact them and ask them a few questions regarding the product, but have not had any response. This is kind of a red flag for me. However, it seems like there is some user base for this product whom are satisfied. What .NET licensing system(s) with .NET code protection/obfuscation are you using? What are its pros & cons that you have encountered? Are there things I should be looking for or looking to avoid when evaluating these systems?
