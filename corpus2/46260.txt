I have a progress indicator in my _Mathematica_ notebook that I update as various calculations are performed:               indicator = ProgressIndicator[Dynamic[progress]];      I would like to figure out how to remove the indicator when the calculations are complete or in the case above when               progress == 1      I’ve looked through the documentation and can’t seem to find a good way to do this.
