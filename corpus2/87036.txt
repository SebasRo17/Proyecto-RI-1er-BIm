I was looking over at http://programming.lispdream.com/blog/2011/06/recursion- vs-iteration/ and I saw that on his implementation of the recursive and iterative implementations of the factorial function, the iterative actually takes longer given n = 1,000. I can't figure out why (he doesn't explain, but says that it is an exercise for the reader). Sorry for my newness to all of this.
