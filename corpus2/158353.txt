Basically I ran Intellij Idea 's plug in called FindBugs-Idea to analyze my code . I corrected whatever errror was caught and then ran the tool again but it was still complaining about the same error even though it was fixed in the source file . It only stopped complaining after I recompiled my classses . Why does it require a compilation step ? Shouldn't it basically look in the source file and detect a possible bug ? How do these tools work in general ?
