I am trying to move from Eclipse to IntelliJ Idea. I am trying out various dev plugins cases for IntelliJ Idea - android, clojure, scala, python, javascript, java, gwt, dart, jboss, spring etc. The start time increases as more plugins are installed (as mentioned by IntelliJ Idea wiki). _I am keen to learn different aspects of programming_. I am trying to find out how developers use IntelliJ Idea when working with multiple language environment. 1) Do they have different IntelliJ Idea installations to work with different language environments i.e the above scenario have 5-6 different IntelliJ installations with only appropriate plugins installed only. 2) Does IntelliJ Idea provide a mechanism to turn off different plugins within a single installation?
