I was wondering if it is possible to override the head of symbols/operators. As a motivating example if I run: ![example](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IHo4E.png) Then Ket will be returned. But lets say I want Bob to be returned instead of Ket. Is such a thing possible? To go a little bit further, I'd like: ![bob](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ugrvy.png)   to return BobKet and ![alice](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1Bi5s.png) to return AliceKet so that I could make a function that recognizes these heads like: ![function](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xH2fd.png) Thanks! Here are the corresponding lines of code `Head[Ket[\[Placeholder]]]` `Head[Ket[Subscript[x, B]]]` `Head[Ket[Subscript[x, A]]]` `combineBobAndAlice[b_BobKet, a_AliceKet] := Ket[{ {Subscript[b[[1, 1]], B], Subscript[a[[1, 1]], A]} }]`
