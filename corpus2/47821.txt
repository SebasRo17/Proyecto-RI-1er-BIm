If I run this in V8               Export["test.pdf", Grid[       Table[x, {10}, {7}],       Alignment -> {{Left, {Right}}, Center},       Background -> {None, White},       BaseStyle -> Directive[FontFamily -> "Times", 12],       Dividers -> {{1 -> White, -1 -> White}, {3 -> True,           6 -> True, -1 -> True}},       Frame -> False,       FrameStyle -> Directive[AbsoluteThickness[0.5], Black],       ItemSize -> {{35, {9}}, 1.5},       ItemStyle -> {Automatic, {Bold}},       Spacings -> {{1, 1, {0.5}, 2}, {0.5}}]]      I get divider lines of the correct thickness. If I run it in V9 the divider line thickness is screwed up. With not only the lines being different to the specification but the line thicknesses vary from each other despite all being specified to have the same thickness. Coincidentally I have noticed this the same day as this question was posted. It appears something became broken in V9. I am wondering if anyone has any suggestions for fixes? I am using Mac 10.9.2 and V9.0.1 and V8.0.4
