I've written an Integration program that produces files from a source set of data and converts it to a target data file. These files contain field/record information that must be validated by our clients using their validation methods. I plan to create numerous test cases and expect to receive information on how well the data validated so I can tweak my program. I want to create a test case that I know will not pass their validation, however I need to know if their validation methods are picking up basics such as the file structure and layout. I am trying to prevent the situation if all my test cases pass, but later on the files were not in the correct format the client needed. Do you feel this is a good idea and would I get any valid information from it?
