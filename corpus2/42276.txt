I would like to format the output. For example, the following code gives               For[n=2,n<=10,n++,       factorization =FactorInteger[n];       length=Length[factorization];       If[length==1,         factorization =(Superscript@@@FactorInteger[n])[[1]],         factorization =CenterDot@@(Superscript@@@FactorInteger[n])       ];            Print["n = ", n, " = ", factorization, ", number of prime factors = ", length];     ]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GF7qH.png) But what I want is something similar to the following (but better alignment) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xoJJI.png) I know there is Grid, but I don't know how to use them in this current case. Also, I prefer a simpler solution (if there is), such as one can specify a "field width" like in the C language.
