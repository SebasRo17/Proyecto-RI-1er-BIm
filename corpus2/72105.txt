I create three folders in the Project Explorer of any IDE that I use. I name them: App Layer, Business Layer and Data Layer. The App Layer holds all the UI stuff, the Business Layer holds all the classes dealing with business logic and the Data Layer holds the classes for DB connectivity and queries. I am new to MVC pattern and when I attempted it on VS2010 with ASP.NET, I found it far more complicated with all sorts of nested folders created. I was already separating the logic and the UI in my old style. What differed in the MVC is that you can use Routing to directly call methods via URL (Correct me if I am wrong), but in that case I assume the performance of the MVC application slows down. It is just an overhead to call a method via URL and than the method queries the DB. Isn't the performance of ASP.NET MVC a bit slow? Even though manageability is good but the learning curve is also very steep?
