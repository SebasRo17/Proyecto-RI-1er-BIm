Most of the C# programmers I know embrace one of the common coding standards. However being aware of the standards is one thing, telling the differences is another. Browsing the common coding standards documents our there on C#, my first reaction was it's more of the same. Admittedly I didn't bother reading everything. Has anyone ever compared them and point out the **major** differences between them?   * **Microsoft's Design Guidelines for Developing Class Libraries**   * **The IDesign C# Coding Standard, development guidelines, and best practices**   * **Lance Hunt's C# Coding Standards**
