I want to plot a series of data point:               q1 = {{0.0001, 0.762371}, {0.000621053, 0.768171}, {0.00114211,       0.773225}, {0.00166316, 0.777677}, {0.00218421,       0.781639}, {0.00270526, 0.785196}, {0.00322632,       0.788416}, {0.00374737, 0.791351}, {0.00426842,       0.794044}, {0.00478947, 0.79653}, {0.00531053,       0.798837}, {0.00583158, 0.800987}, {0.00635263, 0.803}, {0.00687368,      0.804891}, {0.00739474, 0.806675}, {0.00791579,       0.808362}, {0.00843684, 0.809962}, {0.00895789,       0.811485}, {0.00947895, 0.812936}, {0.01, 0.814322}}      q1 = ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DuudC.jpg)               q2 = {{0.01, 0.814322}, {0.02, 0.833238}, {0.03, 0.844964}, {0.04,      0.853516}, {0.05, 0.860265}, {0.06, 0.865849}, {0.07,      0.870619}, {0.08, 0.874787}, {0.09, 0.87849}, {0.1,      0.881824}, {0.11, 0.884857}, {0.12, 0.887639}, {0.13,      0.890209}, {0.14, 0.892597}, {0.15, 0.894828}, {0.16,      0.896919}, {0.17, 0.898886}, {0.18, 0.900745}, {0.19,      0.902505}, {0.2, 0.904175}, {0.21, 0.905764}, {0.22,      0.907279}, {0.23, 0.908727}, {0.24, 0.910112}, {0.25,      0.91144}, {0.26, 0.912714}, {0.27, 0.913939}, {0.28,      0.915117}, {0.29, 0.916252}, {0.3, 0.917347}, {0.31,      0.918403}, {0.32, 0.919424}, {0.33, 0.920411}, {0.34,      0.921367}, {0.35, 0.922292}, {0.36, 0.923189}, {0.37,      0.924059}, {0.38, 0.924903}, {0.39, 0.925723}, {0.4,      0.92652}, {0.41, 0.927295}, {0.42, 0.928049}, {0.43,      0.928783}, {0.44, 0.929498}, {0.45, 0.930194}, {0.46,      0.930873}, {0.47, 0.931534}, {0.48, 0.93218}, {0.49,      0.932811}, {0.5, 0.933426}, {0.51, 0.934027}, {0.52,      0.934615}, {0.53, 0.935188}, {0.54, 0.93575}, {0.55, 0.9363}, {0.56,     0.936837}, {0.57, 0.937363}, {0.58, 0.937878}, {0.59,      0.938382}, {0.6, 0.938876}, {0.61, 0.93936}, {0.62,      0.939835}, {0.63, 0.9403}, {0.64, 0.940756}, {0.65,      0.941204}, {0.66, 0.941642}, {0.67, 0.942073}, {0.68,      0.942496}, {0.69, 0.94291}, {0.7, 0.943318}, {0.71,      0.943719}, {0.72, 0.944112}, {0.73, 0.944498}, {0.74,      0.944878}, {0.75, 0.945251}, {0.76, 0.945618}, {0.77,      0.945978}, {0.78, 0.946334}, {0.79, 0.946682}, {0.8,      0.947023}, {0.81, 0.947363}, {0.82, 0.947695}, {0.83,      0.948023}, {0.84, 0.948345}, {0.85, 0.948662}, {0.86,      0.948974}, {0.87, 0.949282}, {0.88, 0.949584}, {0.89,      0.949882}, {0.9, 0.950177}, {0.91, 0.950466}, {0.92,      0.950751}, {0.93, 0.951032}, {0.94, 0.95131}, {0.95,      0.951583}, {0.96, 0.951853}, {0.97, 0.952118}, {0.98,      0.95238}, {0.99, 0.952639}, {1., 0.952894}}      q2 = ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/titvq.jpg) When I tried to combine them the result was:               p1 = ListPlot[q1, PlotStyle -> Red];     p2 = ListPlot[q2, PlotStyle -> Blue];     Show[{p2, p1}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ryZ0l.jpg) As you can see the red part which is q1 is not noticeable. I also tried:               q3 = Join[q1, q2, 1];     ListPlot[q3]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QLHYl.jpg) I want the graphs q1 and q2 as you can see above alongside each other as if they are one graph. q2 is the continuation of q1.
