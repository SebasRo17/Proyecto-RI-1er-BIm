I'm getting a huge output, but it appears that almost every term should actually be zero, unless I'm misunderstanding the expression. For example, part of the output reads > >     a (0.25 + 0. b) + b^2 (0. + 0./c) + b (-1. + 0. c) - 0.5 c + (b (-1. b - > 0.5 c) c)/a^2 >   `Simplify` and `FullSimplify` won't get rid of these zero terms even with assumptions that `a,b` and `c` are real and non-zero. Suggestions ?
