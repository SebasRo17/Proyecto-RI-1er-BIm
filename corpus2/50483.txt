I have a huge simulation and tried to export it as a video file (or .gif). However regardlessly what I specify under the Framerate option the video its just running for 4 seconds (too fast). When I set the framerate to one the video just consists of one picture and if I set it to 100 the video is fluid but still only 4 seconds long. Do I have to set another flag in the animation? While trying to present you some working example I came up with the following short lines:               data = Import["http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=4Tuv8UKv", {"Data", All, {2, 3}}];     Animate[Graphics[Circle[data[[t]]],           ImageSize -> {500, 200}, PlotRange -> {{0, 100}, {-5, 5}},             Axes -> True], {t, Range[1, 1000]}, AnimationRate -> 1,             AnimationRunning -> False]          Export["test.mov", %, "FrameRate" -> 25]      So I thought that with setting the animation rate to 1 and the framerate to 25 I would get a 1000/25=40 seconds long video. Why is that not happening? Do I have to specify my frames somehow?
