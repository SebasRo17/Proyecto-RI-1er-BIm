I'm working on an script for tracking urls on a web page. This script runs daily to identify resources that are no longer available. If a page returns a `status code` like `404` I know the resource is not available anymore, but sometimes the page returns a `200` with a message like: > This resource has been moved to ...... Or > This resource is not available anymore.... I would like to know which `keywords` are used to say a resource is not longer available regardless the `status code`.
