Which is the best protocol / format for SOA designs using REST. Here are some options but i can't decide...   * XML   * JSON   * YAML   * ProtoBuf   * _... anything else i might have missed_ These are my requirements...   * should be lightweight and less bandwidth guzzler   * should have existing client libs in Python and PHP   * should scale VERY WELL _**\-- UPDATE --_** We have two machines (one is Python -- our middletier) and the other is PHP (front end -- used for rendering different HTML for old browsers, HTML 5 browsers and our Adobe AIR client). We need a communications pipe between the Python and PHP machine -- and we think a RESTful service pipe will be a good idea -- we just can't decide on the format.
