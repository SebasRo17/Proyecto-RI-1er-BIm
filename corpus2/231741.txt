In method call syntax in many object-oriented languages, the receiver object goes to the left of the method name, e.g. `someObject.someMethod()`. This comes in handy when using an IDE with code completion/code assist/Intellisense; when the user types a method call expression, the receiver has already been typed, so the IDE can narrow down its method choices to apply to that receiver (at least in statically-typed languages). What I'm wondering is, what is the user interface for method/function completion like in languages where the method or function name goes _before_ its receiver and/or arguments, e.g. Lisp or C? Does the user have to trigger a hotkey, to which the IDE responds by asking for the receiver and/or arguments, and then once the value is typed in the IDE pops up a list of methods or functions that are applicable to that list?
