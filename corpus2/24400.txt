I have the following function defined:               IntImpTri[r1_, r2_, r_] :=        Piecewise[{         {((4/((r2 - r1)^2)) ((r^2 - r1^2)/2 - r1 (r - r1))),           r >= r1 && r < ((r1 + r2)/2)},          {(1/2 - (2/((r2 - r1)^2)) (r^2 - ((r1 + r2)/2)^2) +            (4/((r2 - r1)^2)) r2 (r - ((r1 + r2)/2))),           r >= ((r1 + r2)/2) && r < r2},          {1, r >= r2}}, 0];      I am using _Mathematica 9_ and I do not understand why, when I try to plot this function, which is the integral function of a triangle pulse, the figure shows an interruption in the line. If I try the following command: `Plot[IntImpTri[0, 4, r], {r, -1, 5}]`, I get the following output: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mjMV0.jpg) There is a discontinuity around `x=2` but the piecewise covers everything!
