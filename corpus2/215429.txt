I have this project which stores product details from amazon into the database. Just to give you an idea on how big it is: ` [{"title":"Genetic Engineering (Opposing Viewpoints)","short_title":"Genetic Engineering ...","brand":"","condition":"","sales_rank":"7171426","binding":"Book","item_detail_url":"http://localhost/wordpress/product/?asin=0737705124","node_list":"Books > Science & Math > Biological Sciences > Biotechnology","node_category":"Books","subcat":"","model_number":"","item_url":"http://localhost/wordpress/wp- content/ecom-plugin- redirects/ecom_redirector.php?id=128","details_url":"http://localhost/wordpress/product/?asin=0737705124","large_image":"http://localhost/wordpress/wp- content/plugins/ecom/img/large- notfound.png","medium_image":"http://localhost/wordpress/wp- content/plugins/ecom/img/medium- notfound.png","small_image":"http://localhost/wordpress/wp- content/plugins/ecom/img/small- notfound.png","thumbnail_image":"http://localhost/wordpress/wp- content/plugins/ecom/img/thumbnail- notfound.png","tiny_img":"http://localhost/wordpress/wp- content/plugins/ecom/img/tiny- notfound.png","swatch_img":"http://localhost/wordpress/wp- content/plugins/ecom/img/swatch- notfound.png","total_images":"6","amount":"33.70","currency":"$","long_currency":"USD","price":"$33.70","price_type":"List Price","show_price_type":"0","stars_url":"","product_review":"","rating":"","yellow_star_class":"","white_star_class":"","rating_text":" of 5","reviews_url":"","review_label":"","reviews_label":"Read all ","review_count":"","create_review_url":"http://localhost/wordpress/wp- content/ecom-plugin- redirects/ecom_redirector.php?id=132","create_review_label":"Write a review","buy_url":"http://localhost/wordpress/wp-content/ecom-plugin- redirects/ecom_redirector.php?id=19186","add_to_cart_action":"http://localhost/wordpress/wp- content/ecom-plugin- redirects/add_to_cart.php","asin":"0737705124","status":"Only 7 left in stock.","snippet_condition":"in_stock","status_class":"ninstck","customer_images":["http://localhost/wordpress/wp- content/uploads/2013/10/ecom_images/51M2vvFvs2BL.jpg","http://localhost/wordpress/wp- content/uploads/2013/10/ecom_images/31FIM- YIUrL.jpg","http://localhost/wordpress/wp- content/uploads/2013/10/ecom_images/51M2vvFvs2BL.jpg","http://localhost/wordpress/wp- content/uploads/2013/10/ecom_images/51M2vvFvs2BL.jpg"],"disclaimer":"","item_attributes":[{"attr":"Author","value":"Greenhaven Press"},{"attr":"Binding","value":"Hardcover"},{"attr":"EAN","value":"9780737705126"},{"attr":"Edition","value":"1"},{"attr":"ISBN","value":"0737705124"},{"attr":"Label","value":"Greenhaven Press"},{"attr":"Manufacturer","value":"Greenhaven Press"},{"attr":"NumberOfItems","value":"1"},{"attr":"NumberOfPages","value":"224"},{"attr":"ProductGroup","value":"Book"},{"attr":"ProductTypeName","value":"ABIS_BOOK"},{"attr":"PublicationDate","value":"2000-06"},{"attr":"Publisher","value":"Greenhaven Press"},{"attr":"SKU","value":"G0737705124I2N00"},{"attr":"Studio","value":"Greenhaven Press"},{"attr":"Title","value":"Genetic Engineering (Opposing Viewpoints)"}],"customer_review_url":"http://localhost/wordpress/wp- content/ecom-customer- reviews/0737705124.html","flickr_results":["http://localhost/wordpress/wp- content/uploads/2013/10/ecom_images/5105560852_06c7d06f14_m.jpg"],"freebase_text":"No around the web data available yet","freebase_image":"http://localhost/wordpress/wp- content/plugins/ecom/img/freebase- notfound.jpg","ebay_related_items":[{"title":"Genetic Engineering (Introducing Issues With Opposing Viewpoints), , Good Book","image":"http://localhost/wordpress/wp- content/uploads/2013/10/ecom_images/140.jpg","url":"http://localhost/wordpress/wp- content/ecom-plugin- redirects/ecom_redirector.php?id=12165","currency_id":"$","current_price":"26.2"},{"title":"Genetic Engineering Opposing Viewpoints by DAVID BENDER - 1964 Hardcover","image":"http://localhost/wordpress/wp- content/uploads/2013/10/ecom_images/140.jpg","url":"http://localhost/wordpress/wp- content/ecom-plugin- redirects/ecom_redirector.php?id=130","currency_id":"AUD","current_price":"11.99"}],"no_follow":"rel=\"nofollow\"","new_tab":"target=\"_blank\"","related_products":[],"super_saver_shipping":"","shipping_availability":"","total_offers":"7","added_to_cart":""}] ` So the structure for the table is:   * asin   * title   * details (the product details in json) Will the performance suffer if I have to store like 10,000 products? Is there any other way of doing this? I'm thinking of the following, but the current setup is really the most convenient one since I also have to use the data on the client side:   * store the product details in a file. So something like ASIN123.json   * store the product details in one big file. (I'm guessing it will be a drag to extract data from this file)   * store each of the fields in the details in its own table field Thanks in advance! **UPDATE** Thanks for the answers! I just want to add some more details to my question. First, the records are updated for a specific interval. Only specific data such as the price or the title are updated. Second, I'm also using the json encoded data in the client-side so I thought at first it would be easier to just have it json encoded so I can easily use it in the client side without having to convert. Does this change your opinion about simply storing the fields in a regular table field in an RDBMS setup?
