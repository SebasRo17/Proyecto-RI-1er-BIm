I can produce a variable size list of strings like `AACBBAABC` with this code:               test[n_] :=        Flatten[ Table[ StringJoin @@ Table[ Subscript[\[Zeta], i], {i, 1, n}], ##] & @@        Table[{ Subscript[\[Zeta], i], {"A", "B", "C"}}, {i, 1, n}], n - 1]      My problem is that ultimately `n` will be such that the table has $10^{17}$ elements.   What I want to do is generating the elements one at a time so that I can run a test on the string to validate it. The number of good strings will be $<<10^{17}$. In essence I need a code that will have a variable number of loops depending on `n`. My $70$ year old brain is having a problem coming up with an answer!
