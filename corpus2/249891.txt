I'd like to add a couple of command-line arguments to my Django's `./manage.py dbshell` command, and I can't figure out how. In specific I'd like to add `-A` to prevent MySQL from scanning every table and every column, and `--prompt=LOCAL:` since I frequently keep multiple shells open. I can't figure out how to do this! I'm only idea is to create my own "mysql" command in /usr/local/bin and have it be a wrapper for mysql with my own flags. But I'd really like to avoid doing that.
