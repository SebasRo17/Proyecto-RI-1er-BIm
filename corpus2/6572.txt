> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Labelling ArrayPlot Charts I am making a `MatrixPlot`. For example, consider the following:               list = {{1, 1, 0, 1}, {0, 0, 1, 1}, {1, 0, 1, 0}};     MatrixPlot[list]      which yields: ![MatrixPlot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QXRcu.gif) But now suppose I want to label the axes with other numbers. For example, I would like to label the ticks on the horizontal axis as 101, 167, 188, 205 (as they are not now), and the ticks on the vertical axis as 1, 2, 3 (as they already are). I know this is a strange request, but it is because I would like to label the horizontal axis according to "particle number" (which is an integer in my application). Or maybe a better way to phrase the question is, is it possible to label axis/frame ticks with _any_ arbitrary string (for example, labeling the horizontal axis with `"Alice"`, `"Bob"`, `"Carla"`, and `"David"`)? One possibility seems like `FrameTicks`, but I can't seem to figure out if it can be used to map strings. If I use               list = {{1, 1, 0, 1}, {0, 0, 1, 1}, {1, 0, 1, 0}};     MatrixPlot[list,       FrameTicks -> {{{1, 2, 3}, None}, {{101, 167, 188, 205}, None}}]      I get: ![MatrixPlot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/EGt5n.gif) because, of course, `FrameTicks` thinks I'm referring to which discrete values to label. Also, if I try:               list = {{1, 1, 0, 1}, {0, 0, 1, 1}, {1, 0, 1, 0}};     MatrixPlot[list,       FrameTicks -> {{{1, 2, 3}, None}, {{"101", "167", "188", "205"},          None}}]      I get "Not a valid tick specification." Do you have any other ideas?
