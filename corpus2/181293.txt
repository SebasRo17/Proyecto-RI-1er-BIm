I've recently been hired for a project that involves working with and around several third-party "enterprise" systems. Due to what I imagine would be the astronomical cost and effort required to build a sufficiently faithful replica of the production environment, the prospect of having a real development environment seems vanishingly slim. This is of course not ideal. On the bright side, I imagine there must be people out there safely testing and deploying software into unreplicable environments like this, and I can probably follow in their footsteps. How those who effectively deal with these kinds of situations do it?
