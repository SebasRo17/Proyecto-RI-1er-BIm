I've just started to use Mathematica for programming and I was wondering how I could do Fitting for several data sets. For example, I have one curve. For this curve I need to plot a fit curve, if my x>0, i'm using this equation: x a (1 - (0.2 - 0.5 x)/b), otherwise (if x<0) this one: x a (1 - (0.2 - 0.5 x)/b). a and b are two parameters I need to find to fit a curve. So to do this I used NonlinearModelFit: NonlinearModelFit[fl, If [x < 0.2, {x a (1 - (0.2 - 0.5 x)/b)}, {a (x - 0.04/(2 b))}], {a, b}, x]. And found my a and b. Is this correct? Now I have another curve and I have to do the same. But! This parameters (a and b) have to be the same for both curves. So how to plot two (three, four) fit curves for different data on one plot? Another problem is that for second curve an equation would be: If [x < 0.4, {x a (1 - (0.4 - 0.5 x)/b)}, {a (x - 0.16/(2 b))}], {a, b}, x] For third curve: If [x < 0.6, {x a (1 - (0.6 - 0.5 x)/b)}, {a (x - 0.36/(2 b))}], {a, b}, x]
