I have made a package                BeginPackage["top`"]      t[x_]:=MessageDialog["This is top"]      t1[x_]:=MessageDialog["This is top1"]      EndPackage[]      and used the code of this link and I am able to auto load packages in `Mathematica` and it is working fine. But when I have used it with `Player Pro`. It is not working. Automatically load packages at startup                initFileName = FileNameJoin[{$UserBaseDirectory, "Kernel", "init.m"}];          (* Make a back-up *)      CopyFile[initFileName, initFileName <> "_" <>     StringReplace[ToString@Round[DateList[]], " " -> ""] <> ".bak"];     exprs = Import[initFileName, {"Package", "HeldExpressions"}];           Export[initFileName,        Append[exprs, HoldComplete[Needs["VectorAnalysis`"]]],          {"Package", "HeldExpressions"}       ]              Row[{Button["Click for function t", top`t[5]], Button["Click for f1", top`t[7]]}]      I have deployed the notebook in to `CDF Player`. But when I am opening the `CDF` by closing Mathematica and opening it with `CDF Player`, it is not working. I have also added that package in Autoload folder of Mathematica Player. What should I do so that my CDF or Player Pro also works fine as `Mathematica` notebook was working fine by autoloading packages at startup? I was getting this output in mathematica when I clicked at "click for function t".![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/oiW7q.png) But I am not getting any output when I click on these two buttons in case of CDF or Player Pro.
