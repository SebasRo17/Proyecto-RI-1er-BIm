How to check whether or not the sum of the cube of each digit of a number is equal to the number itself? In the following code, I tried to return the number in question whenever it matches the condition.               In[191]:= Func[x_]:=If[Total[Map[#^3& ,IntegerDigits[x]]]==x,x,0];     Func[300]      > Out[192]= 300 Apparently the checking seems to be wrongly done. What caused this issue? How to fix it?
