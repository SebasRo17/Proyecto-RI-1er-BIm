I'm looking for a function that applies the following behavior to an expression: -When the expression is given as the full input, or as part of a function that cannot be evaluated, it remains in unevaluated form. -When the expression is used for a function, it is evaluated.  `Defer[]` won't evaluate it in a function. `Unevaluated[]` leaves itself in evaluated when used directly as output. Essentially, I need a function `F[]` that will output the following:   * `F[1-1/2]` outputs `1-1/2`, NOT `1/2`   * `Times[F[1-1/2],5]` outputs `5/2`, NOT `(1-1/2)5`   * `Times[F[1-1/2],x]` outputs `(1-1/2)x`, NOT `x/2` If the solution only works for a specific internal expression, that works, because I only need this for one function.
