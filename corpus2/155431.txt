I'm reading the r6rs Scheme report and am confused by the explanation of continuations (I find it to be too dense and lacking of examples for a beginner). What is this code doing and how does it evaluate to 4? Why does `call/cc` want an argument that's a function of one argument? How is `call/cc`'s argument used?               (+ 1 (call-with-current-continuation            (lambda (escape)              (+ 2 (escape 3)))))               =â‡’ 4      This example is from section 1.11 - Continuations.
