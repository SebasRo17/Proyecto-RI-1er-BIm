I'm working as a developer back in my home country, where English is not a first/second language. However, I consider myself a native speaker since most of my schooling has been in an American environment. Everyday I have to talk to my colleagues about technical stuff and English words obviously come up all the time. My colleagues pronounce English words very differently than how it's supposed to be (well most of the times) and I feel weird trying to correct them or speaking the 'right way' because it makes it seem like I'm a dick and often takes the focus away from the real subject. How do you guys deal with this kind of 'problem?'
