Say I have a Base class called `Car` and it has 3 derived classes say `Ford`, `Honda` and `Audi`. The issue is, all three derived classes have exactly same code but minor difference in calling member functions of their respective engines (these engines have separate class). For example, `Ford` class calls code which is exactly same as other two classes but do call something like `ford_engine-> start()`, `ford_engine->clean()` etc.               //ly  honda  calls   honda_engine->start()   honda_engine->clean();          //ly  Audi calls audi_engine->start()  audi->clean();      Now here the issue is, it has redundant code in all three places with minute difference. How can I have code at one place, most probably in base class and all derived classes use same code?
