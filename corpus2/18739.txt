I am having trouble generating a plot for a solution to my differential equations. I always end up with just blank axes.               Clear["Global`*"]      Remove["Global`*"]     m x''[t] == -k m x'[t];     m y''[t] == -k m y'[t] - m g;     U == v Cos[\[Theta]];     V == v Sin[\[Theta]];     soln = DSolve[{m x''[t] == -k m x'[t], m y''[t] == -k m y'[t] - m g,        x[0] == 0, y[0] == 0, x'[0] == U, y'[0] == V}, {x[t], y[t]},       t][[1]] // Simplify;     soln     ParametricPlot[{x[t], y[t]}, {t, 0, 5}]      The solution comes out fine but the graph always comes out blank. I'm sure I'm making some rookie mistake somewhere and would appreciate if someone can point it out.
