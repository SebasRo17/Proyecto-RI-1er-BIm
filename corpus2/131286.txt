There are several products for tracking the usage of your application. I know at least 10 offers. They tell you which features were used more often than others. Thus, you can identify features that may not make into new versions. While with Google Analytics, or similar tools, this a standard tool for the web at the "page-level". I just wonder who is already using this analysis for desktop applications? Big companies like Microsoft of course do it, but do ISVs and small vendors (perhaps < 50 employees) use such tools? I currently don't know anybody, so I'm really curious about it: Is Usage Tracking esoteric or state of the art?
