I attempt to test the mean graylevels of the alphabets "W" and "Z". I used the following code to create the images of them.               imW = Rasterize@       Graphics[         Text[Style["W", 24, FontFamily -> "Helvetica",           TextAlignment -> Center, Antialiasing -> True], {0, 0}],         ImagePadding -> 0, ImageSize -> 24]          imZ = Rasterize@       Graphics[         Text[Style["Z", 24, FontFamily -> "Helvetica",           TextAlignment -> Center, Antialiasing -> True], {0, 0}],         ImagePadding -> 0, ImageSize -> 24]      However, there are blank areas around the images. How can I get rid of them? Is there a trim function built in for this purpose? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Grr5I.gif) I tried `ImageCrop[imW ]`, however, the top and bottom blanks still left. @kirma I did follow your suggestions, both increasing the `ImagePadding` to 20, and `ImagePad[img, -BorderDimensions[img]]`. Somehow, I still can't get rid of the top and bottom blanks. What I got was something like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2zVxo.gif)
