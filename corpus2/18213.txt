It's been over a year since I've used Mathematica, and I'm having a total brain fart on a home project. I'd like to take an existing list of lists, say,               x = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6}}      and append 9 and 10 onto the end of each sublist of x to get a list y, where               y = {{1, 2, 9}, {1 ,2, 10}, {3, 4, 9}, {3, 4, 10}, {5, 6, 9}, {5, 6, 10}}      I'm sure there's a built-in function to do this, but cannot recall it for the life of me.
