I'd like to create a custom function that does essentially the same as a core function of mathematica but uses different default settings. Example: I want a Plot function that uses Mathematica's core `Plot` function but uses different default settings. I don't want to use `SetOptions[Plot, ...]` because I don't want to override anything for the core Plot function. Instead of this I want to build a custom function `PlotFramed[x^2,{x,-5,5}]` that points to `Plot[x^2, {x,-5,5}, Frame->True, GridLines->Automatic]`. I also want the function to be able to override my default settings. So `PlotFramed[x^2, {x,-5,5}, GridLines->None]` should return the results from `Plot[x^2, {x,-5,5}, Frame->True, GridLines->None]`. And I want to use additional options that are not set by default as in the normal Plot function. So `PlotFramed[x^2, {x,-5,5}, PlotStyle->Dashed]` should point to `Plot[x^2, {x,-5,5}, Frame->True, GridLines->Automatic, PlotStyle->Dashed]`. The reason for this is that when writing reports (in LaTeX) I have to add several options to the plot function to make the font-size bigger, add a grid, etc pp. Using the idea above I could write a custom Plot function that I can use when generating output for the report and otherwise use Mathematica's core function since everything is fine with it when working inside Mathematica. Can anyone tell me how to do this? This would be awesome. Thanks in advance!
