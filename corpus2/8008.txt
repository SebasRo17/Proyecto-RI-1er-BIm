I need some help in plotting the following inequality using Mathematica: $$\frac{1+(x/100+0.1)\times y/100}{1.15+1.15\times(x/100)\times(y/100)}\geq 1$$ assuming $x,y\in \mathbb{Q}$, the set of rational numbers and $5\leq x\leq 90,\ 50\leq y \leq 650$. Copyable code for the above inequality:               (1 + (x/100 + 0.1)(y/100))/(1.15 + 1.15 (x/100)(y/100)) >= 1      I've tried the following in Maple (because it's what we had available) but it only simplifies the term and does not plot it and enclosing the inequality with `plot()` in Maple only generates errors.               assume(x, rational);     assume(y, rational);     assume(x>=5 and x<=90);     assume(y>=50 and y<=650);     (1+1*(x/100+0.1)*(y/100))/(1.15+1.15*(x/100)*(y/100))>=1;      ### Optional theoretical problem: $x$ could theoretically (not in practice) be up to $100$, but $(x/100+0.1)$ on the left side would still always max out at $1$. Should the equation be changed to $x_1$ and $x_2$ with respective limits? But those limits would only apply for $x_1$ and $90< x_2 \leq 100$.
