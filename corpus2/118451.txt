I have been playing around with C# for Windows and ASP.net MVC development for some time now. But I am still unclear on a few areas. I am trying to understand the basic difference between and performance issues with using and interchanging similar kinds of Generic Collection Interfaces. What is the basic difference between `IEnumerable<T>`, `ICollection<T>`, `List<T>(Class)`? I seem to use and interchange them without seeing any problem in my applications. Also, are there any more similar generic collections like these that can be interchanged with those three?
