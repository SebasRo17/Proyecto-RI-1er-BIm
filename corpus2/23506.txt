It is my first time writing an _article_ on a software project. I am supposed to use ACM UbiComp paper format. I already have a structure that I should follow and there is a **Background & Research Methods** section after Abstract, Introduction, Related Work sections. I have browser through several articles, but some of them either dont have it, have only background section or have only research methods section. **I am having hard time to find an article that has this section and moreover what I must write on here**. My project is about Bluetooth location tracking and I do have the implementation and evaluation, so it is not something theoretical.
