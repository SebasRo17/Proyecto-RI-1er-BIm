I want to combine two images to create a zoomed callout, as illustrated below. ![zoom callout](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pIFi6.png) The plot on the right is the zoomed in version of the boxed area on the left. The dotted lines connect the corresponding box corners. I would like to be able to change the location and size of the zoom callout (the right plot) as well as which dotted lines are shown. This is the code I used to make the plots:               bigplot = ContourPlot[x^2 - y^2 == 1/10000, {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1}, ContourStyle -> Directive[Red, Thick], Frame -> None];     xrange = {-1/10, 1/10};     yrange = {-1/10, 1/10};     rect = Graphics[{EdgeForm[Directive[Black, Thick]], Opacity[0], Rectangle[Sequence @@ Transpose[{xrange, yrange}]]}];          combined = Show[bigplot, rect]     zoomedplot = ContourPlot[x^2 - y^2 == 1/10000, {x, xrange[[1]], xrange[[2]]}, {y, yrange[[1]], yrange[[2]]}, ContourStyle -> Directive[Red, Thick], FrameTicks -> None, PlotRangePadding -> None]      I think a solution would use `Inset`. However, I do not understand how the _pos_ argument works.
