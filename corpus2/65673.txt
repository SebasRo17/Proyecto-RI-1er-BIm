So, today I looked at Arduino; seems very interesting. I still don't want to shell out the money just yet, as I have some questions, namely:   1. Should I learn something about electronics? What and with what resources?   2. What stuff should I buy? I have a limited, but not _that_ small budget (probably up to 200â‚¬, but preferably _less_ ). I'm interested in getting a screen (mustn't be complex, but I would prefer one like that), some speaker, some way for it to move and a way to remotely control it. I would also want a battery. I also wan't to be able to use my board for many things in the future, so it shouldn't be too basic, I guess. I think I will go with the MEGA, is that smart?   3. What resources do you recommend? Any books? Good tutorials besides what you find on their site?   4. What are really cool extensions (e.g. screens) which I would be adviced to get/try? Help greatly appreciated. Also, I have _never_ developed for any embedded device, but I know C and computer architecture to some degree; I'm somewhat familiar with low level stuff.
