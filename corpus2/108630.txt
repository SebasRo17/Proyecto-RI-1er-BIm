I have been studying design patterns and came accross the fly weight pattern. I have been trying to see opportunities to use the pattern in my applications but I am having trouble seeing how to use it. Also, what are some signs that a fly weight pattern is being used when I read other peoples code? According to the definition it says: > Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently. If I read it right Dictionaries and Hashtables could be instances of fly weights is this correct? Thanks in advance.
