Is saving SQL statements in a MySQL table for executing later a bad idea? The SQL statements will be ready for execution, i.e. there will be no parameters to swap or anything, for example `DELETE FROM users WHERE id=1`. I guess I'm being lazy, but I thought of this idea because I'm working on a project that will require quite a few cron jobs that will execute SQL statements periodically.
