Does anybody know of a solid source of information regarding the quality/details of a company's codebase? I'm asking as a potential employee of some companies, having been highly dissatisfied by the technology stack of some companies I've worked with in the past. I considered creating a website like this a while back, but ultimately decided that it was really just a subset of what features a site like Glassdoor could offer. Glassdoor has a great site for company reviews, but seems mostly geared towards salary information and is much more general-purpose than this.
