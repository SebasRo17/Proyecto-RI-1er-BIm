Finally I started to play with differential equations in _Mathematica_. And I have faced the problem, which seems too me so basic that I'm afraid this question is going to be closed soon. However, I've failed in finding solution here or in documentation center. **My question is: how to set that`NDSolve` will not save whole `InterpolationFunction` for the result?** I'm only interested in final coordinates or for example each 100th. Is there simple way to achieve that? * * * Anticipating questions:   * I know I can do something like `r /@ Range[0.1, 1, .1] /. sol` at the end, but still, there is whole interpolating function in memory. I want to avoid it because my final goal is to do N-Body simulation where N is huge and I will run out of the memory quite fast. What is important to me is only the set of coordinates as far in the future as it can be, not intermediate values.   * I can write something using `Do` or `Nest` but I want to avoid it since `NDSolve` allows us to implement different solving methods in handy way.   * I saw WolframDemonstrations/CollidingGalaxies and it seems there is an explicit code with `Do` :-/   * Another idea would be to put `NDSolve` into the loop but this seems to be not efficient. Could it be even compilable? * * * Just in case someone want to show something here is the sample of code to play with:               G = 4 Pi^2 // N ;          sol = NDSolve[{                    r''[t] == -G r[t]/Norm[r[t]]^3,                    r[0] == {1, 0, 0},                    r'[0] == {0, 2 Pi // N, 0}                   },                   r,                   {t, 0, 1}, Method -> "ExplicitRungeKutta", MaxStepSize -> (1/365 // N)                  ]           ParametricPlot3D[Evaluate[r[t] /. sol], {t, 0, 1}]            (* Earth orbiting the Sun. Units: Year/AstronomicalUnit/SunMass           in order to express it simply*)
