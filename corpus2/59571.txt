I am given a set of data and told ahead of time that the data will need to be fitted to a _Gaussian Distribution_. I know that _Mathematica_ has preset functions for linear, quadratic, and cubic fits, but how do I define a new equation to fit the data to? From this, I will need the s.d., the `x_average`, and the `A` values. The _Gaussian Distribution_ is to be defined as so:               N(x) = A/(sqrt(2*3.1416)*w)*exp(-(x-x_average)**2/(2*(w**w**2))      * * * So far I have:               Needs["ErrorBarPlots`"];          SetDirectory[];     SetDirectory["/Users/stevendang/Downloads"];          dataContent = Import["data.dat"];          dataOrganized =       Table[{{dataContent[[i, 1]], dataContent[[i, 2]]},       ErrorBar[dataContent[[i, 3]]]}, {i, 2, Length[dataContent]}];      ErrorListPlot[dataOrganized,       FrameLabel -> {"Y, X", "Gaussian Distribution"},       PlotRange -> {{0, 30}, {0, 40}}]          dataFit =       Table[{dataContent[[i, 1]], dataContent[[i, 2]]}, {i, 2, Length[dataContent]}]          FindFit[dataFit, (A/((2*3.1416)^(1/2)*w))*e^(-(x - xave)^2/(2*w^2)), {A, w, xave}, x]      Also I've tried "FindDistributionParameters" instead of FindFit but Mathematica doesn't have a built in Gaussian Distribution to work with. Any thoughts? The following isn't giving me values for A, w, xave.
