I am trying to model in UML 2.0 a Java servlet application that has three classes   * Servlet class; essentially a main class that acts as the controller   * DatabaseLogic; contains methods for database operations   * XMLBuilder; builds an XML from a query result string The classes use a variety of packages from the Java library. I am unsure how to model this in UML Do I have to create a package and show which libraries are used for each individual class or can I just have one large package in the diagram with all the libraries showing which classes have dependencies on which. As per this diagram ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/N05mW.png) This is my first time working with java properly (im a C++ guy) Apart from being a bit messy , is this a correct UML representation of the system I described? Does a Package in UML mean the same as a Package in Java?
