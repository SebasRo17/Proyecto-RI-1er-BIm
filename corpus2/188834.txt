The question is pretty self-explanatory. I've had some experience with git- flow, and not much more _true_ experience with plain git before that. (I was using it more as a backup-provider.) I'm confused as to what consensus is, given that I can safely assume that there are a large number of git users who miss 'the good old days' of formal, centralized version control, and just want a piece of it back (cf. rant article below) Related articles:   * The seminal   * an anti-git-flow rant * * * _"spirit of git"_ in the question title is, whatever it means to you. For me, I remember that it's a DVCS, not a CVS. git flow seems like it's imposing an organized branching model where one might not need to be there at all, where it would be essential in a centralized system such as SVN.
