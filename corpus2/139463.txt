This is more of a usability issue I'd say, looking of suggestions on it. I have a system that depends on the data entered by the users to be correct, as in the address exists, the name is correct, etc. This is all for places. Now the way I figured I could do this is that I have every entry peer reviewed, as in, have 5 other users check and ensure the data is correct before allowing it to be indexed and viewed on the site. The problem with this approach is that the site isn't one where the users will inhabit long, just log on look for a place and that's it, so they might not be inclined to verify that other user's entries are correct. What do you think about this, can anyone suggest a solution that might adjust to my situation?
