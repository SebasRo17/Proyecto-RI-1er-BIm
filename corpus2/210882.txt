Most of my client side code ends up as a long script in one file the mostly looks like this:               <script>     function someFunction1(){/*...*/}     function someFunction2(){/*...*/}     ...     var globalVariable1;     var globalVariable2;     ...     $(function(){          $('selector1').click(function(){         //get relevant data from various DOM elements              //some business logic rules and validation              //open dialog box              //more business logic rules and more validation              //post an ajax request              //update the DOM         });          //many other events          //many jQuery dialogs         });     </script>      It's a maintenance nightmare. Although I use a well designed server-side structure using DDD (application services, domain sevices, value objects,...etc.) I have had little luck structuring my client code to a better separation of concerns. I'm not building a client-side application. I just use jQuery intensively for the client side. How should I approach the code structure to apply DDD client-side wide?
