I have a job from a client that needs a iPhone/iPad app. I'm new to the smartphone development so where do I begin with? Do you have some nice in depth beginning tutorials of some kind? JS libraries I need to look into? Is there a startup boilerplate for iPhone/Android out there with a beneficial starting setup kit or something like that? In general, is there something I really need to know before I start? My coding background is:   * HTML/CSS   * jQuery/Javascript (rookie)   * C#    * AS 3.0
