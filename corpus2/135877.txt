I am not able to find the right technical term to mention child or instance of a template.   What's the right one, child or instance or something else I am not aware of? Sorry for my unclear original question.   Its not related to any language. The Template I am talking about is a business concept in my application. Say for example, I have a "chair" template. I would set a few property values to it to create it's usable instances. I need this for naming and documentation stuff.   Shortlisted 3 terms: Instance, Definition, Child. Whats suits better?
