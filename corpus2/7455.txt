I mean, I still have a MSX2 with a Z80 processor and if you look at any Konami's game made for that computer in its time (roughly between '84 and '90) is amazing the high quality code of those games. I was a kid at the time, trying to learn how to program a computer and still today fascinated me how well made they are, mostly zero bugs or glitches, despite the really complex behavior. What hardware/software tools could they have used to accomplish that quality, which metodology? I know computers are really more complex today but at that time, even a stock control program I made in Basic was plagued with many bugs and was painful to debug. Any light you can shed will be deeply appreciated.
