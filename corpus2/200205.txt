I'm reading the Go language specification. The section on comments states: > Line comments start with the character sequence `//` and stop at the end of > the line. A line comment acts like a newline. What is the point of specifying that a line comment acts like a newline? Couldn't line comments simply act like empty strings? Lines (except the last) end in a newline anyway, so any line (except the last) will act like two consecutive newlines. If the last line has a line comment, then it can also safely act like an empty string.
