Assume that the output of my calculation is `a` and is a number such as: > `a = 100.1252135246354847;` `N[a]` gives me `100.125` However, when I try to save my data, `a` via export such as : > `Export["/path/to/file/with/extension/dat", N[a]]` My eventual filename.dat has `100.12521352463548` and not `100.125`. So is the precision of digits/most significant digits for display only? I also tried `NumberForm[a,6]` and I get `NumberForm[100.1252135246354847`18.000543455259304, 6]` in my data file! What am I doing wrong? ## Edit (possible solution): Replacing `N[a]` with `SetPrecision[a,5]` helped. I wasn't sure if I should have this in the ANSWER section because the solution may be quite trivial and may not warrant being in the answer section. Any thoughts on that (whether or not I should answer this question or let the solution remain as an appended "edit")
