I am developing enterprise iPad application which contained large amount of different bundle data in terms of group of images. Is it worth to stored as a compressed file format or normal set of individual files? I am not worrying about huge amount of data which is reside in the cloud. My concern is that cloud computing provider only charges depending upon the request not about how much data where stored. If I store single file in cloud then it make more request while using the app. So it will cost so much. Is it better to be stored as a compressed file in cloud?
