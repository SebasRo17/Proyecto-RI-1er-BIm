Recently,I got _WebMathematica_. Initially I searched _WebMathematica_ documentation in _Mathematica_ documentation, but it doesn't return any results. For this I read tutorials; finally I placed the `webMathematicaDocumentation` folder in the following link.               FileNameJoin[{$InstallationDirectory, "AddOns", "Applications"}]      After that, I reopen _Mathematica_ and search for _webMathematica_ functions in the _Mathematica_ documentation center. It shows all the results. Out of all functions, I read `HTMLTableForm` description, if you want to call this function, first you should evaluate the `MSP HTML` package. This package corresponds to _webMathematica_ layout. So I copied all the packages, which are under `webMathematica\WEB- INF\Applications` and placed them in `FileNameJoin[{$UserBaseDirectory, "Applications"}]`. Again, I reopen _Mathematica_ , directly searched for `HTMLTableForm` and evaluated `MSP HTML` package. It's working fine. But my doubt was, is this a good way for placing all the packages in `Application` folder. Or is there an efficient way?
