I would expect the following to output the same grids               {Grid[{{1, 2}, {3, 4}}, ItemStyle -> {, , {{1, 1} -> Directive[30]}},        Background -> {, , {{1, 1} -> Red}}, Frame -> All],      Grid[{{1, 2}, {3, 4}},        ItemStyle -> {, , {{1, 1} -> Directive[Background -> Red, 30]}},        Frame -> All],       Grid[{{NumberForm@1, 2}, {3, 4}},        ItemStyle -> {, , {{1, 1} -> Directive[Background -> Red, 30]}},        Frame -> All]}      instead of ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/MoZkC.jpg) **Update:** The following should all produce identical grids and in fact they (almost) do - provided you mix and match between different Mathematica versions:                {Grid[{{1, 2}, {3, 4}},ItemStyle -> {None, None,{{1, 1} -> Directive[30]}},Background -> {, , {{1, 1} -> Red}}, Frame -> All],        Grid[{{1, 2}, {3, 4}},ItemStyle -> {{} , {},{{1, 1} -> Directive[Background -> Red, 30]}}, Frame -> All],        Grid[{{NumberForm@1, 2}, {3, 4}},ItemStyle -> {Automatic,Automatic, {{1, 1} -> Directive[Background -> Red, 30]}}, Frame -> All],       Grid[{{Item[1, BaseStyle -> {Background -> Red, FontSize -> 30}],2}, {3, 4}},Frame -> All],       Grid[{{Item[Style[1, 30], Background -> Red], 2}, {3, 4}},Frame -> All]}      **V6:** ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fC03F.png) **V7** ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ChMiV.jpg) **V8** ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zsmP8.jpg) **V9** ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Vlm0g.jpg) The "almost" is that the second Grid - perhaps the cleanest implementation - is yet to fire but perhaps in V10 ...? (As a side note, n.b. the alternative padding (`None`,`Automatic`,`{}`,`,`}) to reach the cell specification in the `ItemStyle` option - maybe one day argument positions might more seamlessly combine with their structure? ) **Upshot:** There seems to be a bug in combining values for the `Background` option with other styling within a single `Directive` but this can be easily overcome by using both specifications as per the first Grid above.
