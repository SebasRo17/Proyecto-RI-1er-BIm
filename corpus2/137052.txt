A large system has already been done in visual fox pro. They want to add more requirements to a module and make some changes to the system.At the same time they are thinking about migration to .net. Some parts like report generation has been done in .net using visual fox pro database and loaded in vfp. Is it a good idea to start migrating database as well? I mean is it good to create database (and tables) for the module for new requirements and changes? I think this will cause problem and difficulty to maintain the software. How is the process of data migration initiated? Should it be done gradually (partly in visual fox pro and partly in sql) or should it be done all at a time?
