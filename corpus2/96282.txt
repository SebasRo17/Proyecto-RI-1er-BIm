The Apache 1.0 license includes an advertising clause: **Apache** : > All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this *   >  software must display the following acknowledgment: * "This product > includes software developed by the Apache Group * for use in the Apache HTTP > server project (http://www.apache.org/)." I find the phrase "mentioning features or use of this software" unclear if I distribute Apache 1.0 licensed code with other code. Does "this software" mean the Apache licensed component or the whole software package. For example, if I am only using Apache licensed code for encryption, does the advertising clause only appear if an advertisement mentions encryption or does it apply even if the advertisement doesn't mention any functionality provided by the Apache licensed code?
