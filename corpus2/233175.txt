this is a kind of data i have to de-serialize               {         "id": "M:11427",         "title": "DAX30",         "nextStartId": "S:727831",         "sections": [             {                 "type": "HIGHLIGHTS",                 "baseResults": [ values of type highlights ],                 "hasMore": true             },             {                 "type": "CHART",                 "hasMore": false,                 "chartTypes": [ string values ]             },             {                 "type": "TWEETS",                 "baseResults": [ values of type tweets ],                 "hasMore": true             }]     }      I have to serialize & deserialize them all. I want to create something that can hold the values corresponding to baseResults. there is a main class that represent the whole json               class Data      {     ...     ObservableCollection<Section> sections{get;set;}     ...     }      then there is a class that represents the data in **sections** array of main json               class Section     {     string type{get;set;}// thi elements decides what kind of data would be in baseResults     dynamic baseResults{get;set;} //it should hold ObservableCollection of either Highlights or Tweets etc.     }      base class for type of data coming in **baseResults** array is an abstract class `class CategoryData` and its children are `class Highlights` & `class Tweets` I am using `dynamic` since I can not assign an `ObservableCollection<CategoryData>` with `ObservableCollection<Highlights>`. But I don't want to use this dynamic or object type instead I want something relevant. please suggest me what could be a better approach for this problem.
