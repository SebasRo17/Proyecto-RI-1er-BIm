When choosing a title for a new issue, there are several grammatical options to choose from. Here are four different options for an example issue I just made up:   * **Descriptive** : "Newlines are not stripped when multi-line headers are parsed"   * **Imperative - negative** : "Avoid leaving newlines when parsing multi-line headers"   * **Imperative - context first** : "Fix parsing of multi-line headers: strip newlines"   * **Imperative - desired action first** : "Strip newlines when parsing multi-line headers" At my workplace the issue titles alternate between all of these formats, but I keep thinking it's better to pick a convention and stick to it. Which option (from the above, or a different one) is the preferred one, i.e. the one that will minimize the effort of developers reading these issues? **Edit:** as noted in the comments, different issue types may warrant a different choice of grammar, where an especially important distinction is between bugs and new work. To make the question more specific, let's say we choose, as msell offers in his answer, the descriptive option. Now let's look at a suggestion to improve an existing feature:   * "Add city information to geolocation" If we stick to the descriptive grammar, we should replace that title with   * "City information missing from geolocation" However, this seems less clear, since the lack of city information is not a bug, it is the expected behavior. The reporter is merely suggesting to improve that behavior. So it seems the imperative option is the way to go with that issue. Let's look now at an entirely new feature. Consider these options:   * "No ability to export report to XML"   * "Add ability to export report to XML"   * "Export report to XML" Describing the current behavior seems even more ridiculous here, but the imperative option doesn't look so good too. The third option simply describes the new feature itself, which might be the way to go here, assuming the issue has meta-data that indicates this is a “new feature” issue.   * **So what's more important - sticking to one convention, or matching the grammar to the issue?**   * **Where would you draw the line between a descriptive title and an imperative title?**   * **When would you describe the current behavior and when the desired behavior?**
