Here is a simple list:               l={1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0}      To get the position of non-zero elements I use `Position` with `Except`:               Position[l,Except[0]]      Mathematica 9.0.1 returns               {{0}, {1}, {3}, {4}, {6}, {8}, {9}, {11}, {13}, {15}, {}}      I can't figure out why the first element is `{0}` and the last one is `{}`. If I use `Cases` it works as expected:               Cases[l,Except[0]]          {1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1}      What am I missing here?
