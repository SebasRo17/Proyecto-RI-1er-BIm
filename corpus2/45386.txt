I intend to get the certification but am not completely sure how to effectively prepare myself. So I'm wondering if you have any advice on the matter; in particular I would like to know:   * What should the basic learning/practicing plan look like?   * Which book (set of books) should be considered?   * Which practical exercises should be performed? **NOTE:** I've got several years of corporate experience (mostly web apps, though), but I want to be 100% sure I'll pass the test (that's the reason the issue is raised).
