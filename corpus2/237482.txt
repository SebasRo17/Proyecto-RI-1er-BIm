I have a C# application that is developed with VS 2010 pro. The ultimate version would have a sequence diagram feature. Since I will "create" my sequence diagram manually, how do I deal with quite long method names?               object.createPathForCustomerIDblablablabla_click()      Do I just use the method names as they are already given? Use a shorter name in the sequence diagram? I would like it to fit on a A4 page.
