I'm trying to create some "publication quality" figures, but _Mathematica_ is fighting me all the way. So my question is: **Should I switch to Origin?** Please help! * * * Well, all joking aside: I'm trying to create a multipanel figure. Here is an example:               p1 = Plot[100 Sin@x, {x, -5, 5}, Frame -> True,         FrameLabel -> {"XXX", "YYY"}, LabelStyle -> Large,         ImageSize -> 400, ImagePadding -> {{100, 1}, {0, 10}}];     p2 = Plot[5 Sin@x, {x, -5, 5}, Frame -> True,         FrameLabel -> {"XXX", "TTTT"}, LabelStyle -> Large,         ImageSize -> 400, ImagePadding -> {{100, 1}, {40, 0}}];     Column[{p1, p2}, Spacings -> 0]      ![Example image](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Skpd1.png) So the real question is: **How can I align the TTTT and YYYY axes labels?** I also tried using grid, with separate labels but then the TTTT is not centered on the axis, but is too low.
