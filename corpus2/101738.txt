I really am a starter with OCR, and would like to implement an OCR system. Any pointers on where I can find the introductory material, with the programming kept in mind, like what algorithms or data representation models do I need to master? I found Tesseract, on Google Code, an open-source project, but before I dive in to the code, I'd like to have the concepts under my belt. thanks in advance, Yati
