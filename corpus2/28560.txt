I'm making an `ErrorListPlot` where the error bars are a different color then the markers and it works, however, the error bars are drawn in front of the markers and it looks funny. See the following example               data = {{#1, #2}, ErrorBar[#3]} & @@@ RandomReal[1, {10, 3}];     Needs["ErrorBarPlots`"]     ErrorListPlot[      data,      PlotRange -> All,      BaseStyle -> AbsoluteThickness[2],      PlotStyle -> RGBColor[159/255, 158/255, 204/255],      PlotMarkers -> {{Graphics@{Opacity[1], Darker@Blue, Disk[]}, 0.01          5}}      ]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rEdpp.png) See how the error bars are drawn over the markers. I want them to be behind. I tried to use `Epilog` to redraw the markers but they don't have a uniform aspect ratio. `Epilog -> ({Opacity[1], Darker@Blue, Disk[#, 0.025]} & /@ data[[All, 1]])` ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/F9DlD.png)
