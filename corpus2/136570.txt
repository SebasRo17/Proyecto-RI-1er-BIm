For instance, I have a file with poor indentation (at least incoherant with the rest of the project). If I correct the indentation and commit, there will be a serious change in the file at a certain point in time, causing the diffs between versions before and after that serious change to be hard to read. How do you handle that king of minor logical modification causing major diffs ?
