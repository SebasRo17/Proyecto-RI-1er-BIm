I am able to plot a graph of all the differential equations, but I'd like a parametric plot of each individual one. Here is what I have so far.               new = Join[     Table[x[i]''[t] == - x[i][t] +        0.1*(x[i + 1][t] - 2*x[i][t] + x[i - 1][t]), {i, 1,       9}], {x[0]'[t] == -x[0][t], x[10]'[t] == x[9][t], x[0][0] == 0,      x[1][0] == 1}, Table[x[i][0] == 0, {i, 2, 10}],      Table[x[i]'[0] == 1, {i, 1, 9}]];          Solt[i_] = NDSolve[new, Table[x[i][t], {i, 0, 10}], {t, 10}]          Plot[Evaluate[Table[x[i][t], {i, 10}] /. Solt[i_]], {t, 0, 10}]          Table[ParametricPlot[     Evaluate[{x[i][t], x[i]'[t]} /. Solt[i_]], {t, 0, 10}], {i, 1, 10}]      What is wrong with the parametric plot. I've done this one before (without the added forcing term). It won't show up.
