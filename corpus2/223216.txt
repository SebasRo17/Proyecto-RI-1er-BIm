Is there a way to have a "critical update" for my app on the Google Play Store that would require the user to update the app to keep using it? For instance, let say I push an update that brings a few bugfixes. Nothing mandatory, the user updates it if he wants to: that's a non-critical update. Now, say I correct a very serious security issue on my app and want all the users to update to this version to keep using the app: this is a critical update. Basically, if there is a critical update and the user has not updated yet, he cannot use the app until he does so. Is this possible using the Play Store? Thanks for your feedback!
