Alright, so my situation is as follows:   * 1 Front End Developer   * 2 Back End Developers   * 1 QA Tester We all currently have Virtual Machines, or Second PC's set up with our windows environments to test. Now, the real issue is our Windows Environments expire. We're now running into points where randomly parts of our team forget to set up their refreshed environments, and we lose a few hours of productivity. **What I'm hoping to accomplish?** I'm looking to try and set up an external environment that we can all remote to and test on. Something that's separate and external. The only people that really need the environment regularly would be the Front End, and QA parts of the team. They'd also be working on the same section. Anyone have a suggestion for this setup? Has anyone accomplished something similar? Anyone have a suggestion for a better method behind consolidating these Windows Environments? **Clarifying:** by 'windows environments' I mean a local machine running a copy of windows to test on, not a Windows Server where we would deploy code.
