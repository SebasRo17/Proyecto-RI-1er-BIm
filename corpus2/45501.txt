I have _Mathematica_ 9.0.1, and I have problems with `PlotLegends` breaking the `ImageSize` directive. I defined               cm = 72 / 2.54;      to work with centimeters. I would like an output PDF with a width of, say, 9 cm.               Plot[Evaluate[       Exp[-4 f] /. {{f -> t}, {f -> t^2}}], {t, 0, 3},        BaseStyle -> {FontSize -> 11, AbsoluteThickness[1.5]},        PlotStyle -> {Blue, Red},        AxesLabel -> {"t"},         PlotLabel -> "Negativity",        ImageSize -> 9 cm,         PlotLegends -> Placed[{"OU", "FBM"}, {.8, .5}]]     Export["Neg_long_OU_FBM.pdf", %];      With this command, I obtain a PDF with size 6.48 × 4.31 cm. If I remove the `PlotLegends` option, I get the correct width of 9 cm. If I leave `PlotLegends` without the `Placed` directive (the legend is placed at the right of the Plot), I get 9.42 × 4.38 cm. Is this an expected behavior? How can I produce an output PDF with a 9 cm width and the legend inside the plot?
