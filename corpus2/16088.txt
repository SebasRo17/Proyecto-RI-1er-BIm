I created three interdependent `PopupMenu`s with names `demographic`, `region` and `custom`:               DynamicModule[{demographic = "Demographic", region = "Region", custom = "Custom"},      Dynamic@Grid@{{          PopupMenu[Dynamic[demographic], {"Demo1", "Demo2", "Demo3"}, "Demographic"],          PopupMenu[Dynamic[region], {"Region1", "Region2", "Region3"}, "Region"],          PopupMenu[Dynamic[custom], {"Custom1", "Custom2", "Custom3"}, "Custom"]          }}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/RtMnx.png) These controls should depend on each others' values. I want the followings:   1. `region` and `demographic` should be reset to `"Region"` and `"Demographic"` if any from `custom` is selected   2. `custom` should be reset to `"Custom"` if either `demographic` or `region` is changed I tried it with `If` and `Which` but it still won't work. How can I control these three `PopupMenu`s?
