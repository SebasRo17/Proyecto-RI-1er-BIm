**Question:** How to insert `Style`d text of unknown style and length into a graphics and have it wrap at a `Scaled` width? **Attempt:** I found the following two ways to wrap text when I was googling:               (* Based on: http://forums.wolfram.com/mathgroup/archive/2008/Mar/msg00977.html *)     syd[txt_, w_: 100, h_: 50] :=       Graphics[{Inset[Framed@txt, {0, 0}, {0, 0}, {w, h}]}]          (* Based on: http://forums.wolfram.com/mathgroup/archive/2008/Mar/msg00916.html *)     fred[txt_, w_: 150] := Graphics[{        Inset[Framed@Pane[Style[txt, LineIndent -> 0, TextAlignment -> Left], w], {0, 0}]        }]      But I want to handle text of unknown length so I did this to Syds solution:               (* Since {w,h}={100,50} worked for a string of length 460     it's reasonable to assume each character needs (100*50)/460 area units,     so any string should have area of StringLength[txt]*(100*50)/460 \     since w is given let      h=StringLength[txt]*(100*50)/(460*w)     *)     sydGuessHeight[txt_, w_: 100] :=       Graphics[{Inset[         Framed@txt, {0, 0}, {0, 0}, {w,           StringLength[txt]*(100*50)/(460*w)}]},        PlotLabel -> Style["syd guess: w=" <> ToString[w], Red, Bold]]      A test:               txt1 = (StringJoin @@          Table["The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. ", {10}]);     txt2 = (StringJoin @@          Table["The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. ", {20}]);     Grid[Partition[Image /@ {         syd[txt1],         syd[txt2],         syd[txt2, 100, Automatic] ,         fred[txt1],         fred[txt2],         sydGuessHeight[txt2]}, 2]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YlGmH.png) This is all very inelegant and I still can't use it to wrap text of a `Scaled` width nor can I supply `Style`d text since any modification in font will break the guess.
