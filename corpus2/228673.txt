Obviously if the product owner judges solely based on whether the committed stories were done, it wouldn't be good, because then the team will just commit to fewer stories next Sprint. On the other hand if the team made a tremendous job and overcame huge technical problems, but the commitments were not met, its also not good. I think that some measure is needed though, because if there is no feedback from the product owner, the team doesn't know what to improve, if at all. So what, in your opinion, are the criteria for the success of the Sprint?
