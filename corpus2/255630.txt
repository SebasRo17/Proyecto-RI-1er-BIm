my problem is may be complicated, I'll try to detail I cross compiled opencv for ARM (raspberry pi) from my host, and everything works fine. I also tried to cross compile an example and it also worked, i got an executable. but once the executable transferred to the raspberry, I cannot execute it and I get the following error: error while loading shared libraries: libopencv_core.so.3.0: can not open shared object file: No such file or directory. on my host, in my opencv's build folder, I have a "install" folder in which there are four subfolders: "bin", "share", "include", "lib". what am i suposed to do with these folder ?? i think i must use their content but don't know how. where and how do I install the cross compiled libraries in raspberry ?? how could i fix that error ?? thanks in advance
