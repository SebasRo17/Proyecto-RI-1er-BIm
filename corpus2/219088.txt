If you have different database per customer as there is no need to share any data between them does the same apply if a customer has multiple stores ?   I believe that it is easier to do queries for statistics (some require 4-6 table join) if they are at a single schema rather than multiple schemas.   But everyone (haven't done anything yet) in team believes that cross schema queries is the way to go.They claim that postgres supports it well. Which is the way to go?
