I came across a problem when evaluating the following integral: $\int_0^t \sqrt{9 x^4+1} \, dx$ Now, when I evaluate that, I get               ConditionalExpression[t Hypergeometric2F1[-(1/2), 1/4, 5/4, -9 t^4], t >= 0]      The issue is if t is negative. If I do this $\int_0^{-5} \sqrt{9 x^4+1} \, dx$ I get               -5 Hypergeometric2F1[-(1/2), 1/4, 5/4, -5625]      That seems okay, since it's a number. However, if I do this $\int_0^t \sqrt{9 x^4+1} \, dx\text{/.}t\to -5$ I get "Undefined". The issue is that I need to keep t symbolic, but still be able to use negative numbers later. I don't understand why t must be positive, especially since Mathematica seems to be able to compute it when it's negative. Does anyone know why this is happening, or what I can do to fix it? EDIT: I'm actually looking for a general solution for any function. This code is being used to calculate arc length of any function (in this case, x^3). This is just an example of it not working. Here is my actual code:               baseFunction = Function[x,x^3]     secondFunction = Sin     r[t_] = FullSimplify[p0[t] + norm[t]*a*secondFunction[b*Integrate[Sqrt[1 + Derivative[1][baseFunction][x]^2], {x, 0, t}]], Element[t, Reals]]      p0 and norm are 2D vector functions, and a and b are constants. I want to be able to use any function for baseFunction, though, which is why I need a general solution.
