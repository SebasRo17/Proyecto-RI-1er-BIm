I have a project with a friend, and we make some work in Mathematica. He is not very good at Mathematica, and I have made some long necessary formulas we need. I would like to show what I've made but only show what's important. Therefore I need to hide some of the input but not all of it. I have made some research and found this:               AutoCollapse[] := (If[$FrontEnd =!= $Failed,SelectionMove[EvaluationNotebook[], All, GeneratedCell];      FrontEndTokenExecute["SelectionCloseUnselectedCells"]])      The problem with this is it hides all input when used. The example i made below, is it possible in some way, or do I have to break it up into two different inputs?               "In(1):      1+1     3+3     Out(2):     1+1     2+2     3+3"
