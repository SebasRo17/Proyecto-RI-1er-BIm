I am preparing a presentation on Mathematica and realized that though I made the GroupOpeners visible in the working regime (through the OptionInspector), they are invisible in the regime of the slide show. My question: how to make the GroupOpeners visible both in the Working and SlideShow regimes? Mma 9.0.1 WinXP and Win7. Later edit: 1) There is a possibility to use the OpenerView. But this makes all constructs a bit too heavy.   2) I apologize for a wrong term I used. It is not presentation, but a slide show regime where I need to have the openers. Now I corrected it.
