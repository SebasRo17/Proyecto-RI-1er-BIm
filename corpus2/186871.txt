When you look at the code for the Winforms Designer, you see things like this:               this.label1.Font = new System.Drawing.Font("Microsoft Sans Serif", ... etc.      instead of               using System.Drawing;     label1.Font = new Font("Microsoft Sans Serif", ... etc.      The same is true of tools like Linq to XSD, XSD2Code and, I suspect, of Linq to SQL. These tools generate hoards of code with extremely long fully- qualified names. Wouldn't it be easier to generate the appropriate `using` statements, and ditch the long names? Or is there some technical reason for this that I'm missing? * * * **Note:** For those folks that are baffled by the notion that I might want these classes to actually be readable by a human, note that this is exactly my goal. I have an XSD with about 300 classes in it, I don't want to write them all by hand, and yes, I'd like them to look like ordinary code written by humans.
