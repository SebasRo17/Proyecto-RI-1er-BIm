A project has recently come to my attention but i have no idea where to start or even if its possible. The idea revolves around programming a clock that is displayed inside a digital photo frame. The user would then be able to put different pictures corresponding to different times inside a usb pen for example, which would load as soon as you put the usb in. The project itself would be a really neat project - if it was just on a computer. I have no idea if what im talking about it even possible on a digital photo frame and if it is what language? Anyone who has any input at all would be great. My current idea is to maybe have a small device at the back, SSD, that runs the program through a screen, completely by passing standard digital photo frames, again though i dont know how to begin with this. And yes ive tried google (although it helps to know what to google).
