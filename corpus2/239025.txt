In my company, we have had a policy of tagging every release. Someone new joined, and he suggested that instead of formally using a Tag, we could just leave a comment for the release build when it is checked in. I like using a Tag, but, obviously, we can also get to the source code for a build also by looking for the comment. The only advantage I see is that because our product spans multiple technologies, we can group the source code for both in the same directory with a folder for each. **Is there some other advantage of tagging releases that I'm missing?** BTW, we are using SVN.
