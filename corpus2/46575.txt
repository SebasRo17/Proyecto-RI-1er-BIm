(I am new to Workbench) I have 2 or 3 Mathematica frontend sessions open with a few of them running some long-running codes. When I try to open/edit a code in Workbench, I see that it sometimes it attaches itself to the "busy" frontends. (This is not useful since any new evaluations are queued up)   * How does Workbench interact with Mathematica to decide which frontend to attach to?   * Is there a way in the settings, to force the Workbench to open its "own" new kernel for each session and keep reusing it?   * Is there a way to force the Workbench to open the code (and hence attach to) in a particular frontend session, which is free, so that I can continue coding/debugging?
