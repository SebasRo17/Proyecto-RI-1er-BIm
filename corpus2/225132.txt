I can certainly see the need for CLAs with a terser license like MIT or BSD, but the more verbose Apache seems to already have that type of verbiage in it. I would prefer to not add this level of complication an open source project if it is not necessary with the Apache 2.0 license. CLAs seem to primarily grant a copyright license and a patent license from the contributor to the project, both of which are already in the text of the Apache 2.0 license (sections 2 and 3). If I am using the Apache license, do I really need to also add the extra requirement for contributors to sign a CLA? I basically want to get the general benefits of a CLA (like the non-ambiguous right to relicense, though the contributor maintains ownership) without making contributors fill out a bunch of information and sign a contract in some third-party form. Doesn't the act of cloning a repository, modifying code, and sending a pull request indicate agreement to the terms of the associated license? Section 5 of the Apache 2.0 License explicitly states that contributions shall also be under Apache 2.0: > **Submission of Contributions** : Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any > Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the > Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without > any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing > herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement > you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions. When combined with Sections 2 & 3 regarding grant of copyright license and patent license "...to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, sublicense..." it would seem that Apache 2.0 already covers the project's bases regarding submissions. Or am I misunderstanding a possible difference between a "sublicense" and actually changing the license of the project? (Since the Open Source Licensing Q&A site is still a just a proposal, I will accept IANAL answers here.)
