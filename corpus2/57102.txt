Let's say I have               Solve[x^4 + 3 == 0, x]      with output               {{x -> -(-3)^(1/4)}, {x -> -i (-3)^(1/4)}, {x ->i (-3)^(1/4)}, {x -> (-3)^(1/4)}}      how do i lose the "x->" part of each string within this list and get something like               {-(-3)^(1/4), -i (-3)^(1/4), i (-3)^(1/4), (-3)^(1/4)}      Thanks for the answers/links. Judging by the answers I realise now that I have formulated my question poorly. I wanted to know how I lose symbols that are in front of a specific symbol. Let's have a look at two more examples:               list={a: horse, b: chicken, c: fish}      how do I lose "a: ","b: ","c: " or               list2={section 1, section 2, section 3}      how do I lose "section"
