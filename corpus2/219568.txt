I have been using git for about four months now. While I like most of its features, I find it rather inconvenient that multiple developers can make concurrent changes to the same file and then a need for merging ensues. In fact, I would prefer waiting for a file to get unlocked over tedious and brain hurting merges. I was wondering if there was a team etiquette or workflow to circumvent this terrible predicament. In my ideal world of development, there would never be a need to merge. E.g. is there a combination of hooks, commands, and workflows for git in order to have a remote repository notified when a local repository changes a file so that other developers get a git notification if they themselves try to modify the same file concurrently (e.g. when they run `git status` or something like that)?
