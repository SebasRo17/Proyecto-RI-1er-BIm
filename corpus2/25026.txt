I'm trying to solve for Mach number based on the given Prandtl-Meyer function, however I keep getting odd error. Here is my code:               g = 1.4          v2 = 54          Solve[v2 == (Sqrt[(g + 1)/(g - 1)]*             ArcTan[Sqrt[(g - 1) (M2^2 - 1)/(g + 1)]] -             ArcTan[Sqrt[M2^2 - 1]])/Pi*180, {M2}];      This is the website that has the function I'm trying to solve. Any help would be greatly appreciated. ## UPDATED:               g = 1.4          v2 = 54.76          M2 := FindRoot[       v2 == (Sqrt[(g + 1)/(g - 1)]*             ArcTan[Sqrt[(g - 1) (x^2 - 1)/(g + 1)]] -             ArcTan[Sqrt[x^2 - 1]])/Pi*180, {x, 3}]     M2
