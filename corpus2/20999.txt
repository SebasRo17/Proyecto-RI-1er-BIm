After running a `RegionPlot3D` named "testplot" on my desktop, I followed an earlier suggestion from the forum and saved it using:               DumpSave["testplot.mx"].      I then saved and closed the notebook, quit _Mathematica_ and copied the notebook to my laptop. At this point, I re-opened the (copied) notebook and tried to retrieve the plot by using `DumpGet["testplot.mx"]`, but this failed. The plot took 60 mins of run time, and would take even longer on my laptop. The procedure I followed must be incorrect because I am certain this simple transfer can be done successfully allowing me to open the plot on my laptop without re-running. Does anyone have any suggestions?
