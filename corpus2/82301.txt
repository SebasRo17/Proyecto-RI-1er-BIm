My entry-level position suddenly sprung a proprietary scripting language into everyone's lap. Think of it as PASCAL/PERL. Anyway, since this is an entry-level job, I'll definitely be moving on some time in the future. Would it be wise to list that I have experience using proprietary languages on my resume? I figure it would imply that I am quick to learn new style and syntax on the fly, but that seems like an unnecessary perk to a career that involves years of study.
