If I plot many graphs with some standard set of options. Is there a way to store this set so that i can have better overview/structure over my plotting commands? example, I plot a function f[x] with a set of options:               Plot[f[x], {x, 0, 1}, PlotRange -> All, Axes -> False, Frame -> True,         PlotStyle ->Black, LabelStyle -> Directive[FontFamily -> "Symbol"],          FrameStyle -> AbsoluteThickness@1, BaseStyle -> {PrivateFontOptions ->         {"OperatorSubstitution" -> False}}, AspectRatio -> 0.5/GoldenRatio, ImageSize -> 226]      I would like to reduce the above to something like:               plotoptions1={PlotRange -> All, Axes -> False, Frame -> True,           PlotStyle -> Black, LabelStyle -> Directive[FontFamily -> "Symbol"],           FrameStyle -> AbsoluteThickness@1, BaseStyle -> {PrivateFontOptions ->          {"OperatorSubstitution" -> False}}, AspectRatio -> 0.5/GoldenRatio, ImageSize -> 226}      and then make a graph:               Plot[f[x], {x, 0, 1}, plotoptions1]      This structure does not work, I get the error:               Plot::nonopt: "Options expected (instead of plotoptions1) beyond position 3 in      Plot[f[x], {x, 0, 1}, plotoptions1]. An option must be a rule or a list of rules"      But I thought plotoptions1 was a list of rules, so what should I do?
