I am looking for some ideas here. I read the article How should code reviews be Carried Out and Code Reviews, what are the advantages? which were very informative but I still need more clarity on the question below. My Question is,   1. Being the target developer, can you suggest some best practices a developer can incorporate before his code is going get reviewed.     * Currently I practice the following methods        * PPT for a logical flow        * Detailed comments. **Issue: Even though I have implemented the above practices, they do not help on the review. The problem I faced is, when certain logic is referred, I keep searching for the implementation and the flow and too much time is wasted in the process and I get on peopleâ€™s nerve.** I think a lot of developers would be going through what I am going through as well.
