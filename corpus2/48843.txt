I know that one can modify the StandardForm style so that all input and output codes (and maybe other things too) follow that style. This makes it tricky to make input code different from output code (though this problem has been solved here) because the StandardForm is the overriding style for both inputs and outputs. Here I have an opposite problem with formatting texts. I want all text fields in my notebook to have the same font, and that includes the style of Title, Subtitle, Sections, Text, Item, Subitem, and so on. Of course I could set all of them to be the same font in my stylesheet, but I'm wondering if there's a style that I could change and that would apply that change to all texts. That way if I want to change the font of my texts in the future, I could just change that one style instead of changing all text styles one by one. In other words, is there any equivalence to StandardForm for text fields?
