I am currently studding OpengGL with OpenGL Supebible 5th edition. I've found interested for me some C++ code that is distributed with the book (see also on google code). That code is under New BSD License. I am writing my software on C# with SharpGL wrapper and I'd like to know following things:   1. Can I rewrite that C++ to C#? **edid:** I'am interesting in using such things like GLBatch, GLShaderManager and some other thing from GLTools. Problem is that library is on C++, but I use C#.   2. How do I have to mark my source code if I put it somewhere like to my github account?    3. What disclaimer should be? Original disclaimer looks like:               /* GLShaderManager.h          Copyright (c) 2009, Richard S. Wright Jr.     All rights reserved.
