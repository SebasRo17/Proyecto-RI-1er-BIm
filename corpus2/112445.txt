Boost has recently become available on the project on which I'm working, and I don't have much experience with it. The library has so many parts and features that it's hard to know where to get started in learning it - especially since I'll be trying to learn it while making production code (so it can't slow me down too much). I would greatly appreciate it if someone could list around 3 to 5 features which are very useful in general, every-day programming and state why they're useful. Then I can start to learn those and use them - it'll at least give me a foothold in the library and a friendly place to start learning it/applying it :) Thanks in advance!
