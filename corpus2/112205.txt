My programming classes in school were C++, but I ended up working a job doing C# for the last few years. If there was a position that required say 1 or 2 years experience in C++, would my experience in C# be worthy of consideration? How effective could I be in such a position? So do I need to start out as an entry-level C++ programmer to gain the necessary experience?
