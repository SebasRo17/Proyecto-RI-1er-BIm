I'm a fairly experienced desktop .NET developer with a solid feel for MVVM and WPF, and I've worked with JavaScript, jQuery and HTML/CSS in the past - though I'm pretty dated and haven't had a ton of experience with the new frameworks (Angular, et al). My question is, for anyone who has had to do it, what are the key pain points and differences I should be aware of when working on an ASP.NET MVC project? I have a general sense of the MVC pattern and where it differs from MVVM, but ASP.NET tricks me by looking familiar, but with subtle and not-so-subtle differences in implementation and execution. I'm helping out with an ASP.NET project at work, and while my C# knowledge helps, my desktop habits seem to be a liability. Links to material I can review would be appreciated, or a succinct summary of what I need to change about my mindset.
