I use Apple's Numbers spreadsheet for a single thing, a double entry accounting model to understand complicated financial transactions. A current model depends on the value of a single initialization cell. I calculate this value in Mathematica using `Solve[]` as Numbers can't solve a system of equations. Currently I have to manually input this value in the Number's spreadsheet. Ideally I'd like the cell in Number's to call the Mathematica function. Does any means exist to do this? Excel/Link or Math/Link would appear to provide functionality similar to this, but reading through their respective documentation doesn't provide any clear way to do this with Numbers. I can write command-line code to do this (generally):               $ MathKernel -script file.m      which suggests that AppleScript or some other scripting language could do this if callable/runnable from Numbers. Perhaps all of this suggests a better or more general question: What means exist, if any, for calling a Mathematica function or script from applications outside of Excel or specifically applications programmed for J/Link or Math/Link?
