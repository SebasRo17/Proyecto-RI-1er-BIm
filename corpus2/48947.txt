I have several files, and I want to extract for each of them a table, and then select just numbers, and keep only rows with five elements. My code works fine during import               data = Import[#, "Table"] & /@     FileNames["*.txt",     NotebookDirectory[]] ; (*This line import only tables of numerical     values from txt files*)      but if I want to apply selection of numbers to my list of tables, simply doesn't work,               Select[#, NumberQ[#] & ] & /@ data      and I have to specify a level to make it work,               Select[#, NumberQ[#] & ] & /@ data[[1]]      and I am supposed to automate this for twelve tables, rather that typing for each element. Any suggestions what I am doing wrong? I think that my list of tables needs to be specified different, but I don't know how.
