I have gotten very familiar with the core functionality of Javascript and now I am aiming at learning DOM manipulation. I have already thought of learning jQeury for this but I don't know if it is good idea to learning it before first getting familiar with the core functionality of the DOM. Should I first learn the core functionality of the DOM and then learn jQuery? If so, why? Or should I just go on ahead and learn jQuery?
