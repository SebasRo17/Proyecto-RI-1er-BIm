I am a junior developer in South Africa. I just graduated from college last year. My current employers hired me as a developer but they do not give me anything to develop and I've been working here for 8 months now. How I do become a better developer? How do I grow? I do some development at home, but how can I get more exposure? I have looked for another job, but that's not the point. I do not want to give up, I want to become a better developer. How can I improve my skills?
