I'm wondering how to **plot the boundaries of each piece** of a bivariate piecewise function. Lets take for instance the following piecewise linear function $B_{111}(x,y)$:               B11[x_, y_] = Piecewise[{{1, 0 <= x <= 1 && 0 <= y <= 1}}]     B111[x_, y_] = Integrate[B11[x - t, y - t], {t, 0, 1}]      At the moment, I use the following Plot3D command to visualize the function:               Plot3D[B111[x, y], {x, -0.2, 2.2}, {y, -0.2, 2.2},             PlotRange -> Full, PlotPoints -> 25, Axes -> False,             Boxed -> False, Mesh -> None]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UCOHS.png) Although in this particular case the **boundaries of the individual pieces** are already visible due to low quality plot settings, how can I actively plot these boundaries (i.e. as mesh or wireframe) in the same visualization? **Edit:** In this case, it should result in a wireframe consisting of **six triangles** (and **one hexagon** ): ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/H75IO.png) Additionally, is it possible to add some kind of constraint to the `Plot3D` function, such that it only visualizes the actual function? In other words, it should exclude the parts where the function is not defined (i.e. outside the support assigned a grey color in the image below).
