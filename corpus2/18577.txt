I have written a code, and I need a little feed back.. I want to make the `Subscript` distributive across (1) addition and (2) multiplication to mimic short-hand for added vectors. For example, in $(p+2k)_i=p_i+2k_i$ the LHS is short-hand for RHS, where the index is not allowed to be on the coefficient 2. Finally, I need exception, where the numeric quantity 0 should be allowed to take an index: that is, $0_i$ should not go to $0$. My code is:               Clear[Subscript];          Subscript[Plus[a_, b___], idx_] :=        Subscript[a, idx] + Subscript[b, idx];          Subscript[Times[a_, b___], idx_] :=        Times[Subscript[a, idx], Subscript[b, idx]];          Subscript[a_?NumberQ, idx_] /; a != 0 := a;      What I did was to define `Subscript` as functions, which is already built-in Symbol in Mathematica. The code seems to really work, but I don't know if I deserve a pat-on-the-back for being clever, or be reprimanded for overwriting a built-in Symbol (or for any other bad coding behavior). Also, is there any obvious way anyone can see this piece of code going wrong? Thanks!!
