I have a `ListPlot` function               lp2 :=       ListPlot[{#} & /@ #1,         PlotMarkers -> {Graphics@{Rectangle[]}, #2},         AspectRatio -> 1,         AxesOrigin -> {0, 0},         PlotRange -> All,         PlotStyle -> Hue /@ RandomReal[1, {Length@#1}],         Epilog -> {GrayLevel[.3], PointSize[.02], Point@#1, Thick, Line@#1},         Frame -> True,         FrameTicks -> All      ] &      which attempts to add a unit rectangle centered on each point however this relies on having constant axis to scale the unit rectangle to fit the axis. When `PlotRange->All` the axis ignores the aspect ratio and pretty much everything else. Is it possible to alter this behavior or scale the rectangle to the size of the axis chosen by Mathematica?
