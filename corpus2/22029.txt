The best way to show what I want is by giving an example: How to go from               Exp[-a[x, y]] (g[x, y]*Derivative[1, 0][f][x, y])/h[x, y] +      Exp[-a[x, y]] (f[x, y]*Derivative[1, 0][g][x, y])/h[x, y] -      Exp[-a[x, y]] (f[x, y]*g[x, y]*Derivative[1, 0][h][x, y])/h[x, y]^2      to               Exp[-a[x, y]] D[f[x, y]*g[x, y]/h[x, y], x]      If the Exp were not there, i.e. the expression is a full derivative, then integrating would work 1               expr = With[{anti =      Integrate[(g[x, y]*Derivative[1, 0][f][x, y])/     h[x, y] + (f[x, y]*Derivative[1, 0][g][x, y])/     h[x, y] - (f[x, y]*g[x, y]*Derivative[1, 0][h][x, y])/h[x, y]^2,     x]}, HoldForm[D[anti, x]]]
