Suppose I have a very long expression (>500,000 characters) which contains a mixture of real and imaginary terms. e.g `x = g*m*o*p*q*s*v + a*c*f*g*m^2*o*p*q*s*v + c*g*h*m^2*o*p*q*s*v - a*c*g*h*m^2*o*p*q*s*v - B*g*m*o*p*q*s*v*w - g*m*o*p*s*v*x - (1-I*Sqrt[3])*(2*g*o*p*s*v + 2*a*c*f*g*m*o*p*s*v) + 2*c*g*h*m*o*p*s*v + (1+I*Sqrt[3])*(2*g*p*q*v + m*g*f*q*m*o*s*v)...` etc. I would like to seperate the real and imaginery terms and work with the real terms only. I am using `ComplexExpand[Re[x],TargetFunctions->(Re)}]` but I keep getting the message 'No more memory available. Mathematica has shut down.Try quitting other applications and then retry'. Is there a better way to discard the imaginary terms and group the real terms together without this problem?
