I have been in the process of generating documentation for an upcoming project. One of the features of the data available in this project is that it will be revisioned (or at least large parts of it will be). I came across the (as I understand it, very new) "Accept-Datetime" HTTP header. This looks absolutely perfect for enabling access to revisioned data using existing interfaces. My question is this. Which return type should be used for:   1. A date received that is before the initial data date (I am thinking maybe 404 with body error description)?   2. Data that is requested using the header, but that does not support versioning (This is the really sticky one for me. Not sure whether an error, or just the normal data is better) Edit: For the moment, in the second case, I am tentatively putting code 406 - Not Accepted
