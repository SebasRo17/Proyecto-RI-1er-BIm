I am designing an application that has following flow:   1. User designs a form using web application ( **J2EE** backend application)   2. The form is sent to mobile device ( **Android** )   3. Mobile device User fills out the form designed in 1.   4. Results are synced with backend. One of my ideas is to create a common java UI library for creating the type of forms that I need. This library would also have a native renderers for different platforms (Web and Android would be implemented first). The whole point of it is to have a native experience on web and android side. Are there any existing solutions to meet the requirements that I have? Is it a good approach to achieve them?
