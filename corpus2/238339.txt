My application generates text files that need to be synced with remote servers, which may be windows or linux. Sync has to happen without user's intervention. I tried with rsync but windows doesn't come with rsync by default. Also it is not possible to supply password in the command line for rsync. Currently I'm going with ftp. But that seems like an inefficient way. Is there a way to rsync without user intervention? What are the ways to sync with a remote server programmatically? App is on nodejs.
