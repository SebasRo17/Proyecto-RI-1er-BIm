After each commit I bring up the Log Messages dialog and copy the log entry to the clipboard so I can include it in the issue tracking system. Eventually I hope to get SVN integrated with the system so this isn't necessary, but for now this is a great way to keep the two attached. Is there a way to automatically copy the last log entry to the clipboard or even a text file on commit without needing to manually bring up the Log Messages dialog?
