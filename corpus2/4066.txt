Suppose I have a plot like               LogLogPlot[2 x^5/3, {x,0.1,10}, GridLines->Automatic]      How can I achieve to get "custom" gridlines to reduce the number of horizontal lines?   I know how to do it with linear scaled plot. # Edit For linear scale I do basicly:               myGrid[{xmin,xmax,xstep}, {ymin,ymax,ystep}]:=     GridLines->{{#&,/@Range[xmin,xmax,xstep},{#&/@Range[ymin,ymax,ystep])}
