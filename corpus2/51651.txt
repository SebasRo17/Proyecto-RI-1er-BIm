I recall that it is possible to specify which independent variable is the "time" variable in `NDSolve`, but I can't find it documented anywhere. Does anyone recall how it works? I'm getting the following error because (I believe) `NDSolve` is confused about which is the time variable:               NDSolve::bcedge: Boundary condition [...] is not specified on a single edge      of the boundary of the computational domain.      I think this is because my _initial_ condition is inside (not an extremum of) the (time) domain of the interpolating function that specifies it. **Update:** `TemporalVariable` is an option of `NDSolve`MethodOfLines`. Therefore, it does not work directly as an option in `NDSolve`, and should be called in the following manner:               Method ->       {         "MethodOfLines",         "TemporalVariable" -> t       }      However, this did not solve my problem (see the comments).
