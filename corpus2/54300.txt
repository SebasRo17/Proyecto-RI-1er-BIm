We're looking at a replacement for our CMS which runs on Oracle. The new CMSes that we've looked at can in theory run on Oracle, but   * most of the vendor's installs run off of MySQL   * vendor supports install of their CMS on MySQL, and a "theoretical" install on Oracle   * the vendor's dev shops use MySQL   * none of them develop/test against Oracle Our DBA team works exclusively with Oracle, and doesn't have the bandwidth to provide additional support for a highly available and performing MySQL setup. They could in theory go to training and get ramped up, but our time line is also short (surprise!). So ... I guess my question(s) are: If you've seen a situation like this, how have you dealt with it? What tipped the balance either way? What type of effort did it take? If you're to do it over, what would you do differently ... ? Thanks! KM
