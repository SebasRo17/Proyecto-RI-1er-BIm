If I try to make a table `SimpleTable` and to interpolate a function of two variables, I encounter a problem. For example:               SimpleTable = Table[{j, i, 2 i - 3 j}, {j, 0, 5}, {i, -5, 5}];      and interpolation:               f := Interpolation[SimpleTable]      and if I try:               f[1, 2]      I get the error messages: > Interpolation::udeg: Interpolation on unstructured grids is currently only > supported for InterpolationOrder->1 or InterpolationOrder->All. Order will > be reduced to 1. >> > > Interpolation::inder: The order-2 derivative of {0,-2,-4} is not a tensor of > rank 2 with dimensions 3. >>*) To me the table `SimpleTable` seems to have a "rectangular domain". What is wrong here? How to tackle this problem, to get an interpolated function from the table? Does the domain have to be changed? Although the unstructured grids have already been mentioned here, I was hoping that somebody could make clear how to interpolate a function from 3-D data, without the unstructured grid warning.
