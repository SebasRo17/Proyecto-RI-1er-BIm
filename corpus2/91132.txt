I am looking for a SAAS solution that offers project management, time tracking, invoicing and file sharing (to share with clients) as well as source control, work item management and team management for a programming team. In other words, a complete solution for a consulting programmer/programming team.   I am looking at aceproject.com, zoho, basecamp, etc, but they all miss one of more of these features. Do you know any solution to recommend?
