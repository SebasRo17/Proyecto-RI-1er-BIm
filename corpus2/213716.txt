I have .NET 2.5 installed in my computer unit, as a beginner I used VB.net As I went along I've also installed new .dlls that would help me with my VB.net programming Now, I want to study java as well, leading to Android programming. If I install the JDK 7.0, can I still be able to program in VB.net? Will installing JDK overwrite .dlls essential to the .NET framework? Should I get a new developing PC that focuses with JAVA/Android development?
