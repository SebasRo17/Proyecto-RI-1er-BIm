I obtained the images from a Magneto Optic Kerr Effect system from which I have to do some calculations. I cannot calculate the desired information from the images. The details are as follows: ![The image I obtain from the system looks like this:](http://i.stack.imgur.com/eYXlo.jpg) From the image I have to calculate the length and width of the black part of the image (which can be assumed to be a rectangle). So, I first use the command for finding the radius and threshold of the image and then convert it into a binary image. The command I use is               Manipulate[EdgeDetect[image, r, t], {{r, 2, "radius"}, 1, 10},          {{t, 0.1, "threshold"}, 0, 0.5}]      And then I get this result after detecting the edges of the black rectangle.![The result after manipulate and edgedetection](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0gU4F.jpg) Now I have to calculate the width and the length at several different positions in the black box and then take the average to get the mean result. As I know that I will definitely get the result in pixels which I can then convert to real world measurements using the scale bar, but I am unable to calculate the length and the width. Since I am new to _Mathematica_ as well as image processing, help will be highly appreciated.
