This is somewhat related to my other question, but is actually different. I would like to license a Windows Phone application under the GPL. All other Windows Phone Marketplace issues aside (I'll ask those on the forums), I'd like to include icons that ship with the SDK in my application. While this is common practice (documentation points to the icons' location), I'm not sure if I'd be forcing GPL on the icons (a move expressly forbidden by the Application Provider Agreement). How is this usually handled in GPL or am I simply out of luck? **EDIT** The icons in question are copied into the project's source tree and distributed with the application. The license that ships with the SDK states that you may **not** : > modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code [incl. the > icons] so that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. An > Excluded License is one that requires, as a condition of use, modification > or distribution, that > >   * the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or >   * others have the right to modify it. > My question now becomes: can I distribute the icons with my GPL'd application in any way (for example, by including provisions in my license text) that would not violate either the GPL or the SDK agreement?
