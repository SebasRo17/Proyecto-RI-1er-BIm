From what I can tell, most developers will use heavy jQuery DOM manipulation tactics to deliver their updated AJAX views. Once things get out of hand, they may consider refactoring using template engines such as Mustache.js. Is this a valid assessment of a natural progression to use a template engine? When I begin a new AJAX heavy project, is the best practice to use a template engine or is jQuery DOM manipulation good enough? I have yet to find any negatives with using a template engine. The maintainability, efficiency and simplicity seem to be the redeeming qualities. Please advise me on whether JavaScript template engines should be used or not by default.
