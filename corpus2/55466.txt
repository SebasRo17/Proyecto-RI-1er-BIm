Nested Dialogs Experiment The InsideDialog works as expected when invoked from the command line. When started as a button action inside OuterDialog, it takes a very long time to start up (many seconds). When a button is selected, the Inside dialog never returns. Is there a clean way to make this happen without messing with undocumented system internals?               InsideDialog[] := Module[{ans},        ans = 0;        CreateDialog[{Button["  A  "  , DialogReturn[ans = "A"]],          Button["  B   "  , DialogReturn[ans = "B"]]}];        While[ans == 0, Pause[0.2]];        Return[ans];        ];          InsideDialog[]          (* Out[26]= A *)          lessonlist = {        "The Field Properties of \[DoubleStruckCapitalR] and \     \[DoubleStruckCapitalC]",        "Introduction to Vectors and Vector Spaces",        "Properties of Vector Arithmetic"};           OutsideDialog[] := Module[{ans2},        ans2 = 0;        CreateDialog[         Join[Button[#, DialogReturn[ans2 = InsideDialog[]], Method->"Queued"] & /@            lessonlist, {Button["Close", DialogReturn[ans2 = 1]]}]];        While[ans2 == 0, Pause[0.2]]; (* works OK if I do not wait here *)        Return[ans2];        ];           OutsideDialog[]          (* Out[29]= 1 *)
