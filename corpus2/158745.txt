I was thinking about different server-side languages and this question immediately cropped up in my mind. What was the first server-side programming language using which websites were being created? Was it java or some other language? Note: I think some languages became prime server-side because they provided or rather aimed to provide better tools and libraries for easy development. I agree Java was not primarly server-side but it provided better tools and hence was and is used a lot.
