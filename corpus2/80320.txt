Normally, the company where a programmer works has corporate licensed tools which are useful for programmer (ex: proprietary IDEs, reflectors, diagramming tools, office tools and PDF makers, etc.) Can I :   * Install it at home and use it for company projects?   * Install it at home and use it for personal projects (possibly commercial)?   * Use it at office for personal project (e.g. after office hours)? I am not strictly asking for legal advise here (though some legal point of view would be nice, too). But is it a right thing to do in general?
