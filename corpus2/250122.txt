I have known about the weird dingbat fonts since the first time I tried to change the font on MS word and stumbled upon them. Since then I never questioned them, I just thought hey cool. Now I have some questions. What is the purpose behind creating dingbat fonts? Is there anyone/entity that actually uses/needs these types of fonts?
