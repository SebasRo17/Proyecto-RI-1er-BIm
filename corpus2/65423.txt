What I mean is we always want to test something in the actual real world live production environment, regardless of any testing we do with any fake paypal credit card numbers or other sandboxed numbers. So instead of using our personal cards, I wonder if there is a credit company that will supply a fully feature credit card specifically for the purpose of this kind of real world testing? I suppose the answer may simply be just to get yourself a credit card and only use it for that, but I'd want to be sure it was 'out of the loop' when it came to affecting credit scores or that kind of thing.
