I have a function that is set up to write to a database with 10-20 standard variables with 10 fields each, but the application is going to a place where database access is not available. Can Mathematica read an Excel file and pick up the portions of the file that relate to one of these 20 variables, change them if needed and write the whole thing back again? If so, how would that be accomplished? Thanks!
