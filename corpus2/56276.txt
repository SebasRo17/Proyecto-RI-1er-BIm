I want to find all prime-palindromic numbers up to 5000. Prime-palindromic numbers are numbers that themselves and their reverse digits are both primes. For example, 31 is a prime-palindromic number because both 31 and 13 are prime. Here is my code, but it somehow does not work.                Select[Range@5000, PrimeQ[Join[FromDigits[Reverse[IntegerDigits[#]]], # ]] &]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/EChAO.jpg)
