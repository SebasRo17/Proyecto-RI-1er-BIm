The canonical books on software development is fairly well established. However, after reading through a dreadful book full of bad advice on managing programming teams this weekend I am looking for recommendations for really good books that focus on the management side of programming (recruiting, performance measurement/management, motivation, best practices, organizational structure, etc.) and not as much on the construction of software itself. Any suggestions?
