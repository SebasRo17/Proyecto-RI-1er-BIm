We have a prospect with FoxPro 2.6 (whatever it means) system. Our product integrates with other systems by the means of triggers (usually). We would place couple of triggers on X system and then just pull collected data for our use. This way there is no need to customize customers product and it works great(almost real time - we poll for changes every 30 seconds). Question:   1. Can I put triggers on FoxPro 2.6?   2. Can access FoxPro from .NET? Any catches/caveats?
