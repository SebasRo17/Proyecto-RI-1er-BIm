My company just recently invested in the Mono for Android tools for Visual Studio as we have a lot of .NET developers and were impressed with how powerful the monodroid tools seemed. After reading the ZDNet Post I was saddened to see that this project may be dead. Is there anyone out there who might know anything more about this than what is listed in that article? Apparently legions of developers were let go from the mono project but I'm wondering if it's true. Any information would be greatly appreciated. We just bought the Enterprise 5 license, which was pretty costly and I'd be pretty mad if it died after I just bought this thing and started learning it!
