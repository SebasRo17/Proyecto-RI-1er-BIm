The users for our software will want to upload potentially large amounts of files in bulk to our servers. It is then desired that we display the upload status any time the user views the upload screen. This doesn't have to be any more fancy than a progress bar with a percent status. ![Our user will want to upload many files at once and to see the status of their upload.](http://i.stack.imgur.com/04DEU.png) My question is, how can I keep track of the uploaded files and return them at any possible time with a simple GET request at '/upload/status'. A first solutions aims to keep track of the uploads requested and those processed in a database table. That way, it is as easy as querying the database any time the user wants to see his upload status. ![the uploaded files are saved to a database](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KHf7v.png) Is this a viable- and correct- solution to handling the state of file uploads in a REST service? Should I be looking for solutions elsewhere?
