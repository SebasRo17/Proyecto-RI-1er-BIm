A developer learns a lot of stuffs at work. For eg. Lets think of a Java or C++ developer, as years pass by he learns a lot about the technology, design patterns, new frameworks and etc ... This I think adds his work experience a good score to his profile, but               What makes a testers work experience important ?      I'm into Web Application testing an intern in a product based company for the past four and a half months. At my office employees who are two or three years ahead of me don't do the work in any way different than I do, They don look like they have learned anything great from their from work experience. _Is this the fate of a tester or is this happening only at my office ?_. I would love to hear answers from any of my fellow testers who have walked the path of testing :)
