i just basically realized that it's almost impossible to truly learn and master each programming language/technology before a new version is released. so my initial thought was to focus on the .net platform, but then what about the business domain side of the thing? does it make more sense to pursue more knowledge about the platform including taking MCPD, etc or does it makes more sense in the long run to focus on the business domain, i.e. web commerce and only things that is related? i'm just a starting up as programmer and would like to know what's a good way to direct myself to growth so that i could master a certain area for career growth. any tips or article would be nice ;)
