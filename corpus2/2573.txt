As part of my physics homework (which I do not need the answer for, as I did it by hand, and got the correct $$\frac{m_1 g-m_2 g \sin(\theta)}{-m_1-m_2}$$ as the answer) I would have liked to have solved the following system of equations as shown (i.e. put $a_1$ as `Subscript[a,1]` and not `a1` or something similar. The equations that I wanted to solve were:   1. `Subscript[m, 2] Subscript[a, 2 x] == T - Subscript[m, 2] g Sin[\[Theta]]`   2. `Subscript[m, 1] Subscript[a, 1 y] == T - Subscript[m, 1] g`   3. `Subscript[a, 2 x] == -Subscript[a, 1 y]` I tried the following, and was given `{}` as the answer (which is clearly false): `Solve[Subscript[m, 2] Subscript[a, 2 x] == T - Subscript[m, 2] g Sin[\[Theta]] && Subscript[m, 1] Subscript[a, 1 y] == T - Subscript[m, 1] g && Subscript[a, 2 x] == -Subscript[a, 1 y], Subscript[a, 1 y]]` It seems that there at least two problems with the equations that I am asking it to solve.   1. I do not think that it is treating $a_{1y}$ as a variable. When I typed a in the part of solve that asks for the variables that I am solving for, all terms that have `a` in them light up as blue, but when I enter the subscript, it loses that highlighting.   2. It would seem (at least to me) that a perfectly valid answer to `Solve` would be $-a_{2x}$ but that would be a useless answer, as I want the answer in terms of $m_1 , m_2 , g, \theta$ and not in terms of other "compound variables" **Note:** When I tried a "subscript-less" version (`Solve[m2 a2x == T - m2 g Sin[\[Theta]] && m1 a1y == T - m1 g && a2x == -a1y, a1y]` I still got `{}` as the answer. Using Mathematica 8. What is going on, and how can I enter the equations normally, and solve for them in terms of specific variables?
