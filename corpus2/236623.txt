I was looking at _Jcrop_ library code for scaled image size calculation, but I couldn't clearly understand algorithm used in following function: https://github.com/tapmodo/Jcrop/blob/master/js/jquery.Jcrop.js#L187               function presize($obj, w, h)     {       var nw = $obj.width(),           nh = $obj.height();       if ((nw > w) && w > 0) {         nw = w;         nh = (w / $obj.width()) * $obj.height();       }       if ((nh > h) && h > 0) {         nh = h;         nw = (h / $obj.height()) * $obj.width();       }       xscale = $obj.width() / nw;       yscale = $obj.height() / nh;       $obj.width(nw).height(nh);     }      I know that its using jquery image object and boxWidth and boxHeight as described on following link:   http://deepliquid.com/content/Jcrop_Sizing_Issues.html But I want to understand the algorithm used.
