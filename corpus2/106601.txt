I have to explain to some students the use of abstract classes and interfaces, as I have a very tecnical background, I would like to know if you would help me to define an easy explanation for junior. Simple definition: **What are the purposes of abstract classes, interfaces, and what is the difference between the two ?** **When is it appropriate to use one instead of the other?** Thanks.
