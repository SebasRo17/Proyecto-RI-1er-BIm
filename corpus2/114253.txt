I've been working as a vb.net ASP.NET web developer for the past 4 years, and I'm currently making the change over to C# Apart from school/sixth form qualifications, I'm currently lacking any industry related qualifications, and I'm keen to start working towards a Microsoft qualification. What would be the best suited qualification for me to work towards? Any relevant links would be most appreciated.
