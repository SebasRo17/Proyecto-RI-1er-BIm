Sometimes I have a graph and I want to make tweaks to the vertex locations. Is there any way to manually adjust graph vertex location by dragging? If I double click to edit, I can move around the vertex rendered shape (square) or the label inside the square, but not the vertex itself. Also, even if I could move the vertex, it is under the rendered square/circle which does not seem to move with it. I have been using `GraphPlot`. (Should I be using `Graph` instead? I don't really understand the difference.):               GraphPlot[Import["D:/dev/ProjectEuler/keylog.gv"],       VertexLabeling -> True, PlotStyle -> {Black},       VertexRenderingFunction -> ({EdgeForm[Black], White, Disk[#1, 0.08],           Black, Text[#2, #1]} &)]
