Robin condition is the boundary condition which combines the Dirichlet and Neumann condition at the same boundary. For example: At the boundary x = 0 to 2: I want to apply `u[x] = 0` for `x = 0 to 1` and `du/dx = 0` for `x = 1 to 2`. I think one of the possible approach is reformulate the PDE discretization using the finite difference method, and manual apply the Robin boundary condition on the systems of ODE. Could we trick that for `DSolve`, `NDSolve`?
