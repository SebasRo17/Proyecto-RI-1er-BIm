I have a team of skilled C# developers with vast experience in creating ASP.NET MVC applications. We will soon be starting a new big web site project based on the Drupal platform. My developers do not have any experience in Drupal or PHP and I want to make the transition as quickly and effective as possible. We decided to make this decision based on two factors:   1. In my organization there are a couple of teams competing on doing this project. None of the other teams has experience in PHP or Drupal, and I truly believe that my team would do it the best, whether it's ASP.NET or Drupal.    2. One of the requirements from higher management was that we won't build something from scratch, but use an existing foundation. Many of the requirements are available in plugins/modules for the various CMS.  I know this is not an ideal environment, but it's a given state and I have to make the best out of it. None of the .NET Framework based CMS supported all of our requirements. Since my team is dynamic in nature, I believe it can adapt to working with Drupal. Hiring other people is not an option, and sending them to a course will take too much time. I thought about dedicating a week in which each developer will study a specific subject and then will pass it on to the team. Any suggestions on how you would do it?
