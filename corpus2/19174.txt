Is Project Titan (Facebook email app) going to be a game changer from a programmers perspective? Although some details are still scarce, the internet is slowly learning more about this new software. From the perspective of a programmer, what if any functionality do you think this will bring to the mass communications sector of internet use? Will it in anyway be a "game changer" from the existing layer of highly successful web based email clients (such as hotmail, gmail, yahoo mail, etc) I'm interested if anyone thinks email fundamentally needs to change other than to add more "connectedness" to other sources of data such as social media profiles.
