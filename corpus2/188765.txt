I have some C++ knowledge and know that pointers are commonly used there, but I've started to look at PHP open source code and I never see code using references in methods. Instead, the code always uses a return value instead of passing the reference to the variable to the method, which then changes that variable's value and just returns it. I have read that using references uses less memory, so why aren't they used in PHP?
