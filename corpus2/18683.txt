From time to time I have to extract data from scanned papers or rasterized PDFs. Imagine a table of the following kind (but much longer): ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/lP6Yt.jpg) A naive application of `TextRecognize` on the image fails spectacularly:               "OOE-     20B-     70E~     20E-     90E-     70E-     70B-     30B-     30B-     ZOE     .50E+O2     .50E+02     .0OE+02     .O0E+O2     .00E+O2     .OOE+02     18E+O4     .30E+O3     .70E+03     10E+03      Did anybody use `TextRecognize` successfully on similar images?
