I'm having a bad time dealing with the `NonlinearModelFit` in Mathematica 8, since the result given is a bit imprecise. An example is given on potential regression, as follows:               data = {{0.9, 1.1}, {2, 2}, {6, 4.1}, {6.9, 4.5}, {9.9, 5.5},              {10.7, 5.9}, {14, 6.7}, {15.9, 7.3}}          NonlinearModelFit[data, b*t^a, {a, b}, t]      The result I get is: `1.34232*t^0.615024`, however it should be `1.23...*t^0.6548`. What am I doing wrong? I experience the same thing when I try to do a exponential regression (like this: `NonlinearModelFit[data, b*a^t, {a, b}, t]`).
