I currently work for a company, a big company. I have a contract that states that I need to ask for permission to have another job. Very standard I suppose. I'd like to start trying out some ideas for start ups. Some of them work without moving money (write a program, release it as shareware or something like that and see if people is interested), that's easy. But some ideas need to move money. One is, in some way, like Amazon's Turk Machine, where money should be involved since day 1. Without having to request permission from my current employer and having to set up a company, how can I give that idea a try?
