The cost of developing a feature in Agile is very high because it needs to be ready for shipment. It includes:   1. Significant bug fixing   2. Writing/updating and executing tests   3. Writing/updating the user manual   4. Polishing the UI design (placement of controls, color schemes, etc...)   5. Updating the documents for FDA (in our organization) When the cost is that high you are less likely to change the feature once you implement it. So does it make your less agile?
