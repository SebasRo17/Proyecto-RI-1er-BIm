I have a question about _Mathematica_ 's `SimilarityRules` defining (for e.g. `SequenceAlignment` function). So help centre clearly stands for > `SimilarityRules -> {{a_, a_} -> 1, {a_, b_} -> -1}`, giving a score of `+1` > for any pair of identical elements, and a score of `-1` for any mismatch, > deletion or insertion. Ok, I get it, but what if I want to give different score for mismatch, and different for indeles? I tried:               SimilarityRules -> {{a_, a_} -> 3, {{a_, b_} && {{a_!=""} && {b_ != ""}}} -> -8}       and many other combination of `{}`, `&&` positions, but it doesn't seem to help. Any suggestions, is it just a typo I'm doing, or it's rather a silly idea to define it like this?
