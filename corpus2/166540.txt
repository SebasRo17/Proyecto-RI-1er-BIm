> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  What should every programmer know about web development? I have built 10+ straightforward websites using the Symfony framework and Wordpress. Does this mean I am a web developer or a web designer? I set the sites up in Symfony and wrote the CSS/Javascript/HTML. I had to write themes for Wordpress and move some code about. What experience do I need to to be a web developer and not a designer? What experience distinguishes me from a designer that knows HTML and jQuery?
