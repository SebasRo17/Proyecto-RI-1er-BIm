Here is a toy example:               currentTimeStep = 0;     Dynamic[currentTimeStep]     pfun = ParametricNDSolveValue[               {y'[t] == a y[t], y[0] == 1}, y, {t, 0, 10000}, {a},               StepMonitor :> (currentTimeStep = t;), MaxSteps -> 100000            ];     pfun[1]      As you can see from the value of `currentTimeStep`, the variable is most of the time left without a numerical value. Is there a way to look at the current status of computation when using `ParameticNDSolveValue`?
