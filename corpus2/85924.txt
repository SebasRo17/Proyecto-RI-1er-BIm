I'm an intern working for a company for the summer. I've been warmly received and I manage to impress my manager a lot (I guess I'm more experienced than the other people he interviewed). Recently I've been developing a kiosk type application which will generate a simple GUI menu from a text config file a 4 year old could write. I love the project and it has become my baby. However, in the corporate world, whatever you develop for your employer...becomes theirs (or so I've heard). I would really love to be able to keep on working on the project after the summer and I would also want to open source it. How would I go about asking for this? The code doesn't have any company secrets and most of the people here advocate open sourced software.
