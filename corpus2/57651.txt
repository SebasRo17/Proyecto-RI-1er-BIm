**Question:**   Is there an open source license that requires that my name (or a name that I want to promote) will always be associated with a project and derivations of it? (Either within the copyright notice (Â©) or other.) **Motivation:**   \- My main motivation is reputation/career advancement. If it gained wide use, it could look very good on resume (I understand this is a long shot).   \- An additional benefit is that it would explicitly state to prospective employers that this code was used by myself before I started with the company and will continue to be used when I leave. **It is my understanding:**   I am aware that 99.9% of open-source projects never take off, and that I am taking a long shot in regard to advancing reputation/career. I understand that many don't read/respect licenses. I understand that open source projects take a lot of time to manage. I understand that 'Concensus-Based Development' is the best chance at motivating a community and that I may/will loose substantial control.
