I wonder why java defines homogeneous methods in two distinct classes: java.util.regex.Pattern and java.util.regex.Matcher. For example `split` method defined in `Pattern` class and `replaceAll` method defined in `Matcher` class. I think these two methods are homogeneous, why are they not defined in the same class? Have I understood it wrong? By "homogenous", I mean: `split` and `replaceAll` methods are utilities for String, why not defined in a class?
