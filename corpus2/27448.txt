I am trying to numerically integrate an equation that involves InverseErfc (embedded in the copula defined). The equation looks like the following: $$ \int_0^T \int_0^\infty \int_0^\infty e^{-Ab(s)x-Ar(s)y}\ f(x)\ c(F(x),G(y))\ g(y)\ dx\ dy\ ds\, $$ The function $\ f(x)$ and $\ g(x)$ are the density functions of $\ F(x)$ and $\ G(x)$ respectively, whereas the function $\ c(F(x),G(y))$ represents the copula chosen (in this case it's student-t copula). When combined, the student-t copula function with exponential marginals are called upon in MMA as GGE[Theta_,Alpha_, Beta_] in the program code.               (** Defining values of parameters & expressions **)     cr = 0.5; ar = -1; br = 0; Sigmar = 0.5; Gammar = 1; r0 = 0.0153; Betar = 100;      cb = 0.1; ab = -1; bb = 0; Sigmab = 0.05; Gammab = 1; b0 = 0.04; Betab = 200;     Theta = 0.5; T = 1; Rho = 4; DoF = 3;           compr = Sqrt[(cr ar)^2 + 2 (Sigmar Gammar)^2];      compb = Sqrt[(cb ab)^2 + 2 (Sigmab Gammab)^2];          Ar[s_] := (2 r0 (1 - Exp[-s compr]))/((compr - cr ar) + (compr + cr ar) Exp[-s compr]);      Ab[s_] := (2 b0 (1 - Exp[-s compb]))/((compb - cb ab) + (compb + cb ab Exp[-s compb]);          (** Define the copula - Student-t copula with exponential margins **)     GEE[Theta_, Alpha_, Beta_] := CopulaDistribution[{"MultivariateT", {{1, Theta}, {Theta, 1}},      DoF}, {ExponentialDistribution[Alpha], ExponentialDistribution[Beta]}];          (** Obtaining the density function of the above copula and its Laplace transform **)     GumExpExp := PDF[GEE[Theta, Betab, Betar], {x, y}];     P[u_, v_] := LaplaceTransform[GumExpExp, {x, y}, {u, v}]          (** The following is the expression I would like to calculate **)     chat = NIntegrate[P[Ab[s], Ar[s]], {s, 0, T}]      I have been running the code for 8 hours and up till now there is no output. Can someone please point out what is the mistake or give me a different idea on how to obtain the numerical answer? Your help is much appreciated.
