I'm struggling with release management of a piece of software. First some general information:   * It is a ClickOnce application   * I follow the release often practice   * There are about 30 parties served with this software   * I need full control which update will be delivered to which party   * Not each party is allowed to get the latest update/release   * Each party has multiple clients that are all allowed to get the latest update, served for the specific party So that's what my requirements are in a rough description. So let me explain what I was thinking about how to solve this.   * I would like to create a "deployment" website (asp.net) that will handle all the requests   * There are two endpoints one for download the client and one where the client checks for updates   * So each party has a separate endpoint like DeploymentSite/party1 and another for DeploymentSite/party2   * The Application Files should still be stored centralized So I thought it would be manageable with mage.exe with the following steps   1. Build application and store new release into Application Files Repository/Folder   2. Get parties that should be updated (config file, database what ever)   3. Run mage.exe to create a new application and deployment manifest for each party in the update list with new Application File Location (1.0.2)  Actually I'm really struggling with this mage.exe staff. I can't create the appropriate files with the needed codebase. How to handle thes requirements?
