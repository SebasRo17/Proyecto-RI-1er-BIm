The function sequence is defined over $[-\frac{L}{2},\frac{L}{2}]$ (all elements are valued 0 outside this interval): $$\psi_n(x)=\begin{cases}\sqrt{2/L}\sin{(\frac{n\pi x}{L})} & n \space even \\ \sqrt{2/L}\cos{(\frac{n\pi x}{L})} & n \space odd \end{cases}$$ I would like to create a Mathematica function that takes a natural number $N$ as a single parameter, and returns the corresponding function definition from the sequence. Looks like it boils down to substituting $n=N$ and substituting $\sin\oplus\cos=\begin{cases}\sin & N \space even \\ \cos & N \space odd\end{cases}.$ How can I achieve this?
