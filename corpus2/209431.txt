I am interested in decentralized systems, and am currently considering building one myself. I am considering using JavaScript and HTML5, simply because it makes it very easy to use the system (they just have to go to a website). Some thoughts:   * I may or may not use another decentralized network for storage, and even if I do, I probably want to cache stuff on the client. If I do not, I **need** to store stuff on the client, since the information will then be distributed on **my** network. Is any of the HTML5 storage models good for this? I've read somewhere that they have a size limit.   * When using JavaScript in the browser, my understanding is that I have to use WebSockets instead of regular sockets. Doesn't this force me to use WebSocket in my "protocol spec"?
