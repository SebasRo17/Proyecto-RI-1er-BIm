I was reading an article/interview ( _Language War: PHP vs. Ruby_ (by Jeffrey Way; Mar 2011)) by a developer for Envato using Ruby. He says, "PHP is a web framework disguised as a language." He didn't expound on that statement, so it got me wondering if that is true, and if so how. I did a bit of research but couldn't turn up any information on this topic. I'm wondering how this statement is true and what makes PHP not a programming language. And why do other languages like python or ruby not fit in that category?
