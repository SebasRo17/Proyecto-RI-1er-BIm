I would like to learn PHP for web development but have been drawn back because of comments like the following*:   * PHP is good but generates spaghetti code   * PHP is nice but Python is marriage material   * PHP lacks stuff that you get in other languages like C# or Java But for PHP5 I have seen some promising comments. So, my question is: How does PHP5 fare with earlier versions of the language and is it good enough now to learn for web development. * Comments are just for reference not to incite a flame war. No comparison of PHP with other languages is asked for here. Please comment just on PHP5 and how it compares with earlier versions.
