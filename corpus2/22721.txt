My question relates to how I should share the fees paid by clients to me and a fellow programmer, both of whom are freelancers. I've thought of a few options, but I'm in a dilemma as to which one would be the most motivating for both of us. 1) The first option I've thought is a fifty-fifty share. However, more brainwork is going to be done by my colleague, while initially at least, I will be handling the communication with customers. 2) The second option is a 60-40 share, where the colleague exerting more efforts gets a bigger share. This is the option I feel most inclined to adopt, but I'm not sure how it's going to feel in the long run. 3) The third option is calculating each one's contribution in terms of the number of hours spent, and sharing the revenue accordingly. It will be wonderful to hear everybody's thoughts on this!
