For a while I've been wanting to learn ERP. What I would like to do is set up a system, and then practice running a business doing things like generating invoices, raising purchase orders, producing monthly accounts, and keeping track of fixed assets. Then look at enhancing the system further by adding custom code. Is there a book out there that's the de-facto standard for describing best practices, design methodologies, and other helpful information on ERP? What about that book makes it special?
