This is an example in Mathematica's help document.               NDSolve[{y''[t] == -9.81, y[0] == 5, y'[0] == 0,          WhenEvent[y[t] == 0, y'[t] -> -0.95 y'[t]]}, y, {t, 0, 10}];     Plot[y[t] /. %, {t, 0, 10}]      I do a modification like this:               NDSolve[{y''[t] == -9.81, y[0] == 5, y'[0] == 0, a = y[t]; b=y'[t];        WhenEvent[a == 0, b -> -0.95 b]}, y, {t, 0, 10}];     Plot[y[t] /. %, {t, 0, 10}]      It doesn't work. If I want to keep a new symbol just as here `a` to represent the `y[t]` or some expression about `y[t]` in the `WhenEvent`, what can I do to achieve this goal? (The error may be caused by the `HoldAll` attribute of `WhenEvent`. Why I want to replace the `y[t]` by `a`? It is important to me. Bucause I will use a dynamic `a` in the WhenEvent )
