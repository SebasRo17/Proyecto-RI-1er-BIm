I am creating a networking application in Mathematica that runs a non-stop simulation, and periodically receives new information from the remote server that affects the simulation. Whenever values of certain variables inside the simulation change, Mathematica needs to send an update with the values to the remote server. Is there a way to catch an event in Mathematica that corresponds to the change in the value of a specific variable? For example, assume that initially I have two variables: `a` and `b`, such that `a=1`, and `b=1`. Then, throughout the simulation one of the variables changes, while the second one remains the same: `a=2`, `b=1`. Is it possible to write an event handler that knows which variable has changed and what the new value is? I've seen this discussion: Triggering actions when a variable is set, that recommends using upvalues for `Set` and `SetDelayed`: `$var /: Set[$var, value_] := Block[{$in = True}, Print["$var set to ", value]; $var = value] /; Not@TrueQ[$in]` But this seems to not cover all possible cases when a variable might change, and requires defining UpValues for every variable. Is there a better way?
