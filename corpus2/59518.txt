I have two lists with x- and y-coordinates with different z-coordinates of the form               {{x0, y0, z0_1}, {x1, y1, z1_1}, ..., {xn, yn, zn_1}}        and               {{x0, y0, z0_2}, {x1, y1, z1_2}, ..., {xn, yn, zn_2}}.        I want to construct the list > >     {{x0, y0, z0_1 - z0_2}, {x1, y1, z1_1 - z1_2}, ..., {xn, yn, zn_1 - > zn_2}}   >   i.e. construct a list containing the difference of only the z-coordinates, for each x- and y-coordinate. Is it possible to do this with a few simple commands, or should I construct a loop and create a new list from scratch?
