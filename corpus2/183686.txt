This is what I **guess** would happen:   1. If two cores tried to access the **same** address in RAM, one would have to **wait** for the other to access the RAM. The **second** time that each core would try to access the same address, they may still have that RAM cached, so they could access their respective **caches simultaneously**.   2. If two cores tried to access **different** addresses in the same RAM, one would have to **wait** for the other to access the RAM. In other words, I would imagine that for RAM intensive programming tasks, multiprocessing won't help much unless it involved reading from the same address in RAM multiple times per core. So, can multiple CPU's / cores access the same RAM simutaneously, or is what I'm saying correct?
