I am developing a CAD - drawings to CNC machine code software. These CNC's have sort of a Instruction set which receive parameters,etc to do some blah blah job. I am quite comfortable with the CNC side; but am suddenly being asked to make a software which would let you "draw" plus will convert the drawing to the machines code. I am REALLY worried about the "draw" part. Shall i go for OpenGL development? or is there a more simplified way of doing things ? So to summarize, my problem : Creating a mini CAD platform (its all 2D and i dont need to bother with complex shapes apart from lines , some curves) But i have to provide the user with tools to make these "simple drawings" Please give me technical advice and a head start.
