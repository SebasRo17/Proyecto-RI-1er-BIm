Say you are developing a desktop application, and you want the user to be able to customize menus, buttons, keymapping, and other commands and components. How much customization should be allowed? I like my environments to be pretty much infinately customizable. I also want the environment to have a good set of defaults so I can just tweak the settings I need rather than having to set up the whole thing. Does anyone have any user experience to point to to support or contradict my preference?
