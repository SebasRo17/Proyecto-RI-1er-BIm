I have solved for values of $y(x)$ from $1 < x < 2$ and plotted them:               eqn1[w_, x_, y_, z_] :=  3 x y'[x] - 2 z^2  + 3 w y[x] == 5 x     eqn2 = eqn1[1, x, y, 2]     sol = NDSolve[{eqn2, y[1] == 2}, y[x], {x, 1, 2}]     Plot[Evaluate[y[x] /. sol], {x, 1, 2}, PlotRange -> All]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/lDBP6.png) I want to find the value of $x$ when $y=3$. Graphically, when $y=3$, $x \approx 1.55$. I tried this method to calculate the value of $x$ it didn't work:               Solve[{Evaluate[sol /. y -> 3]}, x, Method -> Reduce]
