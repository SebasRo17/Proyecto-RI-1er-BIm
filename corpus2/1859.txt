On my system, the result of this:               f[x_] := 2 Sin[x] + Sin[x]^2;     Reduce[f'[x] == 0, x]      contains the following expression twice:               x == -(Pi/2) + 2*Pi*C[1]      This is the entire result:               Element[C[1], Integers] &&           (x == -(Pi/2) + 2*Pi*C[1] || x == Pi/2 + 2*Pi*C[1] ||            x == -(Pi/2) + 2*Pi*C[1] || x == (3*Pi)/2 + 2*Pi*C[1])      Is there a reason the expression appears twice? Is this a bug?
