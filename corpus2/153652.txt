I am learning Objective-C and iOS development and not sure what proper naming convention should be used. I understand how to use the label aspect of Obj-C methods but not the proper way to name each label. What is the best practice for naming methods, properties, objects, outlets, and actions? Also,   Should different naming conventions be used between Obj-C code and C code? And if so what differences is there?
