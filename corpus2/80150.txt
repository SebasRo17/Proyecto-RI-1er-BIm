I recently worked for a (UK) medium sized company on an in-house IDE plugin tool. I thought it looked generally useful, but probably needed a different direction to be relevant for people with my interests. I no longer work for that company and I was thinking of making a similar tool for myself using the experience I gained on the project as well as some of the ideas covered. My understanding of things is that they had looked to commercialise it and had discussions with an Intellectual Property lawyer to check if anything was patentable, which didn't apparently result in any patents. I don't think the project will be comercialised as the company specialises in consulting contracts for other companies and has no history of making products. I know I am being vague, but I would like to know if there is anything I should consider (in terms of legality) before I continue. Thanks in advance!
