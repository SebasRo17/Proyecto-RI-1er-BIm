We have an existing code base which has been developed to meet the needs of most of our clients, which has accumulated features and bug fixes as they were needed and as projects developed universally useful features. Right now, we're running into the problem that there's no real documentation for its capabilities outside of the code itself, and on larger jobs it can mean that it's difficult to determine what should be included in the scope of work. How would you approach writing a defined spec for an existing application or framework?
