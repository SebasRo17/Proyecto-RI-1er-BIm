I've recently read three separate books on algorithms and data structures, tcp/ip socket programming, and programming with memory. The book about memory briefly discussed the topic of serializing data structures for the purposes of storing it to disk, or sending it across a network. I can't help but wonder why the the other two books didn't discuss serialization at all. After an unsuccessful web/book search I'm left wondering where I can find a good book/paper/tutorial on serializing data structures in C? Where or how did you learn it?
