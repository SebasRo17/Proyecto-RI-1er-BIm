In **Version 10** , the `GeneralUtilities` package contain some useful functions. `AssociatePairs` is one of those functions included in the package and advertised to work as follows:               Needs["GeneralUtilities`"]          ?AssociatePairs      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fGgLy.png) Well, here is an input that matches a `List` of pairs:               lis = Table[{k, k^3}, {k, 2, 10}];      Now,               AssociatePairs[lis]      Gives the following error: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QVJ9N.png) Well, the included `PairQ` function disagrees with this assertion:               AllTrue[lis, PairQ]      > True So, is this a bug? Since I can't get any list of pairs to work with this function. I'm on **Windows 8.1**
