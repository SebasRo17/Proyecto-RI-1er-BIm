Typically, computer memory is always linear. So is the term non linear used for a data structure in a logical sense? If so, to logically achieve non linearity in a linear computer memory, we use pointers. Is that right? In that case, if pointers are virtual implementations for achieving non linearity, why would a data structure like linked list be considered linear, if in reality the nodes are never physically adjacent?
