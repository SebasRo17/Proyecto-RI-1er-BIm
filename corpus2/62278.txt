what do you think about this design? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/VmBGO.png) In this image i have reported the dependencies between packages. I would like to reduce the coupling between them, but do you have any idea about how to do this? I think it is impossible to reduce it more than this. The Preferences package is responsible to manage program options, Persistence instead to save them in storage. Applogic and model are in domain layer. Thanks in advance!
