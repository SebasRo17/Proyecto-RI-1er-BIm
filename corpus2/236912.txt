My company is investigating using a service bus. Currently we have running prototypes of NServiceBus and Microsoft Service Bus (on premise). I'm quite happy with the pub-sub and topic messaging capabilities the bus provides but I'm getting lost in one of the requirements they are referring to. For example: They want to query the service bus and "GetAccountInformation()" and expect a result back ala WCF service style and expect the bus to answer them sufficiently to display the result in a UI. Now, with the above I mentioned the following :   1. The bus cannot be used for querying as the inherit pattern involves a "high latency" as we cannot be guaranteed that any subscriber would be listening at that point.   2. It sounds like they want to use the bus as a "hub" for all communications. To me that's sounds like they need WCF relays. To complicate matters, the reason why they are looking into it, we need to be able deliver messages to (and query from) geographically dispersed sites some of which has absolute horrible connectivity issues. So, for this case messaging fits. Also, all different sites have numerous WCF Soap and Web API services. How to achieve this?
