I am a mathematics student and am just starting to learn about programming. I am stuck on a particular program I am trying to write for fun. I want to find an algorithm to create all possible column vectors of size N containing only ones and zeroes and combine them in one large matrix by putting all the columns after each other. The order of the columns is of no importance. For instance if N=3 I want to get the matrix: 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0   0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0   0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 which vertically contains all possible combinations of ones and zeroes of length 3. Does anyone have any idea how to do this? I am not necessarily looking for a very efficient or clever way to do this because the value I will be using for N is 14, so my matrix will be 14 x 2^14 which is 14 x 16384 which is not too big. Also, sorry for the formatting of my question, I am used to the math stackexchange where you can use LaTeX text to make your matrices and equations look nice. Thanks to anyone who can help me along!
