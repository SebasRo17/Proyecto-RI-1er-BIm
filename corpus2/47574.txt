I try to compute the `Automorphisms` of graphs with multiple edges from its `AdjacencyMatrix` but failed. The following code shows how to compute the `Automorphisms` of graphs without multiple edges:               Block[{$ContextPath}, Needs["Combinatorica`"];     Needs["GraphUtilities`"]]     m = ({     {0, 1, 1, 1},     {1, 0, 1, 1},     {1, 1, 0, 1},     {1, 1, 1, 0}     });     g = AdjacencyGraph[m];     Combinatorica`Automorphisms@GraphUtilities`ToCombinatoricaGraph[g]//Lenght (*24*)      As I have tried, `AdjacencyGraph`, `IncidenceGraph` will fail to convert a matrix into a graph. And               Graph[{1 \[UndirectedEdge] 2, 1 \[UndirectedEdge] 2}]      will fail also. But if I plot the graph as a figure directly `Automorphisms` will fail at that figure of graph. Other software will do this work, for example Sage. So, how to compute the `Automorphisms` of graphs with multiple edges in Mathematica?
