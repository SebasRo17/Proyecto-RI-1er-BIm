A widely recognized cue that text is clickable is to underline it, set it in a different color, and change the cursor to a hand symbol when hovering over it. I have a situation where a column in a report may contain a tool tip -- hover- text that appears when the cursor is placed over it. I'm trying to come up with an obvious cue to the user for this. When I use a cue similar to a hyperlink, users instinctively click on it and wonder why nothing happens. Can you refer me to any real-world examples of an effective cue? Or, what cue have you successfully used in the past to accomplish this?
