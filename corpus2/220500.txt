I am creating an application with lots of photos. They will take `> 100 mb` on memory. So far I have 3 ideas: >   1. Place it in `@drawable` \- app will be heavy >   2. Download by JSON and place in java array - caching - How long it can be > there? >   3. Download by JSON, place it on phone memory/SD card and read in the > application from memory. User can Remove pictures. > The best option will be to give possibility to user if he want to have a pictures or not. What strategy is most efficient and recommended?
