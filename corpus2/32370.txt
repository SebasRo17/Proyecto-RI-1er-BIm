I have the following Pitchfork bifurcation:               f[x_, r_] := r x - x^3      I was able to find some nice code on this site to draw up the Logistic Map. I have the following snippet (maybe there is a better solution) to draw the bifurcation diagram, but was wondering if it can be colored to represent the stable from unstable branches? ( saved the file, then modified it). We have three stable branches and one unstable branch. The unstable branch is [0, +r], see: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0pqFu.png) Is there a way to show the three branches as a solid blue line and the unstable branch as a dashed red line? Also, can we label the axes as $r$ and $x$, and the branches as stable and unstable? Here is the code snippet that drew the above bifurcation diagram (is there an easier way).                  CClear[NotComplexQ];        NotComplexQ[c_Complex] := False;        NotComplexQ[c_] := True            CartProd[l_] := Outer[List, l[[1]], l[[2]]]            ArreglaLista[l_] := Select[Map[(x /. #) &, Flatten[l]], NotComplexQ]           Points = Flatten[        Map[CartProd,         Table[{{r}, ArreglaLista[NSolve[f[x, r] == 0, x]]}, {r, -1, 2,         0.05}]], 2]           ListPlot[Points]
