I am importing Excel spreadsheet data into Mathematica. Here is what the data looks like, notice the cell Q1 with "sdf": ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/kQ7rU.png) I import this data by specifying the Spreadsheet location, sheet name, top 9, left 7, drop the Header Row and **delete empty values** :               Dataset1 =        DeleteCases[        Drop[Import[           "c:\\GraphingSoftware\\Book2.xlsx", {"Sheets", "Sheet2"}][[9 ;;, 7 ;;]], 1], ""];          FullForm[Dataset1]          List[List[126.7, 55.3, 113.8, 96.9, 47.8, 74.6, 71.9, 55.2, "", "", ""]      The results contain the emtpy cell values upto the "sdf" column. I want to be able to remove empty values with the `DeleteCases` function but it doesn't work. The documentation doesn't indicate if you can specify the number of columns and that would be really useful. To save the day I simply want to delete empty cells or even better specify the number of columns so empty columns aren't included. Help as always is much appreciated.
