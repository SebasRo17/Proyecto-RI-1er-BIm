I'm trying to get into web development, so I started learning HTML, CSS, and javascript. I've been coming along really well with javascript, but I still can't make anything with HTML and CSS to save my life. I was going to ask for some places or tips to improve, but I know the question has been asked countless times and would just get deleted, so I figured I would just view the source of some other people's websites. What I keep seeing is tables left and right. Is there a valid reason to use tables?
