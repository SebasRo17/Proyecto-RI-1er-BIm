In Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering at the end of fact 2, Robert Glass says: > The problem is—and of course there is a problem, since we are not acting on > this fact in our field—we don't know how to identify those "best" people. We > have struggled over the years with programmer aptitude tests and certified > data processor exams and the ACM self-assessment programs, and the bottom > line, after a lot of blood and sweat and perhaps even tears were spent on > them, was that the correlation between test scores and on-the-job > performance is nil. ( **You think that was disappointing? We also learned, > about that time, that computer science class grades and on-the-job > performance correlated abysmally also [Sackman 1968].** ) Is this fact supported by more recent papers?
