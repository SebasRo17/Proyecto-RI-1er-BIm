> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  What "version naming convention" do you use? Do you change your major/minor/patch version numbers right before you release or right after? Example: You just released 1.0.0 to the world (huzzah!). But wait, don't celebrate too much. 1.1.0 is coming out in six weeks! So you fix a bug and do a new build. **What's that build called?** 1.1.0.0 or 1.0.0.xxxy (where xxxy is the build number of 1.0.0 incremented)? Keep in mind you may have 100 features and bugs to go into 1.1.0. So it might be good to call it 1.0.0.xxxy, because you're nowhere close to 1.1.0. But on the other hand, another dev may be working on 2.0.0, in which case your build might be better named 1.1.0.0 and his 2.0.0.0 instead of 1.0.0.xxxy and 1.0.0.xxxz, respectively.
