I have been working in Mathematica 9.0 for last 6 months. Now in our organization we got webMathematica. We don't know how to install webMathematica initially, with the help of this link http://support.wolfram.com/kb/3230 and other links we manage to install java(JDK 1.7) and tomcat (apache-tomcat-6.0.37).I had webMathematica in archive format. I have Unpacked the webMathematica web application archives into the webapps directory located in the Tomcat directory. The location where I copied webMathematica is **C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 6.0\webapps** according to the guide from above given link. After that as per guide I tried to set the kernalExecutable and KernelLaunchFlags in MSPConfiguration.xml file which is found in **C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 6.0\webapps\webMathematica\WEB-INF** directory, But I faced two problems   1. Can't save the MSPConfiguration.xml after modify even though login as administrator.   2. I don't know how to save the licence of webMathematica whether in separate file or not. If it is separate file then which format it should be store. I tried like this to modify xml file                   <KernelPool>         <KernelPoolName>General</KernelPoolName>         <URLPattern>/*</URLPattern>          <KernelExecutable>C:\Program Files\Wolfram Research\Mathematica\9.0\MathKernel.exe</KernelExecutable>         <KernelLaunchFlags>-pwfile C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 6.0\webapps\webMathematica\WEB-INF</KernelLaunchFlags>         </KernelPool>      but when I tried to save MSPConfiguration.xml file with above said modification, I was not allow to save the xml file. I have checked the property of the file also, It says that administrator is have access of full control of read, write and all. I am login in as administrator as well. But I can't able to save the modification. Help to resolve this problem.
