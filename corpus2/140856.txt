I'm looking for a solid and but fast paced entry in field of javascript development. The following topics come to my mind:   * Javascript advanced concepts, OOP   * jQuery, jQuery-UI, jQuery-Mobile   * backbone.js   * node.js   * BDD and/or TDD The courses of http://www.codelesson.com seem promising. What certificates for Javascript developers exist/can be recommended? What other vendors can you recommend?
