I'm wondering what the arguments for/against Falsy values are. On what principles would you decide to add or exclude them from a language? Are there any problems you could see them causing off-hand? For users of languages that support Falsy values:   * Where specifically have you used them to your advantage?   * Where have you had unpleasant run-ins with them?   * Are there any rules or finer points in your language/project/team about where it's appropriate or inappropriate to use them? For users of other languages:   * Have you ever seen a situation where you've thought "I wish I could use a Falsy value here"? I'm tagging the question `haskell` and `python` because AFAIK those two represent opposite ends of the spectrum (Haskell demanding `Bool`s when you use `if`, and Python treating `None` and some "empty" values as Falsy), but feel free to talk about your experience from other languages. Just mention where on the spectrum they stand.
