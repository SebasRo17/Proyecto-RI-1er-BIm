> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  How do I adapt to pre-interview challenge questions? InterviewStreet is a new company that essentially acts as a filter for companies to find programmers that can code. My problem is my math is fairly weak and I'd like to study it, even if it's from the ground up, to be able to solve questions such as this one, that is found on their site: `Find the no of positive integral solutions for the equations (1/x) + (1/y) = 1/N! (read 1 by n factorial) Print a single integer which is the no of positive integral solutions modulo 1000007` Now, please do NOT post the answer to that question, it is taken directly from InterviewStreet and should not be posted here. It is not the answer I'm seeking for in this thread. What I'm asking is a more fundamental question which probably can be answered by some of the hackers in the SO community. How does one prepare for such a question? What resources are available for me to study/learn how to solve this type of problem? Is this covered on MIT open courseware? Khan Academy? Any particular books? I'm not even sure where to begin to start solving the problem above and I'd like to learn what steps I can take to do so.
