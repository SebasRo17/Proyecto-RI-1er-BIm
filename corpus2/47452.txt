If I am using TraditionalForm, how do I make the output larger in size? I don't want to change the general font size of the GUI, just make the output of one expression larger. I tried:               TraditionalForm[x^3 + y^3 == 22 z^3, FontSize -> Large]      but this does not work. FontSize is apparently not allowed as an attribute here.
