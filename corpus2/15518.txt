I have hooked up my Twitter account to Mathematica and I have 1468 followers               myfollowers = Length[SocialMediaData["Twitter", "Followers"]]          1468      I wondered what my follower network would look like but the returned graph was far too simple looking:               a = SocialMediaData["Twitter", "FollowerNetwork"]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/R5cpx.png) The graph only has 32 vertices:               VertexCount[a]      Looking at the names of the Twitter users it has included, it seems that it has only considered the most recent people who have followed me. So, how do I get Mathematica to consider all of my followers?
