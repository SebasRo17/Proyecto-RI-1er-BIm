Consider the function, $f(z) = z tanh(\pi z) log (z^2 + a^2)$ for some $a>0$. Now I am considering 3 different situations,   * $z = i(n+0.5) - i\epsilon + \delta - it$ for $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ and we integrate from $t=0$ to $t=1-2\epsilon$.    * $z = i(n-0.5) + i\epsilon - \delta + it$ for $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ and we integrate from $t=0$ to $t=1-2\epsilon$.   * $z = i(n+0.5) - i\epsilon - \delta - it$ for $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ and we integrate from $t=1-2\epsilon$ to $t=0$.  Now in any of these cases I am truncating the Taylor expansion of $f$ (and the integration limits) to zeroth order in $\epsilon$ and $\delta$ and then doing the integration. (...because that is the limit that interests me.) I am using the `Series` function of _Mathematica_ twice (once each for the two infinitesimals) to get this zeroth order term and I get that,   * For the first and third cases this zeroth order term comes out to be, $\frac{1 + 2(n-t) }{2}Cot [\pi (n-t) ]Log [ a^2 - (\frac{1 + 2(n-t) }{2})^2 ] $   * In the second case this zeroth order term comes out to be, $\frac{-1 + 2(n+t) }{2}Cot [\pi (n+t) ]Log [ a^2 - (\frac{-1 + 2(n+t) }{2})^2 ] $ Now the confusion is this - hence symbolically for the first and the third cases the integrations are negative of each other (as I would expect!) but the second case turns out to be distinctly different. But if you think on the z-plane then the second and the third are exactly the same paths on which the integration is being done. Then why this difference? * * * In the comments confusions were raised about how the series was done - so here is the code for the first case,               z = I (n + (1/2) - x - t) + y;           Assuming [        n \[Element] Integers && n < a && a > 0 && x > 0 && y > 0 &&        t > 0   ,        Series [ z Tanh [ \[Pi] z  ] Log [ z^2 + a^2 ]    , {y, 0, 2}]]      Doing the above produced the zeroth order term in "y" ($\delta$) to be,               -(1/2) (1 + 2 n - 2 t - 2 x) Log[          a^2 - 1/4 (1 + 2 n - 2 t - 2 x)^2] Tan[          1/2 (\[Pi] + 2 n \[Pi] - 2 \[Pi] t - 2 \[Pi] x)]      So then I did an "x" ($\epsilon$) series on it,               Assuming [         n \[Element] Integers && n < a && a > 0 && x > 0 && y > 0 &&         t > 0   ,         Series [ -(1/2) (1 + 2 n - 2 t - 2 x) Log[          a^2 - 1/4 (1 + 2 n - 2 t - 2 x)^2] Tan[          1/2 (\[Pi] + 2 n \[Pi] - 2 \[Pi] t - 2 \[Pi] x)]   , {x, 0,          2}]] // FullSimplify       This produced the expression, $\frac{1 + 2(n-t) }{2}Cot [\pi (n-t) ]Log [ a^2 - (\frac{1 + 2(n-t) }{2})^2 ] $ as the zeroth order term. Similarly for the other cases...
