I have a small webapp in java and I am adding the internationalization support, replacing texts with labels that are defined in dictionary files. While some texts are obviously unique to each view (v.g. the html title), other refer to concepts from the model (v.g. a ticket, the location or status of such ticket, etc.) As usual, some terms will appear many times in different locations (vg, in both the edition page and in the search page and in the listings I have a "ticketLocation" label). My question is: can I organize the labels around the model concepts (so I have a `ticket.location` label and I use it everywhere such field is labeled) or should I make a different label for each (so `form.ticketLocation` and `filter.ticketLocation` and `list.ticketLocation`). I would go for the first option; I have searched for tips and the only thing that I see that could hinder me is due to the length of the string disrupting the design, and even for that I would prefer having to add a `ticket.locationShort` for places where there is not much space. What is your opinion/tips/experience?
