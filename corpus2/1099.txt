Is this a bug or my MMA went insane or I'm missing something?               LengthWhile[Reverse@IntegerDigits[1000], # == 0 &]      works fine, but with SameQ instead of Equal, or with PossibleZeroQ it doesn't               In[32]:= LengthWhile[Reverse@IntegerDigits[1000], # === 0 &]          Out[32]= 0          In[33]:= LengthWhile[Reverse@IntegerDigits[1000], PossibleZeroQ]          Out[33]= 0      It doesn't particularly happen with 1000, it was just an example.
