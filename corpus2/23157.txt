I have three lists. As an example,               a = {10, 5, 6, 8, 7};     b = {4, 8, 9, 7, 9};     c = {7, 5, 12, 4, 1};      I want to get $$x(i)=\sum _{i=0}^i\frac{1}{2}\left(a_ib_i+a_{i+1}b_{i+1}\right)\left(c_{i+1}-c_i\right)$$ i goes from 1 to 4. i.e. I want to get: x(1),x(2),x(3) and x(4) So, I used following code               x=Sum[1/2*(a[[i]]*b[[i]] + a[[i + 1]]*b[[i + 1]])*(c[[i + 1]] -      c[[i]]), {i, 1, 4}]     For[i = 0, i < 4, x, Print[x]]      But, I didn't get expected output. Could anyone please tell me how to do this?
