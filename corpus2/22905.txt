I need to import about 100000 "dat" files to my progrom. I want to do this using the last answer to this question: Importing multiple files using a for-loop I know that I should define a list of all the names of my files, and at the end, I `Import` all of them. But I have a problem with this. The names of my files obey a special pattern, like this:               "mutomu,dms41,x1,dms51,x2,q24,x3,q25,x4.dat"      Which x1-x4 are integers in this way:               {x1, 1, 21}, {x2, x1, 21}, {x3, 1, 15}, {x4, 1, 15}      . When I am defining the names of my files, I do it as:               allprobabilityfiles = {Flatten[Table[{{x1, x2, x3, x4},"mutomu,dms41,x1,dms51,x2,q24,x3,q25,x4.dat"}, {x1, 1, 21,1}, {x2, x1, 21, 1}, {x3, 1, 15, 1}, {x4, 1, 15, 1}], 3]};      but in this way, the result is:               ....{{21, 21, 6, 5}, "mutomu,dms41,x1,dms51,x2,q24,x3,q25,x4.dat"},      {{21, 21, 6, 6}, "mutomu,dms41,x1,dms51,x2,q24,x3,q25,x4.dat"},      {{21, 21, 6, 7}, "mutomu,dms41,x1,dms51,x2,q24,x3,q25,x4.dat"}, ....      (x1-x4 don't change inside the file names in this table), but what I need is the following:               ....{{21, 21, 6, 5}, "mutomu,dms41,21,dms51,21,q24,6,q25,5.dat"},      {{21, 21, 6, 6}, "mutomu,dms41,21,dms51,21,q24,5,q25,6.dat"},      {{21, 21, 6, 7}, "mutomu,dms41,21,dms51,21,q24,5,q25,7.dat"}, ....      How can I solve this problem?
