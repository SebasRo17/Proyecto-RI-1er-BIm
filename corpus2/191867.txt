I have just released an iOS app for beta-testing with TestFlight. I'm wondering what is good practice during beta-testing?   * Should I halt development of the app during beta-testing?   * Should I continue developing but make a snapshot image of what the code looked like when it was released for beta-testing?   * Issues that could rise that I can think of is that if I make any changes to the code and then a bug is detected in the code that I have changed this would not be ideal. There are probably other issues to deal with but these are the ones that I could think of at the moment. I'm the only developer of the app at the moment.
