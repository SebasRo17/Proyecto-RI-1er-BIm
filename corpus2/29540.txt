I'm looking for other options for maintaining my personal JavaScript namespace. The problem I'm having boils down code _Organization_ Vs. _Performance_. I would simply LOVE to be able to separate major sections of my code into a more "traditional" style. But I haven't because if I were to do that I would probably quadruple the amount of HTTP requests I send out. Essentially I am including two different js files. `jQUery/jQueryUI/my namespace` in one and my implementation in the other. Great for performance in my web-apps... but looking at my JavaScript source makes me scared, confused, and horrified all at the same time. What am I missing here?
