Does anyone know (I have searched documentation, online and MathSource) if there are ways to coax out the following factorizations from Mathematica?   * $A = LU$, $LU$ factorization   * $PA = LU$, $LU$ factorization with Partial Pivoting   * $PAQ = LU$, $LU$ factorization with full pivoting   * $A = LDU$, $LDU$ decomposition I found one library in MathSource for $LU$, but it does not behave very well.
