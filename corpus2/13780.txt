I have chosen different font for text. Unfortunately this font is larger than the standard Times font. So all math symbols (e.g. greek) are now a little too small. If I could just set the FontSize for the math font to 13 it would probably look good. How do I accomplish that? If it is not that simple: In defining a custom Style via Stylesheet (or private Style Definitions), what is the correct way to define a custom size for the math font. There are Style definitions for "Display Formula" and "Inline Formula", but if I type just an inline cell, the latter does not apply.
