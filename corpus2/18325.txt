I want my program to always save a text file with unix-style `LF` line breaks (even when _Mathematica_ runs on Windows). But the way the built-in `Export` command works depends on the operating system. For example the following code:               testFile = "newlinetest.txt";     testStringList = {"abc", "abc"};     Export[testFile, testStringList, "List"];     BinaryReadList[testFile]      Linux or Mac OS gives exactly what I want: > {97, 98, 99, 10, 97, 98, 99} Windows adds an extra `CR` symbol: > {97, 98, 99, **13** , 10, 97, 98, 99} Is there a normal way to save text files with unix-style newline on Windows?
