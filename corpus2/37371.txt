I've written a mathematia code which arranges $n$ unit squares in columns of length $m$ (of course, when $n$ is not divisible to $m$, then the last column is not full). This is the code:               n = 60;     m = 1;     l = {};     For[i = 0, i <= n - 1,       l = Append[l,         Rectangle[{Quotient[i, m], Mod[i, m]}, {Quotient[i, m] + .9,           Mod[i, m] + .9}]]; i++]     Graphics[{Red, l}]      **Here's my problem:** For a fixed value for $n$ (say, $60$), if you change $m$ then you get squares of smaller or larger sizes, as shown below. I want all the squares for different $m$'s be of the same size. What should I do? Thanks in advance. for $n = 60$ and $m = 1$: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/H9P67.gif) for $n = 60$ and $m = 13$: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/55UOW.gif)
