A (maybe noob) question: Let               a = 1234567891234567889998.5     b = 1234567891234567889999.5      Mathematica (v8) yields for               a*0.5 - b*0.5      \--> `0.` (wrong answer) and               (a - b)*0.5      \--> `-0.5` (correct answer) although both expressions `a*0.5 - b*0.5` and `(a - b)*0.5` are mathematically identical. I set `$MinPrecision = 200`, to no avail. Is there a way to get for both analytically identical expressions the same numerical result? In my original mathematical problem I want to compare two representations of the same problem, with one yielding a vast sum over products of binomial coefficients (yielding numerically results of order `10^2^n`, for `n > 10`) with tiny numbers (order `0.1^2^n`). Analytically I cannot simplify the expressions. Thanks a bunch. Michelle
