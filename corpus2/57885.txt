I'm trying to guage how popular and how used LINQPad is today. I'm just wondering if it's still a useful tool or not as VS and other tools have gotten better. Furthermore, I am coding over LLBGen by working with LINQ to SQL. I see there is a plug-in for LLBGen and LINQPad. Still I wonder if LINQPad is really worth it or what benefits it can give me or if it's still highly suggested out there for ORMs, etc.
