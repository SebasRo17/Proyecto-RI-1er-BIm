I have some very small values such as 2.601519253*10^-8. I'd like to output these values to CSV for another program to work with. I've tried N[value, 50], but Mathematica still insists on producing scientific notation (which my program can't read). How can I force Mathematica to output values in decimal form? EDIT: AccountingForm seems to be the answer to my question. AccountingForm[2.601519253458693*10^-8, 30] gives a nice decimal format I can use. â€“
