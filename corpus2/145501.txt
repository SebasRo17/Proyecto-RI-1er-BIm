Are there any actual business cases that have made any company move from a DVCS to a CVCS (regardless of whether they were on a CVCS originally)?. Other than having a closed mind and rejecting the paradigm shift altogether (for the particular case of companies coming from a CVCS) I cannot think of any cause for this happening. Double chocolate cookie for anyone with empiric evidence.
