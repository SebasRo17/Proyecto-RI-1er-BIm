At some point I get this error:               Warning: scaled local spatial error estimate of 32773.0090044258` at      t = 987.7919550194803` in the direction of independent variable x is much greater than the          prescribed error tolerance. Grid spacing with 1001 points may be too large to achieve the       desired accuracy or precision.         (etc.) How do I track this time with `WhenEvent`? How is this _scaled local spatial error_ kept in NDSolve?
