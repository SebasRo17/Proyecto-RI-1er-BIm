First ATMs performed tasks like a cash dispenser, they were offline machines which worked with punch cards impregnated with Carbon and a 6-digit PIN code. Maximum withdrawal with a card was 10 pounds and each one was a one-time use card - ATM swallowed cards! The first ATM was installed in London in the year 1967, as I looked at time line of programming languages, there were many programming languages made before that decade. I don't know about the hardware neither, but in which programming language it was written? (also which hardwares were used?) _*I didn't find a detailed biography of John Shepherd-Barron (ATM inventor at 70s)_ **_Update_** I found this picture, which is taken from a newspaper back to the year 1972 in Iran. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/eIQj8.jpg) **_Translated PS_** : > Shows Mr. Rad-lon _(if spelled correctly)_ , The manager of Barros _(if > spelled correctly)_ International Educational Institute in United Kingdom at > the right, and Mr. Jim Sutherland - Expert of Computer Kiosks. In the rest of the text I found on this paper, these kind of ATMs which called "Automated Computer Kiosk" were advertised with this: > Mr. Rad-lon _(if spelled correctly)_ puts his card to one specific location > of Automated Computer Kiosk and after 10 seconds he withdraws his cash. Two more questions are: **1-** How those ATMs were so fast? (withdrawal in 10 seconds in that year) **2-** I didn't find any text on Internet which state about "Automated Computer Kiosk", Is it valid or were they being called _Computer_ in that time?
