I'm trying to calculate a continuous integral within a discrete integral. Something similar to this (yet more complex):               NSum[NIntegrate[x^2 + y, {x, 0, 1}], {y, 2}]      I receive the following error code: > NIntegrate::inumr: "The integrand x^2+y has evaluated to non-numerical > values for all sampling points in the region with boundaries {{0,1}}. " What is the proper way to tell Mathematica to evaluate this expression?
