I am trying to plot a function in which is piecewise defined. I found the Fourier coefficients of this, and my question is how to define `even` & `odd` conditions for the `Piecewise` command? I used _2n_ and _2n+1_ for even & odd respectively, but this does not suffice. I have a `MWE` below.               Clear[f,a,b,F]     f[t_]=Piecewise[{{-Sqrt[9+t+t^2],-2<t<0},{Exp[Sin[t]],0<=t<=2}}]     a0=23/9;     a[k_]=Piecewise[{{20/(k^4Pi^4),2k},{-83/(k Pi),2k+1}}]     b[k_]=Piecewise[{{-92/(k^3 Pi^3),2k},{-53/(k Pi)+14/(k^2 Pi^2),2k+1}}]     F[t_]=a0/2+Sum[a[k]Cos[(k Pi t)/2]+b[k]Sin[(k Pi t)/2],{k,1,20}];     Plot[{f[t],F[t]},{t,-1,1}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/yktUT.png)
