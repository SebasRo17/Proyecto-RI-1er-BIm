I want to draw a set of convex polyhedrons whose vertices are defined by spherical coordinates on the surface of a unit sphere. Currently I followed the advice from here: http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/a/21842/651 But it draws diagonals on any tetragonal face. Each face is composed of triangles. Is it possible to accomplish the same but without tetragonal faces diagonaled? The current code:               Needs["TetGenLink`"]     mapping[{1,0,0}]={0,0,1}     mapping[{1,Pi,0}]={0,0,-1}     mapping:=CoordinateTransformData[{"Spherical"->"Cartesian"},"Mapping"]     verteces[n_]:=Flatten[Table [{1,Pi k/n, i 2Pi/Binomial[n,k]},{k,0,n},{i,0,Binomial[n,k]-1}],1]     Convex[n_]:=TetGenConvexHull[mapping/@ verteces[n]]     pts[n_]:=First[Convex[n]]     surface[n_] :=Last[Convex[n]]     b:=5     Graphics3D[{Yellow,Opacity[.9],GraphicsComplex[pts[b],Polygon[surface[b]]], Black, Line[{{0,0,-1.1},{0,0,1.1}}]}]
