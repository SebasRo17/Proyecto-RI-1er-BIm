I have a very simple working console application written in C++ linked with a light static library. It is just for testing purposes. Now that the coding part is done, I would like to know the process of actually deploying the program. I wrote a very basic CMakeLists.txt that create makefiles or VS projects to build the sources. I also have a program that calls the static library in order to make some google tests. To me, the distribution of this application goes like this: >   * to developers : the src directory with the CMakeLists.txt file (multi- > platform distribution) with a README.txt and an INSTALL.txt >   * to users : the executable and a README.txt >   * git repo : everything mentioned above plus the sources for testing and > the gtest external lib > A this point : considering the complexity of my application, am I doing it right? Is there any reference that would formalize this deployment process so I can get better and go further ? Say I would like to add dynamic libraries that can be updated, external libraries like boost : how should I package this to deploy it in a professional way?
