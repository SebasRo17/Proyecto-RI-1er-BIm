I am trying to make a density plot in Mathematica, however the distribution of the plot is not as visible as I would like. I plotted the same function in python and it contains a greater visible range of information. This can be seen in the first picture below. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0t5ES.png) When I try the same plot in Mathematica some information is lost. I cant see the decrease in intensity on either side of the central bright spot. I am using PlotRange "All" and I can adjust the plot range but I get large white spots where I am outside of the plot range. I am not sure how to tackle the problem if anyone has any ideas I would appreciate your thoughts! My code is as follows               DensityPlot[di, {x, -5, 5}, {y, -5, 5}, PlotLegends -> Automatic,      ColorFunction -> "Rainbow", PlotRange -> All]      Thanks, Ben ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HVQ5M.png)
