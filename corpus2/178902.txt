Consider this scenario:   * I am developing a program FooSuite that uses a GPL-licenced library QuuxTools   * I release the program FooSuite 1.0 under GPL Later on I discover that, for some reason, I need to licence the program to someone on different terms.   Hence:   * I remove the dependency on GPL via QuuxTools, by either...     * rewriting the program not to use this library any longer     * obtaining a different licence for QuuxTools (if it's dual-licenced; see PyQt)   * I release FooSuite 1.1 under a non-GPL licence. However, _FooSuite 1.1 is still a derivative work from FooSuite 1.0_. I understand that it's not legal for a stranger to do what I did, but am I myself - as the owner of FooSuite - free from this restriction?
