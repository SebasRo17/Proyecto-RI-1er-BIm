p1 = Plot[x^2, {x, -2, 2}, PlotStyle -> {Thick, Black}];      p2 = Graphics3D[{EdgeForm[Black], Texture[p1],       Polygon[{{-2, 0, -1}, {2, 0, -1}, {2, 4, -1}, {-2, 4, -1}},       VertexTextureCoordinates -> {{0, 0}, {1, 0}, {1, 1}, {0, 1}}],       Opacity[1]}, Lighting -> "Neutral", Boxed -> False];     squares =       Table[Graphics3D[{Opacity[.3],       Polygon[{{-Sqrt[y], y, 0}, {Sqrt[y], y, 0}, {Sqrt[y], y,       2 Sqrt[y]}, {-Sqrt[y], y, 2 Sqrt[y]}}]}, Boxed -> False], {y, 0, 4, .25}];     all = Show[Table[squares[[j]], {j, 1, 16}]];     Show[p2]     Show[p2, all]      results in this output for me: ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/eF6Uf.jpg) ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1N0TQ.jpg) However, for others (at least one of whom is a Mac user), indeed the `p2` graphic shows up in the second result. When I click on the cell bracket, and Save As... PDF, the result is ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UV7jF.png) And finally, if I directly copy and paste the figure (rather than export), I get this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3BQPH.jpg) I need some independent confirmation of if this a bug in the Windows 7 version of v8.0.4 and if you have any ideas for workarounds since I need a PDF version of the last figure for insertion into other docs. Thanks.
