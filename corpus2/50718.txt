When importing a data file what are the comment symbols for _Mathematica_? That is, given a file like this               blabla     bulbul          1 2 6 54 7 ...     ..      what symbol do I have to put in front of header lines so _Mathematica_ skips them and starts reading at the line `1 2 6 54 7 ...`. I tried `#`, which works in gnuplot, but that did not work. I know that I could just tell _Mathematica_ to skip the lines, but as I can control the file output, it would be nicer to use some kind of a tag.
