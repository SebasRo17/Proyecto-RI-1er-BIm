I'm trying to learn how to step through Ruby code (written by more experienced programmers) in order to improve my knowledge of Ruby. Problem is that I don't really know how to do it well. Googling the topic brought me to an about.com page on Ruby; I thought a higher quality more comprehensive answer should belong on StackOverflow, so if anyone can write an answer (with an example) for it, showing how a beginner can step through code to learn as much as possible about it, it'd be much appreciated.
