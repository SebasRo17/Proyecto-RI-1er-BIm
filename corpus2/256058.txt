I have a Delphi application (D2007) which connects to a Wordpress installation (V4.0, PHP V5.3) and retrieves hashed passwords. I would like the application to be able to verify whether or not input passwords match the stored hashed password. As far as I understand it, the hash is Blowfish using randomly generated salts, which are concatenated into the hash..? **Pass** : newnewnew **Hash** : $P$BA8BEfC.y9WjbpiRqLQHbKrc2sQfbk0 I have been playing around with **DCPcrypt** but yet to make any real progress and I am not sure if what I am trying to achieve is possible Thank you
