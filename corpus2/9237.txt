I'm looking for a robust way to add vertices to a graph by modifying its `AdjacencyMatrix`. Here's what I have so far:               addNode[matrix_,in_,out_]:=Module[{mod},         mod=ArrayPad[matrix,1];         mod[[1,2]]=1;         mod[[2,1]]=1;         mod[[Length@mod,-out]]=1;         mod[[-out,Length@mod]]=1;         mod     ]      This will add a vertex connected to `vertex 1` and another vertex connected to `vertex out`. Notice that I only add 1x1 0's to my matrix. This is because at the moment I only need to add 2 vertices to my graphs. * * * **Examples:** ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BdGfp.png) ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BtQcJ.png) * * * I've tried implementing a similar function that accepts the `in` argument, but I couldn't get it to work properly. It seems as if I have to program special cases for it to work. Is there a better way to do this?
