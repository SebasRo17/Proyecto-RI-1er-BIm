I have read in a few places that publishing programming problems/puzzles/exercises from interviews is not nice with the company, but I have recently had a few interviews where I faced some interesting problems I really wanted to discuss with those who could have solved them better. Do you think that is fine if I don't copy-paste these exercises but try to "make my own version", for example rewriting it a bit so the whole point will be the same but in another format? Also if I didn't mention the company itself, not even the fact the problem was asked on an interview, would it still be a bad thing to do? Thanks in advance!
