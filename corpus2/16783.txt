If k=3, then I would like the following to say "Sine Curve, k=3" when you hover over the output of the `Tooltip` command:               Tooltip[Sin[k*x], "Sine Curve, k=", TooltipStyle -> FontSize -> 16]      I have made a number of attempts, using pure functions and substitutions, but none delivered the output I want. The ultimate goal is to put this into a `Manipulate` where `k` is a user selectable value and the `Sin[k x]` function is plotted.
