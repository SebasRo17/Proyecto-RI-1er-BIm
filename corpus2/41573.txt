I fed this inequality into _Wolfram/Alpha:_ `Mod[-1 + 2^(1 - IntegerExponent[2 + 2 x, 2]) 3^ IntegerExponent[2 + 2 x, 2] (1 + x), 1 + 2 x] < 1 + 2 x`, and got this plot:   ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DSPwk.png)   The uploads didn't format properly, so I just have the image. I copied the function for the plot and got: `Plot[{Mod[-1 + 2^(1 - IntegerExponent[2 + 2 x, 2]) 3^ IntegerExponent[2 + 2 x, 2] (1 + x), 1 + 2 x], 1 + 2 x}, {x, -5.01, 5.01}]` This doesn't work. So I have some questions: Q1) How can I get _Mathematica 9_ to replicate the plot? Q2) How can I determine the x-,y-axis ratio? (It looks like 1:2, but I want to be sure.) Q3) If 1:2 is the case, what is there about the formula that would indicate that this is a good ratio?
