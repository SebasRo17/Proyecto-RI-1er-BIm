I have very large numbers (million digits). number = A*10^partlen + B As of now, I split the numbers by this way:                TotalLen = IntegerLength[a];       partlen = IntegerPart[TotalLen/2];      Print[First[Timing[A = IntegerPart[number/(10^partlen )]]]];      Print[First[Timing[B = Mod[number, 10^partlen ]]]]      And the timings for a 6 million digits number are:               4.703          0.36      Converting the number to strings and rebuilding the parts is even slower than this. Is there any faster way?
