I am an iPhone developer. I am quite confident on developing iPhone application with some minimal feature. I would consider myself as a fair application developer but the code I write is not so much structured. I make very little use of MVC because I don't seem to find places to impose MVC. Most of the time, I create application with viewcontrollers and very few models only. How could I improve the skill for making my code more reusable, standard, easy and maintainable. I have seen few books on design patterns and tried few chapters myself but I don't seem to skip my habit. I know few of them but I am not being able to apply those patterns into my app. What is the best way to learn the design patterns and coding habit. Any kind of suggestion is warmly welcomed.
