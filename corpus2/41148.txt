I have a simple DEQ: $$y'(t) = y + C$$ for a constant $C$. It turns out that the equilibrium point of this DEQ is $-C$. I can use the `StreamPlot` command to plot the direction field for 'any' value of $C$, for example, for $C = 2$:                StreamPlot[{1, y + 2}, {t, -4, 4}, {y, -8,  4}]      The `StreamPlot` is: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QnvRf.png) This `StreamPlot` would look exactly like this for any value of $C$. is there some way to show the y-axis as a $C$ instead of $-2$ and to show the other values as $C \pm <\rm{offset}>$. That is, the point $-4$ is shown as $C-2$, the point $-2$ is shown as $C$, the point 0 is shown as $C+2$, etc. In other words, the y-axis values are shown as a function of the general equilibrium point?
