I'm a student and in my spare time I'm working for a big enterprise as Java developer. The job is good, but the problem is, my boss writes very strange code. I don't want to complain, but some issues are in my opinion really strange. For example:   * he doesn't know any booleans. All boolean conditions are Strings called "YesOrNo" and then in the condition he uses if (YesOrNo == "Yes")   * there are a lot of very strange characters in method names and variables like é õ ô or è   * all loops are infinite loops in the style of for(;;). Then at the end of the loop the condition is tested and if the conditions is fulfilled break; is called. I don't know if I should tell him that I think this isn't a good practice, since he is my boss and decides how and what to do. On the other hand some of his examples are really very weird. Any hints how to cope with? And is this only me who thinks that's bad style?
