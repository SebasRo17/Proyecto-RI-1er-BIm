I'm sure a lot of software developers have pet projects and hobbies that they do outside professional tasks. I have my own, and I'm struggling with how to include them on a resume. These are not necessarily hot open source projects that everyone's life depends on, just some tinkering with fun languages like Haskell or Lisp that I do to learn new concepts. Maybe some experimenting with a web framework that I was curious about. I have a couple reasons for wanting to include these on a resume:   * I have a handful of languages and technologies listed where I would consider myself "experienced." I would have no trouble being grilled on these at an interview. But if I put Haskell on that line of technologies, I would fold if asked an advanced question about it.   * When I help interview job candidates (I'm not a hiring manager, but we have engineers participate in the technical side of interviews), I always ask them about their programming hobbies, if any. It opens them up about stuff not on their resume, maybe leads to something interesting that I wouldn't have learned just from asking about past jobs.   * I really am passionate and curious about software, and I want to show potential employers that I am expanding my knowledge outside job duties. But I want to be honest about not being an expert when I'm not an expert. What's a good threshold for including a programming hobby on a programming resume - read a book or two, wrote working programs, used it to solve a problem of X magnitude, etc.? How segregated should it be from professional experience - included with other skills (but with some sort of "just a hobby" qualifier, in its own section of "personal interests", or pushed off to the second page everyone throws away? Or, leave it off entirely and let the interviewer ask, if they care?
