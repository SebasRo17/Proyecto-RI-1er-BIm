Suppose the middle tier servers are replicated 3 way and the backend database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc...) is replicated 3 way. A user request ends up creating some user data in the middle tier servers and I would like to commit this to the backend database in a way resilient to failures. A candidate attempt solution, for example, if I send the data to one SQL database and have it replicate the data to the other databases then if the one SQL database has the harddrive crash before it can replicate the data, the data is lost. What is the best practice solution for fault tolerance that is used in the actual real world.
