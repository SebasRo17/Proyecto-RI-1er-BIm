Can anybody point me in a direction that will guide me to extend the VoronoiDiagram function in Mathematica to handle 3D (three dimensional) situations (i.e. points in 3D)? Any help will be greatly appreciated. **Update** The current `VoronoiMesh` function in **V10** still does not compute 3D Voronoi diagrams, which is strange since both the `DelaunayMesh` and `ConvexHullMesh` functions work with 3D data sets. I guess the waiting continues.... For the Wolfram Research employees, any ideas on why this was omitted and timeframe for when this functionality will be included in _Mathematica_?
