I want to develop a big personal project using Play 2 Framework. I am expert with Java language but it seems, with the few articles I read that Play 2 works perfectly and especially with Scala. I've never worked with Scala but I already learned concept as closures, functional programming etc... Learning it would be interesting. I am really motivated for but I wonder if there are some people who have started coding with Play2/Java and have changed for Play2/Scala that could explain their major concrete advantages.
