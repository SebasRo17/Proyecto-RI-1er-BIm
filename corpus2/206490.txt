I like to create simple class diagrams for my projects. Most of the time I just use composition, inheritence and associations. IMB's basic UML resource tells all about this. However I'm using ruby so I got the option to define a module with some methods. I can just include this module in every class where I want to use these methods. This could be interpreted as an inheritence, however some of my classes are already child classes of an other class and I don't want to mix the meaning of a symbol used in my diagrams. **How should I display an included module in my class diagrams in UML?**
