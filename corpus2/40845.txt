I currently simulate data with a lognormal distributed covariate. I used the following code to check the generated random numbers (with Mathematica 9).               slogn2 = Select[RandomVariate[LogNormalDistribution[6, 9], 10000000], # < 10 &];      Show[          Histogram[slogn2, 200, "ProbabilityDensity"],          Plot[PDF[LogNormalDistribution[6, 9], x], {x, 0.0001, 10},                PlotRange -> All, PlotStyle -> Thick],           PlotRange -> {{0, 10}, Automatic}      ![\] ](http://i.stack.imgur.com/AI6t9.jpg) I found an unexpected deviation from the PDF. The histogram data are well above the density (see image). Does this indicate an error in the random number generation or how can this be explained?
