when I use               FileDate[filename,"Creation"]      it gives messages like > FileDate::nocreationunix: The Creation date of a file is not available on > Macintosh and Unix. >> > > FileDate::nocreationunix: The Creation date of a file is not available on > Macintosh and Unix. >> > > FileDate::nocreationunix: The Creation date of a file is not available on > Macintosh and Unix. >> Why? **Edit** I forgot to say my OS. My OS is Linux. As george2079 said, Linux don't have creation date. But I found `FileDate[filename,"Change"]` works like "Creation" in windows system.
