Configuring a remote kernel with the Kernel Configuration Basic Options I manage to have a new kernel in the list of the kernel that I can open. However when I start the new kernel I get asked for the password and then nothing happens ... > The kernel MYKERNEL failed to connect to the front end. (Error = > MLECONNECT). > You should try running the kernel connection outside the > front end. My connection works both via ssh and via java ... `"java -jar /Applications/Mathematica.app/SystemFiles/Java/WolframSSH.jar user@host path/MathKernel"` Any suggestions or a less basic command that gives more info on the reasons of the failure of this connection? Thanks, Roberto
