Aside developer's tasks, there are minor stuff that each developer should do. In our company, the project leader spends some time with each developer to guide them on how to do several stuff, especially on inexperienced ones. Of course each developer has their tasks, but also they have notes that either they or the project leader noted. Those tasks can be like:   1. You should change the flow of this method,    2. I don't like the way you solve this issue,   3. Consider a faster solution   4. etc. Those notes of course can be noted! But laziness is an issue, even if the developer has the abilities required. My question is: How do we 'force' them to become more hypochondriacal than lazy?
