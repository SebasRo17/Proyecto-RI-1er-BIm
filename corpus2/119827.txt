I got this question in an interview and I was not able to solve it.   * You have a circular road, with N number of gas stations.   * You know the amount of gas that each station has.   * You know the amount of gas you need to GO from one station to the next one.   * Your car starts with 0.   * You can only drive clockwise. The question is: Create an algorithm, to know from which gas station you must start driving so that you complete a full circle. As an exercise to me, I would translate the algorithm to C#.
