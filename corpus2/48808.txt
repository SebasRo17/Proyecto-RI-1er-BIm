Given the Matrix               M = {{31.3, 31.2, 29.7, 29.7, 29.8, 29.2, 28.7, 28.3, 28.2, 28.2},        {31.7, 30.7, 30.7, 30.1, 30.2, 29.8, 29.2, 28.7, 28.5, 27.7},        {24.0, 24.2, 23.7, 23.7, 23.2, 23.1, 22.6, 22.2, 22.1, 21.7},        {23.2, 22.2, 22.2, 22.0, 22.2, 21.8, 19.5, 19.1, 19.1, 18.9}};      I want to get a list of all possible correlations between its vectors. With               x1 = Take[#, 2] & /@ Permutations[Range@Length@M];      And               x2 = Union@Cases[x1, {a_, b_} /; a < b];      I get the necessary permutation:               {{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, 4}}      Finally, with               Correlation @@@ Partition[M[[Flatten@x2]], 2]      I get the desired result:               {0.923, 0.933, 0.893, 0.952, 0.946, 0.934}      I am, of course, not happy with this code and would wellcome any suggestion how one could write this succinctly.
