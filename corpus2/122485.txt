This is a minor niggle, but every time I have to code something like this, the repetition bothers me, but I'm not sure that any of the solutions aren't worse.               if(FileExists(file))     {         contents = OpenFile(file); // <-- prevents inclusion in if         if(SomeTest(contents))         {             DoSomething(contents);         }         else         {             DefaultAction();         }     }     else     {         DefaultAction();     }        * Is there a name for this kind of logic?   * Am I a tad too OCD? I'm open to evil code suggestions, if only for curiosity's sake...
