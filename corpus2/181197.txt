I have the following question taken from a compilers course exam:               Show that the following grammar is ambiguous.          S = XcY     X = a     Y = b | Z     Z = bW     W = d | Ïµ      I drew the following tree: ![grammar diagram](http://i.stack.imgur.com/17J52.png) Am I correct in thinking it is ambiguous because **acY** can end up at **acb** (one of which is followed by an epslion) following different paths?
