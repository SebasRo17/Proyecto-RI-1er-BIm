I just managed to get my multiple kernels up and humming on a new multi-core machine, which I am quite happy about. I am slightly at a loss, though, about the meaning of the different parts of the Parallel Kernel Status monitoring screen, as the official documentation on it is quite sparse. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bxaDO.png) This screen is accessible from the Evaluation menu. Clicking on `Select Columns...` goes some way into clarifying some of the more mysterious elements: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WrFHN.png) In particular   * **CPU** gives the CPU time used so far by that kernel, and    * **RAM** gives the RAM it's currently using.   * The dots change color from green to red when a kernel starts calculation and back to green when it finishes. However, I have a few specific questions:   * What does the **Time** column measure?   * What does the **Elapsed** dialog measure?   * What exactly is the **speedup**? What is it comparing with?   * What are the green bars? Upon mouseover they grow tooltips with percentages with no indication of what they are. For the ones above I imagine the kernels are not really being used to their full potential; is that the case? (And, if so, is there a good resource for ideas on fixing that?)
