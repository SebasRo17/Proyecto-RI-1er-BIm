I am working on an issue where the exception only occurs in our production environment. I don't have access to these environments, nor do I know what this exception means. Looking at the error description, I'm unable to understand the cause.               javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Received fatal alert: handshake_failure      Would someone please advise me on how to approach this kind of problem?
