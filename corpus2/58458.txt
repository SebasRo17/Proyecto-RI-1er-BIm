I'm trying to solve an atomic physics problem in which I need to solve 625 linear coupled differential equations. I generated them by using the AtomicDensityMatrix Package. They are Liouville equations of my 25 level system. I am using the the command `DSolve` for solving them. When I solved 25 coupled differential equations with the same procedure there was no problem. example:               x1'[t]= 20*x2[t]+ 0.8*x41[t]+ 5*x152[t]+....,      x2'[t]= 48*x1[t]+ 12*x65[t] + 0.6*x60[t]+....,      x3'[t]=.....,     x4'[t]=.....,      with some initial conditions               x1[0]= 1/9, x2[0]=2, x3[0]=5......,      Can _Mathematica_ solve this large number of equations? What command can I use? Either `DSolve`, `NDsolve`... It would be very very tough for me to write this equations in some other software. I need some help.. I know definitely there will be a way to solve them in _Mathematica_ only..
