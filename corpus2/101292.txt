Lots of big companies, from Apple to Microsoft to Google, are putting more and more money into creating tools that will allow anybody to create a website with a WYSIWYG editor. For example, this email I just got from Adobe: > **Build websites as quickly and easily as an Adobe® InDesign® layout.** > > Currently in beta form, the application code-named "Muse" is a new > technology that enables graphic designers to use familiar, free-form tools > to design and publish HTML and CSS websites—all without writing code or > being restricted to templates. Be part of this incredible free preview and > experience how Muse will revolutionize the way you create for the web. As a web developer, I can't foresee any way that Adobe or any other company will be to create some solution which allows a user with no HTML/CSS/JS knowledge to build a useful website design for these reasons:   * The code generated will almost certainly be a mess, which makes it difficult for a programmer who wants to write the backend for the site to work with it. They may even be required to change the code themselves to structure it as they need it.   * HTML is not pixel-based, so it is very difficult to develop a tool that can easily design templates which can flow with changes in text size, etc. In addition, elements should follow each other in reasonable order, not in some random order (e.g. as dictated by when an element is added).   * Code generated in one tool would likely not be portable to other tools easily, which would lock you in to the original tool. (I am assuming that the tool would allow complete control of a website; as Adobe said, "as quickly and easily as an Adobe InDesign layout". Programs which let you use professionally-designed templates are a different story.) Do you think it will ever be possible for a person unskilled in HTML to create quality (both behind-the-scenes and appearance) web designs/sites?
