The documentation for the function `ToRadicals` says: > â™¦ There are some cases in which expressions involving radicals can in > principle be given, but `ToRadicals` cannot find them. I'm concerned only with cases where the argument to `ToRadicals` is a single `Root` object with a single polynomial function with integer coefficients and no parameters, and an explicit root index. * * * Here is an example when _Mathematica_ cannot find an expression in radicals:               ToRadicals[Root[-1 - #1^2 - #1^3 + #1^4 + #1^6 &, 2]]      But actually the expression exists: $$\frac1{\sqrt[3]{36}}\left(\frac3{\sqrt{\beta\phantom{.}}}+\frac\beta2\right),\ \text{where}\ \beta=\sqrt[3]{2\,\ \alpha}-8\sqrt[3]{\frac3\alpha\phantom{}},\ \alpha=9+\sqrt{849}.$$ * * * Another example is               ToRadicals[Root[6 + 25 #1 - 25 #1^3 + 5 #1^5 &, 5]]      where the expression in radicals is $$\sqrt[5]{\frac{-3+4\sqrt{-1}}5}+\sqrt[5]{\frac{-3-4\sqrt{-1}}5}$$ * * * What is the nature of this restriction? Is the problem known to be undecidable in general? Or is it extremely computationally expensive? Can we write an implementation of `ToRadicals` that is able to find an expression in radicals in all cases when it is possible? Or, at least, in much more cases then the built-in `ToRadicals` does?
