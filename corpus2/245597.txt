GNU General Public License is a ‘Viral License”. If an organisation is using Linux and MySQL which come under this license, is it dangerous to the organisation in terms of exposure of its intellectual property? As this license will demand the software that is linked to or that incorporates a GPL program to also be made available in source form under the same license when it is “distributed.”
