I am currently learning the two languages F-Sharp and Scala. These two languages are, in my opinion, both quite comprehensive to grasp. Nonetheless, what seems to make Scala and F-Sharp similar, is that both of them try to offer a conglomeration of programming paradigms (OO, functional), in order to solve real-world tasks and to make them applicable as general-purpose languages. While both languages seem to get the most attention in academia, there is comparable little mention of their usage in commercial software projects. Considering the different platform philosophies behind these two languages, which is -in your subjective opinion- more promising to become widely used for commercial purposes in the near future?
