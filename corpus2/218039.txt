I am in the middle of starting up a software company where we would use ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET WebAPI extensively at shop. We will be a group of 4 and no more than 10 will work on any particular project at any point in time(these are ground rules). I would like to know, what programming methodologies best suit a small(guerilla) team. Specifically, I would also like to know which ones are being used at famous ASP.NET MVC shops like Stackoverflow. The ones I know are:   1. Scrum and   2. Waterfall(I know its bad).  But what's the recommended way of development for smaller, group of 9-10 team. Also, will Test Driven Development help such a team in producing quality software? Are there any other techniques the team will have to know to be good at producing quality software?
