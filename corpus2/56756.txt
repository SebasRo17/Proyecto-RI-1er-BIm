I have a periodic function ff:               ff := Function[x, Piecewise[{{ff[x - 1], x >= 1}, {2 x, 0 <= x < 1}, {ff[x + 1], x < 0}}]]      Plotting it works fine:               Plot[ff[x], {x, -4, 4}, PlotRange -> {{-4, 4}, {-.5, 3}}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/EyIPM.png) But integrating it like this:               Integrate[ff[t], {t, 0, 5}]      What I get is a few of: > $RecursionLimit::reclim: Recursion depth of 1024 exceeded. >> and a few of: > $IterationLimit::itlim: Iteration limit of 4096 exceeded. >> And it keeps running until I abort the evaluation. What's the problem? Thanks. * * * EDIT: Thanks for the answers. To avoid any more confusion, this is the signal I actually have to integrate. It's a bit more complex, and I wanted to know if that's the reason why it won't integrate, that's why I went for the sawtooth signal.               s := x \[Function] Piecewise[       {       {s[x + 2 Pi], x < -Pi},       {0, -Pi <= x < -Pi/2},       {Cos[x], -Pi/2 <=  x <= Pi/2},       {0, Pi >= x > Pi/2},       {s[x - 2 Pi], x > Pi}       }      ]      Plot command:               Plot[s[x], {x, -8, 6}, PlotRange -> {{-8, 6}, {-.5, 6}}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BVcaV.png) EDIT 2: Using this much simpler, "automatically" periodic definition for the signal, there seems to be no problem with integration:               s = Function[x, Piecewise[{{0, Cos[x] < 0}, {Cos[x], Cos[x] >= 0}}]]      Still doesn't answer the question why Mathematica isn't able to integrate the signal when it's defined like above.
