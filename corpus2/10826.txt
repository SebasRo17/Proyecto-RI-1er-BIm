Over on Meta: A wishlist for Mathematica I got an interesting comment on the following suggestion and thought it merited a stand alone question: > re: NOTEBOOK INTERFACE USABILITY & ORGANIZATION > > Dock palettes -- When I use palettes, I'd love the ability to just stick > them on to the side of a notebook window so I don't have to keep searching > for them. Comment: > This may be able to be done using docked cells. @rcollyer See: DockedCells in the documentation. I recognize that Wolfram builds palettes as notebooks and I can imagine that one could create a custom palette whose cells one could dock at the top of another notebook (this would work great if one could split a notebook into panes and scroll through them separately so one always had access to the palette). Just not certain I see a clear way to do this with a supplied palette. So, does anyone know how to dock a palette to a notebook (or any reasonably functional equivalent)?
