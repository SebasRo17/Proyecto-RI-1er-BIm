I have this equation to begin with: $$1 - 3 x y = 5 z - 2 x $$ I want to solve this equation for $z(x,y)$, then plug $z(x,y)$ I plug $z$ inside a second equation: $$ y = 7 x z - \frac{z}{x} $$ Finally, I want to plot $y(x)$ for $-5 < x < 5$ and $-5 < y < 5$. I tried numerically, but the following doesn't work:               eqn1 =  1 - 3 x y  ==  5 z - 2 x       eqn2 = y == 7 x  z - z/x          Table1 = Table[z /. Solve[eqn1], {x, -5, 5, 1}, {y, -5, 5, 1}] // MatrixForm          Table[y /. Solve[eqn2 /. Table1, y], {x, -5, 5}]      I think the problem is feeding the values from `Table1` into the second table. How do I feed the data from `Table1` as the domain for solving `eqn2`?
