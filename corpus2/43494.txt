When you go to the Appendix D in Oracle Text Reference they provide lists of stopwords used by Oracle Text when indexing table contents. When I see the English list, nothing puzzles me. But the reason why the French list includes _moyennant_ (French for _in view of which_ ) for example is unclear. Oracle has probably thought it through more than once before including it. How would you constitute a list of appropriate stopwords if you were to design an indexer?
