Often you can see answers like “Avoid using C libraries in your C++ code“ or “This can be rewritten using STD/Boost in pure C++“. I understand C++ produces more maintainable code and has many advantages, but is it actually bad using C libraries when performance is a priority? I mean writing in what is sometimes called C-with-classes. I‘ve been developing a text file parser with both C and C++ versions and the C one was considerably faster. What i would like to know is if using C libraries in C++ has hidden drawbacks apart from the obvious ones like making the code less maintainable.
