I'm planning on making a **simple discussion feature** for a web framework I'm building. It should:   * allow anonymous posting   * block spam bots  The obvious answer is to use a generic " **captcha** " plugin, however I think there are some **creative opportunities** here that I would like to explore, e.g. questions like:   * (simple math) what is four + three? **___**   * (pop culture) who sings like a virgin? **___**   * (history) last name of first U.S. president: **___ __**   * (pictures) [picture of Obama], who is this?: **___ ___**   * (contextual) what year was our association founded? **___ __**   * (company) last name of our personnel director: **___ ___**   * (current events) the country that toppled Muburak: **___** The captcha could actually be used to **teach people about the community** , information that they had to look up, etc. Or these could be **collected from users** of the community, the ones which got approved and used would earn them reputation points. **What is the best way for a CAPTCHA to be designed so that it not only blocks spammers but helps reflect the knowledge of a community?**
