I am not sure this question is suitable for this site. Please let me know if my question is too vague or if it is hard to give a clear anwser. I'm a new user of _Mathematica_. My _Mathematica_ use began with version 8. I think I'm reasonably familiar with the core language of _Mathematica_ , but I want to get better acquainted with it's applications to various fields such as visualization. I find Michael Trott's four big volumes, _The Mathematica Guidebook_ , a very good resource, but find it a problem that the books are written for V4 and V5. As I stated above, I am a user of a later version of _Mathematica_ , so I have little knowledge of versions before V6. The core language of _Mathematica_ hasn't changed a lot since V5, but other parts did (the graphics capabilities for example). So, my question are:   * Are there any tips/suggestions/references for making the best use of this rather old book?   * How do I deal with the code compatibility issues?
