Could anybody, please, explain what is a `Property Container` or at least where can I get information about that pattern **on the Internet**? I've found that it exists as one of the `Fundamental` patterns in this article. Unfortunately, it is not described in the corresponding English article. The only thing is a short description in Wikipedia that I've tried to approximately translate below: > This pattern allows to add additional properties for the class in container > (inside the class), instead of extending the class with the new properties. If a short example is possible in PHP / C# / C++ or Java, it would be quite useful for understanding. P.S.: It seems like it has been described in "SanFrancisco(TM) Design Patterns: Blueprints for Business Software", but I don't have access to it. Google does not help or I'm searching with the wrong keywords...
