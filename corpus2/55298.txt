I was experimenting with the code from this question when I ran into another problem with regions.               Ω = RegionDifference[Rectangle[{0, 0}, {10, 10}], Rectangle[{4, 4}, {8, 8}]];     RegionPlot[Ω]      ![plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HkCCM.png)               Ω1 = TransformedRegion[Ω, RotationTransform[45 °, {5, 5}]];     RegionQ[Ω1]      > >     True >                 RegionPlot[Ω1]      > RegionPlot::invplotreg: TransformedRegion[RegionDifference[Rectangle[{0, 0}, > {10, 10}], Rectangle[{4, 4}, {8, 8}]], TransformationFunction[...]] is not a > valid region to plot. >> What is the difference between a "valid region to plot" and a region that satisfies `RegionQ`? Or, perhaps, to put it better, am I seeing a bug in `RegionPlot` or just an incomplete implementation? I note that               RegionPlot[TransformedRegion[Rectangle[], RotationTransform[45 °, {.5, .5}]],        PlotRange -> All]      works as expected, so it would seem `RegionPlot` can handle rotations for some class of inputs.
