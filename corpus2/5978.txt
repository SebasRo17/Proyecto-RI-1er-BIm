I would like to create a progress bar tool that allows me to see how my computations are going. I found answers to this question on many sites, I even found a package for it ( http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~jeremy/mathematica/progress/#download ), but unfortunately, I have no knowledge whatsoever on programming and such, so I could not really understand the instructions for installing it properly (didn't know wether to use a notebook to create the package, go to the kernel, or something else?). So I would really really appreciate if somebody could provide detailed step by step instructions for me to be able to get the progress bar going.
