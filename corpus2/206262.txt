I got mainly abstract classes in my project and there are a few other class which are using/inheriting them. When I'm writing the documentation I would like to specify that a part of it is just about the behavior of these non- abstract classes, but I found using this word silly. I could just say it's a class, however an abstract class is a class as well. So I was wondering **_is there an explicit word/synonym for non-abstract class?_** SEO update: What is the general name of non-abstract classes?
