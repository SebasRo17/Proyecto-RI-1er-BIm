Wikipedia helpfully explains: > The yobibit is a multiple of the bit, a unit of digital information storage, > prefixed by the standards-based multiplier yobi (symbol Yi), a binary prefix > meaning 2^80. The unit symbol of the yobibit is Yibit or Yib.1[2] 1 yobibit > = 2^80 bits = 1208925819614629174706176 bits = 1024 zebibits[3] The zebi and > yobi prefixes were originally not part of the system of binary prefixes, but > were added by the International Electrotechnical Commission in August > 2005.[4] Now, what in the world actually takes up 1,208,925,819,614,629,174,706,176 bits? The information content of the known universe? I guess this is forward thinking -- maybe astrophyics or nanotech, or even DNA analysis really will require these orders of magnitude. How far off do you think all this is? Are these really meaningful units?
