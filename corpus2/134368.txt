I am doing a research paper on programming, and I need to somehow explain assembly... I've never learned the language, but I understand what it is used for and kinda what it looks like...               MOV A,47     ADD A,B     HALT      And from what I understand, it is used for writing some compilers, small bits of code that need to be really fast, and other tasks... But this is kind of a question for people who have used/studied assembly and understand it fairly well. And no, I'm not asking for you to type up this segment of the research paper for me. That would be selfish. I just need a brief explanation, clarification on the subject (I'm just unsure if what I know is true or not) and a pointer in the right direction. For a research paper (I need to explain this VERY simply...) what is purpose of using Assembly in today's society? Of course it was important back in the day but now with all the high level languages, when is this low level language used?
