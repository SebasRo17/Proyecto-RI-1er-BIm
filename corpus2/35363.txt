I have a piecewise function that is continuous and strictly monotonic, like this:               f[t_] = Piecewise[{{t/4, t < 0}, {t/2, t < 3}, {3/2 + (t - 3)*3, True}}]      Now, I would like to get the inverse of that function. I would like an expression like this:               fInverse[x_] = Piecewise[{{4*x, x < 0}, {2*x, x < 1.5}, {5/2 + x/3, True}}]      (I later want to convert that expression or something derived from it of it to C code that will run on a microprocessor. So I need symbolic result, not a numerical one.) I have tried `InverseFunction[f]`, but I think it the result is a numerical inverse. I also tried `Solve[f[t] == x, t]`, but it returns no result at all. `Simplify[Reduce[f[t] == x, t]]` with proper assumptions (`$Assumptions = {t ∈ Reals, x ∈ Reals}`) is promising:               (t == 2 x && 0 <= x < 3/2) || (t == 4 x && x < 0) || (6 t == 15 + 2 x && 2 x >= 3)      but it's not a piecewise expression. My next step would be to write a function `piecewiseInvert` that iterates through the alternatives in the `Piecewise` expression, solves each one for `t`, changes the conditions appropriately, and creates a new `Piecewise`, but I'm hoping that there's a simpler way to do this.
