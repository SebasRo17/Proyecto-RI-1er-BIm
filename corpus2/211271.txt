I feel uncomfortable when using query string parameters as: `http://xyz.com/default.aspx?carId=1129&country=uk&uniqueId=98745DVF4563VVf1259` I would rather use something that should not make sense to anyone who is trying to make some sense from the URL: `?a=1129&b=uk&c=98745DVF4563VVf1259` (after all this query sting info is for my use only) Firstly is this a good thing to do? (I mean to hide logic of you query string) If it is, then is there a way, that internally developers can use `carId`, `country` and `uniqueId` in code, but externally the url uses `a`, `b` and `c` respectively? So if someone goes to   `?a=1129&b=uk&c=98745DVF4563VVf1259` when I do `Request.QueryString["carId"]` I should get 1129. Can this be done?
