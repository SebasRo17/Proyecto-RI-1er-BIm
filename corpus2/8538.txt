This is something that should be simple, but the documentation and other questions don't seem to deal with it. I can think of mechanically doing it through a loop, but I know there must be a better way. In this example, I have three lists (although the actual operation will involve several sets of 20-30 each, and they're much longer):               list1={1,5,5,5,5,6};     list2={2,1,2,2,2,2};     list3={3,3,3,3,3,3};      What I need to do is add them together - as in all the first positions of the three lists being added together, all the second positions, and all the third positions, so that I just have say:               list4={6,9,10,10,10,11};      The actual order of the list is important (I'm using it to store data). Thanks in advance.
