I usually see two job titles in the IT industry. My understanding of their most commonly accepted usage (simplified):   * **Business Analyst:** Main role is eliciting the users' needs   * **Software Developer** Main role is to design, build and test a software solution answering the needs I'm wondering: " _How we should call somebody whose role is to do both of the roles above?_ " Is this a common job title? And is trying to find people with these broadness of skills realistic, difficult? **EDIT:** I'm specifically interested to name Lead Software Developers who have eventually learned and can apply techniques of Business Analysis.
