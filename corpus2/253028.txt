I have a SAML 2 response with one assertion which is signed and the response itself has signed again. I use below code to validate the signature profile of the response.               SAMLSignatureProfileValidator signatureProfileValidator = new SAMLSignatureProfileValidator();     signatureProfileValidator.validate(**response**.getSignature());      And below code block to validate signature.               SignatureValidator signatureValidator = new SignatureValidator(validatingCredential);     signatureValidator.validate(**response**.getSignature());      But I believe that these things validate the response signature and the response signature profile only. **Do I need to validate the assertion signature as well?** I have tried validating assertion signature using below code block. But it gives me the ValidationException which means it is not valid. But it should be.               SignatureValidator signatureValidator = new SignatureValidator(validatingCredential);     signatureValidator.validate(**assertion**.getSignature());
