While browsing SO today I found this question here and it starts with this: > Sure, you're gonna tell me that SOAP is depracated and all, well i'm forced > to use it Found lots of statement like this one on SO up till now, this one just triggered me to ask this question. REST has its uses, SOAP has its uses, in some places they intersect as functionality but they are not replaceable to one another. So I wonder, why do people think SOAP is "deprecated"? Is it ignorance? Complexity of SOAP and WS-* specs? REST hype? What? If you think SOAP is deprecated please tell me why. I'm curious!
