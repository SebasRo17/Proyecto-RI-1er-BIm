Can you efficiently parallelize this? The parallel versions are much slower than the sequential version, and I'm not sure why. Does `SetSharedVariable` allow simultaneous reads for different kernels? It appears that it doesn't even though the documentation says you should use `CriticalSection` to make separate reads and writes atomic and thread-safe.               dispatch = Dispatch@Table[i -> RandomReal[1, 500], {i, 20000}];          Map[Select[# /. dispatch, # < .1 &] &,       RandomInteger[{1, 20000}, 10000]] (* < 3 secs *)          ParallelMap[Select[# /. dispatch, # < .1 &] &,       RandomInteger[{1, 20000}, 10000]] (* 50 secs *)          SetSharedVariable[dispatch]; ParallelMap[      Select[# /. dispatch, # < .1 &] &, RandomInteger[{1, 20000}, 10000],       DistributedContexts -> None] (* longer than 2 minutes *)
