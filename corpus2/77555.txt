I'm just about done writing an iPhone application and submit it to the App Store for approval. I'm going to sell the app for a price, but I'd like to be able to give out a few free copies on occasion, kind of like a promotional offer. I know when you go to one particular coffee establishment, they have gift cards available to feature various artists. You type in a code and it immediately "purchases" and downloads the song for you. I'd like to be able to do something similar to this for my own app. Is this possible?
