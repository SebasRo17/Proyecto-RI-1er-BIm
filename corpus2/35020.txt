I know that Eclipse is a universal IDE and variety of plugins are available to scale it. What is the difference between: The original Eclipse IDE, Aptana and NetBeans. I looked into Wikipedia and came to know that the latter two originate from the main Eclipse. For Aptana specially, what was the need to reproduce a new variant that resembles too much with its base IDE? If your preferred choice is Eclipse itself, what makes it unique as compared to the other two.
