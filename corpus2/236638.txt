Is there a good way to run a C# application on clientside in lieu of JavaScript? I have done some front end work with JavaScript and backend C# for web developing at an old job, but I am interested in hosting a website myself soon. I have a C# application I would like to be open source, but before people care to download I'd like them to be able to use it. At its basic level it's a simple text editor, but there's much more to it in the nitty gritty. I could write it in JavaScript, but it would require me to keep documentation and up to date changes on JavaScript and C# in that case. I was thinking of creating an AJAX panel and somehow loading my winform application into a frame, but I don't know how or what words to google because I've never done it before except AJAX.
