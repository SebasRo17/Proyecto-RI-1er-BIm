I'm working on a personal project (Windows desktop application) and started thinking about trying to make some money from the application (not the source). I'm not expecting to make a billion dollars but who knows right? The easiest way I see is give it out for free and allow people to donate but I'm not sure how well that works or what payment system is the easiest/best (Paypal)? If I were to sell it how would go about that? 3rd party distribution? Sell it from my own website with Paypal and verify reciepts? Build my own "store" for the application? Essentially: What method did you use to make money from a personal project (donation, selling, other?) and how did you go about it? Tips? Thanks for your response.
