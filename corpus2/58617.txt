I am using Mathematica 10 now. I typed code below               {{1, 2}, {2, 4}, {3, 6}, {4, 8}}[[;; , 1]][[1]]      and this gives result               1      But code               {{1, 2}, {2, 4}, {3, 6}, {4, 8}}[[;; , 1, 1]]      gives error > Part::partd: Part specification {{1,2},{2,4},{3,6},{4,8}}[[1;;All,1,1]] is > longer than depth of object. >> But according to help doc > expr[[i,j,...]]] or Part[expr,i,j,...]] is equivalent to expr[[i]][[j]]... What is wrong?!! I remember I always coded it like this in Mathematica 9, no error occurs. Is it a bug??
