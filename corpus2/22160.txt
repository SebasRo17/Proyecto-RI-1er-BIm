Let's say I want to minimize a function that uses a `Table` named `a` with the Conjugate Gradient Method of `FindMinimum`. _Instinctively_ I do the following :               FindMinimum[(Sum[a[[i]]*Cos[1.3], {i, 1, 2}])^2, {a, {0, 0}}, Method -> "ConjugateGradient"]      But I obviously get the following messages and results : > During evaluation of In[135]:= Part::partd: Part specification a[[1]] is > longer than depth of object. >>   >  During evaluation of In[135]:= Part::partd: Part specification a[[2]] is > longer than depth of object. >> > > {0., {a -> {0., 0.}}} So, to overcome this _little_ difficulty, I tried the following :               a = {a1, a2};     FindMinimum[(Sum[a[[i]]*Cos[1.3], {i, 1, 2}])^2, {a, {0, 0}}, Method -> "ConjugateGradient"]      > During evaluation of In[136]:= Part::partd: Part specification a[[1]] is > longer than depth of object. >>   >  During evaluation of In[136]:= Part::partd: Part specification a[[2]] is > longer than depth of object. >> > > {0., {{a1, a2} -> {0., 0.}}} and again I obtain the same error messages. So I came down to the _dirty_ manner:               FindMinimum[(a1*Cos[1.3] + a2*Cos[1.3])^2, {{a1, 2}, {a2, 0}},        Method -> "ConjugateGradient"]      which this time provided me with actual results :               {2.86222*10^-17, {a1 -> 1., a2 -> -1.}}      Now, while this last alternative works for this simple example and for a Table containing only two values, It will become impossible if I had to do for example:               FindMinimum[(Sum[a[[i]]*Cos[1.3], {i, 1, 1000}])^2, {a, {0, 0}},        Method -> "ConjugateGradient"]      How can I sort this out? I'm aware that there might something wrong with my approach, but I can't find another manner to set this up.
