I am trying to implement an algorithm for finding the zero crossing (check that the signs of all the entries around the entry of interest are not the same) in a two dimensional matrix, as part of implementing the Laplacian of Gaussian edge detection filter for a class, I understand everything up to step 3 of page 25 of this PDF. Why do I have to compare the absolute values of my neighbouring entries? It doesn't seem logical to me. If I have a matrix that looks like this:               [1 1 -2],     [2 -4 -1],     [1 -2 -2]      Why isn't the value of -4 a valid zero crossing?
