I'm creating a fictional architecture and other fictional components for this computer/emulator. I'm facing an issue, this being the virtual display. I need to be able to create a Window in which my program has access to all pixels contained inside, this is to emulate video memory/access. For the best speed I was thinking the best way to do this is to use native system API and conditional compilation for cross platform support, but I don't know if this is the best option. So essentially I just need some sort of way to create a cross platform window in which I can draw pixels in. I'm writing in the D language but almost any solution in C can be translated to D with C linkage. Thanks for any help.
