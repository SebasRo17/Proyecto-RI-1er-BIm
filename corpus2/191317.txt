I know that methods in a class should have high cohesion which roughly translates to having all the methods use all the instance variables directly or indirectly. I know that _LCOM4_ (Lack of cohesion)metric is useful for having a quantitative figure of how much cohesive the methods in a class are. A class with a LCOM4 value of 1 will be considered pretty good while a class with LCOM4 value of, say, 10 is considered a poorly designed class and this probably tells that we are better off decomposing the original class into 10 separate classes. All this is okay but what does the _4_ signify in _LCOM4_ metrics?
