I recently upgraded from Mathematica 5 to Mathematica 8 and I have a number of notebooks that no longer work correctly. The problems relate to the use of units. I don't need complicated unit conversions so I typically just tag values with symbols for the units. Under Mathematica 5, I could write the following (I understand that this example isn't physically meaningful):               3. in + 4. in - 7. in + 5. lb      And Mathematica would return               5. lb      Now, under Mathematica 8, I get               0. + 5. lb      This breaks a large number of notebooks. Can someone explain what is happening, and what if anything I can do to get the old behavior back? Thanks!
