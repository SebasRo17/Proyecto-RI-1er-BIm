I am a Web Developer working at a company where the fronted framework we have selected is Angular JS. I am now in the position where I am the 'resident expert' whatever that may mean. I have been tasked with teaching/explaining everything that our Designers need to know about Angular JS. Unfortunately my knowledge/understanding of design begins and ends with the color wheel. Therefore I have the following question: What, if anything would a designer need to know about a front end javascript framework in general/Angular JS in particular in order to streamline their productivity? What kind of things are irrelevant? What kind of things are important?
