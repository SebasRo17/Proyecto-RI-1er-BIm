I'm a beginning programmer, trying to get a grasp on everything, so pardon the probably mundane theoretical question: I see in a C++ tutorial that prototyping is needed to let the compiler know that a function(?) is coming up and not to throw up any errors. Why does it not search throughout a document to find the function it's looking for? Maybe the question I'm asking is; what is the purpose for prototyping? And can it be used in other languages?
