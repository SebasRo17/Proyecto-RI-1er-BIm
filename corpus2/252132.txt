Reading SASS basic features on their website, I stumbled upon the `@extend` feature. The example they give is the following:               .message {         border: 1px solid #ccc;         padding: 10px;         color: #333;     }          .success {         @extend .message;         border-color: green;     }          .error {         @extend .message;         border-color: red;     }          .warning {         @extend .message;         border-color: yellow;     }      That compiles to               .message, .success, .error, .warning {         border: 1px solid #cccccc;         padding: 10px;         color: #333;     }          .success {         border-color: green;     }          .error {         border-color: red;     }          .warning {         border-color: yellow;     }      Thus with this snippet of HTML               <div class="success">hello world</div>      you style your element with properties of `.message` and `.success`. However I feel this way of writing HTML (and CSS) very poor, in terms of semantic (you don't explicitly see from the markup above that the element has _also_ the styling of `.message`). Shouldn't the snippet above be               <div class="message success">hello world</div>      ? I feel it to be more descriptive, and more easily reusable. For example I could assign the `.success` class (as written in the above CSS but without the `@extend`) to other elements which are not messages, and so using the class as a modifier, in a BEM-fashion. **So my question is, is the SASS example approach more desiderable than mine?**
