From my experiences in software development (Eg. Waterfall ) I see it that most of the times it is the development team that sweats it out with the BA folk to get requirement clarity. The development folks then slog it out to meet deliverable deadlines. Where is the QA - they might be free - but will only hitch onto the bandwagon after the code is delivered. Then starts a slew of communication regarding what is a defect and what is a requirement change / clarity needed. From QA perspective - log a defect / bug / issue - and then its the development team responsibility to go figure it out. Clearly this is problematic and affects my opinion of the role and value that QA brings to the table in the Waterfall model. The question is if Agile is actually geared towards reducing this 'waste' by getting testing involved early in the development so that issues get eliminated at the start? If so then what aspects of Agile help solve some of the above problems I have experienced?
