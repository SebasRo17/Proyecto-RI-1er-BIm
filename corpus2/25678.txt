I currently have a large number of detailed files from which I would like to extract certain cells' information to make an Archive spreadsheet. There are approximately 9 parameters of each spreadsheet I would like to import, which in principal could be copy/pasted individually. However, I have a huge number of spreadsheets to extract these parameters from, so I would like to specify to Mathematica to import (likely using `Import`) these parameters from each detailed file (say, named Run01.xlsx to Run0N.xlsx for N files), extract the parameters of interest (whose position doesn't change from file to file), and add (likely using `Append`) them to a seperate archive file (named Archive.xlsx in the same folder). I understand how to write to/from Excel files directly by using _MathematicaLink (3.5) for Excel,_ and that _Mathematica_ alone can `Import` & `Export` Excel files directly. But, I don't know how to incorporate a command that specifies that the content to be written is to be imported from Run0N.xlsx for N from 1 to, say, 40, each of which is to then be `Appended` to the file Archive.xlsx (within the same folder, even). Can anyone shed some light on this admittedly simple question?
