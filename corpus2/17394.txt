I'm experimentally trying to use CDF Player to create an Dashboard TV here in the company (like in the airport, see image below). I would like to configure the CDF file so It could be displayed in full screen as a slide show. The TV has a resolution of 1280x720. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ubHKY.jpg) The idea is to setup each slide to have some time duration, and use some fade transition. Each slide is a image with the 1280x720 resolution, generated by Mathematica and saved in one specific file folder. As I use enterprise version, I have no problem in make CDF Player to have external folder access, and ready there images. Important points:   1. If the files in the folder are updated, it should be automatic updated in the dashboard, without need to restart it. The image file names and number in the folder are always the same.   2. Nice transition effect (like new version 9 options)   3. Make the mouse disappear   4. Should works on CDF (enterprise version, that can import local files) I'll be very glad with some ideas on how could I implement it.
