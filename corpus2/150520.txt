I'm entering my last few semesters of a CS degree and looking to start a career in Embedded Systems. From talking to a lot of people it seems like I might have been better off with a Computer Engineering degree but it is a bit late now. I am wondering what I can do to make myself employable in an embedded systems job in about a years time. I have taken a good number of computer architecture type courses as part of my degree and am hoping to tailor my electives towards embedded systems but it may not be feasible. What sorts of solo projects could I work on to get my chops up? I have an Arduino Uno but from what people have told me working with that doesn't really count. Can I access it at a lower level somehow? Are there books out there I can self study to learn more about embedded systems and the core knowledge I'll need to know? Is there some other cheap hardware kit I can buy to hack on that will be better than Arduino? Basically, how do I guarantee myself being an employable Jr. Level Embedded Systems Engineer in about a years time so I don't get stuck having to take a boring Java or Web App job?
