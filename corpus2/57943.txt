I am trying to find the list of any file in any directory of a given name (by in the directory, I mean directly in the directory, so in a directory which is in the directory would not count). For the sake of example. Let's suppose I want to find all files in each folder called "Preferences", and let's restrict our search to the folder ~/.Mathematica. If I wanted to do this from the terminal, I could just do `find ~/.Mathematica -regex ~/.Mathematica.*Preferences/[^/]*`. This works and I see there is a single file matching my criteon, `~/.Mathematica/ApplicationData/Parallel/Preferences/Preferences.m` But I want to try to do it conveniently in mathematica. I am thinking the `Filenames` function should do it. I will first run `SetDirectory["~/.Mathematica"]` Then I would run               fileAndDirectoryNames =       FileNames["*",RegularExpression[".*Preferences"], 1]      followed by               fileNames = Select[fileAndDirectoryNames, ! DirectoryQ[#] &]      However, this gives incorrect results for me: `fileAndDirectoryNames` is an empty list. If I instead run               fileAndDirectoryNames =       FileNames["*", RegularExpression[".*/.*/Preferences"], 1]      and recompute `fileNames` as before, then I get correct output. I am confused because it seems to me that the regular expression in my second attempt is stronger (allows for fewer matches) than the one in my first attempt. The fileNames function should have a monotonicity property in the second argument that if you weaken the pattern, then the new output ought to be a superset of the original output. Yet this doesn't seem to happen. Why is this? I am not sure if I am having a problem with mathematica or my understanding of regular expressions.
