**Introduction** : I have a WCF service library and a self-host Winform. Service features is File explorer including _(copy, move, delete, new folder, delete... etc)_ and Task Manager _(run, kill, update list)_. Then now I want to add other features like chatting between self-host and client, send an image from client to self-host so when it received, it is shown in a pictureBox in a new form. Till now I have two endpoints for (Task Manager, File Manager) that runs under one service "MainService". And I set up all the connections using DotNet 4.0 WCF Configuration and Wizards, and I'm using netTcpBinding. **Problem** :   I need to know how to communicate with between WCF service lib and self-host, so I can append a received chat from client on self-host form's textbox `TextBoxChat`. And also call a client callback from self-host when Send button clicked, to send the message from self-host textbox `TextBoxMessage`. Let's say this's self-host ChatForm ![http://i.stack.imgur.com/CWL8H.jpg](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CWL8H.jpg) So is it possible to do that in WCF? I would prefer to run ChatEndpoint under MainService, so all Endpoints use one port.
