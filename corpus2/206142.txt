We have Development department and the department of System Engineers that works on a big project (development of J2EE application). We are using _Build management system_ , _Bug tracking system_ and a _Wiki engine_ in our work. Sometimes we have a situation when some developer initiate a server restart or an application build that breaks the debug process for other developers (in some cases developers using the same remote _Developer_ server). At the present moment we are using the _chat_ application for approving the process of restart\rebuild server (application). Can anyone share the experience of solving collision like I described above? * * * My vision is to use application which was able to do the following things:   * create request for server restart (or application rebuild\redeploy);   * subcribing for notification on "new request created" event;   * manual approving the request (by several members) and automatic approving of request (in case nobody declined the request during the some period of a time);   * subcribing for notification on "the request is approved" event;   * the request solving;   * subcribing for notification on "the request is solved (done)" event. It looks like the request has its own lifecycle or workflow. I think that some _Bug tracking system_ (for example, _by Atlassian Jira_ ) can help to create the request and can start the workflow on it. But this solution does not look perfect (even good) for me - its too "heavy and bulky".
