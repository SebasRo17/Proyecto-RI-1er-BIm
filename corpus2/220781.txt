I'm in a situation with my company where this may be an important distinction. Is there any distinction between "source code" and "source files" in a technical context? Is there any distinction between "source code" and "source files" in a legal context? Thanks. Edit: I saw some close votes on this. I want to note that this is a possible issue between two companies - and where necessary, we'll definitely use legal counsel. I'm asking this because I'm attempting to be prepared if I'm asked for any technical definitions (as the developer role in this).
