I have an image: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UNXEV.jpg) I tried to extract the outline of the bubbles, but I met with some problems. Firstly I tried the method used in _Mathematica_ documentation for `Analyze Segmented Cells In An Image`, but it didn't work well, I got an irregular figure: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CkzBU.jpg) Then I tried the function `EdgeDetect`.
