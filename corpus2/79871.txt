When I challenged Chrome development team about their decision to block every version of the Java Plug-in by default (http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=84001). They answered that Java Plug-in is not widely used anymore. Google is also officially stating this: https://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?answer=1247383&hl=en-US. I'm aware that Applets as a tool for design purposes (banners, menus, etc) is outdated, and I must admit that it has been a while since I developed something serious that used the Java Plug-in (I had some fun with JavaFX and Web Start draggable applications for learning purposes, but that's pretty much it). Still, Java Plug-in accounts for a important part of my surfing experience (I'm the sad type of grownup still playing games such as Runescape. My bank use a Java Applet for the security keyboard and several sites I often visit uses Applets for things such as file uploading and authentication). My question here is: Do you guys think that client-side Java web applications are still relevant? Please disregard Desktop and Server Side applications... We all know how popular Java is (http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html). This question is specifically about Java Plug-in.
