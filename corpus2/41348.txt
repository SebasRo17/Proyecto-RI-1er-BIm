I have the following two questions   1. How to visualize the dependence Y versus X with Mathematica using ContourPlot, if it is given by the following system of two equations: Y=f(X,Z) and g(X,Z)=0   2. How to return the points {Xi,Zi} generated by ContourPlot applied to g(X,Z)=0 that visualizes Z=q(X).  Remark 1: The answer on the second question resolves evidently the problem formulated in the first question Remark 2: In fact the problem formulated in the first question may be effectively solved without ContourPlot by differentiating in X both equations, and numerical solving the resulting system of 2 ordinary differential eqs Any help and suggestions are appreciated.
