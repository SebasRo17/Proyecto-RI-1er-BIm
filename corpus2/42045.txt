does anyone know if there will be a Wrox Box 4? I would love to get something like that, but the latest collection of Wrox books seems to be the release for 3.5. I really need to get up to date with the latest version of .NET. I'm not sure if there will be a Wrox Box 4 though, because it looks like Wiley is now publishing Wrox books under Wiley, and not Wrox anymore. So it looks like I'm going to have to go with Professional ASP.NET 4 in C# Instead of the Wrox Box 3.5
