In mathematica, I have a piecewise function similar to:               Piecewise[{ {x^2 + 2*x - 4, 0 <= x <= 1/4},                 {0, true}                    }]      I don't know how many pieces there will be, or what the internal ordering will look like, but I know that exactly one of the pieces will have `x=0` as its left endpoint. How do I extract that piece in its general form (`x^2 + 2*x - 4`) without knowing the upper end of its domain (`1/4`)?
