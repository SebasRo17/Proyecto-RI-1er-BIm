I've spent some time developing a little Android app to scratch my own itch. I'm considering publishing the current version as a beta in Android Market. Pros for publishing it now would be the potential to get feedback. It would also be a way to gauge interest in the app which could effect whether to develop it further at all. What would be the cons of publishing beta in Android Market?
