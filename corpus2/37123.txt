I have a normal distribution with mean 106, and a standard deviation of 8. I'm being asked to find the point that has the property that 25% of these values have this value or lower. What I've concluded on my own (I'm just learning _Mathematica_ ) is that the value I'm looking for would be `y` in the following:               NProbability[x <= y, x \[Distributed] NormalDistribution[106,8]] = 0.25      Since I'm not very well versed in the language, I'm hoping someone can lead me in the right direction here.
