I am in the process of creating a short check-list for peer code reviews. So far I have come up with the following...   1. Is there a unit test?   2. Is there a integration test?   3. Do you understand the code you are reviewing?   4. Is it easy to maintain (simple,robust)?   5. Does the code not duplicatie existing functionality ? (Don't reinvent the wheel)   6. Does the code follow (my company's) naming conventions? (variable names,test class names etc)   7. Are all functions, methods and classes documented? (Summary,parameters,comments etc) What do you think of this list? Did I miss something? Is there any standard?
