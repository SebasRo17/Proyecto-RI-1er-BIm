I have been programming in .NET for the last 5 years. I have used design patterns a lot in our projects. I do have some domain knowledge in financial jargon. My ultimate goal is to become a technical architect. But the problem is that I am not getting the opportunity to do so in our organization. My question is in such a case how should I develop myself for becoming a successful technical architect? Also I have read somewhere that domain knowledge does matter for becoming a architect. Can some one please clarify this statement?
