I am trying to find out how to block a whole area/controller from being accessed by typing url website.com/area1/basecontroller/method1 (this area also contains the views that will be displayed) , while still being able to inherit said controller and use the method from original controller like so website.com/area2/extendedbasecontroller/method1. There would not be a method1 in the extendedbasecontroller, it would just perform method1 from the basecontroller Is it possible or could it be achieved in a different way?
