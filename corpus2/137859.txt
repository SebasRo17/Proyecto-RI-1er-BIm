I would like to gain the "Oracle Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) Developer" certification. According to this page I have to take a number of classes each of which costs up to a couple of thousand GBÂ£. Is this really the only way to obtain the certification? Can I not just buy a certification guide book from amazon and just sit the requisite tests? At the moment I have no Java EE experience and I'm finding it impossible to get interviews for the jobs I'm interested in. I'm hoping this will at least help me get my foot through the door.
