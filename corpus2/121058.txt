I have read that Node.js is a server-side javascript enviroment. This has put few thought and tinkers in my mind. Can we develop a complete data-drivent web application utilizing just JavaScript (along with node.js), HTML5 and CSS? Do we still need to use some server-side scripting language (e.g. C#, PHP)? In case we still need to use other scripting languages, what is node.js worth for, or useful? **NOTE:** _Pardon with my knowledge about node.js._
