I am trying to generate an Excel-compatible XML file from _Mathematica_. First, I created a test XML file by saving a Microsoft Excel workbook as "XML Table". Then I `Import`ed this file:               XMLdata = Import["test.xml", "IncludeNamespaces" -> True]      Now I am `Export`ing this back to XML:               Export["test_exported.xml", XMLdata, "AttributeQuoting" -> "\""]      The generated file cannot be opened by Excel. Comparing it with the original file shows that most of namespace prefixes are dropped although they were present in `XMLdata`. Why does this happen? How can I correctly `Export` an XML file which will be compatible with Excel?
