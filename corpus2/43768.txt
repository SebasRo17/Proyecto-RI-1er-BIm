I have a partial differential equation as follows: $$\frac{\partial p(x,t)}{\partial t}=\text{Dp} \frac{\partial ^2p(x,t)}{\partial x^2}-\frac{p(x,t)-\text{p0}}{\tau }$$ What I try to do was to get its general solution by               DSolve[D[p[x, t], t] == -((p[x, t] - p0)/Ï„) + Dp D[p[x, t], {x, 2}], p, {x, t}]      However, the output returns what I have inputted, which means **_Mathematica_** cannot solve this PDE. By looking up the help document, I find that `DSolve` can only find the general solution for a restricted type of homogeneous linear second-order PDEs, that is, for such a linear second-order PDE as $b \frac{\partial ^2u}{\partial x\, \partial y}+a \frac{\partial ^2u}{\partial x^2}+c \frac{\partial ^2u}{\partial y^2}+d \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+e \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}+f u=g$, only when `d=0`,`e=0`,`f=0` and `a`,`b` and `c` are all constants can we get the general solution. I have tried this PED in **Maple** , and get a solution with conditions, but I don't know whether it is correct. The help document tells that the algorithm used by `DSolve` is not applicable in this case. So, I wonder whether there exist some other ways or some packages to solve this PDE. If finding the general solution is impossible, is it possible to get a special solution?
