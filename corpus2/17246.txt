In version 9, with a newly started _Mathematica_ session, try the following code:               plotAttributes = Attributes[Plot]          Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 1}];          Attributes[Plot]          % == plotAttributes      > `{Protected, ReadProtected}` > > `{HoldAll, Protected, ReadProtected}` > > `False` Is there any explanation why `Plot` doesn't have `HoldAll` as one of its attributes when a fresh _Mathematica_ session is started, and acquires this attribute only after I call `Plot` once?
