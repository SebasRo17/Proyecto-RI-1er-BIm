I don't use C++ or bitwise operations at my current job but I'm thinking of applying to companies where it is a requirement to be fluent with them (on their tests anyway). **So my question is:** Can anyone suggest a project which will require gaining a fluency in bitwise operations to complete? On a side note, is there a canonical book on optimization techniques using bitwise operations since that seems to be an important use of them?
