I basically need some confirmation and clarification concerning Windows Azure with respect to a Silverlight application using RIA Services. In a normal Silverlight app that uses RIA services you have 2 projects:   * App   * App.Web ... where App is the default client-side Silverlight and app.web is the server-side code where your RIA services go. If you create a Windows Azure app and add a WCF Web Services Role, you get:   * App (Azure project)   * App.Services (WCF Services project) In App.Services, you add your RIA DomainService(s). You would then add another project to this solution that would be the client-side Silverlight that accesses the RIA Services in the App.Services project. You then can add the entity model to the App.Services or another project that is referenced by App.Services (if that division is required for unit testing etc.) and connect that entity model to either a SQLServer db or a SQLAzure instance. Is this correct? If not, what is the general 'layout' for building an application with the following tiers:   * UI (Silverlight 4)   * Services (RIA Services)   * Entity/Domain (EF 4)   * Data (SQL Server)
