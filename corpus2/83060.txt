I am trying to write a joomla type system in PHP to improve my coding/programming skills i need guidelines/rules of thumb to do that. what i basically want to do is create a index.php file which will act as a front controller and will redirect to the request transparently to "extensions/plugins" (no need for them to follow MVC and hence it will be more flexible) what are your recommendations on that? **EDIT** i meant i am trying to create it using CORE PHP (no frameworks), but existing libraries are acceptable
