So..I am going to have a phone interview with a company tomorrow. I never had a phone interview before so I don't know anything about it except that I am going to talk to someone over the phone. This is a PHP developer position. Is she/he going to ask PHP questions only? or is she/he going to ask any other questions? Please advise me!
