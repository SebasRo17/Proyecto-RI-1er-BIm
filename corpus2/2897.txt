1. I am new to _Mathematica_ and would like to find the set $$\{ (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2: (3x+y\exp(xy))(x-a) + (6y + x \exp(xy))(y-b) < 0 \}$$ for some constants $a$ and $b$. How can I do this? **Added** : Is the set empty when a=-1.0643 and b=0.150?    2. My actual question may be more difficult. For this function $f:\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$, defined as $$ f(x,y) := (3x+y\exp(xy))(x-a) + (6y + x \exp(xy))(y-b) $$ I would like to know its range $f(\mathbb{R}^2)$, or better yet $f(\mathbb{R}^2 - \{(a,b)\})$, or as close as possible. Can it be done in _Mathematica_ as well?
