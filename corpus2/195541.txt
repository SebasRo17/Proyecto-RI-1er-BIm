In a recent interview I asked the interviewers "how do you go about evaluating new technologies and libraries (such as SignalR) and bringing them in to use?". They said they don't, that instead they write everything themselves so they don't have to rely on anyone else. The firm doesn't work for the government or defence contractors or on any safety-critical projects or anything like that. They were just your average, medium-size software development firm. My question is: **how common is it for teams to write everything themselves? Should I be concerned by teams that do?** Edit -- Most every response has said this is something to be concerned by. **Would a second interview be an appropriate time to ask them to clarify/repeat their position on writing everything in house?**
