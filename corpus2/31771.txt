I have two lists as the followings:               ab = {1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1};     ac = {1, -1, -1,  1, 1, 1};      How I can find the difference (more precisely, the **edit distance** ) between them? In this case the result should be 1, since there is one item difference between `ab` and `ac`. Note: in my case, the list elements only take the values 1 and -1, and both lists are one dimensional of the same length, but it is always nice to see more general solutions (elements are of `Reals`, lists are matrices, etc.). Thank you.
