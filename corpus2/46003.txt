Here I obtained one code which should tests some zeros of the poly for various g, but sometimes I have to many cycles because of step and I need to parallelize the running on all cores. Classical ParallelDo instead the Do doesn't work. What to do further                poly=g*x^3+21*x^2-1.23*x+7.3247*g*I*x^2;                LM = {};      Do[      Lroots = x /. NSolve[(poly /. {g -> G}) == 0, x];           res = 0;      Do[      root = Lroots[[i]];      If[Im[root] >= 0,      L1 = Drop[Lroots, {i}];      res = res + 1/(Times @@ (root - L1));      ];       , {i, 1, Length[Lroots]}        ];       M = 1/((4*G^2)*res);       AppendTo[LM, M];           , {G, 0.001, 15, 0.01}      ];
