> Lisp and Fortran were the trunks of two separate evolutionary trees, one > rooted in math and one rooted in machine architecture. I see this in _Hackers and Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age_. And someone said that Lisp are Human oriented and Fortran are Machine oriented. Here human oriented means that the way of problem solving is more likely human do.   And machine oriented means that the way of problem solving is more likely machine do.   I think that Lisp and base on S-expression and symbol. Fortran are base on von Neumann and Variables. Is it right?
