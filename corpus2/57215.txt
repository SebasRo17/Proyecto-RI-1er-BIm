I use               NMinimize[someFunction, Method -> {"RandomSearch", Method ->{"InteriorPoint"},"SearchPoints" -> 2n, "RandomSeed" -> RandomInteger[{0, 100}], "PostProcess" -> {FindMinimum, Method -> "QuasiNewton"}}, MaxIterations -> 1000 n, PrecisionGoal -> 10, AccuracyGoal -> 10]`      where `someFunction` is a function of `n` variables. How could I measure the time complexity of this method?
