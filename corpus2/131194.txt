I have a question concerning derivative works of GPL'ed software. Imagine the following situation: A company writes a software (A) using a library (B) which is released under the terms of the GPL. Now of course, software (A) has to be released under a compatible license to the GPL. But what about dual-licensing? If software (A) is released under two licenses, GPL and a commercial one, is this in violation with the terms of library (B)? To rephrase the question, does the GPL force exclusivity for derivative works?
