I'm porting to C++ and adding a lot of functionality to a numerical application written in Fortran 77. While I hate F77, I have to admit that the thing goes very fast. Now, I'm implementing practically the same structure and algorithm, but nevertheless the difference in the execution time is noticeable. Not big, but it's there. And I'm wondering, could it be that I need to pass extra information to the compiler? The only related information that I've been able to find is a recommendation to use the **restrict** key word which is supported by g++, but that's all. Hence, my question: Are there anymore keywords important to speedup code in C++ in numerical applications? or maybe compiler directives? Thanks!
