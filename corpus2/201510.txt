The tutorials I've read tell you to use [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] attributes and `<%= Html.AntiForgeryToken() %>` in your code. I was wondering why this isn't a built-in automatic setting or at least a global toggle in the web.config. Perhaps it is, and I haven't realised, but I am doing it by hand and I can't help but wonder if there is a good reason for not handling it automatically behind the scenes. Any ideas?
