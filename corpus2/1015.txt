I'm going to ask this question at the risk of someone exposing me their own personal algorithm, if that's what you do please don't post that! I'm interested in learning what software you use to manage your passwords on various sites. If you do use software, what is it? What features do you like/hate/want? The other day I discovered a vendor that offers a "Hosted Cloud" platform to manage your passwords. Would you consider such a thing? What would your requirements be?
