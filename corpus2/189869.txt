I'm about to begin working on a project which involves creating an eBook-like website which will contain lots of large documents with text and images.   The site should have a rather minimalistic design, but it will include a UI with some scripting and animations to make browsing the large documents easier. I've been thinking on this matter for a while now and I can't decide what markup to use for such a project.   Should it be `HTML 4.0 strict`? `XHTML 1.0 strict`? Perhaps `HTML5`? It is a likely that people who are not especially internet-savvy will visit the site due to its content, and as such I think it's very plausible for some of the visitors to have relatively old browsers. Can `XHTML` or `HTML5` hurt me in this regard? Reading about various eBook formats (specifically `EPUB`), I learned that many of them use `XHTML` internally; does this mean that if I use `XHTML` (correctly) the site might also be packaged and delivered as an `EPUB` in the future? The strictness and cleanliness of `XHTML`/`XML` also appeals to me greatly. Overall `XHTML` appeals to me the most, but I'm scared about the implication of its use. It has supposedly been discontinued by W3C in favor of `HTML 5`. However, I don't really see any advantages to using `HTML5` over `HTML 4 strict`, as I won't be using any of it's features. I'm also worried about browser compatiablity of `HTML5`. Should I just stick with good ol' `HTML 4 strict`?
