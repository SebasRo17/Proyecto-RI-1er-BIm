I have a CSV file with $9$ columns. I want to plot them in the following way. Column $1$ will be along the $X$-axis. Any point $(x_i, y_i)$ of $i$-th curve in the plot will have the $x$ value from the corresponding row of column $1$ and the $y$ value from the $x$-th row of the $(i-1)$-th column. So, there will be $8$ curves in the plot. The file could be downloaded from this link. The code is:               data = Import["iso-pair-data.csv", "CSV"]; ListPlot[{data[[All, 2]],     data[[All, 3]], data[[All, 4]]}, Joined -> True, PlotMarkers -> Automatic]      I am not getting the plot as expected. Any help?
