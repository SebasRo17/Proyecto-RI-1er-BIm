I've read a lot about RESTful, but I have always had a hard time figuring out how I'd use it with a very long query string. This is an in-house project, and it won't always have a simple /someAction or someController/12/14/my-article- I-want-indexed. I'm not worried about SEO because the application is not on the Internet. My querystrings are long sets of ?somevar=123456&x=4785&y=394958....... Most examples for REST I have seen are for SEO and simple web apps like a blog, maybe a CMS. Is REST not the best practice for a situation where having long URLs with lots of variables in the querystring is the norm? Here is an example of what looks to me like a non-RESTful way: http://www.target.com/s?searchTerm=bicycle&category=0%7CAll%7Cmatchallpartial%7Call+categories&lnk=snav_sbox_bicycle Is this link an illustration bad practice and design? It's not a super long URL, but it illustrates that not everyone uses REST, if I understand REST. I know the reasons for REST, pretty URLs, hackable URLs, etc. I'd like to design my application well but feel like it would be shoehorned into a pattern I don't need. What is the best practice here?
