So I was wondering what is the typical way that people handle working on a project with git and getting to a point where the work you have done is not committed and not in a form that should be committed but you won't be able to work on it at that location anymore? Is the best thing to do just to transfer your working tree files over to a new location and continue work then commit and wipe the working tree and pull the changes, or is there some git utility that I do not know about that would allow me to do something like a soft commit, or something where I didn't have to alter the history when the commit is ready.
