When I try this command               Integrate[1/Sqrt[(s^2 - u)^2 - 1], {s, m, Infinity}, Assumptions -> u > 2 && m > 10]      _Mathematica_ declares that the integral does not converge on `{m, âˆž}` The integral, though, is clearly convergent, and _Mathematica_ has no trouble evaluating it at any value of $u > 1$. A command such as               Integrate[1/Sqrt[(s^2 - 20.1)^2 - 1], {s, m, Infinity}, Assumptions -> m > 10]      works fine.
