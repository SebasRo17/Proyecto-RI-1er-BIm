If I simplify an equation like Sqrt[A^5]+5*Sqrt[A^3]-Sqrt[A] then I get (A^2+5A-1)*Sqrt[A] with no problems. But when I need to simplify Sqrt[(A^5) (1 + a) ] + 5 Sqrt[A^3 (1 + a)] - Sqrt[A (1 + a)] as (A^2+5A-1)Sqrt[A (1 + a)], I get the original one: > >     Sqrt[(A^5) (1 + a) ] + 5 Sqrt[A^3 (1 + a)] - Sqrt[A (1 + a)] >   > > I tried `Simplify`, `FullSimplify`, `Expand`, `Factor`, but they all return > the original equation. What is going on behind the scenes ?
