I'm reading "Dependency Injection in .NET" of Mark Seemann (it's fantastic, and must have) and author often uses word "SEAM", but I can't understand what does it means? Here is an example of using this word:               Chapter 7 explains how to compose objects in various concrete frameworks     such as ASP.NET MVC, WPF, WCF, and so on. Not all frameworks support DI     equally well, and even among those that do, the ways they do it differ a lot. For     each framework, it can be difficult to identify the SEAM that enables DI in that     framework. However, once that SEAM is found, you have a solution for all applica-     tions that use this particular framework. In chapter 7, I have done this work     for the most common .NET application frameworks. Think of it as a catalog of     framework SEAMS.      I would be gratefull for helping me with understanding this word.
