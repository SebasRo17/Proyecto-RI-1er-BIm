# Passwords exposed in URIs An application stores URIs to be used for file transfers via SFTP, FTP, FTPS and SCP. Many of these URIs contain passwords, for example:               sftp://someuser:sekrit@host.example.com/      These URIs are visible to too many people. We cannot hide email addresses from these people. # A mini-language to get passwords out of URIs Using a mini-DSL, we can specify the parts of the email address we don't want to show:               sftp://someuser:<<CONFIG:customers/widgitco/password>>@host.example.com/      The program that does the file transfer would look for instances of this mini- DSL in the URI, parse them, look up the appropriate strings from restricted sources, and substitute those strings into the URI. For example, supposing that restricted source contains this key/value pair:               customers/widgitco/password: moresekrit      Then, after replacement, the URI should be:               sftp://someuser:moresekrit@host.example.com/      Each instance of the mini-DSL within the URI would be delimited with `<<` and `>>`. Details of the mini-DSL between the `<<` and `>>` would be free to vary in order to meet future requirements; the only requirement would be that it contain no `>>`. This would achieve my goal of reducing the exposure of these passwords. # Is this mini-language fragile?   * Are there valid FTP/FTPS/SFTP/SCP URIs which will break this scheme?   * Are they at all likely?   * What mini-DSL is less likely to be broken by valid URIs?
