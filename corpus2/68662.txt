I have /src/main/ with all my code (i also have /src/online, /src/prvlibs, /src/test, etc) but now i am thinking about moving a few non active projects out of the folder. Sure i could go in and delete all objs, (some) project files, etc so it doesnt take 200mb of generated data. But i think it might be nice for only 20projects or less instead of dozen of prototypes that aren't throwaway test. I use git for source control (but i'm sure all scm do the same thing). They dislike files are missing and if i delete them they aren't easy to browse. I like how i can commit all of my source by going to /src/main and commiting. And i can push all of them just as easily. But moving folders (to my external HD and keep history) is the problem. Should i have every folder have its own repo? or is there some kind of workaround i can use? If every folder has its own repo is there an easy way to push all my folders to my HD (or website) for backup?
