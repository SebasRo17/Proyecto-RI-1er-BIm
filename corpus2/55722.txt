I have now written my last line of code and I am ready to publish my application to the Android Market, what disclaimers should I add to protect myself as a developer from customers who purchase my application, to prevent being sued by stupid people? It might be a harsh question, but how does developers protect themselves when publishing their software? Developers or small companies (for example all these iPhone/Android developers) that can't afford hiring a small army of lawyers, what should they do? Any solid text I can use?
