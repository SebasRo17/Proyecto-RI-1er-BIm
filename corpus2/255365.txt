I've been looking for a way to get into programming for about a year now. I have about 2 years experience with scripting and programming at home and have been working for an 'IT' company for nearly 2 years. I say IT company loosely. They are an IT company but literally anybody could do the job. My trouble is finding a job without any professional experience (I'm sure most people can relate to this). I've had several interviews this year for help desk roles and devops roles all with the same outcome, "you are good but we need someone with more professional experience". I'm about to apply for a junior software engineering role but want to do things a little differently. I am rubbish at lying and far too honest when it comes to interviews. But I feel like I am needing to lie about my current job to include the things I do at home. I know I can do the jobs I'm applying for, but with no relevant education or proper experience I'm finding it impossible to prove I can do what they need me to do. I recently set up a website which I'm using as a platform to present my work and what I'm doing. I've not really had a chance to show it off to any potential employers yet though. I will definitely work in software development one day and I have no doubts about that because I am so determined. I just want to know if its OK to lie to take a short-cut. In short my question is. Is it OK to lie about what you do at work in an interview as long as you know you are capable of doing it. I've also been looking at going back into education for something computer science related. I already have a degree in Structural Engineering so it's not a decision I want to take lightly considering I'd have to fund it myself, but if it was going to get me a job then I would definitely think it would be worth while. P.S. references aren't a problem for me.
