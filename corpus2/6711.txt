Does anyone know how I can do this in Mathematica? Just an example.. Defining indices and variables (defined over indices), "mapping" variables and indices:               index i {NewYork,LosAngeles,Chicago}     Subindex j {NewYork,LosAngeles}     Index k {a,b,c}          variable costs = costs(i,k)     variable size = size(i)     variable biggest = biggest (j,k)      After that, I can start my calculations..               costs(i,k)=...      What about the notation package? Does it help? Thanks!!
