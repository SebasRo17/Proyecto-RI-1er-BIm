I am about to graduate, and I am already working as a web developer in our library IT department. When I look at job postings I am absolutely overwhelmed by the sheer variety of technologies out there. Some companies care about math + algorithms + data structures. Some care about experiences in technology stack XYZ. SQL, css, html, frameworks, javascript, design patterns etc.. etc... etc... At some point I realized I just need to start at mastering a foundation to become employable at a better place and go from there. But the skill-set to get me in the doors varies and I just don't have time to learn everything. How do you deal with this issue? What is the essential stack to become employable? Say in php or ror arena. Perhaps a smarter move would be to move to a technology stack with less variety like .net?
