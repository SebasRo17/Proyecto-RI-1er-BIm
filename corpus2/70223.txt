Unless it is needed to differentiate between a variable and field with the same name, I never put `this.` in front of a field or any member access in C#. I see this as no different to `m_` prefix that used to be common in C++, and think if you really need to specify that it's a member, your class is too big. However, there are a number of people in my office that strongly disagree. What is considered current best practises regarding `this.`? EDIT: To clarify, I never use `m_` and only use `this.` when absolutely necessary.
