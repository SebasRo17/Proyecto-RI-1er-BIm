I wonder about how I could make a `Graph` scale automatically when I vary the size of the vertices. I would like to visualize information with a `Graph`. The vertices all have e.g. additional info like a weight which I would like to visualize with the vertices drawn with different sizes. However, when I define the sizes, the graph keeps the original (as opposed to the new) layout. The graph then becomes invisible.               Graph[{1 \[UndirectedEdge] 2, 2 \[UndirectedEdge] 3,3 \[UndirectedEdge] 1, 3 \[UndirectedEdge] 4}]      shows: ![Standard Graph](http://i.stack.imgur.com/AJ9WQ.jpg) Now I add the "weight"               Graph[{1 \[UndirectedEdge] 2, 2 \[UndirectedEdge] 3,3 \[UndirectedEdge] 1, 3 \[UndirectedEdge] 4},VertexSize -> {1 -> 1.1, 2 -> 1.2, 3 -> 1.3, 4 -> 1.4}]      This shows: ![not scaled](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SditS.jpg) What I would like is that the Graph would be like ![nice](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GldPG.jpg) Any thoughts? This is a graph currently working on. As you can see one vertex hits his neighbour. I would expect MM to or reposition this vertex a bit further or to scale down all nodes. Of course this can be done by dividing the vertexes by a number. But this is manual work to see what looks best. I hope there is another way. ![other example](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pE7Uk.jpg)
