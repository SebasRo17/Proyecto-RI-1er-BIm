I've been asked to look at converting our traditional client-server software into a web-based version (using PHP).   One of the first questions from management was how we'd limit the number of concurrent users, currently handled by our licence manager that every client connects to when running our apps. My initials thoughts:   * Check the number of open sessions on the server (only with valid users that have logged in).   * Logging each login/logout to a DB table and counting them. Is there a standard/best practice way of limiting the number of concurrent users who can log into a web app?
