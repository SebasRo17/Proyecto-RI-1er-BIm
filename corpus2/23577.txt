I tried the following but plotting the function clearly reveals that there is a global maximum around $r = 7$ (here $a = 0.53$)               FindMaximum [{r^2*(Exp[-(r)/(3 a)]* (27 a^2 - 18 a r + 2 r^2)/(9 a^2))^2 ,                   0 <= r < Infinity}  , {r, 0}]      {0.253131, {r -> 0.39222}} I tried `NMaximum`, `Max`, `MaxValue`, `Maximize`, `FindMaxValue`, `FindMaximum` but nothing works! _(..I wonder why there are so many maxima finding functions anyway!..)_
