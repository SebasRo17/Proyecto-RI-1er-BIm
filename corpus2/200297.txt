The development team I'm in has been working on a VERY large project for months now and we recently started to implement a kanban board with agile practices into our process. We have seen MASSIVE improvement in our throughput! Its so exciting! But we have one struggle right now. We have a total ticket count for the project and our supervisor has given us incentive(candy and popcorn boxes) for when we get down to 100 and 50 tickets. It at first felt like a great idea but it feels like new tickets are created just as fast as we can resolve them, and its making the team feel worse about our progress. So heres my question: Should you reward based on overall project completeness or velocity? And if completeness how do you make that feel more reachable?
