I'm practicing mindfulness since a few weeks, a popular form of secular meditation which concept is to focus yourself on the **present moment**. It works so great I don't understand why not more people are rushing into that practice. It's useful for me because I've important responsibilities in several companies, and I have to manage a high level of pressure. Programming is still a large part of my daily occupation, but most of what I do and will do in the future is working with programmers, not programming itself. `That's what I'm questioning`. As a programmer we use the past and plan for the future all the time very actively. Being in peace will certainly help with interpersonal interactions and communication, but the so specific intellectual task programming is? Is meditation decrease our **ability** to do that, in profit of more peaceful and happy life? **Is meditation a good or bad thing for our programming abilities?** I will be very interested in the way to do meditation too. For example, I use breathing. **UPDATE APRIL 8 2011** : just finished the 8 weeks Jon Kabat Zinn training (MBSR). While it's too early to measure benefits on my programming abilities, I can tell you it reduced overall anxiety significantly. I strongly recommend the program.
