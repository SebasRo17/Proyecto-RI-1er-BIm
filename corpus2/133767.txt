I am going to build a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) service using Microsoft Enterprise Library for caching. I am wondering whether or not I should put the cache in the service layer. If I do this, do I have to use `InstanceContextMode = Single` for this to work? Are there better alternatives, because I prefer using `InstanceContextMode = PerSession`. Where could I put the cache?
