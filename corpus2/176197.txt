I'm creating a demo web app in html in order for people to physically see and comment on the app prior to committing to a proper build. Whilst the proper app will be database driven, my demo is just standard html with some JavaScript effects. What I do want to demonstrate is that different user group will see different words. For example, imagine I have an html sentence that says: > This will cost Â£100 to begin. What I need to some way of identifying that if the user has deemed themselves to be from the US, the sentence says: > This will cost $100 to begin. This requirement is peppered throughout the pages but I'm happy to add each one manually. So I envisage some code along the lines of 'first, remove the [boot US] trunk' where the UK version is 'first remove the boot' but the code is saying that the visitor needs the US version. It then looks up boot (in an Access database perhaps) and sees that the table says for boot for US, display 'trunk'. I'm not a programmer but I can normally cobble together scripts so I'm hoping someone may have a relatively easy solution in JavaScript, CSS or ASP. To recap: I have a number of words or short sentences that need to appear differently and I'm happy to manually insert each one if necessary (but would be even better if the words were automatically changed). And I need a device which allows me to tell the pages to choose the US version, or for example, the New Zealand version.
