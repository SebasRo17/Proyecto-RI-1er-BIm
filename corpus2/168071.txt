I'm considering implementing slugs in my blog. My blog uses MongoDB. One of the side-effects of using MongoDB is that it uses relatively long hex string IDs. Example before: http://lastyearswishes.com/blog/view/5070f025d1f1a5760fdfafac after: http://lastyearswishes.com/blog/view/5070f025d1f1a5760fdfafac/improvements-on- barelymvc Of course, that's a relatively short title.. I have some longer ones, but intend to limit the maximum character limit for slugs to something reasonable. At what point does a URL become so long that it hurts SEO instead of improves it? In this case, should I leave my URLs alone, or add slugs?
