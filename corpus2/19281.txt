How could I create two Input cells, such that when the first is evaluated, the contents of the first are copied to the second? So for example, there would be two empty cells - let's call them A and B - and when the user enters `f[x_]:=x^2+4` in A, nothing happens. When that same user evaluates cell A, then the contents of cell B are updated to be `f[x_]:=x^2+4`. There is a similar question here, but I don't need to be that low-level about things, and I also don't want automatic refreshing; only when cell A has been evaluated.
