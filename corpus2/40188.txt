I've printed my notebook into a pdf. There is a huge gap in the left page, due to the fact that the graph in the right page isn't divided to fill in the gap. Is there a way to fix it, preferably without resorting to do something like:               drawOrbits[deq1];     drawOrbits[deq2];     drawOrbits[deq3];      Currently, although it may not be evident, I'm doing something like:               drawOrbits /@ {deq1, deq2, deq3};      and show the result via Grid[]. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rlapx.png)
