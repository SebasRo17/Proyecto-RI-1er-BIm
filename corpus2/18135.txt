This takes a little patience to reproduce, but I got a screenshot of it in version 9 on Mac OS X 10.7.5: With a small `Graphics` object, it occasionally happens that `MousePosition` doesn't get updated when your mouse enters the graphic from the _bottom_.               Dynamic[MousePosition["Graphics"]]          Graphics[{Orange, Rectangle[{0, 0}, {1, 1}]}, ImageSize -> 60,       PlotRange -> {{0, 1}, {0, 1}}]      ![mouseposition](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1ZdJ9.png) As the image shows, the mouse is clearly inside the orange square, but the line above shows `None` instead of the mouse coordinates relative to the `PlotRange`. If I leave the square toward the top and re-enter from the top, the mouse position starts following my movements. To see the effect of the frozen `None` mouseposition, it seems I have to enter the rectangle from the bottom. I have to try this a couple of times - it doesn't happen every time. Is there a way, perhaps by surrounding the `Graphics` command in some other environment, to insure that the `MousePosition` is recorded more reliably? **Edit** I've now reproduced it on _Mathematica_ version 9 _and_ 8.0.4, OS X 10.7.5 on two different computers. **Edit 2** Although I'm not 100% sure, I strongly believe that jVincent's observation is correct: to reproduce this, I have to set the zoom level of the notebook, or the Magnification setting in `Advanced Preferences > Global Preferences > Notebook Options > Display Options` to something _other than_ the default `100 %` (or `1`, respectively). In my case, the latter was set to `1.25` when I made the screen shot.
