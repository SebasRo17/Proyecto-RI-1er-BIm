I am thinking through how I will use JavaScript for a project which is just in its beginning of coding. I am not an expert in JavaScript, but I recognize it as a very important part of the site so I have a few questions:   1. I often see projects have 1 huge javascript file which handles everything. Is that for the purpose of making things faster?   2. Is it ok to have javascript functions coded inside html pages? Or is it considered bad design?   3. Are most people still using jQuery? I have been seeing a proliferation of other .js frameworks. I know Yahoo made one and there are many others. Is jQuery still the defacto standard for most js frameworks needs? (sorry this question is subjective).   4. How should I approach/test various browser compatibilities? Should I be very concerned about that?
