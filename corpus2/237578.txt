I am confused about use case levels. All I could understand was that use cases that are contained in another use case fall under the level which is below the level of the container use case. I have identified the following use cases for an e-commerce store and I would like to know if their levels are correctly determined or not. Please provide a description of the differences between levels if I have done something wrong here. ![Identified Use case Levels](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QijX0.png)
