Wikipedia's "Edit Watchlist" page (for logged in users) has a list of hyperlinks to the user's watchlist (here is an example from my account). ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7bYtZ.png) I've tried to use `URLFetch` and `URLSave` as follows               URLFetch["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:EditWatchlist"]     URLSave["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:EditWatchlist","test.html"]      but it seems that they cannot grab the links in the watchlist. I thought `URLSave` is the same as saving a webpage as a HTML file by hand in Internet Explorer... Am I wrong? Even `Import`, with               Import["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:EditWatchlist","Hyperlinks"]      (and also with `"Source"`), cannot get the hyperlinks. How can I log into Wikipedia and get these links using _Mathematica_?
