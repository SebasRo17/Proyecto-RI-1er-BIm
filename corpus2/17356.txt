I am using `Show` with `PlotRange -> All` to overplot multiple `ListLogLogPlot`. The resulting plot has axis ticks that are unevenly clustered toward the top of the y-axis. (right image) When I use `Show` with `PlotRange -> All` to overplot the same data using `ListPlot`, the resulting plot has evenly spaced ticks along the y-axis (left image). ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XocXU.png) How can I use `Show` with `PlotRange -> All` to overplot `ListLogLogPlot` and get even axis ticks along the y-axis? I can force a fix by specifying the entire range with `PlotRange` in the first plot, but in general I will not know ahead of time the plot ranges and would like to avoid editing the plots themselves.
