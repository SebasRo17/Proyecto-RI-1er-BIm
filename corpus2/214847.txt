I see that most implementations of JAX-RS represent a class object containing a list of elements as follows (assume a class House containing a list of People)               <houses>       <house>         <person>           <name>Adam</name>         </person>         <person>           <name>Blake</name>         </person>       </house>       <house>       </house>     </houses>      The result above is obtained for instance from Jersey 2 JAX-RS implementation, notice Jersey creates a wrapper class "houses" around each house, however strangely it doesn't create a wrapper class around each person! I don't feel this is a correct mapping of a list, in other words I'd feel more confortable with something like this:               <houses>       <house>         <persons>         <person>           <name>Adam</name>         </person>         <person>           <name>Blake</name>         </person>         </persons>       </house>       <house>       </house>     </houses>      Is there any document explaining how an object should be correctly mapped apart from any opninion?
