I have file structured as `(Axis 1) (Axis 2) Data`.   As an example:               1.2E-003 -0.500        0.0000000000000000          1.2E-003 -0.493       1.53468784818295775E-004     1.2E-003 -0.487       5.89210645476378352E-004     1.2E-003 -0.481       1.23713800962565101E-003     1.2E-003 -0.475       1.99285240196946144E-003          2.8E-003 -0.500        0.0000000000000000          2.8E-003 -0.493       1.65202052327590321E-004     2.8E-003 -0.487       6.34230407238311057E-004     2.8E-003 -0.481       1.33156043724947304E-003     2.8E-003 -0.475       2.14469618088317755E-003      In other words:   * Each line has 3 real values   * The data is divided in blocks separated by a blank line.      * The size of each block is between 200 and 3000 (this size is unknown prior to reading the file, but I could write a shell script to extract and store this information somewhere if that makes things easier).     * The first value is the same for the entire block.   * There are exactly 1000 blocks. I would like Mathematica to open this file and store this information inside a variable. This variable would be a list of vectors. In this list, each element (a vector) corresponds to 1 block, and this vector contains the data from the third column (all other data is discarded). In this example, the variable should be a list of 2 vectors:               {{ 0.0000000000000000 , 1.53468784818295775E-004 , 5.89210645476378352E-004 , 1.23713800962565101E-003 , 1.99285240196946144E-003 },      { 0.0000000000000000 , 1.65202052327590321E-004 , 6.34230407238311057E-004 , 1.33156043724947304E-003 , 2.14469618088317755E-003 }}      Is this easy to do?
