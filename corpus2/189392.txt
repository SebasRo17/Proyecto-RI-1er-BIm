Well, I don't have a strong background in programming. I know C, C++, some C#, some vb, and some basic java and SQL, that's it. I don't have any work experience in web development, so just consider me as a completely new starter. I would like to do web development, and I hope I can easily find a job in web development after I finish my current academic program. So I have started with asp.net MVC framework. But, at least it seems to me that many positions require java programming in web development, so I decide to learn java at the same time while learning .net. Well, there are a lot of frameworks out there. A friend of mine suggests Hibernate, some people say that play framework is good for small applications, whereas some guys recommend spring, which seems to be a very difficult one. I want to start with a framework which is relatively easy to pick up and popular in job market. So what should I start with? And aside from a framework, what else should I learn? Besides, which one is more popular in terms of web programming, .net or Java? It seems that java is required by most employers, and I haven't found many positions indicating .net experience. Which of the two is actually more popular, and what about the trend in the future?
