Upon exporting a Mathematica graphics expression as a PDF, Mathematica does not seem to embed any nonstandard fonts used. When you open the resulting PDF document with a PDF viewer, all the text items are rendered with standard fonts instead. Is there a way to make Mathematica embed nonstandard fonts? Example with Mathematica 8.0.4 under Mac OS X 10.7:               g = Graphics[{ Circle[],         Text["Sample",          BaseStyle -> {FontFamily -> "Papyrus", FontWeight -> "Bold",            FontSize -> 24}]}, ImageSize -> Tiny]     f = Export["~/Desktop/Graphics.PDF", g, "PDF"]      The resulting PDF does not use the correct font.
