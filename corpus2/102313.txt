This might be a bit subjective and maybe that's a problem here, but I'm asking my question anyway :) Also, I found similiar questions (but none, answered my question), so you don't need to remind me to that, thanks. About my question: I have problems to keep my motivation/concentration the whole day up. I mean, in the morning until after the lunch it's all good. The problem usually starts round about 3pm-4pm, where I have (on hard days) massive problems. I get some sort of writer's block and can't think straight about problems anymore. I often just stare at the code and nothing... I know I need to solve problem X or achive something Y with my code. But it feels like my brain can't (or can hardly) make the connection between an idea and the actual code, I'd need to do this, anymore. Usually relax methods don't really work anymore, when this point is arrived. When I have some extra hours on my account, then I usually call it a day and go home. But obviously I can't do this anytime, sometimes something just needs to get done soon or I need the extra hours. I know, this is a sign of my body that I can't keep this up anymore without a longer rest. And I know (and you guys, too) that this job can be mentally really exhausting. (I work with sharepoint...) Don't get me wrong, I like my job, but I really do feel bad when I can't do with all the passion I'd want to and slack off in the later hours of the day. It just feels like my power is drained for the rest of the day for mental work. And now my actual question. Do you guys experienced similiar? What did helped you? How can you sustain your power for the whole day? (I just don't want to ask myself at the end of the day "why was I so "lazy" the last 1-2 hours" anymore) This is really important for me, I hope someone can help.
