As a university project, I have to replicate Raptor. A flowchart interpreter. The interface looks like this ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GTFmw.gif) But as I am not a experienced swing developer, I don't have much idea about which swing components to use for which part. I know:   1. The whole thing is a JFrame.   2. There is MenuBar on the top.   3. ToolBar exactly beneath it. Question 1: Am I right? Question 2: What component should I use for left hand side _symbols_ and rest of the part named _main_ in the picture? What you would have used? Note 1: We can drag and drop the symbols from Symbols to main. Note 2: I am not looking for any code. I just want direction. As there are always so many options in Java. It's easy to get confused easily. I researched a lot, but found nothing specific as it is mostly a design issue.
