I am using Voronoi Poligonization as a support form simulating island erosion; my data are the output of `VoronoiDiagram`, `DelaunayTriangulation`, the starting point and the list of point that now are sea. I am not working whit `BoundedDiagram` so I made sure all unlimited poligons are in sea. Now I need to show this output like in `DiagramPlot`, but with sea cells colored blue, and land cells colored in brown.   Can you give me some code example or indications on where to search? More in general, I need to have a planar graph of which I know vertex coordinates and the edges, what function should I use to choose the color for the faces of the graph?
