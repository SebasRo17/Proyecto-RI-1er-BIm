I'm a PHP developer for a living but have never worked on or contributed to any open source projects before. I am developing a CMS for my own use. I have a working prototype and I think that once it's ready (probably a couple of months time) this could be something the PHP community would be interested in. I'm a fairly confident developer but there are areas where my knowledge is lacking, especially when it comes to open source issues:   * What's the best way to publicise the project and/or find others who might be interested in collaborating   * My CMS is powered by CakePHP and basically sits as a layer on top of it. I've forked the CakePHP project on GitHub: I've used version control systems (SVN) before but I'm fairly new to GIT so want to be sure I'm doing things in "the best way"   * How can I find out about licensing issues? Which open source license would be best for my app? Also, my project borrows from a lot of other open source projects, for example I have sections of code (which I have heavily modified) but which had copyright/licensing notices in place- I've no idea what my obligations are in terms of keeping these in These are just a couple of examples of the questions I have, but I feel like there must be some resources out there which would be useful to me. Where's the best place to get started, what are the best communities/sites out there which cover these issues? I've had a look around but haven't been able to come up with much...
