There is a lot of evidence that things like offices, multiple screens, administration rights of your own computer, and being allowed whatever software you want is great for productivity while developing. However, the studies I've seen tend toward companies that sell _software_. Therefore, keeping the programmers productive is paramount to the company's profitability. However, at companies that produce software simply to support their primary function, programming is merely a support role. Do the same rules apply at a company that only uses the software they produce to support their business, and a lot of a programmer's work is maintainence?
