I am developing a very simple iPhone game with this view hierarchy:               Main Menu View       └> New Game View       |    └> Player vs Computer Game View       |    |    └> Pause View       |    |    └> End Turn View       |    |    └> End Game View       |    |        |    └> Player vs Player (offline) Game View       |         └> Pause View       |         └> End Turn View       |         └> End Game View       |       └> Information View      My current implementation has a single **`ViewController`** that controls every aspect of the user interface and a single **`XIB`** file that contains every **`View`** of the game.   Is this correct? It looks a bit confusing...   Should i have more **`ViewControllers`** and more **`XIB`** files? And what's the proper way to make them cooperate?
