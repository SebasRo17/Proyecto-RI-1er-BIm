I have heard about many techniques which are used by developer/software manager to solve hard programming logic or to create flow of an application and this flow will be implemented by developers to create an actual application. Some of the technique which i know, are:   1. Flowchart   2. Screen-Layout   3. Data Flow Diagram   4. E-R Diagram   5. Algorithm of every programs I'd like to know about two facts: (1) Are there any techniques other than this ? (2) Which one is the most suitable to solve hard programming logic and process of application creation?
