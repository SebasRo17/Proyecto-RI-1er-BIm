I want to get into web stuff, and thought of going with PHP+MySQL. I have experience in C#, C++, desktop graphics, but no web stuff besides HTML, CSS which I started learning 2 months ago. On SO PHP-book question, the highest rated book is "PHP Objects, Patterns and Practice". However, I'm not sure if it's a book to start PHP with... or is it? Most of the books mentioned in that SO question seem to be for those who already know PHP. I considered "PHP & MySQL Web Development, 4th Ed.", but someone mentioned that "it uses the mysql_* functions which are almost deprecated." Help?
