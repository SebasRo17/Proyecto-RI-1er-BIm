I am trying to plot a contour for a matrix, but it seems not to be evaluating all the points. Here is the interpolated figure, followed by the MatrixPlot version itself. I used this colormap because otherwise it looks like the white parts are actually evaluated values, but here the white isn't in the colormap.               ListContourPlot[{{0.55, 0.62, 0.65, 0.668, 0.672, 0.67, 0.676, 0.67},      {0.56, 0.631, 0.659, 0.669, 0.673, 0.675, 0.677, 0.677},      {0.57, 0.637, 0.661, 0.671, 0.675, 0.675, 0.677, 0.677},      {0.6, 0.649, 0.665, 0.673, 0.675, 0.675, 0.677, 0.677},     {0.65, 0.669, 0.673, 0.675, 0.677, 0.677, 0.677,  0.677},      {0.71, 0.694, 0.685, 0.679, 0.677, 0.677, 0.677, 0.677},     {0.77, 0.718, 0.694, 0.683, 0.679, 0.677, 0.677, 0.677},      {0.807, 0.733, 0.7, 0.687, 0.681, 0.679, 0.677, 0.677},     {0.807, 0.7333, 0.7001, 0.68652, 0.6806, 0.67871, 0.67675, 0.67675}}, ColorFunction -> "BlueGreenYellow", PlotLegends -> Automatic, InterpolationOrder -> 2]      ![ListContourPlot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wdvkR.png) ![ColorBar](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SENhs.png) When I plot the data using MatrixPlot I get: ![MatrixPlot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7Lmtr.png) I have tried to change Method in ListContourPlot to different options without any sucess, but I'm not sure I understand the documentation for this.
