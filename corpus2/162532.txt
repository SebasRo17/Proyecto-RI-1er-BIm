I have these classes               class Match     {       int MatchID,       int Team1ID, //used to reference Team       int Team2ID,       ... other fields     }      Note: Match actually have 2 teams which means 2 TeamID               class Team     {        int TeamID,        string TeamName     }      In my view I need to display `List<Match>` showing the TeamName. So I added another field               class Match     {       int MatchID,       int TeamID, //used to reference Team       ... other fields            string TeamName;     }      I can now do               Match m = getMatch(id);     m.TeamName = getTeamName(m.TeamId); //get name from database      But for a `List<Match>`, `getTeamName(TeamId)` will go to the database to fetch TeamName for each TeamID. For a page of 10 Matches per page, that could be `(10x2Teams)=20` trip to database. Example:               for(1..10)     {        Match m[i] = getMatch(i);             //the team are never going to be repeated, 20 teams spread over ten matches         m[i].Team1Name = getTeamName(m.Team2Id);        m[i].Team2Name = getTeamName(m.Team2Id);     }      To avoid this, I had the idea of loading everything once, store it in memory and only lookup the TeamName in memory. This made me have a rethink that what if the records are 5000 or more. What pattern is used to solve this and how?
