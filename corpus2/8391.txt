In a book I'm reading there is a chapter on documentation for your code. The book is about PHP and described some easy methods but also going for some complicated and time consuming methods (xml, xsl) like DocBook. At my current small company (5 people) we even rarely write comments, but I'm wondering if in a big company how detailed documentation do they write? Do they use such tools like DocBook? Is it complex or simple?
