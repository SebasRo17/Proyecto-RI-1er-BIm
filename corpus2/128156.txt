I believe this is a little related with this question: How to be a zero-bug programmer?. But I believe this is more regarding clumsiness in programming because I know it is impossible to become a zero bug programmer. Often, I write a very buggy code caused by my own clumsiness. For example in writing a currency rate conversion function, a trivial function. I can code the function that running well given the correct value. But sometime I just forgot to validate some unexpected-but-reasonable values. So are there any ways for clumsy programmer like me to write and test the code more thoroughly? **Additional** I see a lot of people suggesting to write unit test or using TDD approach. But writing unit-test not always goes well because of clumsiness isn't it? I don't because I once tried to write unit-test, but still often bumps with bugs.
