Sorry for the too ambiguous title. First consider a following code snippet.               x = "x"; y = "y";          kk[] := Module[ {q, w, m},         q[a_] := a + 1;         w[a_] := a^2;         m[Global`x] = q;         m[Global`y] = w;         m     ]      With this function `kk` I can write code like this,               kk[][x][1]    (* output -> 2 *)     kk[][y][2]    (* output -> 4 *)      as expected. However, I want to change the name of the global variables `x` and `y` to those of the local variables `q` and `w`. Thus, consider a below snippet. q = "x"; w = "y";               kk2[] := Module[ {q, w, m},         q[a_] := a + 1;         w[a_] := a^2;         m[Global`q] = q;         m[Global`w] = w;         m     ]      Note that the only change to the above code is the global variable names `x` and `y`. However, this function `kk2` does not work as expected anymore. Can you explain? The output I got was,               kk2[][q][1] (* unevaluated *)     kk2[][w][2]      Thanks in advance. EDIT: add `[]` to each `kk2` calls as pointed by m_goldberg
