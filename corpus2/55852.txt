Consider the following simple LogPlot:               LogPlot[Exp[x],{x,0,5}]      ![LogPlot of Exp\[x\]](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Rn3Er.png) Is there a nice way to switch the axes of a LogPlot? I'm aware that plotting the inverse function as follows               LogLinearPlot[Log[y],{y,Exp[0],Exp[5]}]      will do the job. The actual function I'm using is more complicated so I want to avoid using the inverse if possible. I've tried the various methods here How can I transpose x and y axis on a Plot? but they would seem to require some modification in order to work.
