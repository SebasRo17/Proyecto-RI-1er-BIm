I am an entry level programmer with only a few months of experience. Yesterday I was discussing with a colleague how we can improve the performance of a project we are working on together. The project is built with C# + Ext.NET + JS The plan was to move as many things as possible to client-side JavaScript instead of interacting with the server all the time. I thought this was a good idea, but couldn't help but wonder if there is a point where bringing everything to client-side starts making the web application slower. I understand that interacting with the server and reloading unnecessary data all the time is a waste of time in most cases, but I've also seen websites loaded with so much JS that the browser actually lags and the browsing the web application is just a pain. Is there a golden point? Are there certain 'rules'? How do you achieve maximum performance? Take Google Cloud apps, such as Docs for example, they're pretty fast for what they do, and they're web applications. That is some very good performance.
