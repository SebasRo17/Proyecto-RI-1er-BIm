At one of the DevDays conferences a presenter said that Workflow Foundation isn't just for applications that require persistence, but they can make it easier to write and maintain Async WCF code and the corresponding error handling. (try.. catch)   * Assuming that is true, is Workflow Foundation able to use all the CPUs in a system? (Async IO)   * What WF-specific guidance is needed before writing a CPU-heavy Async WCF application within the WF framework? (only tips that are specific to Workflow Foundation)
