If there are some points in a figure, how can I exclude some points to make them more evenly in the figure? 'Evenly' here can be defined as the number of points in each $0.01*0.01$ box is at most one. Without loss of generality, we can produce some random data to copy with (we can also give data directly, which is too long and tedious to present them here. So, we do not talk about how to produce the data but how to copy with the given data)               ListPlot[RandomReal[{-1, 1}, {10000, 2}]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7CuuS.jpg) Any help or suggestion will be appreciated!
