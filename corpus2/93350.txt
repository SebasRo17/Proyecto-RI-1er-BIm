I have seen many times that if we build a website for a client then there is a possibility that this site gets changed over a period of time. I was thinking that from now onwards whichever site I make I will host a copy of the site on a personal server. Like `client1.myserver.com` so that even if they change it I have the copy of it. So that if I need to show someone or I need to refer myself few things I have the proof there. I will not make them public but will password protect it. I want to know whether this is legal and a good idea or not.
