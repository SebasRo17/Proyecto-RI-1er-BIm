Recently I wrote an small prototype that uses some relatively new technology. Now I wanted to verify if this prototype is usefull and could be used in real world example. But now I have a problem, how can I do that?   * Normally, it would be a good thing to compare the prototype with already existing similar applications and compare if you perform better, provide better usability, etc. Since I'm not aware of something similar, this is quite difficult   * Normally, I would see if the requirements of the customers are met. But there aren't any real requirements and no real customers. It as just an idea. So the problem is, how can I get feedback on my prototype to see how it is accepted by potential users and what should be improved in a real implementation?
