I am trying to make a function like `Norm` but defined like so: `MyNorm[{x_,y_,z_}]=Sqrt[x^2+y^2+z^2]`. Mathematica assumes that x, y, and z are constants, and gives `MyNorm'[{x,y,z}]` to be `0` for any x, y, or z. This would be fine, except that my `x`, `y`, and `z` will be functions of `t`, and I would like `MyNorm'[{x,y,z}]` to be equal to $$\frac{d}{dt} MyNorm(x(t),y(t),z(t))$$ of course I actually mean `MyNorm[{x,y,z}]`. Does anyone know how to do this?
