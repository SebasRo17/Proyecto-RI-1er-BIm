When recieving data from clients how much data that you provided to them should you require back from them? For example when clients order a product from a webservice should they just need to provide a product code? The other alternative would be to require the product code product name and product price ect. I have alway built webservices the former way with the minimum of data returned back to me, however I have just been consuming another web service that requires the vast majority of the data returned back to them. What are the advantages of the second way?
