I am encountering a problem using `SystemDialogInput` within a `Button`. The code below shows what I am doing. To test this create a couple of files "myfile.txt" and "myfile2.txt" etc.               DynamicModule[{path = $HomeDirectory},           Column[{       Button["Save",        path = SystemDialogInput["FileSave", "myfile.txt"];        Print[FullForm@path],        BaseStyle -> {"GenericButton", 11, Bold},        ImageSize -> 120],       Dynamic[path]       }]      ]      **1:** Press the "Save" button. **2a:** Find e.g. "myfile.txt" and click on it; or (next try) **2b:** Type "myfile.txt" in the input field. **3:** I then get the warning message asking me if I want to replace. I choose "Replace". The problem is that the pathway 1->2a->3 seems to work ok, however 1->2b->3 seems to abort (no path returned). In other words when you type the file name of an exisitng file into the input field and try to save nothing happens. I am using Mma 8.0.4 on OS X 10.6.8. WRI tech support say they cannot reproduce this. **Q1.** Can anyone else reproduce this? **Q2.** Can anyone suggest possible causes? For those who post that it works for them can you give your system and version details. Thanks **Edit** I must be in need of a break because it does seem that the evaluation timeout is the cause so `Method -> "Queued"` is needed. Rookie mistake! Not sure now whether this question even needs to be here. Probably not.
