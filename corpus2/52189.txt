Let me first give you a small background. I am a high school student in my last year of high school. When I get to college, I want to take up computer science, because I really love software engineering. At home, I do a lot of programming. I never really finish any projects, but I just create all kinds of different "experimental" stuff just to learn different programming languages, technologies, and programming methods. I am a big fan of C# and I also am getting more into other managed languages such as Java. I've worked with C++ many times, and I know how the language works. Still, I just can't seem to get anything useful done with it. In C#, I can create a useful app in just a few hours. In C++, I will still be trying to understand different 3rd party libraries to get things done. For instance, I was earlier trying to figure out Qt for C++ GUIs, but in C#, you have Windows Forms right there to help with GUI Development. **So I say all of that to ask** , what is the job market out there currently looking for? I want to get more into C++, but it gives me such a hard time. By the way, I am interested in business application programming. So would it be wise to concentrate on sharpening my C# and Java skills and leave C++ until later? Thanks
