I'm a senior student at my university and chairperson of IEEE Student Branch there. Recently I was thinking of some idea to acquaint students with the professional environment, how software is produced in the industry and get a practical experience.. Obviously trips to software houses are not enough and we cannot provide this many internships. So the idea of simulating a software house within the university popped in. Resources at my disposal are students with their own laptops, university UPS and lan network with internet access, and a reasonably sized room with a whiteboard and three hours free time daily.. :) However, I have absolutely no idea where to begin with. Milestones or whatever it may be called, are Requirements Document generation, sharing of resources, delegation of tasks, version controlling etc... I'd really appreciate some advice, programming tools (for JAVA), communication tools etc and other things used in a decent software house... Technologies to be targeted shall be random possibly starting with J2EE Spring Hibernate and Later Visual Programming in .NET C# and ASP.NET MVC as well as Android or iPhone development....
