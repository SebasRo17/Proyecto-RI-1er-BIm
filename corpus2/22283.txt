I want to program in the regular and irregular spherical Coulomb wavefunctions $F_\ell(\gamma,kr)$ and $G_\ell(\gamma,kr)$, respectively, which are defined in terms of the regular and irregular solutions to Kummer's differential equation $$\Big[z\frac{d^2}{dz^2}+(\beta-z)\frac{d}{dz}-\alpha\Big]\,f(z)=0\,.$$ The **regular solution** is given by the standard Confluent hypergeometric function ${}_1F_1(\alpha|\,\beta|\,z)$. I can access this function in _Mathematica_ using `Hypergeometric1F1`, out of which I can construct the regular spherical Coulomb wavefunction $F_\ell(\gamma,kr)$. But I am unable to find the two **irregular solutions** , typically denoted $W_1$ and $W_2$. I need these to construct the irregular spherical Coulomb wavefunction. The $W$'s and the regular ${}_1F_1$ are connected by the relations: $${}_1F_1(\alpha|\,\beta|\,z)=W_1(\alpha|\,\beta|\,z)+W_2(\alpha|\,\beta|\,z)$$ Does anyone know how I can access **both** irregular solutions?
