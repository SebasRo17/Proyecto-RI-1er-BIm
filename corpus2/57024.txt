Is there some clever way to **integrate products of elliptic functions** $\wp(z;g_2,g_3)$ or $\zeta(z;g_2,g_3)$ in _Mathematica_? * * * _Mathematica_ seems to be able to integrate functions like               Integrate[WeierstrassP[z, {g2, g3}]^3, z]      However, not something like               Integrate[WeierstrassP[z, {g2, g3}] WeierstrassP[z + a, {g2, g3}]], z]      I have tried using the addition formulae for the $\wp(z)$, but _Mathematica_ is still unable to give the answer.
