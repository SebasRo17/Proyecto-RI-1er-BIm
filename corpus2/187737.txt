I am working with multiple websites (freelancer) and a good amount of them I write using C# MVC4. I created a very good boilerplace project that I plan to use on every next starting mvc4 application I build, however the namespace is named `Website`. I also do a lot of copy-paste from one project to another and then I always have to refactor namespaces, if I will use single namespace (Website) on all my websites then this problem dissapears. However - will this somehow impact my application, is it considered a very bad practice?
