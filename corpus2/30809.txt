Let the square nonsingular matrix $M$ is a given convergent matrix. What are the best scalar values for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (in the real numbers domain), at which the following quadratic matrix equation _approximately_ holds: \begin{equation} M^2+\alpha M+\beta I\approx0. \end{equation} In fact, I would like to find the scalar values as closely as possible for the following matrix $M$ (as an example)               Clear["Global`*"]     SeedRandom[12345]     n = 1000; Id = SparseArray[{i_, i_} -> 1., {n, n}, 0.];     A = RandomReal[{-1, 1}, {n, n}];     X = 1/SingularValueList[A, 1][[1]]^2 ConjugateTranspose[A];     M = A.X;      Also I tried to use NMinimize or FindInstance, but I failed. Please note that a rapid approach is more better for me to find more accurate values for the scalar paramteres.
