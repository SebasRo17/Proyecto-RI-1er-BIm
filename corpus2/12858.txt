In the spirit of getting new people on the project up to speed and leveraging their familiarity with existing Windows tools, what are possible options for cross-platform editing/development? Of course, the Windows people could learn vi/Emacs, X, Eclipse/NetBeans, etc, but this would involve a period of learning, per-person. Is there any combination of technologies/tools that would let developers that are most familiar with a Windows tool-chain help out on a Linux-based project? E.g. One developer would like to use UltraEdit. For reference, the Linux project(s) are all daemon processes written in C++ and the development server has:   * Version Control systems include RCS, CVS and SVN.    * Compile tools are GCC and a Make-like build system.   * X Windows   * Telnet/RSH/SSH Suggestions don't have to be free/open-source, but an indication of licensing terms would be greatly appreciated (Updated to add language)
