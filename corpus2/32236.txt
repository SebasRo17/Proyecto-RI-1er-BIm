My goal is to export a list of numbers into a file, with a comma between each value. Executing the following commands seems to produce a file with a new line between each entry.               v = {1.1, 2.2, 3.3};     SetDirectory@NotebookDirectory[];      Export["v.csv", v, "csv"];      When I open the file with notepad, what I see is   1.1   2.2   3.3   What I would like to see is comma separated values, like the following:   1.1, 2.2, 3.3 Recommendations? Thanks.
