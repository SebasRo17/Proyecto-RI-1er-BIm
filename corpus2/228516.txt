I'm a Java developer moving to Objective-C. So far in Objective-C I've seen protocols used extensively to implement the delegate pattern, but I haven't seen then to add a layer of abstraction in the way one would use Java interfaces. My gut instinct is to use protocols to define a contract and add a layer of abstraction, so that I may later substitute a different concrete class. Is this idiomatic in Objective-C, or do people tend to just use `@interface` to define the contract for a concrete class and use it directly?
