There is good explanation available for error handling on this and similar links. Here there is information on handling inappropriate input arguments and handling unprocessed functions using `$Failed`. But it is much of incomplete because I want to catch error message and according to that display some specific message. For example if I get               Integrate::idiv: Integral of E^n does not converge on {1,\[Infinity]}. >>      Than I want to display some specific message in words which is possible if I can capture this message and extract from it or if Mathematica returns some error code associated. Is there some better technique available than just using `$Failed` everywhere ?
