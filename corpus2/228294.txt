I wish to search for an integer in a vector of integer. I have two candidates for the job:   1. Binary Search   2. Find It seems that **Binary Search** is the best candidate for the job as although I have to sort the vector, the total running time will be `O(NLog2N)` assuming quicksort take `O(NLog2N)` and searching takes `O(Log2N)`. The running time for **Find** will be `O(N)`. It seems such clear cut that **Binary Search** is superior to **Find** , why did the committee of C++ still have Find in the algorithm library? I am sure the C++ committee had their reasons for including **Find** , what benefits of **Find** am I missing or how is **Find** superior to **Binary Search**? EDITED : Changed running time of quicksort to NLog2N
