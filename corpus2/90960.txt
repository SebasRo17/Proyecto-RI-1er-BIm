I participated in a set of interviews for a position in which I was hired recently. During the interview process I was interviewed 6 seperate times. 3 technical interviews and 3 situational / business interviews. During my second (and most dificult interview) the interviewer, who is now my manager, asked me to provide a solution to a programming problem overnight. I submitted the solution the next day but found out shortly that it was not what the interviewer expected. I quickly followed up with another solution that included the correct answer, and was deemed as such from the interviewing company. I now know that behind the scenes, during this time period, the interview process was changed because the manager had not hired any employees for the position in a 6 month time period. Now that I have the position, I am somewhat worried that this particular situation has put a bad taste in this manager's mouth regarding my placement here (which I believe was done above his head because of the new hire process taking too long). I have now been at the job for over 2 months and have NOT had ANY direct interaction with this manager, just a team lead. I believe that I have performed well, and have received praise and confirmation of my perceptions from my team lead. From a professional perspective, How do I make sure that my manager sees this, noting my interviewing history? Thanks in advance for any answers.
