I want to count some integral in _Mathematica_ (actually, check that this integral is zero...) I arrive to an answer which has a zero real part but has some imaginary part! Why? This could be a mistake but I suppose that I am not writting down the commands correctly... What do you think?               r[ϕ_] = 2*(1 - (1/3)^2)/(1 + (1/10) *Cos[ϕ])          Integrate[(Sqrt[(r'[ϕ])^2 + r[ϕ]^2])/(Sqrt[2 (-1 + 1/(r[ϕ]))]), {ϕ, 0, 2 π}]      _Mathematica_ gives the following answer > >     0.` - 13.028165432276161` I >
