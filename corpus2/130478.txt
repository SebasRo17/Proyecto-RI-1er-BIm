In 2011, I released some open-source code that was licensed using the Apache license. As such, all the source files have this boiler plate message at the top:               /*        Copyright 2011 My Name             Licensed under the Apache License... <blah blah>     */      So now it's 2012, and I am readying to release a version 1.1. As such, most all of the source files have been touched in some way. And some new source code files have been added. How do I update the copyright date on the existing files? Is the following the correct update to each source file? (i.e. change 2011 to "2011-2012")               /*        Copyright 2011-2012 My Name             Licensed under the Apache License... <blah blah>     */      Do the new source files get `Copyright 2011-2012` applied equally as well? Or does the new code just get `Copyright 2012`?
