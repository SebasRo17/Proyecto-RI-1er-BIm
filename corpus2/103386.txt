C#/ASP.net:               /// <summary>     /// Is a group in the basket already?     /// </summary>     public static bool isItemInBasket(List<BasketItem> BasketItems, int GroupID)     {         return BasketItems.Where(c => c.GroupID == GroupID).SingleOrDefault() != null;     }     public static bool isItemInBasket(List<BasketItem> BasketItems, int GroupID, DateTime ArtworkDate)     {         return BasketItems.Where(c => c.GroupID == GroupID && c.ArtworkDate == ArtworkDate).SingleOrDefault() != null;     }      Some people I spoke to consider this to be repeating code, whereas I don't consider it to be repeating essentially because the repeating code are all things you would have to pass to a method anyway if you wanted to adopt another technique. I don't think it's possible this can be simplified, or broken up into a more simplified version any further, therefore it's not repeated code. Is this a reasonable thing to say?
