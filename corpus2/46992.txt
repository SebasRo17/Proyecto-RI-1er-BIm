I have written the following function which can take in a list of tables as an arguement, and then filters each one. The function I wrote is below, and the commands I combined are listed below the function in case it is not clear what the steps are (sometimes I get confused if things are all strung together). Can this be cleaned up to be more concise, and readable?               Function[myTable, {tunableORRData =      Replace[myTable , a_ /; Abs[a] >= 10 -> 0, {2}] - ORR /.         targets; d = Sign@Diagonal@tunableORRData;         returnValue[row_, col_, myTable] := myTable[[row, col]] ;         tunablePairs =          Position[(tunableORRData\[Transpose] d)\[Transpose], _?          Negative]  /. Reverse /@ elementList;         pairEnergy =          returnValue[#1, #2] & @@ {#1, #2} & @@@           Position[(tunableORRData\[Transpose] d)\[Transpose], _?            Negative] ;         tempVar = Partition[Riffle[tunablePairs, pairEnergy], 2];          filterImposs = Replace[tempVar, a_ /; Abs[a] >= 5 -> 0 , {2}] ;          filterImposs = Replace[filterImposs, a_ /; a > 1 -> 0 , {2}] ;          Cases[           filterImposs, {x_, y_} /; y != 0]}][#] & /@ {smallBindingTable,            bigBindingTable}      Targets is used to set any value to the table equal to zero that is exactly the target. element list is used to map elements onto rows and columns of the tables.               targets = {ORR -> -1.51}     elementList = {"Sc" -> 1, "Ti" -> 2, "V" -> 3, "Cr" -> 4, "Mn" -> 5,       "Fe" -> 6, "Co" -> 7, "Ni" -> 8, "Cu" -> 9, "Zn" -> 10, "Y" -> 11,       "Zr" -> 12, "Nb" -> 13, "Mo" -> 14, "Tc" -> 15, "Ru" -> 16,       "Rh" -> 17, "Pd" -> 18, "Ag" -> 19, "Hf" -> 20, "Ta" -> 21,       "W" -> 22, "Re" -> 23, "Os" -> 24, "Ir" -> 25, "Pt" -> 26,       "Au" -> 27};      Leave only those elements that are within 0.05 of the target non zero               idealORRSmall =      Replace[smallBindingTable - (ORR) /. targets,       a_ /; Abs[a] >= 0.05 -> 0, {2}] ;      Get those elements and their positions. Then map a rule replacement to put the element names in, and the table name (to make the output human readable) Then filter the same table broadly for a different search.               tunableORRData =        Replace[smallBindingTable , a_ /; Abs[a] >= 10 -> 0, {2}] - ORR /.         targets; (*set any spurious values to zero *)      Here we filter to see if the diagonal element is on opposite sides of the target. IE (opposite in sign from any member of the column)               d = Sign@Diagonal@tunableORRData;     returnValue[row_, col_] :=       smallBindingTable[[row,         col]] ; (* lets us take row, col data from theidealORR data and \     get the energy from the small binding table*)          tunablePairs =       Position[(tunableORRData\[Transpose] d)\[Transpose], _?Negative]  /.        Reverse /@         elementList; (* get tunable pairs, map on element names *)          pairEnergy =       returnValue[#1, #2] & @@ {#1, #2} & @@@        Position[(tunableORRData\[Transpose] d)\[Transpose], _?Negative] ;     tempVar = Partition[Riffle[tunablePairs, pairEnergy], 2];          filterImposs = Replace[tempVar, a_ /; Abs[a] >= 5 -> 0 , {2}] ;     filterImposs = Replace[filterImposs, a_ /; a > 0 -> 0 , {2}] ;          Cases[filterImposs, {x_, y_} /; y != 0]      I have included a sample data table needed to make this work in a txt file. Here is the link:smallBindingTable Below is the output from filtering the smallBindingTable. I would like to do the same thing with a list of such tables.               {{{"Sc", "Pd"}, -1.47187}, {{"Sc", "Ag"}, -1.69071}, {{"Ti", "Mn"},       0.860106}, {{"Ti", "Au"}, -1.19295}, {{"V",       "Au"}, -1.10513}, {{"Cr", "Au"}, -0.131714}, {{"Mn",       "Ag"}, -2.51796}, {{"Mn", "Pt"}, -1.29537}, {{"Mn",       "Au"}, -1.21843}, {{"Fe", "Ag"}, -1.81939}, {{"Fe",       "Au"}, -1.44088}, {{"Co", "Au"}, -1.30395}, {{"Ni",       "Au"}, -0.671956}, {{"Zn", "Ag"}, -2.13397}, {{"Y",       "W"}, -0.189288}, {{"Nb", "Au"}, -1.087}, {{"Mo",       "Au"}, -1.1764}, {{"Tc", "Au"}, -0.922638}, {{"Ru",       "Au"}, -0.787955}, {{"Rh", "Au"}, -0.482705}, {{"Pd",       "Au"}, -0.379127}, {{"Ta", "Ag"}, -2.3501}, {{"Ta",       "Au"}, -1.12029}, {{"W", "Au"}, -1.16135}, {{"Re",       "Pt"}, -1.22974}, {{"Re", "Au"}, -1.04512}, {{"Os",       "Au"}, -0.76104}, {{"Ir", "Au"}, -0.578992}, {{"Pt",       "Au"}, -0.593863}}
