My company has highly optimized scientific application which has become so big and complicated that new versions are literally taking t = infinity to produce. (E.G. I have an email which pre-announces a late 2007 release for something that has not been released yet.) New feature requests from the scientific team to the development team leads to a lot of arguing. This got me to thinking.. The application should be clearly written with good design, clear names and lots of automated tests. New features are added to this application. Run and pass the tests. Then this application is branched for optimization a.k.a. a release or production version. Again, run and pass the tests. Am I missing something? Is this a 'thing'? I guess my question is, if I bludgeon the VP of Product Development with this, would I be right (about the idea, not the bludgeoning)?
