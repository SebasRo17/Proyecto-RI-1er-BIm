Which elements must a requirement contain that it can be considered complete? Or if this works better - which questions should I ask about a requirement to find out if it is complete. I am not talking about the implementation of the requirement but the requirement itself. I am asking this from the perspective of an analyst who wants to make sure that his requirements are complete before passing them on to the design team.
