I have a requirement to create a donation software for a project. Does anyone know how KickStarter designed theirs? What are the security elements involved? How do I create the credit card transactions-processing part? Is there some common library/service used for that? I am still in research phases for this, so any ideas appreciated!! The site I am trying to do this for is http://www.problemio.com
