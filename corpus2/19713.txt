I have a large expression produced by _Mathematica_. To use this expression in my Fortran program I need to change it to a Fortran90 form. I am not satisfied with the `FortranForm` command. The output of the _Mathematica_ expression is like this,                      -48*Sqrt[6]*E^((-2*S[1, x]^2)/bx - (S[1, y]^2)/bx - (S[1, z]^2)/             bz - (S[2, x]^2)/bx - (S[2, y]^2)/bx - (S[2, z]^2)/             bz - (Sp[1, x]^2)/bx - (Sp[1, y]^2)/bx - (Sp[1, z]^2)/bz)              + 3*Sqrt[5*v]      I hope I can get this expression like this,                   -48.q0*sqrt(6.q0)*Exp((-(2.0*s1x**2/bx)-s1y**2/bx-s1z**2/bz  &         -s2x**2/bx-s2y**2/bx - s2z**2/bz - sp1x**2/bx - sp1y**2/bx   &         - sp1z**2/bz)+ 3.q0*Sqrt[5.q0*v]      Notice that:   1. The width should be fixed and there is a "&" at the end of the line. It is better the single line space can be fully occupied.   2. Some integers should be changed to reals. For example, `6` -> `6.q0` or `6.d0`;   3. It is better for `E^` to be changed to `Exp()` form.  How can I change `S[a,b]` to `Sab` easily? This is not a big problem. I could replace it in _Mathematica_. Anyway, I want to change my _Mathematica_ expression into a Fortran90 expression automaticly. Is it possible?
