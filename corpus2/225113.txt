A few sprints ago I was assigned a task that was primarily research. I had to figure out how to get our product to interoperate with a very complex black box that we did not develop. I couldn't think of a way to estimate this work. Even if I got the ball rolling and knew the immediate problem I faced, I could not get a sense of how many other problems I'd have to solve after that. I could never tell if I was almost done or far from it. How am I supposed to estimate a backlog item like this? * * * I want to elaborate the nature of this assignment. I knew what calls I had to make to interoperate with the black box. That was the easy part. But the API took a very, very complex object as a parameter. Calling the API would throw an error and it was not easy to figure out what that error was trying to tell me. The black box wouldn't tell me all the problems wrong with my request, it would just tell me the first problem it found. This made it very difficult to know how much work I had left.
