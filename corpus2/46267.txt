I have a `Manipulate` with 6 sliders controlling 6 different variables. I have labelled them all. The problem is that the labels have different lengths, so it looks a bit messy: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/LB3HG.png) I'd much rather have the sliders aligned with each other perfectly so that they don't start and end in different places, to make them look more orderly. How would it be possible to do this? This is how the control panel is presently built:               {{x, 1, "Time"}, 1, 200*3.154`*^7, Animator,       AnimationRate -> speed*86400, AnimationRunning -> False},     Row[{Control[{{speed, 1, "Speed"}, 1, 30}], Spacer[20],        Dynamic[speed]}],     Row[{Control[{{\[Theta], 10, "Zoom"}, 30, 1}], Spacer[20],        Dynamic[\[Theta]], " degrees"}],     Row[{Control[{{scale, 0, "Scaling"}, 0, 5}], Spacer[20],        Dynamic[10^scale], " \[Times]"}],     Row[{Control[{{Opac, 0.05, "Opacity"}, 0, 0.5}], Spacer[20],        Dynamic[Opac]}],     Row[{Control[{{recurRate, 1, "Recurrence rate"}, 0.1, 1}], Spacer[20],        Dynamic[recurRate]}]      **UPDATE** On @Kuba's recommendation, I have put the whole thing in a `Grid`. Now however, it is displaying the variable names alongside the sliders. How can I hide the variable names from displaying next to the sliders? This is the code I'm currently using:               Grid[{       {"Time",         Control[{{x, 1}, 1, 200*3.154`*^7, Animator,           AnimationRate -> speed*86400, AnimationRunning -> False}],         SpanFromLeft},       {"Speed", Control[{{speed, 1}, 1, 30}], Spacer[20], Dynamic[speed],         Dynamic@If[speed == 1, " day per second",           " days per second"]},        {"Zoom", Control[{{\[Theta], 10}, 30, 1}],         Spacer[20], Dynamic[\[Theta]],         Dynamic@If[\[Theta] == 1, " degree", " degrees"]},       {"Scaling", Control[{{scale, 0}, 0, 5}], Spacer[20],         Dynamic[10^scale], " \[Times]"}},          Alignment -> Left]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/N3HQw.png)
