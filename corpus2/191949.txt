I know there are different ways to combine programming languages (Haskell's FFI, Boost with C++ and Python, etc...). I have an odd interest in combining programming languages; however, I have only found it "necessary" once (I didn't want to rewrite some older code). Also, I notice that this interest is shared (there are an abundance of questions about integrating languages on SO). My question is, simply, are there any other benefits in combining programming languages? Is there value in mixing different programming paradigms (e.g. functional+OO, procedural+aspect-oriented)? Any from-the-field examples would be much appreciated. **UPDATE** When I say "combine two languages" I am talking about using them in conjunction, in ways not necessarily originally intended. For example, suppose I use Boost to incorporate Python code in C++.
