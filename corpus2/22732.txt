I need to take two lists (each list contains the number of moles of a chemical). I have a function calledFraction that takes the each entry of the list and then calculates the mole fraction of Chloroform. Each entry in the new list should be the mole fraction calculated by taking   molesChloroform[[1]]/(molesChloroform[[1]] + molesAcetone[[1]] Here is what I have tried:               molesChloroform = {0.125, 0.100, 0.0625, 0.0375}     molesAcetone = {0.027, 0.068, 0.0952, 0.136}     moleFraction[molesA_, molesB_] = molesA/(molesA + molesB)     {moleFraction[#1, #2]} & @@@ {molesChloroform[[1 ;;]],        molesAcetone[[1 ;;]]}     Out[23]= {{0.555556}, {0.284211}}      This is not the correct output.
