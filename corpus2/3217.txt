Say I have two matrices (or, as in my case, higher order tensors) $A,B$, and I want to solve the equation $A=B$. To do so , I need a list of equations that equate entry-wise the elements of $A$ and $B$ (then I can pass this list to `Solve` or `DSolve` or whatnot). Is there a simpler way to get this list than `Thread /@ Thread[A == B] // Flatten` Because this only works for matrices and I need to add another `Thread` for each rank. I'm sure some of you code-golfers will come up with somehting elegant and unreadable...
