A list of `{Integer32, Real32}` items in _Mathematica_ seems to use 12-times as much memory than the `C` equivalent array of structs. And it looks like it can't be stored in a packed array, due to the integer/real mix. Besides splitting the time-series into two lists, one of timestamps and the other of values, so that each one can be packed individually, is there any other strategy? Also, _Mathematica_ 9 has a new function â€“ `TemporalData`. Is that more efficient than a simple list?
