There is a .NET application built using F# (the core part, as a DLL) and C# (the GUI part, using WPF). What is the best way to package it and to make an installer package and what are the most appropriate tools to use, commercial or free? It needs to include F# redistributable package in my application package and to check/download .NET framework needed. As you guessed, I'm completely new to this Windows world. Thanks in advance. Kh
