I think one of the best ways to learn and become a better programmer is to share knowledge gained from working on personal or work projects with others. One way to do this at the workplace is to set aside an hour or so a week and let one or several team members present their progress on the part of the code base they have been working on. This is especially helpful when each team member has a specialized skill set. What are some other useful practices that managers can institute to increase team cohesion and improve productivity?
