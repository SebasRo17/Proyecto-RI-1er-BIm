I've been having an issue in a project I am working on for a demonstration that involves a manipulate containing buttons that influence local variables. In essence, the problem is demonstrated by this piece of code:               Manipulate[DynamicModule[{T = 5},          Dynamic[Panel[Row[{T, Spacer[50], Button["T", T = T + 1]}]]]], {x,      1, 4}]      Before Closing: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cK2dE.png) After Reopening: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tSt3z.png) It works fine as far as functionality, but when I try to create a thumbnail and snapshot with the output, the values displayed are not saved if I close and reopen the file (in the case of this program, the display of of T would be reset to 5). How can I get around this?
