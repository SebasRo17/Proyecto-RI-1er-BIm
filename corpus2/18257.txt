I have a simple interactive plot in _Mathematica_ , with controls for various parameters. The point the plot is simply that, by manipulating these controls users can explore how the plot changes as the parameters change. IOW, this is `Dynamic`-101 stuff (which is my level at the moment). I would like to convert this to (non-proprietary) HTML + SVG (+ CSS, JavaScript, etc., as needed). Is there a straightforward path for doing this? I know that one can export _Mathematica_ graphics to SVG, but I'm not sure how one would export the dynamic behavior described above. (BTW, I've looked for ways to do this starting from JavaScript to begin with, but I have found that JavaScript support for plotting is rather primitive. JavaScript graphics seem to be mostly about Illustrator-type stuff, and more recently, "data visualization". In comparison there's almost nothing in the JavaScript graphics universe for plotting functions, the way `Plot` et al. do.)
