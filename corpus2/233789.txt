I have some methods im trying to test which use a StreamReader dependency that i mock using Rhino mocks. But it is a large xmlFile. In the spirit of unit testing im trying to keep away from using a test file in my test project. On the other hand copy-pasting 100 lines of xml into my test class seems sort of ugly. What is the best practice when returning large strings using a stub.
