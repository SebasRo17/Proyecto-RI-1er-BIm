I have one more problem, still with exporting full quality 3d figure into Word. I want perfect quality in a Word document of a 3d figure prepared with legend (traditional form of text). Extremes of the function in figure is nice to be yellow and rest of the function feature red. Example,                 Plot3D[Sin[4 x]*Cos[4 y], {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2}]      I need this figure to import in Word with full prepared legend and combination of color (red-yellow).
