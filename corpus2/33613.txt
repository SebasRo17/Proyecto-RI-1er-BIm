We are doing work for a particular client managing their CRM implementation. (The CRM itself is a product which has been largely customized to suit my client's needs). Now, they want us to manage the Oracle batch jobs/ETL as well. And for this, they are ready to provide us with Knowledge Transfer. (The Oracle batch jobs/ETL is managed in-house by the client now). After much persuasion, I got one of the Project Lead (designation-wise) to email the client asking for a KT Plan. (The Project Lead kept saying that they have never had KT plans before and all that for which I offered I will draft a template and even that was rejected!). Email from us to them - > Can you please share with us the KT Plan? Response from them - > Not sure what is expected from my side? The KT is planned for tomorrow from > 11 am onwards where Functional knowledge of existing ETL Data migration > package will be shared. How do you handle such a client? Most likely what is going to happen is this. The person who is giving the KT will say that I have given complete Knowledge Transfer and we will go back and say that "No, this was not covered. For this, they provided an overview alone and left it at that!" and so on... My Project Lead also did not respond to that email. He just said that the meeting is scheduled to happen at 11 AM (basically repeating whatever the email said and left for the day!). What could I possibly do? PS: Look for another job is a very helpful answer, but I am not looking for it. :-) **EDIT** The meeting went on well where they shared a Oracle DB package (which runs to 10K LOC). They told us that ETL which fetches data from other core systems to a Staging_DB is the ETL team (another team's) responsibility. This Oracle DB package will move the data from Staging_DB to my CRM_DB which is what we are to manage/modify. **What I did** Drafted the Minutes of Meeting as below:   1. Listed down what is In Scope and what is Out Scope   2. No documentation regarding the functionality of the Database Package   3. No reports for performance of existing Database Package to baseline the performance   4. ...   5. ... And then went back to my management and told them I need time to do the documentation, baseline the existing performance and so, I will come back with clarifications which the client is supposed to answer. Let us see how that goes.
