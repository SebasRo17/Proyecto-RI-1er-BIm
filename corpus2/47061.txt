I'm new to _Mathematica_ and can't get my problem solved. I want to display a list of `HighlightGraph` objects in `MatrixForm` like `GraphicsGrid`. This is my current tryout create a 3xn matrix               GraphicsGrid[      Table[# &, {3}, {(Length[graphLst] / 3) + Mod[Length[graphLst], 3]}]      ] /@ graphLst      This is the output. > ![Output](http://i.stack.imgur.com/oLyr8.png) I can't figure it out how to get this thing going. Can you lend me some help?
