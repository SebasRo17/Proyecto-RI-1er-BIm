I have a system of algebraic equations. For example: $$ \left\\{ \begin{aligned} x^2 y + 2 x y + 2 &= 0,\\\ y^3 + 2 x + 1 &= 0. \end{aligned} \right. $$ (In my problem the system contains 16 equations of degrees 1â€“3). I need to know the number of complex roots (the system in question has a finite number of roots). I believe, the number of roots can be determined using `GroebnerBasis`. But what is the most elegant way to do it?
