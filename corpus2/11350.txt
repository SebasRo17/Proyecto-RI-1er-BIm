![xkcd 1064](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bjF9V.png) I received an email to which I wanted to respond with a xkcd-style graph, but I couldn't manage it. Everything I drew looked perfect, and I don't have enough command over `PlotLegends` to have these pieces of text floating around. Any tips on how one can create xkcd-style graphs? Where things look hand-drawn and imprecise. I guess drawing weird curves must be especially hard in _Mathematica_. **EDIT:** FWIW, this is sort of what I wanted to create. I used Simon Woods's `xkcdconvert`. By "answers" in this plot, I of course don't mean those given by experts to well-defined problems at places like here, but those offered by friends and family to real-life problems. ![my plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ohDio.jpg)
