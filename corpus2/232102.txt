I am busy writing a bare-bones Standard C Library for my hobby OS. I am only including the functions I really need for now but the library is still referenced as 'libc' in my source and I plan to expand it to a fully featured C Library. My OS is going to be released as open-source so I would like to know what kind of copyright notice I should put on the source files for my 'C Library' because the coding is mine but it is still based on the source of other C libraries such as GNU C. I have seen this copyright notice on a C Library implementation for AVR               00001 /* Copyright (c) 2002, Marek Michalkiewicz     00002    Copyright (c) 2004,2007 Joerg Wunsch     00003      00004    Portions of documentation Copyright (c) 1990, 1991, 1993, 1994     00005    The Regents of the University of California.     00006      00007    All rights reserved.     00008      00009    Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without     00010    modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:     00011      00012    * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright     00013      notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.     00014      00015    * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright     00016      notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in     00017      the documentation and/or other materials provided with the     00018      distribution.     00019      00020    * Neither the name of the copyright holders nor the names of     00021      contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived     00022      from this software without specific prior written permission.     00023      00024   THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS"     00025   AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE     00026   IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE     00027   ARE DISCLAIMED.
