I just found this function in the project I'm working at:                 -- Just returns the text unchanged.       -- Note: <text> may be nil, function must return nil in that case!       function Widget:wtr(text)           return text       end      Too sad, the coder does not work in the company anymore. Why would one make a function that does nothing, but returns the parameter it's called with? Is there any use to such a function, not specified to this example, but overall in any case? Due to               function aFunction(parameter)         return parameter     end      Ends in               aFunction(parameter) == parameter      Why would I write something like               aFunction(parameter) == whatIWantToCheck      instead of               parameter == whatIWantToCheck      ?
