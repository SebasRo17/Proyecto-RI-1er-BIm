Is there a definitive guide to writing code comments, aimed at budding developers? Ideally, it would cover when comments should (and should not) be used, and what comments should contain. This answer: > Do not comment WHAT you are doing, but WHY you are doing it. > > The WHAT is taken care of by clean, readable and simple code with proper > choice of variable names to support it. Comments show a higher level > structure to the code that can't be (or is hard to) show by the code itself. comes close, but it's a little concise for inexperienced programmers (an expansion on that with several examples and corner cases would be excellent, I think). **Update** : In addition to the answers here, I think this answer to another question is highly relevant.
