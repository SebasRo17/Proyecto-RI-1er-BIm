My experience has primarily been in Java, but I'm working on a PHP project and conscious of my lack of knowledge of idiomatic PHP. What resources (online or print) will help me avoid making the mistakes that people with Java goggles normally make? First prize would be something that would give me short in- depth examinations of important PHP ideas, a la Joshua Bloch's Effective Java.
