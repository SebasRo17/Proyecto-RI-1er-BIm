I have been hearing about this term for close to 5 years now. I have read about services from Microsoft (Azure), but I have never saw it adopted in the mainstream usage. The thing I am trying to understand is this:   1. What happened to cloud computing? Is the infrastructure at present insufficient to implement this?   2. Is it still in its infancy?   3. Is it being used in other forms, like all the services Google seems to provide (plus Plus Google OS, etc)?   4. If it has failed, then why?
