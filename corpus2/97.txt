I'm working on a N-body simulation within Mathematica, and currently I have something along these lines:               Manipulate[      {r, v, a} = Step[G, m, r, v, a, ts dt];      Show[Visualize[names, colors, radius1, r1],        PlotRange -> {{-d, +d}, {-d, +d}}, ImageSize -> 1200],       Dynamic[MatrixForm[r]],      {{dt, 0.02}, 0.0001, 1, 0.0001}]      `Step[...]` simply steps the simulation forward in time. This works fine and I can confirm it works perfectly fine independent of anything else. However, occasionally the `Dynamic[MatrixForm[r]]` expression stops evaluating. I can't really figure out why it does this. Furthermore, sometime after the `Dynamic` stops evaluating, the `Show[Visualize[...], ..]` expression stops evaluating. At some point earlier when I had something much simpler along the lines of               Manipulate[f = Step[f]; Show[SimpleVisualize[f]], {...}]      The code within `Manipulate` would run indefinitely. Now it seems to randomly stop. It never stops at the same time, but it always does. Any ideas why? **An example of where this occurs is available here:http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9450720/minimal.nb** **Environment Information: Mathematica 8.0.4.0 on Windows 7 64-bit** * * * Here is a basic example of what I'm doing:               Step[r_, v_, a_, dt_] := Block[{nr, nv, na},        nv = v + dt/2 a;       nr = r + dt nv;       na = -nr;       nv = nv + dt/2 a;       {nr, nv, na}]          r = {1, 0};     v = {0, 1};     a = {-1, 0};          Manipulate[{r, v, a} = Step[r, v, a, dt];      Dynamic[Show[{Graphics@Circle[{0, 0}, 1],          Graphics[{PointSize[Large], Red, Point[r]}]}]],      Dynamic[{r, Norm@r}],      {{dt, 0.005}, 0.00001, 1, 0.00001}]      This evaluates fine and runs indefinitely.
