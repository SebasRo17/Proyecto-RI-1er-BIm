Correct me if I'm misunderstanding. Refer to the following sentence: > Stack Overflow copied a key part of the Wikipedia database design. This > turned out to be a mistake which will need massive and painful database > refactoring to fix. **The refactorings will be to avoid excessive joins in a > lot of key queries.** This is the key lesson from giant multi-terabyte table > schemas (like Googleâ€™s BigTable) which are completely join-free. **This is > significant because Stack Overflow's database is almost completely in RAM > and the joins still exact too high a cost.** 1 Actually I'm trying to pass from the interest on single technology like Asp.net MVC to architectures design. Can you better clarify the quoted sentence? [1] http://highscalability.com/stack-overflow-architecture
