Given the eight-element set `{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}`, I would like to enumerate all multisets (subsets with repetition) of size `n`, where `n >= 3`. For example, with `n = 3`, the sets `{1,1,1}, {1,1,2}, ..., {8,8,7}, {8,8,8}` would all be found. Ideally, I would like to be able iterate through each set, rather than create one gigantic program-crashing list, so that I can use each set at the time it is found. Since `Binomial[n, k]` only works for values of `k <= n`, I'm not sure how to best go about this.
