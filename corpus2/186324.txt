I am writing an application to report to the user(devs) when their website _fails_. And what I mean by _fails_ which is unfunctional or needs to report the problem to devs.   I do understand that status code 2XX means 'Success' according to wiki. But does that really do? I have access my website once and returned 204 'No- Content', which is unfunctional to me. So the question is, what are the list of status codes return should It be considered "website is functional"?
