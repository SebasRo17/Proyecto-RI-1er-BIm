I would like to hear some improvement suggestions for mobile development (Android/iOS) project architectures. I would like to go for a "safe" design, modular and that can be easily maintained in time. As far as I know **Android** and also **iOS** platforms are built on **MVC** , at least have the `Activities` and `UIViewControllers` that are a sort of _controller_ part from **MVC** (as many stated out there on the internet). Also I know two approaches so far for a basic project( **Android** /* _iOS_ *): ##  1\. My favorite (a sort of MVC) _**Model_** \- I have here the models, only simple getter/setter classes   shaping the project entities _**View_** \- the Activities, UIViewController and custom views, only display, get data from the user interface here, usually gets the data from the Controller, never directly from the Acess _**Controller_** \- some singletons (not necessary but usual) that manage each entity data, usually are doing business jobs, loading data from the Access layer and don't have access to the view layer. _**Access_** \- Database and Web Service managers, serves data back to Controller layer, can't have contact to any other layers. ## 2\. Commonly seen (also a sort of MVC) _**Model_** \- the models, only simple getter/setter classes shaping the project entities, I usually saw also some business jobs here too. _**View-Controller_** -(Activities and UIViewController) that manage entity data, usually are doing business jobs and also take care of displaying data to the user. Also make calls through some web service classes to get the data. So far I am using the first variant as I consider it more decoupled and I can see the difference between who is making business jobs, user interface communication and data providers. This making it more maintainable than the second one. The drawback for the first one is that has 2 more layers than the second one, this means more classes(but less code in each class) and at the start of a project, this can take a bit longer to develop than the second one. What approach do you use or which do you think it is better and why?
