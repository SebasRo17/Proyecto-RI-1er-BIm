We're developing a web app uing Django and we're a small team of 3-4 programmers â€” some doing the UI stuff and some doing the Backend stuff. I'd love some tips and suggestions from the people here. This is out current setup:   1. We're using Git as as our SCM tool and following this branching model.   2. We're following the PEP8 for your style guide.   3. Agile is our software development methodology and we're using Jira for that.   4. We're using the Confluence plugin for Jira for documentation and I'm going to be writing a script that also dumps the PyDocs into Confluence.   5. We're using `virtualenv` for sandboxing   6. We're using `zc.buildout` for building This is whatever I can think of off the top of my head. Any other suggestions/tips would be welcome. I feel that we have a pretty good set up but I'm also confident that we could do more.
