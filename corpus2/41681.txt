Is there a way to add ContourLabels on ContourPlot3D ? (tried in Mathematica 9) I tried doing the following code :               f[x1_, x2_, x3_] := x1 + x2^2 + x2 x3 + 2 x3^2     h[x1_, x2_, x3_] := x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2 - 1     a = 1;     ContourPlot3D[      h[x1, x2, x3] == 0,      {x1, -a, a}, {x2, -a, a}, {x3, -a, a},      MeshFunctions -> {f[#1, #2, #3] &},      PlotPoints -> 20,      ContourLabels -> Automatic      ]      It throws the following error :               ContourPlot3D::optx: "Unknown option ContourLabels->Automatic in ContourPlot3D[h[x1,x2,x3]==0,{x1,-a,a},{x2,-a,a},{x3,-a,a},MeshFunctions->{f[#1,#2,#3]&},PlotPoints->20,ContourLabels->Automatic]"      If I **removed** ContourLabels -> Automatic, it works fine and I get the following output ![ContourPlot's output when ContourLabels option is removed](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nMQJM.jpg) Edit 1: I would like to add the contours for the mesh (black) lines as shown in the figure
