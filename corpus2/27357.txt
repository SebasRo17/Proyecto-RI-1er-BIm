I am currently running some rather compilex _Mathematica_ calculations on my laptop and sometimes run into an out-of-memory errors. However, I have access to some larger simulation servers via ssh, but they don't have _Mathematica_ installed on them. Is there a possibility I can use this additional calculation-power for my calculations? (I already found ConnectToARemoteKernel but if I understand correctly this only works, if _Mathematica_ is installed on both systems.)
