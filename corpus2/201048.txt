I have some legal questions regarding OpenJDKs source header:               /*      * Copyright (c) 1997, 2008, Oracle and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.      * DO NOT ALTER OR REMOVE COPYRIGHT NOTICES OR THIS FILE HEADER.      *      * This code is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it      * under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 only, as      * published by the Free Software Foundation.  Oracle designates this      * particular file as subject to the "Classpath" exception as provided      * by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code.     (...)        * Is it GPL-conform to define a comment-part of a source-file (in this case the header) as "must not be modified"?    * Do other GPL-licensed open-source projects derived from this sources need to obey this "statement"?   * Does Oracle really have a Copyright on these GPL-sources?   * Is it GPL-conform to state that it's **_only_** allowed to `modify [the software] under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2`?   * What does this mean for GPLv3 open-source projects which are using these (possibly modified) sources?   * Do I have to fear editing (and publishing) this file (and maybe adding something to the file header) in my own GPLv3 open-source project?
