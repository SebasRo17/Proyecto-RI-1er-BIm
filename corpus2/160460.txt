I am student of 3rd year software engineering, and I find myself nowhere in field of programming. I know basics of programming languages like C, C++, Java, Visual Basic, HTML, JAVAScript, CSS and PHP. But every time I sit in front of my computer and start coding in any of the languages, I feel frustrated and distracted and I just shut it down. I have lost interest in everything and I am worried about my future. I am worst at creating logics. So can anyone help me or guide me to make me create my interest in programming?
