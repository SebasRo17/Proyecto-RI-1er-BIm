I'm not a morning person. I got into the habit of working from 10 to 7/8, sometimes 9. Nevertheless, many of the places I've worked for have asked for something more like 8 to 6 or 9 to 6. Honestly, I have a real tough time getting my brain going in the morning and getting into the code. Once I do, I can concentrate for a long time and be quite productive. It's getting into the code and starting to get going with it that I have trouble with. Sometimes I will waste time in the morning just because I can't focus on the problem (yes, I am writing this in the morning). I've put all my busy work in the morning, but as a developer, I don't have a lot of busy work. It kind of becomes a self reinforcing thing; because you don't get things done in the morning, you have to stay later. Because you have to stay later, then its harder to get started the next morning, etc. Do other people have trouble with this? If so, any techniques you've learned? Thanks!
