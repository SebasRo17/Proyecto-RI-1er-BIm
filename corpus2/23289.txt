I am trying to produce publishing quality graphs. I would like to export graphs from a Notebook to Ai (Adobe Illustrator). How do I do this? Just started using Mathematica, very new! Thanks, Anousheh PS This is NOT a duplicate question!!! It has nothing to do with the FONTS!!! A simple question of how to export graphs into Ai. Can we attache files (Notebooks) for easiness? Thank you, Anousheh
