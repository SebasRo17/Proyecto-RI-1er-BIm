I'm a newbie to Mathematica and I'm reading through "The Student's Introduction to Mathematica, Second Edition" and am on the "Using Mathematicaâ€™s Plot Options" section of chapter 3. The examples for using the Exclusions option for plotting asymptotes uses both specific x-values:               h[x_] := ((x - 3) (x - 4))/((x - 2) (x - 5));     Plot[h[x], {x, 0, 7}, Exclusions -> {x == 2, x == 5}, ExclusionsStyle -> Dashed]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/EBClV.png) as well as using a function to automatically determine the vertical asymptotes:               Plot[Tan[x], {x, 0, 4 \[Pi]}, Exclusions -> {Cos[x] == 0},       ExclusionsStyle -> Directive[Gray, Dashed],       Ticks -> {Range[0, 4 \[Pi], \[Pi]/2], Automatic}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Mmgib.png) Using an Exclusions function for the first equation instead of the specific x-values works as expected:               Plot[h[x], {x, 0, 7}, Exclusions -> {h[x] == 0}, ExclusionsStyle -> Dashed]      I attempted to use a function from earlier in the book in the same way and it did not give me the asymptote as expected:               f[x_] := (x^5 - 4 x^2 + 1)/(x - 1/2);     Plot[f[x], {x, -1, 2}, Exclusions -> {f[x] == 0}, ExclusionsStyle -> Dashed]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1AhPB.png) even though specifying the x-value did work:               Plot[f[x], {x, -1, 2}, Exclusions -> {x == 1/2}, ExclusionsStyle -> Dashed]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GQ9FK.png) My attempts to test for something other than 0 (i.e. Undetermined, Infinity, ComplexInfinity etc.) didn't work either. What am I missing here? Also, I haven't seen anything yet regarding plotting horizontal or oblique asymptotes and I don't know if they're covered in this book so any references/tips etc. on those topics would help immensely. Any help is greatly appreciated. Gary
