We develop an application involving a lot of ajax. Such as showing users notifications, updating what they see via ajax while they are on the web page. This update is due to the actions of other users in the application.   1. In the code base we are generating a query inside setTimeout function of javascript. This makes an ajax call.    2. Every call is a separate query to the database.   3. There are many calls on the same page. So we run queries against the database after 15 seconds, no matter if something changes or not. Will this approach work if we are expecting high traffic?
