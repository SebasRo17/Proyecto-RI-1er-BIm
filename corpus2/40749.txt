![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5ZtSi.png) The function is well defined in the whole region. But it just skips plotting the center region. I've tried PlotPoints, Mesh, Contours - it didn't help. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/kTbCN.png) After making more contours. White hole is still there. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8GBrC.png) After zooming in the region suddenly reveals data. How can I make it to plot central part in detail when zoomed out? Thank you in advance. UPD: Yes, thanks, that's PlotRange :)
