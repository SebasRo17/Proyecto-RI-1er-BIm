I've heard the statement that Python would be too slow to be of any use in browsers. I reckon Javascript is only superior in this aspect because of companies like Google who need it fast (and made it fast) because they need it to survive, but I could be wrong. Are there any differences in how Python and Javascript are designed that have an impact on how they (would) perform in browsers? Since as of now there isn't a client side Python implementation, my question comes from the statement someone made, so maybe it has something to do with the languages itself (although I donâ€™t believe that).
