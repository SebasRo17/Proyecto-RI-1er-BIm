I'm a biologist and a newbie in Mathematica. I want to fit three data sets to a model consisting of four differential equations and 10 parameters. I want to find the parameters best fitting to my model. I have searched the forum and found several related examples. However, I could not find anything that matched my question. Here are the details: **I have three time-series datasets: (xdata, ydata, zdata)**               time = Quantity[{0, 3, 7, 11, 18, 25, 38, 59}, "seconds"];     tend = QuantityMagnitude[Last[time]];      **xdata:**               xdata = Quantity[{0, 0.223522, 0.0393934, 0.200991, 0.786874, 1,          0.265464, 0.106174}, "milligram"];     xfitdata = QuantityMagnitude[Transpose[{time, xdata}]];      **ydata:**               ydata = Quantity[{0, 0.143397, 0.615163, 0.628621, 0.53515, 0.519805,          0.757092, 1}, "milligram"];     yfitdata = QuantityMagnitude[Transpose[{time, ydata}]];      **wdata:**               wdata = Quantity[{0.0064948, 0.221541, 1, 0.434413, 0.732392,          0.458638, 0.1484432, 0.0294298}, "milligram"];     wfitdata = QuantityMagnitude[Transpose[{time, wdata}]];      **I used`ParametricNDSolve` to solve the 4-DE model:**               pfun = {x, y, z, w} /.         ParametricNDSolve[{x'[t] ==           k1 - k10 x[t] w[t - 25] - k2 x[t] - k3 w[t] w[t],          y'[t] == -k8 y[t] + k10 x[t] w[t - 25] + k3 w[t] x[t],          z'[t] == k4 y[t] - k5 z[t],          w'[t] == (k6 x[t])/(y[t]^n + 1) - k7 w[t], x[t /; t <= 0] == 0.01,          y[t /; t <= 0] == 0.01, z[t /; t <= 0] == 0.01,          w[t /; t <= 0] == 0.01}, {x, y, z, w}, {t, 0, tend}, {k1, k2, k3,          k4, k5, k6, k7, k8, n, k10}]      Then I used `FindFit`. But I don't know how to specify that `xdata` is supposed to be fitted to `x[t]`, `zdata` to `z[t]` and `wdata` to `w[t]` via least-squares fit. For `y[t]`, there are no time-series data, but the parameter (`k8`) for `y[t]` is supposed to be determined as well. **I have tried the following, which is apparently wrong:**               fit = FindFit[xfitdata,        pfun[{k1, k2, k3, k4, k5, k6, k7, k8, n, k10}][        t], {{k1, 0.0859}, {k2, 0.0125}, {k3, 0.8541}, {k4, 0.0185}, {k5,          0.1004}, {k6, 0.5002}, {k7, 0.0511}, {k8, 0.0334}, {n, 9}, {k10,          0.8017}}, t]      **This is the error message:**               FindFit::nrlnum: The function value {0. +<<1>>[0.],-0.223522+<<1>>,-0.0393934+<<1>>,-0.200991+<<1>>,-0.786874+<<1>>[{0.0859,0.0125,0.8541,0.0185,0.1004,0.5002,0.0511,0.0334,9.,0.8017}][18.],-1.+<<1>>[25.],-0.265464+<<1>>,-0.106174+<<1>>[59.]} is not a list of real numbers with dimensions {8} at {k1,k2,k3,k4,k5,k6,k7,k8,n,k10} = {0.0859,0.0125,0.8541,0.0185,0.1004,0.5002,0.0511,0.0334,9.,0.8017}. >>      I'm lost and I would really appreciate your help!
