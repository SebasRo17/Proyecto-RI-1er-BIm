I have a data file which can be downloaded from here. In order to plot this, I use the following Mathematica code               SetDirectory[" ... "];     data = Import["pss_data.dat", "Table"];     S0 = ListPlot[data, Axes -> False, Frame -> True,      FrameLabel -> {"x", OverDot["x"]}, RotateLabel -> False,      FrameStyle -> Directive[FontSize -> 17, FontFamily -> "Helvetica"],      PlotStyle -> {Black, PointSize[0.001]},      PlotRange -> {{-10.1, 11}, {-45, 45}}, ImageSize -> 550]     Export["pss_plot.eps", S0, "EPS"];      However, the quality of the plot is not satisfactory. Let me be more specific. I realized, that the element which causes the problem is indeed the `PointSize` option. Here is a magnification of the .eps output created using Mathematica ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/os9us.jpg) OK, this is a decent plot, but take a look at this one created using gnuplot ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qjtd5.png) Now, the problem it is far from obvious. The dots which represent the points are way too big in the Mathematica plot. I tried to reduce the `PointSize` of them, but it seems that it cannot be smaller 0.001. You may insert 0.0001 but these is no effect. I even tried to `Rasterize` the plot before export it to .eps but again I could not achieve the desired quality. So, my question: Is it possible to achieve the same plot using Mathematica? Well, it should be. In fact, the question can be rephrased as: How could we shrink more the `PointSize` in `ListPlot`? Many thanks in advance. EDIT: Following Jens's method the output .eps file is the following: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ocR3E.png) Obviously, almost the entire right part of the plot is missing. Only if I set `Magnification -> 1` I can obtain all the plot. But then, zooming in you can see that the dots are still big enough as in my initial output. So, back to square one!
