I'm developing a language which I intend to replace both Javascript and PHP. (I can't see any problem with this. It's not like either of these languages have a large install base.) One of the things I wanted to change was to turn the assignment operator into an assignment command, removing the ability to make use of the returned value.               x=1;          /* Assignment. */     if (x==1) {}  /* Comparison. */     x==1;         /* Error or warning, I've not decided yet. */     if (x=1) {}   /* Error. */      I know that this would mean that those one-line functions that C people love so much would no longer work. I figured (with little evidence beyond my personal experience) that the vast majority of times this happened, it was really intended to be comparison operation. Or is it? Are there any practical uses of the assignment operator's return value that could not be trivially rewritten? (For any language that has such a concept.)
