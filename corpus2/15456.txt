**Update** There is now an official response from Wolfram Support on this issue. Having recently installed _Mathematica_ version 9 64-bit on Windows 7, I keep running into Self-Test Errors evaluating certain expressions. For example, if I evaluate:               Piecewise[{{0, x < 10}, {1, True}}]      then this message pops up: > INTERNAL SELF-TEST ERROR: NoteFont2|c|1982 The output cell did not render properly and, when I hover over the cell, the following additional message pops up: > The stretchable character 0xf361 in the Mathematica5Mono font (size 13) has > a repeating piece (0xb2) that is zero size. The same SELF-TEST error pops up if I type `ESC`pw`ESC` in an input cell. This error occurrs on two different Windows 7 machines, installing the Standard Edition on one and the Home Edition on the other. Both machines also have versions 7 and 8 installed. On the Standard Edition machine, it is very likely that _Mathematica_ had been run many times before installation after the last reboot. But on the Home Edition machine the installation was the first thing done after power-on. Interestingly, my pre-existing installations of version 7 and version 8 both exhibit this behaviour now. They worked prior to installing version 9. How can I fix this? **Update** Some users report getting a Windows "Blue Screen of Death" (BSOD) performing these or similar operations.
