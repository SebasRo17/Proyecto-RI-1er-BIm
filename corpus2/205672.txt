The problem of Electronic Data Interchange over networks is well known and understood. Today, the most common formats for data interchange are things like XML and JSON. There are various pros and cons of using one format over the other, and certain formats lend themselves better to certain data-sets. I've been programming for quite some time now, and I've only just NOW come across the **ASN.1 (Abstact Syntax Notation)** format, which is apparently used in certain Internet protocols such as LDAP, and is actually quite old (in Internet years). I read a bit about the format. Like JSON, it provides primitive data types (boolean, integer, etc.) and also sequence and set types. It's a bit different from JSON or XML in the sense that, while the notation itself is human readable, the encoding is usually not human readable (it is usually encoded in a binary format.) Is there some reason why this format is so rarely used? (Or am I totally wrong, and it is actually used often?) I've only just now heard of it for the first time, and I've never heard it come up in any of the various discussions I've read about the merits of JSON, YAML, XML or whatever interchange format. Is there some major drawback to ASN.1 that prevented it from being more widely used?
