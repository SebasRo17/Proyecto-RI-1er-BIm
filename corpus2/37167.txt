I want to display my data in a logarithmic way in a 3d diagram. I found BarChart3D, which seems to be nearly what i need. I tried:               BarChart3D[data2, ChartLayout -> "Grid"]     BarChart3D[(Log[10, data2] - 2)/5.0568, ChartLayout -> "Grid"]      and got this figures: ![non-logarithmic data](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7sC8B.png) ![logarithmic data \(wrong scale\)](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2j3ir.png) What I need now is a way to fix the horizontal scale. Would be glad to get some hints! THANKS A LOT! Andreas EDIT: Just found the very simple answer               ScalingFunctions -> "Log"      sorry for waste of bits.
