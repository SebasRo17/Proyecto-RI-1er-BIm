Coding bat, project euler, python challenge for example are all amazing brain teasers that usually provide you with some learning material, ways to compact your code, and enhance your problem solving skills.

Are there similar exercises for OOP, MVC, MVVM, MVT, and so on type situations? In class it is usually taught to think of an object as a cat, part of an animal class. and you have mammals and so on.
