This is an ode which is solved with no error in V9, but gives a very strange error in V10. Is this a regression bug? On version 9, the ode is solved with no error                 $Version       (* 9.0 for Microsoft Windows (64-bit) (January 25, 2013) *)       ClearAll[x, y]       ode = ((30 + 4 x)y[x]+5(-6 + x)x y'[x] +x^2(3 + x) y''[x]+ x^3 y'''[x] == 0);       DSolve[ode, y[x], x]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4pj6Z.png) Now on version 10                $Version      (*10.0 for Microsoft Windows (64-bit) (June 29, 2014)*)      ClearAll[x, y];      ode = ((30 + 4 x) y[x] +5(-6 + x) x y'[x] +x^2 (3 + x)y''[x]+x^3 y'''[x] == 0);      DSolve[ode, y[x], x]      I get screen full of errors ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1Q0DU.png) At the bottom I see the same solution as given by Version 9 ! This happens after I restart the kernel, on fresh session. The computation takes few minutes (on my PC it took 5 minutes, old PC). Reproducible. I am on windows 7, 64 bit. Can other reproduce this? Any idea what might be causing it?
