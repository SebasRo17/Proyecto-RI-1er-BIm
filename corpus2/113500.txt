However, in order to do so, you must first have registered the copyright with the U.S. Copyright Office." Is it true that the only way to take legal action against software copyright infringers in the U.S. is to first register with the U.S. Copyright Office? And is it true that that's the only way to recover statutory damages? Are there other benefits of registering software with the U.S. Copyright Office? What are the costs, besides the fee and the hassle of re-registering new versions of the software?
