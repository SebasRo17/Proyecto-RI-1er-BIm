I know very well that java is a portable language..and it is the byte-code that makes it portable.. However I've studied also that C is a portable language. **"The programs written in C are portable i.e. programs written for one type of computer or operating system can be run on another type of computer or operating system."** Then what is the difference between C portability and Java's portability? can we say that C is also a portable language like java? I know that java portability may be in terms of different application such as mac, PC, mobile phone..and C can't be used in such cases..But my question is still as how portability is different in both language? Please clear my confusion. Thanks in advance..
