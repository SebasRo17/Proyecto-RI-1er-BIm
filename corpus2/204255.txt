I have made a program in Javascript and HTML5 canvas and I am wondering what happens when you draw a shape on a certain location of canvas then draw another shape on top of that same object. Does it consume more memory because I am drawing new object on top of each others? (Currently, rendering process of my program is not that fast, I am assuming it is due to I am drawing new object on top of old object, is that right?). Also, I want to know what kind of performance monitoring tools available out there for Javascript programs. I want to figure out which fragment of my program consumes the most memory so I can optimise that particular process to be faster. Thank you.
