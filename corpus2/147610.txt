Are there any eye tracking case studies, or similar research done to verify what code format is easiest to read, maintain and work with. I always format my code this way.               function thing()     {         if(something)         {           // do something         }         else         {           // do something else         }     }      But, I never see this followed elsewhere. In most APIs or open source projects it's done like this.               function thing() {         if(something) {           // do something         } else {           // do something else         }     }      Can you provide an answer that is not based upon your personal preference, but is supported by research or some kind of fact? **Has there been any visual eye scanning studies done to confirm which format is best?**
