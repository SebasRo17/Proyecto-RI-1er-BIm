In Maple I often simplify expressions for functions of same argument using the collect command:               > collect(a*f(x)+f(y)+x*f(x), f, factor)     (a+x)*f(x)+f(y)      where the extra option factor will factor the coefficients. In contrast Mathematica:               > Collect[a*f[x] + f[y] + x*f[x], f]     a f[x] + x f[x] + f[y]      Is there some command in Mathematica which achieves the same?
