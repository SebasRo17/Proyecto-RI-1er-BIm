I have a matrix say               matinitial =       {{41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 410},        {11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 10},        {21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 210},        {31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 310}};      I want to form matrices `matfinal[i],` where i runs from 1 to 6 in this example.My `matfinal[i]` should be equal to matinitial after sorting rows based on sum of columns from `i` to `i + 4`. I tried the following codes :               Do[matfinal[i] = SortBy[matinitial,Total[matinitial[[All, i ;; i + 4]], {2}]], {i, 1, 6}];      But I do not get the results I desire. For example, my matfinal[1] should be equal to matinitial sorted based on Total of first four columns:               {41 + 42 + 43 + 44, 11 + 12 + 13 + 14, 21 + 22 + 23 + 24, 31 + 32 + 33 + 34} = {170, 50, 90, 130}.      Therefore,               matfinal[1]={{11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 10},                 {21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 210},                 {31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 310},                 {41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 410}};      Please note, in my real world problem my matinitial matrix is 100 by 20000 in size.Any help is greatly appreciated.And also, thank you for your help in advance!! :))
