Assume there are three groups of 2-dimensional coordinates               data = RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[#, .25], {15, 2}] & /@ Range[3];      Is there a way to `ListPlot` these data points just like               ListPlot[data, PlotStyle -> {Red, Blue, Green}]      ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CV9BD.png) but instead of the dots with the result of an integer-valued function, e.g. `Round[Norm[#]]&`, shown in the according colour? I already had a look at this and that question, but wasn't able to modify the answers to obtain the desired result.
