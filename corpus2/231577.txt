Procedural programming means coding the application is a series of tasks. Do A, then do B, then Do C. And often wrap these tasks in procedures or functions that can be easily called and run several times in the code. Object Oriented Programming is also often done by doing A, then doing B, then doing C. But objects are used (and correct me if I'm wrong because I'm not sure) as sophisticated ways to store, manipulate and hide data. This affects significantly the design of the program. But the overall flow of the application is still do A, then do B, then do C. Do you agree? If so, would you say that OOP is essentially a type of Procedural Programming?
