We have modularized our API into some independent components. Independent meaning these can be built via Maven and used as dependencies for other projects such as webapps. Now, to use this API, there needs to be an _intermediate processing class_ which does a _translation of the client data model into the callee (component) data model_. The question is does this handler/processor class belong and need to be packaged along with the client application JAR/WAR or is it part of the component JAR. What is the convention?
