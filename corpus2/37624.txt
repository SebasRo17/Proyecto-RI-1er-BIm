I'm a java web developer for nearly 3 years. Always trying to learn more and be better but still I feel that the amount of knowledge is not that good as I want. The knowledge in some places still seems to be non-systematic and don't provide a very strong base to solve the problems as good as I want to do it. The example I have is my senior developer, whose solutions are always more efficient and beautiful. So, the question is rather simple and hard the same time. What is the right way to get my knowlege be more systematic and therefore improve it's quality. I understand that there is no practically good answer for the all java programming, so let's focus on the modern java web or nearly web technologies:   1. JSF 2.0   2. JPA2 and Hibernate as persistence provider   3. Web services   4. and Java SE as a core. What methodologies or books or learning technics lead to the strong knowledge base within the given knowledge area?
