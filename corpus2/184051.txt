I'm 16-years old, and due to being placed in accelerated programs during my whole academic career, I just finished high school over the holiday season. For the past year or so I've been teaching myself web development (front-end, more specifically), and want to go into a career in the field. I have a front- end internship all lined up for the summer (some places don't offer them year- round, I guess), but I want to continue learning between these two periods. More specifically, I want to learn some server-side development so I can understand the interconnection between the front-end and back-end better. My question is, would taking on a programming certification program at my local community college teach me anything, or is the information too outdated to be relevant whatsoever? PHP is the server-side language covered in the certificate (it also covers JS and CSS). I feel like in self-teaching myself I may have skipped over some fundamentals of JavaScript, and I'd really like to have a solid understanding of the language from both a syntax and philosophical perspective (i.e. understanding advantages, distadvantages, etc). Edit: I've been building a portfolio, and am considering skipping going for a degree altogether. I just want to do this for self-improvement.
