Hi I am trying to use curve fit some data using the `BSplinefunction`. I havent been using _Mathematica_ long, so my questions might be quite basic.               pts = {{0, 645.01`}, {5, 645.445`}, {10, 645.622`}, {15,      646.048`}, {20, 646.475`}, {25, 646.934`}, {30, 647.496`}, {35,      648.296`}, {40, 649.095`}, {45, 651.485`}, {50, 652.017`}, {55,      652.611`}, {60, 653.268`}, {65, 653.924`}, {70, 654.231`}, {75,      654.473`}, {80, 654.8`}, {85, 655.136`}, {90, 655.146`}, {95,      655.126`}, {100, 656.136`}, {105, 655.116`}, {110, 655.126`}, {115,     655.106`}, {120, 655.116`}, {125, 655.096`}}      using;               SP = BSplineFunction[pts]      I am trying to find out if there is a way to expand this function and look at its individual parts over a specified range within my dataset. I am also trying to look at the derivative of the function at a specific points by using.               SP'[pts1 = Table[{i, SP'[i]}, {i, 0, 1, .1}];      Is this the right method to get the derivative? If it isnt, I would appreciate it if someone could point in the right direction. Any help is much appreciated.
