I have a roughly 100,000 Ã— 3,000 matrix (as a `SparseArray`) that I'd like to find the kernel (null space) of. It has about 500,000 nonzero entries, all -1 or 1. When I tried with `NullSpace`, it ate up 8 GB of RAM, complained about insufficient memory and shut down:               No more memory available.     Mathematica kernel has shut down.     Try quitting other applications and then retry.      Is there a better way to do this? Something a bit more efficient with memory (either a different Mathematica technique or a different language altogether)? I don't think there's any structure in the matrix to exploit, beyond what I've mentioned.
