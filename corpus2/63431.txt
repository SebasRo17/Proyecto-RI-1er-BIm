My 2 friends and I are preparing our senior project idea for next year. I need some of different ideas while deciding the base environment of the project, especially from software developers/engineers who worked in huge software product developments.   * We have limited human resources ( _just us, 3 students_ ), limited time and very limited fund.   * The project aims to office environments like Outlook, Thunderbird.   * It will run on the desktop, not web   * GUI will be really rich with customized widgets/dialogs like Outlook   * We want to start selling it and opening maybe a small company. So it is not just a senior project for us and we take it serious.   * Even if we can't open a company, we want this project to be a good reference at our CV, especially for when searching jobs in USA.   * Speed of the software is of course important, but realiability _(crashes in a commercial software product is not acceptable for customers right?)_ and bringing the project to a usable state as fast as posible are more important.   * It will be like MS Outlook, with many features in the single client. _(More than Outlook actually if we count.)_   * Also we want this project to carry our practical skills to a better place   * We use C++ and Java really good, but we never worked within a large project like this so we can't see how the environment effects our needs in the long term We have two environments to choose from (Java Swing and C++ Qt) and we are proficient in those, but because of the factors I described above, we should decide which one is better. **What would be your advise for a project with those criterias?** * * * **Our fears for Java:**   * Slowing the software because it is really a big project.   * Especially we are afraid of the GUI's speed. **Our fears for C++:**   * Developing time consuming   * Definitely more bugs will occur   * More time or money to develop and maintain _(harder to find good C++ developers than Java developers right?)_   * Making that much customized GUI with Qt might be really hard   * Libraries won't be reusable for a mobile web interface _(at least easily)_ _PS: It is not an email client. It will be used in office environments like Outlook, but not as an email client. Outlook is a good picture to represent it._
