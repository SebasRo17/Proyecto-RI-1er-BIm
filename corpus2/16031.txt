I use `NDSolve` to solve a large set (~400) of coupled ODEs. Sometimes, the memory (~4GB) gets filled up, and my computer becomes impossible to work with, because it spends too much time writing to swap and the process can only be killed violently by the OS. I circumvent this by using `MemoryConstrained`, but when the solver reaches the memory limit it is simply aborted and does not return the solution it obtained so far. Is there a way to obtain this solution (much like what happens when the solver encounters a singularity or reaches `MaxSteps`)? Note: using a hack of the form                StepMonitor :> If[MemoryInUse[]>...,...]      results in serious computational overhead.
