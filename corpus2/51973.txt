I have a problem with Mathlink (Mathematica 9.0), form which I call a Fortran subroutine which should return a list of 13 numbers. I have written a C-wrapper to call the Fortran subroutine (called "hubclus") from C. The main part of this wrapper looks as follows:               void hubclusML P((int, int, int, double, double, double, int));          :Begin:     :Function:       hubclusML     :Pattern:        HubClus[ Nx_Integer, Ny_Integer, Ne_Integer, U_Real, t_Real, Temp_Real, fulldiag_Integer  ]     :Arguments:      { Nx, Ny, Ne , U, t, Temp, fulldiag }     :ArgumentTypes:  { Integer, Integer, Integer, Real, Real, Real, Integer }     :ReturnType:     Manual     :End:          #include "mathlink.h"     extern void hubclusML( int Nx, int Ny, int Ne, double U, double t, double Temp, int fulldiag );               void hubclusML( int Nx, int Ny, int Ne, double U, double t, double Temp, int fulldiag )     {            double results[12];            /* Call hubclus */       hubclus_(&Nx, &Ny, &Ne, &U, &t, &Temp, &fulldiag, &results);            /* Send the Results to Mathematica via MathLink */       MLPutReal64List(stdlink, results, 13);            return;     }      This wrapper calls the Fortran subroutine "hubclus" which in turn calculates a list with 13 elements as result and should pass it via Mathlink back to Mathematica. **Now here is the problem:** It always worked well as long as the list "results" contains not more than 10 elements. But if the list "results" contains more than 10 elements the Link to this function dies after the execution in Mathematica without giving any error message except "$Failed". I would be thankful for any help.
