I am exporting some data into the txt file but since the values exported to this txt file expresses 10^6 to be *^6, I cannot use these numbers in calculations in other programs.. For instance, when I do,                AA= {-292., -5., -9036., -1.162*10^6, -1.555*10^6, \          -1.85*10^6, -2.146*10^6, -2.401*10^6, -2.736*10^6, \          -2.91*10^6}      Export["C:/data output1.txt", AA]      May I ask how I can deal with this problem..? Thank you.
