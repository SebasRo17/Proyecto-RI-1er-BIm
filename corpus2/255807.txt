I am converting HTML5 file to .exe using HTML EXECUTABLES converter. After converting to exe, the total size comes around 70 to 80MB. So the problem is when i update a single CSS file I have to convert the whole project again to a exe and give it to my Client and every time i have to upload 80MB file for very small changes. Is there any other alternate option to update a certain file instead of converting again to exe.
