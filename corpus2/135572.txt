I'm basically looking for arguments to persuade the internal "consultants" at work as the following are not working:   * What happens if you do a Cartesian join and crash the server?   * You don't need to do selects from that server. You have other servers for that.   * It's not for you it's for the clients. We're going to be implementing DB wide triggers to stop casual logging on during work hours but with a fail safe so that devs / DBAs can fix issues if they come up but need some more arguments to forstall the screaming that's probably going to happen. **EDIT** To clarify; there are no actual problems. The database will be locked down better no matter what. I'm not looking for technical reasons to do things or advice on how to manage a DB. I'm hoping that some other technical people on here have some advice on how to explain to non-technical people the, possibly only perceived, importance of this particular issue.
