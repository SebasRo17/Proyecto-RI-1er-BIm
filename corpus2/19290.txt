MouseAppearance[Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 5}], "LinkHand"]      ![hand](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XjHbo.png) Unfortunately I cannot get a screen grab to show the link hand but it is a cartoon hand with a finger pointing. In most/many graphics packages there is also an open hand (open carton hand) and a closed hand (closed cartoon hand) used for sliding a graphics within a region. _I realize that if I can find some open source clip art_ then I can use this as a mouse appearance:               MouseAppearance[Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 5}], clip art]      But was wondering if undocumented open hand and grab hand exists within Mathematica? Intended usage: I have an application for sliding a graphic. I wanted to use an open hand over the graphic and grab hand/closed hand for sliding the graphic. My reason for seeking something built in is solely aesthetic so that it matches the "LinkHand" appearance. If I cannot have a built in solution I'll look for clip art for the full set of icons -- including the link hand.
