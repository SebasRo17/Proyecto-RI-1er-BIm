We are moving away from IBM Rational products due to really high costs. I am trying to find alternative solutions that will roughly cover all the functionalities from IBM Rational product line. I included a listing of all products currently in use:   1. IBM Rational ClearCase MultiSite   2. IBM Rational ClearQuest   3. IBM Rational Performance Tester   4. IBM Rational Requistite Pro   5. IBM Rational SoDA   6. IBM Rational Purify for Linux and UNIX So far, I was told SVN / Team Foundation Server / Serena PVCS are decent alternatives but I suspect I may need more tools to cover almost everything provided by IBM. Any recommendations / feedback would be greatly appreciated.
