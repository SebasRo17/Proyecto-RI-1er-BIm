I'm working on a lawsuit and I need a definition of a 'class library' that I can reference. Every book and all the documentation I can find seems to assume the reader already knows what a library is. Even the wikipedia entry on 'Library (computing)' is low on references. And the references it does have are from the 80s or earlier. So, in the context of C#, what is a class library? (with references) I have been getting a decent number of definitions from 'Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software' but it also assumes the reader knows what a library is.
