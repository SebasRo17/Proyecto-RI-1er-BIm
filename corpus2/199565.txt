I want to learn C but I tend to learn best when I have a project to work on. I've never done iPhone development, so I'm hoping to kill two birds with one stone. Will learning objective c also teach me to program c reasonably well, or are they too dissimilar? EDIT: I'm mostly wondering if objective-c/iphone-development would teach me all the little gotcha's that are inherent to c. I come from a .Net background so I haven't done much in terms of memory management or working with pointers.
