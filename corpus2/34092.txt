I have a function, which gives an implicit solution of a variable $y$ as a function of $x$. Moreover, I have a function $f$ which depends on $y$. How to plot a ratio of $f/y$, given that $y$ is only given in an implicit form? **Edit** Let me be more specific. First, I have a polynomial $G(y,x)=0$, which defines implicitly $y$ as function of $x$, let's call it $y=g(x)$. Second, I have a function $f(y)$. I want to plot a ratio $f(y)/y$ as a function of $x$ or, using $y=(g(x))$, $f(g(x))/g(x)$. How to plot it given that $y=g(x)$ is given implicitly by a polynomial?
