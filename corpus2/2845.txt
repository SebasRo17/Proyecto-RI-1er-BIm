I am trying to download some data from a website that uses "java enabling" to tell me that I cannot download the data. Using               Import[ "website...", "Data"]       I get               {....."You need Javascript enabled to view live scores. Loading... Loading... ..}      Do I have to use something like squid to change requester_id so it shows up as a web-browser rather than Mathematica ? I have now fixed this problem. The second problem is that Mathematica does not support iframe. Does it ? Is there a way around this issue ?
