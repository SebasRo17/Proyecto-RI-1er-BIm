I am not totally a Web UI developer, indeed I am doing some work about deployment. But I have interests in the fantastic effects of some great website. I know a little about javascript, jquery, extJS, Ajax or Flex are doing this kind of fantastic work. What bothers me:   1. Is there other techniques doing this kind of work?    2. Which should I dig deep in?    3. How can I effectively improve the techniques in that?
