I want to add a project which in this case is created in Netbeans but this question is general for most IDE's. It's simply, what should I include in my repository. For example Netbeans creates a nbproject folder, eclipse creates a .settings folder etc. should I include these in my repository, what are the advantages/disadvantages of including or not including project specific settings. In this case it's a personal project so I don't imagine that other people will start working on it, but it would be nice to add the bare minimum of project settings so the project itself will be easy to start work on different machines.
