I am attempting to understand what a Package Management System. I grasp the main concept of it but I have some queries.   * Does a package management system install features(compilers, libraries, virtual machines) necessary to run an application AND install an application or does it just install features necessary to run an application?    * Are package management systems external applications that you run with command line arguments or are they API libraries that you integrate into your installer code? To use an example; if my application uses python 2.7 and wxPython would a Package Management System ensure that python 2.7 is installed and wxPython is installed then finally install my application(python script files)?
