I was told that I will be asked coding questions in my interview and that the context will be related to Distributed Systems (I took ONE Distributed Systems course and I don't even remember much from it!). I've seen a lot of data structure/algorithms coding questions but for Distributed Systems, all I can think of is questions about different concepts. What could they possibly ask me to code for them? I've tried looking up examples to practise or at least get an idea what kinds of things to expect but I haven't found any because they all just seem to focus on concepts, not design. Any ideas?
