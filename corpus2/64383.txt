Inspired after reading an article from Lifehacker, I would like to explain, what I went through few weeks back. I am currently working for an MNC in India for the last 4.5 years and on the 14th of last month I decided to resign from here due to various options given below:   1. Multiple responsibilities on my head and along with that normal programming with less pay.   2. No Opportunities in going to onsite working with the onsite project team.   3. Worked almost 3 out of 4 weekends in a months and too much of work related pressure due to adhoc changes in the requirements.   4. Almost burned out and no work life balance.   5. No Vacations. Month end Pay was my major concern for my decision to quit because I believe that for the amount of work I do and the kind of responsibilities I take, I should be paid given a market competent pay. But a huge MNC like my company, the appraisal and hikes happen only once in an year. With all these above reason, I quit 2 weeks back. But, since I was critical to the project, the management tried to retain me back by agreeing to processing my H1B visa, which I agreed with no double thought because my major concern (Money) is been taken care. But rest all my concerns still persist and the management is putting everyone under deliverable pressure by giving tough timelines and adhoc requirement changes. Now I feel like quitting again... I am confused. Any advice here please...
