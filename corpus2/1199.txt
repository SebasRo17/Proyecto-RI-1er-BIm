I have a function that operates on a **list of parameters of variable-length** $n$. I would like to create a `Manipulate[]` that has $n$ sliders, one for each list element, each considered a separate parameter. The syntax `Manipulate[expr,{u,...},{v,...},...]]` does not lend itself to this, as it is geared toward a **fixed number of parameters** known in advance, and referenced by separate variable names. I have started exploring preparing a list of arguments to `Manipulate[]` and then using `Apply[]`, but this seems tricky and complicated. _Anyone come upon this conundrum before?_
