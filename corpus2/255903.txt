I am developing an web application in **MVC4**. I my application all the function is did by the **ajax post call**. I do not even **post single form(Even not have the form tag also)** all the things are did by the ajax call. but I am scared for the miss use of the my java script. Any one who got this code he can post the **dummy data** to my application. So I need to **validate** the weather the post request is coming form my website or not. I thought that the ajax call is good instead of posting all the form to server. Also I have did the validation at client side only. Is that also the threat for me?
