I know this sounds like a weird question, but do you think it's possible to go from a Programmer Job to a System Admin job? I mean the pros:   * You're a programmer, so you know scripting pretty well (for Cron Jobs/Bash Scripts)   * You usually know your way around a Unix System   * You could prolly debug stuff that isn't working.   * Most programmers are familiar with Computer Hardware   * You have a Degree which you worked hard for, and your familiar with setting up different software systems So do you think it's possible to go from a Programmer Job to a System Admin job? or probably not.
