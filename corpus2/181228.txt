I need something that represents a queue in F#. The queue will be filled with items once, and (as the application progresses) items will be taken from this queue and moved to other lists. Should I use the Queue class in .NET, or should I avoid it, and use the native lists in F# instead? Is there a better solution? Why should I use one, or the other, in a functional language such as F#?
