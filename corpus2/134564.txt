I'm creating a powershell / C# host and want to add the following comment               // This method cannot be called multiple times on a given pipeline. The state of the      // pipeline must be NotStarted when Invoke is called. When this method is called, it     // changes the state of the pipeline to Running.      // see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms569128(v=vs.85).aspx     if (pipeline.PipelineStateInfo.State == PipelineState.NotStarted)     {         Collection<PSObject> results = pipeline.Invoke();     }      Is this an appropriate comment? What would you improve about it?
