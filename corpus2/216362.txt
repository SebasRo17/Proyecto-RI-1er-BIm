I'm currently working as an IT administrator, but I'm thinking of making a slight career change into programming. I want to focus my time and effort into learning some web-based languages, but does it feel achievable when working full time to expect to make much progress after a long day's work? I love to read, but this is sometimes a hindrance. I have read on some resources that you will never make much progress unless you quit your 9-5 job and dedicate six months to getting a fundamental understanding.
