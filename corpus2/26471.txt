I am trying to plot some data using the `LevelScheme` package, but changing the logarithmic scale to display values in `NumberForm` instead of `ScientificForm`. I.e. I want to see the axes displaying values as `1`, `10`, `100` and `1000` instead of `10^0`, `10^1` etc. Do you have any tips on how I can achieve this? I was trying to play with `TickLabelFunction` but I guess this is not meant to be used as I want. Here's a minimal working example:               randomdata = Sort@Transpose@{        Log[10, RandomReal[{1*^-7, 1*^-5}, 1000]],        Log[10, RandomReal[{0.1, 1000}, 1000]]     };          ListPlot[randomdata, PlotRange -> {{-7, -5}, {-1, 3}}, Joined -> False,      Axes -> False, Frame -> {{True, False}, {True, False}},       FrameStyle -> {{Automatic, None}, {Automatic, None}},      FrameTicks -> {{LogTicks[10, -1, 3,TickLabelFunction -> (ScientificForm[#] &)],None},                      {LogTicks[10, -7, -5], None}}     ];      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zxaP7.jpg) (Interestingly, this pseudo-data is not so randomly distributed at all ;) **edit:** nevermind, I didn't remember the data was in logspace)
