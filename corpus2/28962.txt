I am attempting to do a seemingly-simple task: label ordered pairs in a `Plot` that display with parentheses that grow to match the expression within. I've trawled the documentation and searched the posted questions here to no luck. The problem is that parentheses are internally special, so they are very difficult to force into a displayed expression. I can use something similar to `Graphics[Text[f[0,1/2]]]` and the resulting output form has correctly-sized parenthesis, albeit with the pesky `f`. I can use any bracketing operator to achieve the same result, e.g. `Graphics[Text[\[LeftAngleBracket]0,1/2\[RightAngleBracket]]]`, but no luck with parentheses. Am I missing something incredibly simple?
