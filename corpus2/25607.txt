I'm trying to plot a histogram of a few data points and overlay a plot on it (it's a fit of a geometric distribution to my data). The weird thing is that a vertical line appears always next to the smallest datapoint of the histogram. As the distribution is continuous, I always get this vertical line in the middle of the plot, and I'd like to get rid of it.               p[s_] := 1/(1 + s); q[s_] := s/(1 + s);     Geom[s_, x_] := p[s] (q[s]^x);     SigmaC = 9114.738337867104`;     data = {4.566649578817866`, 4.1087341086023645`, 3.5448119117577757`, 4.191562787591725`, 3.7948364578145606`, 4.157517208532611`,    4.539966367996713`, 3.8003045775561977`, 2.60422605308447`,   4.220081924933814`, 4.166548514738755`, 3.879841055986562`,    3.673481697073347`, 3.310480891462675`, 4.680335513414563`};     Hist = Histogram[data, 10, "PDF"];     Pl = Plot[Log[10] 10^s Geom[SigmaC, 10^s], {s, 0, 5}, PlotRange -> {0, 1}, PlotStyle -> {Red, Thick}];         Show[Hist, Epilog -> First@Pl, PlotRange -> {{0, 5}, {0, 1.5}},  Frame -> True]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/sJdIc.png) When I set               Frame -> False      then the vertical line changes into y-axis. I'd like to have y-axis in the far-left side of the plot. Does anyone have an idea how to resolve this? This is probably really simple but I'd appreciate any insight! Thanks a lot!
