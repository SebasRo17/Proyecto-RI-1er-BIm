Are there any software licenses that automate the reassignment of ownership? For instance, in a usual circumstance, you have a license, and then you make all contributors sign off that by contributing they reassign ownership to the project owner. In the sort of license I'm looking for, by just _editing **and** redistributing_ the result (whether in source or binary form), the person who had made changes would not only have to redistribute the code but would also have automatically reassigned their ownership to me. Alternatively, if that's not possible, can I add a binding clause to an existing license that makes it so?
