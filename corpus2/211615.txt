I need to make a "SELECT * FROM" Sql from PHP, that now returns about 10.000 records, that I insert in an Array and re-utilize in a page to show results in a table. I need to have all that elements also in a hidden input fields, to connect via API to a SMS service to send SMS               <input type="hidden" id="destinatariSMS" name="destinatariSMS" value="<?php echo htmlentities(serialize($destinatariSMS)); ?>" />      Obviously, with 10k elements loading of page is about 10-15 seconds (in a VPS with 2GB ram). I'm worrying because in about two months element will be 12-13k, about 1k elements at the month. I cannot paginate elements because I need all together in that input... In your opinion, what's best practice to no "destroy" VPS or browser? Thank you very much
