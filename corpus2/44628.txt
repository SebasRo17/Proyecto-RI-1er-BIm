I tried importing a webpage using `Import`: `Import["http://ultrasignup.com/m_results_participant.aspx?fname=Troy&lname=Siemers"];` which should give some info about a runner friend of mine (he gave permission to have his name shown here). Using `Import` as shown above gives generic HTML information but the table containing the data I want. Using the options `"Data"` and `"FullData"` do not give anything useful, either. However, in my web browser I can see the HTML code for the table when I "View Source." Is there an option for importing a web page in _Mathematica_ that I am overlooking? How do I import the data from the page?
