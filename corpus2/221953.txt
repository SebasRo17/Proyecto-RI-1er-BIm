This may or may not be a silly question, but I really would like to know the answer to something which has been bothering me for a while. I quite often see programming examples/conventions where the programmer has created a directory called `acme` to put stuff in. What does `Acme` mean? Why Acme and not Emca or other? Is Acme like a generic folder name to group miscellaneous OOP classes? Where did the term come from in terms of the programming convention. As far as I can see, it has nothing to do with a programmer UI http://plan9.bell- labs.com/sys/doc/acme.html
