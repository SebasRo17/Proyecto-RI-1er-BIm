While bouncing around StackOverflow, I've noticed a number of people attaching events (notably `click` events) to the `document` as opposed to the `elements` themselves. **Example:** Given this:               <button id="myButton">CLICK ME</button>      Instead of writing this (using jQuery just for brevity):               $('#myButton').on('click', function() { ... });      They do this:               $(document).on('click', function() { ... });      And then presumably use `event.target` to drill down to the element that was actually clicked. Are there any gains/advantages in capturing events at the `document` level instead of at the `element` level?
