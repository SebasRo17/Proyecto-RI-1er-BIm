I'm trying to import an image in Mathematica on my Raspberry Pi. The code is simple but I get an error when importing:               $ wolfram     Wolfram Language (Raspberry Pi Pilot Release)     Copyright 1988-2014 Wolfram Research     Information & help: wolfram.com/raspi          In[1]:= SetDirectory["~/"];          In[2]:= i=Import["small.jpg"];      > >     InstallJava::fail: A link to the Java runtime could not be established. >   This is the image I'm trying to import: http://i.stack.imgur.com/zzSLr.jpg It's 1.5 MB large so the Pi should have no problem importing it. Why do I get this error and how can I prevent it? * * * UPDATE: I believe this is caused when the computer is running out of memory. I don't know a sure way to reproduce it but it keeps happening if I do other memory-intensive tasks on my Raspberry Pi. I'd like to know if there's a way to prefevnt this. and I got this error: > /opt/Wolfram/WolframEngine/10.0/SystemFiles/Kernel/Binaries/Linux- > ARM/WolframKernel: error while loading shared libraries: > /opt/Wolfram/WolframEngine/10.0/SystemFiles/Libraries/Linux- > ARM/libWolframEngine.so: cannot make segment writable for relocation: Cannot > allocate memory
