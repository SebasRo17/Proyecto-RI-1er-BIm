I have the following function:               F[t_] := V1 (Cos[w1 t - ph1] Exp[-alpha1 t] -           Cos[ph1] Exp[-beta t]) +        V2 (Sin[w2 t + ph2] Exp[-alpha2 t] - Sin[ph2] Exp[-beta t])      where all the variables are constants. I want to express it in terms of Spherical Bessel Functions of any type or any linear superposition of them. My first idea was to extract the data from the function making a list and then use               FindFit[data, p SphericalBesselJ[q, t], {p, q} t];      But I am struggling to export the data so that it matches the form of a function. I tried:               data = Table[F[t], {t, 0, 0.1, 0.0001}]      But the label of the x axis is 1,2,3.... where I need 0.0001, 0.0002 and so on. Any ideas of how to get around it or maybe another way of finding the correct expression of `F[t]` in terms of Bessel Functions?
