As explained in this solution,               ListAnimate[Table[Plot[Sin[n x], {x, 0, 2}], {n, 3}]]//InputForm      will allow me to view the types of appearance element for the `ListAnimate` controller. But the same method does not work for simple controls or compound `Manipulate`-s, e.g.               Control[{{u, 3, "hello"}, 1, 5, 0.1}] // InputForm     Manipulate[u, {{u, 3, "hello"}, 1, 5, 0.1}] // InputForm      as both are already in `InputForm`. Is there a complete list of `AppearanceElement` types in the documentation (I doubt that) or elsewhere, or a trustworthy way of extracting this information? Added in response to Nasser's solution: it would also be good to allocate exactly which appearance elements are appropriate to each control; looking at `Animator` I've found a couple more which are in the relevant documentation, see below.               appearanceList =        Sort@{"AutorunPlayButton", "BookmarksButton",              "BookmarksPlayButton","ContentResizeArea", "DirectionButton",              "FasterSlowerButtons", "HideControlsButton",              "InteractiveTradingChartMenu",              "InteractiveTradingChartSnapshotButton",              "InteractiveTradingChartResetButton", "InputField",              "InlineInputField", "ManipulatePlayButton", "ManipulateMenu",              "PlayPauseButton", "PlayButton", "PauseButton", "ResetPlayButton",              "ProgressSlider", "ResetButton", "SnapshotButton",              "StepLeftButton", "StepRightButton", "UpdateButton"};     Length@appearanceList     DynamicModule[{sal, dx = 0.5, dy = 0.5, anim1, anim2, loc, swatch},       Column@{         Control[{sal, 1, 10, AppearanceElements -> appearanceList, Appearance -> "Open"}],          Control[{sal, 1, 10, AppearanceElements -> All, Appearance -> "Open"}],         Slider2D[Dynamic@{dx, dy}],(* no appearance elements *)         Animator[Dynamic[anim1], {0, 1, 0.1}, AppearanceElements -> appearanceList,           AnimationRunning -> False],         Animator[Dynamic[anim2], {0, 1, 0.1}, AppearanceElements -> All,            AnimationRunning -> False]        }]      ![image of output of above](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GKDca.jpg) This brings the total to 26, including `All` and `None`. By the way, it is odd that the `ResetPlayButton` looks exactly like the `PlayButton`, as far as I can see.
