I've been wondering about this for a while - but never got around to asking - until I saw faleichik's incredible answer to _Mathematica_ Minecraft. I did some work at a not-for-profit a little while ago, which participated in a program called Meals On Wheels - wherein I helped to deliver food to those who are homebound. Myself and a partner would deliver meals to a daily list of addresses, sorted by name; not the most efficient route. The time to complete a route varied by as much as two hours because of it. `FindShortestTour`, however, is only one (possible) part of the solution. I'd need to parse addresses, read map data, and handle the slight irregularities of NYC streets. How can I use `FindShortestTour` to find the optimal meal delivery route, given a list of addresses?
