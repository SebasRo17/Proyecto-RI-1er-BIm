Is it possible to have a Java standalone application (no application server attached) that exposes some operations that a client can call and be the one to manage the transactions? I was thinking this application to expose JNDI resources and get a hold of a java:comp/UserTransaction from there, get also a bean from there and call methods A, B and C on it and coordinate the transaction from the client? The application I'm writing isn't complex enough so that I need a big application server around it so I'm thinking to have a standalone JTS inside it that the client could interact with from a transactions point of view. I don't have much experience with distributed transactions and don't really know how to tackle the issue. Is it even possible? Am I getting myself into something beyond what a mere mortal (programmer) can handle? How can I approach this?
