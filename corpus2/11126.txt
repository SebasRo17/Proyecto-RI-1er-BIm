This question on importing news headlines via a RSS feed reminded me of an old question I've been meaning to ask. Past attempts at finding a use for Mathematica's RSS to Notebook capabilities were frustrated by the fact that images within a given post always get parsed as a long ugly link to the image, rather than importing the image itself. Consider the following blog:               NotebookPut[Import["http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss", "RSS"]];      Scrolling down to one of the posts containing an simple image (along with a tiny snipped of text that correctly hyperlinks to a WSJ article), one often sees something like: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6o3ce.png) **Request 1:** Instead of the messy html text---that is a working hyperlink to the actual image---I'd rather see an actual image. Many posts also contain embedded video clips for sites like YouTube, etc. Instead of seeing an messy link, as in: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/aL2W3.png) **Request 2:** Can you instead display a static video image (and make that image a hyperlink to the actual YouTube video---and feel free to strip out the tracking crap...)? I realize this may require some knowledge of how YouTube embedded links actually work. Dunno if it's easy, or even possible, to request a static 'placeholder' image from YouTube.
