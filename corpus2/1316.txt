I'm running _Mathematica_ 8 on Windows 7. When I start the _Mathematica_ front end, I would like the menu bar and the blank notebook that opens to appear at a different position and with a different size from what they do by default. (By default the menu bar appears at the top of the screen and the blank notebook appears below it on the left side of the screen. I would like to try having the menu bar and notebook appear resized to about 350px wide and positioned in the upper right corner of the screen: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tqznd.png) .)
