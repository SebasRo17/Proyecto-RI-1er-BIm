I have a stand alone `Manipulator` (it is not in a `Manipulate`) and would like to know how to alter the style of the label. There are no explicit styling options for `Manipulator` so I tried wrapping it in `Style`:               Style[      Manipulator[0.5, AppearanceElements -> None,       Appearance -> {"Labeled"}, ImageSize -> Small],      FontSize -> 20]      this didn't work. I have also noticed that I cannot set an image size other than a named size. In other words `ImageSize` does not accept a number!               Manipulator[0.5, AppearanceElements -> None,       Appearance -> {"Labeled"}, ImageSize -> 100]      and               Manipulator[0.5, AppearanceElements -> None,       Appearance -> {"Labeled"}, ImageSize -> 400]      produce the same output. Are these issues possible bugs or am I overlooking something? Q1. How can I change the font size (and other font styling but mainly font size) for the Manipulator label? Q2. How can I make `ImageSize` accept a number rather than a name? **Edit** My question is **not** about what alternatives exist to using `Manipulator`. I have posted an example with `AppearanceElements -> None` so as to make the label the sole focus. However I want the possibility of being able to add back in the `AppearanceElements` is desired/required. The setting `AppearanceElements -> None` obviously looks like a stand alone slider and has led to readers thinking in terms of sliders rather than "fixing" the `Manipulator`. **Edit #2** In situations when no `Manipulator` controls are wanted `Slider` is an alternative but it also has some strange behaviour:               Framed@Slider[Dynamic[x], Appearance -> "Labeled", BaseStyle -> FontSize -> 20, ImageSize -> 100]     Framed@Slider[Dynamic[x], Appearance -> "Labeled", BaseStyle -> FontSize -> 20, ImageSize -> 200]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/moTS9.png) So it appears that the label occupies the same image size as the slider! This presents a problem in a GUI layout but there is a work around:               Framed@Pane[Slider[Dynamic[x], Appearance -> "Labeled",      BaseStyle -> FontSize -> 20, ImageSize -> 200], ImageSize -> 260]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Hk9iR.png) But the image space allocated to the label looks like a bug or something unintended. This doesn't address my question but I add it here because slider answered have been given. FWIW: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/I3MMY.png) **Edit #3** Tech support confirm that the strange image sizing for `Slider` when a label is used is a bug.
