* Ruby on Rails    * Twitter Bootstrap    * Html5Boilerplate    * Backbone.JS or Knockout.JS I sort of understand what each one is individually, but my understanding isn't strong enough to understand whether some of them sort of overlap in functionality and whether any subset of that list contains items you wouldn't use together because they play similar roles. I'm fairly clear on RoR-- it's mainly the latter three that I'm not sure how they play together.
