I asked a question at MSE and Raymond Manzoni provided an excellent answer that included these visuals: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/hLJyA.gif) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0bIpk.gif) I made a very basic attempt at recreation with               y = 10000; ListLinePlot[Table[{Im[E^(-I y Log[k])/Sqrt[k]], Re[E^(-I y       Log[k])/Sqrt[k]]}, {k, 1, Round[Sqrt[10000]]}]]      but a very messy plot resulted. I tried various parametric plots, but was equally disappointed with the results. Could someone please point me in the right direction to achieve the curlicues (that were apparently applet- generated) in the answer listed?
