So, I'm working on a project where the number of independent variables is not fixed. Consider a problem of $N$ independent variables, $\boldsymbol{r}$. I want to perform different things with them. Amongst them, I want to consider (multidimensional) integration, etc. ## Variables definition My first question regarding this topic, is the definition of the variables to perform algebraic manipulation. My first though was to use               variables[N_]:=Table[x[i],{i,1,N}]      However, in some situations, (e.g. with Block), I cannot use these variables as I use x1,x2,.... e.g.               Block[{x[1]=2},x[1]^2]      gives an error. (my current naive solution is to use):               variables[N_] := Table[ToExpression["x" <> ToString[i]], {i, 1, N}];      Is there any more standard solution? ### Sums, integrals This question also holds for the problem of computing integrals for arbitrary dimensions. How can I tell _Mathematica_ to compute               Integrate[f[{r1,r2,...,rn}], {r1, 0, 1}, {r2, 0, g[r1]},...,{rN, 0, h[{r1,r2,...,"rN-1"}]}]      Most of the times I will be interested in numerically compute the integral, but nevertheless, how do I tell _Mathematica_? I tried the simple "naive"               Integrate[1, Table[{i, 0, 1}, {i, variables[3]}]]      but it gives an error.
