In mark-sweep-compact garbage collection algorithm you have to stop-the-world when relocating objects because reference graph becomes inconsistent and you have to replace values of all references pointing to the object. But what if you had a hash table with object ID as a key and pointer as value, and references would point to said ID instead of object address... then fixing references would only require changing one value and pause would only be needed if object is tried to be written into during copying... Is there a mistake in my line of thought?
