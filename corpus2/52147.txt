I'm wring a thesis which has quite amount of tables. When the thesis gets printed, Mathematica often breaks pages between the table title and table. I would like to keep the title and table in the same page. How can I do so by editing the Stylesheet? Details regarding this problem: First I chosen the initial style sheet to be Artical -> Preprint. Then I selected "TableTitle" for the cell style of the title, and self-defined "TableText" for the cell style of the table. The self- defined "TableText" basically inherits the definition of the existing cell style "Text" as follows:               Cell[StyleData["TableText", StyleDefinitions -> StyleData["Text"]], TextAlignment->Center,      MenuSortingValue->1911,      FontSize->12]      The problem is even if I group the cells of titles and tables, Mathematica still often breaks the page between the cell "TableTitle" and the cell "TableText" when the Screen Environment is in Printout and I choose Printing Settings -> Show Page Breaks. I wouldn't like to add the page break lines manually. I'm wondering how to tell Mathematica not to add the page break lines between the cells "TableTitle" and the cells "TableText". Is it possible to do so by adding something to the StyleData of "TableTitle" in the environment of "Printout":               Cell[StyleData["TableTitle", "Printout"],      PageWidth->PaperWidth,      Hyphenation->False,      FontSize->12]      I tried to add `PageBreakBelow -> False` but it did not work.
