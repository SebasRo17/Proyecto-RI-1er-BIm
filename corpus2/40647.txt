I'm trying to create a histogram using `ListPlot` using the `Filling->Axis` and `FillingStyle -> {{LightGray, Thickness[.1]}}` as options. However, when I use this the columns are actually higher than the value in the lists. Below is an example                  n = 6;        p = 0.5;        (*calculate probabilities *)        list = Table[          c = Binomial[n, k];          d = p^k (1 - p)^(n - k);          {k, c* d}, {k, 0, n}]                  (*FillingStyle Thickness results in additional height being added to \        top of each column*)        ListPlot[(list),          Joined -> False,         Axes -> True,         FrameTicks -> {Table[i, {i, 0 , n, 1}],            Table[i, {i, 0, 0.3, 0.05}]},         FrameLabel -> {"Successes k", "Probability"},         Frame -> {True, True, False, False},         PlotStyle -> Automatic,         Filling -> Axis,         FillingStyle -> {{LightGray, Thickness[.1]}},         ImageSize -> 6*72 ]      Does anyone have a suggestion for a solution for this problem while still using `ListPlot`? Thanks, Mike
