I have multiple single page PDFs I'd like to join together into a single file. (Obviously I mean the file format and not the probability distributions here!) I'm aware of free online services such as this one and I have used them several times. On this occasion, however, I have info I'd prefer not to upload to a server I don't know anything about. I know Mathematica can `Import` and `Export` PDFs, but is there any easy way to join them together? I've tried using `Join`, but it produces a single large page instead of a page 1, page 2, page 3 format. Also the file size balloons - joining a 500 kB and 208 kB pdf results in a 3,503 kB file.
