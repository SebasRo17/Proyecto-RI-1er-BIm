I have a little over 10 years of development experience. For the past few years, I've mostly been working solo and although it has its perks, I feel as if it has been limiting my growth. I'm looking to pick up a contract job to get back into a team environment. I've been weighing a couple of opportunities: Company A is using the latest tools (.NET 4, VS 2010, ASP.NET MVC). The interview was fairly technical and I definitely felt rusty and didn't do as well as I had hoped. But I did get the offer. Their development process seems pretty mature. I felt like I could be the "dumbest person in the room" at this job, which I think can be a good thing, from a personal growth standpoint. Company B is a step behind platform wise (VS 2008, .NET 3.5, ASP.NET WebForms). After working with MVC, I find WebForms pretty painful. I also got the sense they have a fair amount of technical debt and they're still working on figuring out a good development process. But at least they're aware of it and working on it. That's an area of interest of mine and I feel like I could come in and provide some good ideas both in terms of development process and paying off technical debt. So these seem like two opposing kinds of jobs: one where I have more of an opportunity to learn technically, and one where I might have a better opportunity to come in and effect change. TL;DR - Which job situation is a better: the one with the biggest opportunity to be a student, or the one with the biggest opportunity to be an agent of change?
