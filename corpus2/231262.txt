`gcc`and `clang` are both known to be compiler drivers. As such, the `gcc` executable does not compile anything itself. Rather, it calls the compiler (`cc1`), assembler (`as`) and linker (`ld`) with the right flags as needed. Is this setup true also for the Microsoft C compiler, `cl.exe`? Is there actually some other executable that does the compilation? I assume that at least the assembling and linking are done by separate executables, since I know that `ml.exe` (known as MASM) and `link.exe` exist as separate executables, so `cl.exe` probably calls them.
