Given a rectangular board of height H and width W.   N colors are given and each color occupies Xi percentage of area on the board.   Sum of Xi's is 1. The colors on the board must be placed in rectangles.   An optimal solution has the rectangles' aspect ratios as close to 1 as possible.   An ideal case has the board filled only with squares. What's the best algorithm for laying out the rectangles?
