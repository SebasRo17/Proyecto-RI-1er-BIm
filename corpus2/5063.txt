I am using the following code to filter data based on the percentage change between points.               Reap[z = data[[1]]; Sow[z];               Scan[If[Abs[# - z]/z > delta,               z = #; Sow[z]] &, data]][[2, 1]]      That is, only considering point that were separated but a certain percentage change. While it gives me the correct answer, I would like to count the values that are dropped in between each selected point. How could I do that ?
