I am a beginner of _Mathematica_ and need some help for the following issue. I have the following two lists:               NamesandIDs = {{"ccc", 05}, {"ggg", 03}, {"zzz", 17}}          data = {{"zzz", 50, 30}, {"zzz", 49, 32}, {"ccc", 49, 21}, {"ccc", 27, 68},             {"ggg", 72, 38}, {"ggg", 77, 59}}      In `NamesandIDs` the first element of each list is a name and the second is ID number corresponding to each name; `data` contains some data for each name. With the two lists, what I wanna do is two things.   * Replacing names in `data` by the corresponding IDs, i.e. I would like to have the following result:              data = {{17, 50, 30}, {17, 49, 32}, {05, 49, 21}, {05, 27, 68}, {03, 72, 38},              {03, 77, 59}}        * Inserting the ID corresponding to each name into the second position of each list in "data," i.e. I would like to have:              data = {{"zzz", 17, 50, 30}, {"zzz", 17, 49, 32}, {"ccc", 05, 49, 21},              {"ccc", 05, 27, 68}, {"ggg", 03, 72, 38}, {"ggg", 03, 77, 59}}      I highly appreciate if someone could let me know how to come up with the two results above. Thank you very much in advance!
