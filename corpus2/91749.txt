I am wondering what other contractors in the field of software development do when a potential client approaches them with a spec.. in terms of contracts. In my experience, clients will often be happy to proceed with no formal agreement. I know this is quite an open ended question, so I will break it down into a series of subquestions that can be actually answered. If the client does not have a contract for you to sign, do you present a physical contract to them? If you have such a contract to present to clients, how did you acquire such a thing? Obviously you can pay through the nose to have a lawyer write it, and other obvious answers, but are there other reasonable (cost effective?) solutions to acquiring such a contract? At what stage, if any, would you require the client to physically sign such a contract? (what if the job is just one day?) In some cases, the software you are providing to the client is a customized version of an off-the-shelf, open-source, or proprietary in-house software, how does this affect things? _I realise that the best answer is probably "It depends on the client, and other factors..", you don't need to tell me that. But what are your experiences and opinions about 'best practices' in this area? Or to put a programming slant on it, do you have a reliable algorithm for managing the contract side of things, ie keeping both sides happy, most of the time?_
