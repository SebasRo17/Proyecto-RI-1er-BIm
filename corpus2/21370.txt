I've been using the shiny new legends in V9 for my plots. However, I usually increase the `Frame`/`Axis` `Thickness` and the plot `Thickness` and I would like the thickness of the legend line to match. There is a related question (Legend of a plot: how to increase the size of the line/marker?) asked about using the previous `PlotLegends` package. See this simple example, modified from the documentation:               Plot[{Sin[x], Cos[x]}, {x, 0, 2 \[Pi]},        PlotLegends -> Automatic,        PlotStyle -> Thickness[0.005],        AxesStyle -> Thickness[0.005]]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QzXvr.png) I've tried the obvious modification of the `LineLegend` `LabelStyle`, however, this just appears to modify the text and has no effect here:               Plot[{Sin[x], Cos[x]}, {x, 0, 2 \[Pi]},        PlotLegends -> LineLegend[Automatic, LabelStyle -> Thickness[0.5]],        PlotStyle -> Thickness[0.005],        AxesStyle -> Thickness[0.005]]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/yi89K.png) I found that I could set `Joined -> False` and use a thicker `line` as a `LegendMarker` but it is never as long as the normal legend line no matter how long you make the line... (also note that to get a comparable thickness it has to be set two orders of magnitude higher)               Plot[{Sin[x], Cos[x]}, {x, 0, 2 \[Pi]},       PlotLegends ->        LineLegend[Automatic, Joined -> False,         LabelStyle -> Directive[FontFamily -> "Helvetica", Medium],         LegendMarkers ->          Graphics[{Thickness[0.5], Line[{{-2, 0}, {2, 0}}]}]],       PlotStyle -> Thickness[0.005], AxesStyle -> Thickness[0.005]]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tvUcx.png) now make the line really long (no change):               Plot[{Sin[x], Cos[x]}, {x, 0, 2 \[Pi]},       PlotLegends ->        LineLegend[Automatic, Joined -> False,         LabelStyle -> Directive[FontFamily -> "Helvetica", Medium],         LegendMarkers ->          Graphics[{Thickness[0.5], Line[{{-100, 0}, {100, 0}}]}]],       PlotStyle -> Thickness[0.005], AxesStyle -> Thickness[0.005]]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0TBXn.png) I've tried to look at the `InputForm` for the plots and for just a `LineLegend` but I can't figure out what exactly I need to replace to fix this.
