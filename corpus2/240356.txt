I was _"that guy"_ that pushed his aws keys to github. Ugh. Anyway, I'm doing some research on how to prevent this in the future as this is the third time I've seen this done (my first!) and it was just a headache for the entire company. Everyone gets their own keys that have full access since we need to spin up instances, access s3, etc. Most people store them in environmental variables as do I and when I committed my dot files that's where the issue came in. We'd also like to not have them in code. We can send out memos and make sure people know but accidents will happen so what are some best practices to reduce the risk? I was thinking of storing them password protected and when you decrypt them they go into the environment and maybe providing some git hooks that search for certain keywords. Any other suggestions?
