I have an unformatted binary file generated using the Compaq Visual Fortran compiler (big endian). Here's what the little bit of documentation states about it: The binary file is written in a general format consisting of data arrays, headed by a descriptor record:   1. An 8-character keyword which identifies the data in the block.   2. A 4-byte signed integer defining the number of elements in the block.   3. A 4-character keyword defining the type of data. (`INTE`, `REAL`, `LOGI`, `DOUB`, or `CHAR`) The header items are read in as a single record. The data follows the descriptor on a new record. Numerical arrays are divided into block of up to 1000 items. The physical record size is the same as the block size. Additional keyword info:   1. `SEQHDR` \- 1 item - `INTE` \- Sequence header, with data value. If number is present it is an encoded integer corresponding to the time the file was created.   2. `MINISTEP` \- 1 item - `INTE` \- Ministep number is essentially the data number (ex: psi on day 1)   3. `PARAMS` \- n items - `REAL` \- Vector parameter at ministep value. Attempts to read such data into _Mathematica_ including `Import`               data=Import["file", "Binary", ByteOrdering -> +1];     data = FromCharacterCode[data]      and `OpenRead`               OpenRead["file", BinaryFormat -> True]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/f2NYv.jpg) show me some identifiable text, but no useful numerical values. A file in question is available here. Is _Mathematica_ able to parse this file type, and if so, what is the best way?
