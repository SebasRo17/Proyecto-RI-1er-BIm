I'd like to plot a certain function where only its qualitative progession shall be emphasized. Thus, using the `Ticks->None` option seems to be appropriate. However, I need to place a zero at the axes origin. My first choice was to put it in the epilog.   As a toy example, consider the code               Manipulate[       Plot[(a + x)*Sin[a*x], {x, 0, 4*Pi}, Ticks -> None,               Epilog -> Text[0, {-.1, .5}]       ],{a, 1, 5}     ]      As you can see, the zero gets closer to the x-axis as _a_ increases and in my real case, the zero is striked out by the x-axis for some parameter values. How can I place a zero to indicate the axis origin, such that it is independent of the function drawn? Ideally, the x-axis is only drawn for non negative _x_ and a zero would be placed right left to the point _(0,0)_.
