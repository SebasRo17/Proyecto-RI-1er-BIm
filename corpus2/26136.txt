Is it possible to convert the following list of strings to computable numbers with the comments preserved?                str = {{{"8.0,1034(*g opx ksp pl ilm liq q *)"}, {"8.0,1035(*g opx ksp pl ilm liq q *)"},               {"8.0,1037(*g opx ksp pl ilm liq q *)"}, {"8.0,1038(*g opx ksp pl ilm liq q *)"},                 {"8.0,1039(*g opx ksp pl ilm liq q *)"}, {"8.0,1040(*g opx ksp pl ilm liq q *)"}},               {{"8.0,886(*g opx ksp pl ilm liq q  *)"}, {"8.0,889 (*g opx ksp pl ilm liq q *)"},                 {"8.0,891(*g opx ksp pl ilm liq q  *)"}, {"8.0,894 (*g opx ksp pl ilm liq q  *)"},                 {"8.0,896(*g opx ksp pl ilm liq q  *)"}, {"8.0,899 (*g opx ksp pl ilm liq q  *)"}}}      I'm after something like:               strc = {{{8.0,1034(*g opx ksp pl ilm liq q *)},....      Perhaps there is a way involving programatically adding the comments back onto the numbers after the numbers have been converted to an expression? Any Suggestions?
