I'm going through a rough time. I'm a CS student at UIUC, which I hear is one of the top schools for CS. I love computers and programming. I've been pretty much doing it my whole life. I'm a freshmen now (junior in actuality, but I was premed before I switched to CS-long story). I'm finding the cirriculum pretty hard and challenging, but of course this way you learn so much. Due to the challenging nature of this program, especially at this school, I dont always get the top scores, while others seem to have no problem. I get discouraged quickly, and say to myself something like "whatever, I know even if I dont finish this program, I will find a way to make it on my own". Of course, I only say this to make myself feel better about my situation. But I really want to graduate from here and get this degree, but I find myself losing more and more motivation by the day. For those of you that graduated with a CS degree, any tips on how to get through this? Also, what are the benefits of a CS degree? I heard that I wont even use half the stuff I learn here. Why cant I just learn programming on my own by reading books. Most companies love experience. What does it come down to at the end? Of course I would love having this degree, but getting through it is gonna be a challenge.
