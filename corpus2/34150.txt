In mathematica 9.0: This:               Assuming[b > 0 || b < 0, Simplify[Log[Exp[a/b]]]]      yields:               a/b      However, this:               Assuming[FullSimplify[b > 0 || b < 0], Simplify[Log[Exp[a/b]]]]     enter code here      or this:               Assuming[b !=0 , Simplify[Log[Exp[a/b]]]]      Yield:               Log[Exp[a/b]]      Shouldn't be both equivalent? Why isn't the expression simplified in the second case?. Also tried to add ass an assumption a and b to be real, just in case, but doesn't work either. Could someone shed any light on this?
