After performing a fit in Mathematica, I would like to show the fitted parameters in a box on the plot showing the fitted function. How would I go about achieving that? Here is a MWE:               func[a_, b_, x_] := a*x + b;     nlm = NonlinearModelFit[{{1, 1}, {5, 5}, {2, 3}}, func[         a,         b,         x],        {{a, 1}, {b, 0}}, x];                    Plot[Normal[nlm[t]], {t, 0, 1.0}, PlotRange -> Full]     nlm["ParameterTable"]
