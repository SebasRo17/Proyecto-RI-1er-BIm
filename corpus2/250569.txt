The trivium is a systematic method of critical thinking for deriving certainty from any information which is comprised of:   * grammar    * logic    * rhetoric Joseph, Sister Miriam (2002). in _The Trivium: The Liberal Arts of Logic, Grammar, and Rhetoric. Paul Dry Books, Inc._ shortly describe this stages: > Grammar is concerned with the thing as-it-is-symbolized, Logic is concerned > with the thing as-it-is-known, and Rhetoric is concerned with the thing as- > it-is-communicated When I learned about the trivium I realized that would be the best way to approach teaching programming languages. Adapted to programming languages this would be the stages:   * in the grammar stage there would be the learning phase where writing any program, playing with all the all variants of syntax, simple, data structures, using all the keywords, datatypes, making simple programs, would be the goal.   * in the logic stage there will be teaching algorithms, complex conditionals, as a learning goal    * in the rhetoric stage there could be teaching programming paradigms, procedural programming, OOP, collaboration and versioning tools (git) etc. What would be the shortcomings of the trivium method applied to programming languages, what would be the learning subjects who could not be integrated with the trivium method, and would the trivium stages order(grammar first, logic second, etc) apply well to programming learning?
