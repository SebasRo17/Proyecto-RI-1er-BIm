I don't like to speak about money. I just like to work. I still believe in a relationship between good work and good compensation. Hence I don't want ask my employer about my compensations, actually they are asking me. So I created a liberal contract with unspecified salary-day -- I did not want to lose my rights to my own projects and I did not pay any attention to the salary-day.   1. Now the firm said that they would have paid me 1 month earlier if I had provided a tax -paper. I provided it before the next payment -day (unspecified).   2. During the next month, the co-employer pretty much blocks my working -- does not allow me to access working repository and the co-employer goes to cruise when we should finalize a project so I cannot do anything.    3. Now the project is not finalized, the co-employer has apparently provided some false statements to the boss about my doings (not getting anything for one month's work and 1 month when the co-employer pretty much wasted just my time) -- I was only allowed to debug the code of my co-employer and not to do anything.   4. I feel that co-employer did not allow me to work by purpose so that they have an excuse not to pay any salary.  The co-employer says that I cannot speak to the boss. The boss say that I need to speak directly to co-employer, not to him. I haven't said anything about the situation. I did not get things done because I was not allowed and now I am not even allowed to speak. Boss is the person who pays salaries. But both boss and co-employer have stages in the firm -- I think co-employer and boss are the same person pretty much, they created a theatre so that they get almost 2 month's work for free. Now I have multiple ideas how to avoid this kind of situations in the future:   1. specify the salary day   2. make sure you can speak directly to the manager and the boss, not through middle-hand   3. other?
