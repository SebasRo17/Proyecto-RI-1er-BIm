I'm trying to get this code working:               a = 2;     func[t_] := Dynamic[t + a];     Plot[func[t], {t, -5, 5}]      The idea is: I'd like to have the dynamic parameter a change the graph, without the need of actually re-evaluate the `Plot` command after each change of the parameter `a`. But this code delivers no plot printed on the screen. I've tried adding an `Evaluate` command as well, without luck. What am I missing of the `Dynamic` command? Or where did I do something wrong? Thank you all for your answers and your help!
