When writing constructors, I regularly encounter a situation where some fields already have approperiate (default) values, such as `false` for boolean values and `0` for integers. What are reasons to emphasize these values, for example like: `state = 0;` Do you appreciate it when reading someones code? On one side I feel like expressing implementation details explicitly, on the other side I find it pointless to set a field when I'm sure it is already correct.
