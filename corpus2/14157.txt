I am trying to create the interpolating function for a function of two variables, over a finite area. Just for consistency we can think of a function:               MyFunc[a_,b_]:=Sin[a*b]/Sqrt[1+a^2+b^2]      I've read the documentation and, in order to get the interpolating function I use:               MyTable=Table[MyFunc[a,b],{a, -5, 5, 0.1}, {b, -5, 5, 0.1}]     MyApproximateFunc = ListInterpolation[MyTable]      this seem to work, but when I try to plot MyFunc and MyApproximateFunc they look very different: I must have missed some detail...               Plot3D[MyFunc[a, b], {a, -5, 5}, {b, -5, 5}]     Plot3D[MyApproximateFunc[a, b], {a, -5, 5}, {b, -5, 5}]      Thanks in advance for your kind help!
