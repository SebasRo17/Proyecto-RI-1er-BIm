I'm starting to get into writing automated Acceptance tests and I'm quite confused where to write these tests against, specifically what layer in the app. Most examples I've seen are Acceptance tests written against the **Domain** but how about tests like: > Given Incorrect Data When the user submits the form Then Play an Error Beep These seem to be fit for the **UI** and not for the **Domain** , or probably even the **Service layer**.
