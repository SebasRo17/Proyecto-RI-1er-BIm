There seem to be a problem with `ListPlot` auto ranging in _Mathematica_ 9\. Here's my code:               n = 10;     dn = 10;     data = Table[If[Divisible[i - n, dn], i, 1], {i, 1,  100}];     ListPlot[data, PlotRange -> Automatic]      In version 8 it works as expected (y ranges from 0 to 100), but in version 9 it only shows y going from 0 to 2. Is there something wrong with my code? A bug in _Mathematica_?
