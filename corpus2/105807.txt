We are preparing to OpenSource our ASP.NET MVC multi-tenancy CMS. We currently use BitBucket.org to host our source repository and we are considering best approaches to repository naming. In terms of the user/host of the repository, We are debating using our company name which is the sponsor of the project versus the project name itself. The company name is JoyaTech Solutions, the project name is JoyaCMS. Do people think that having a company name as the user/owner of an open source project is a turn off or is there value in displaying that relationship?
