In RFC 2617 HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication they speak always of username and password for the authentication. Why should I choose to take a username as identifier for a website? Usernames are often hard to choose a not existing one or one which is unique. But everyone getting an account somewhere has an email which is unique. Why does the RFC not speak of something abstract like a unique string identifier? That would make much more sense to me where everyone logs into his account with his email... When someone starts with security/authentication the first thing he will think reading the RFC 2617 that he can not do basic auth because I want email + password. What am I missing here?
