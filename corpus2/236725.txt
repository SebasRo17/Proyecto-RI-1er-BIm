We have created a REST API for a voting game. Now we are jumping into creating analytics/graphs/charts for moderators and users to watch how are they doing in the game. The game has a certain group of people vote or use their votes for a certain number of choices. Now there is a moderator for this group which can compare the activity and performance of a group consisting of approx 50 members. So the graph requires votes of a user for a particular choice in days.   * user      * vote     * choice     * when to show the people increase in voting activity over time against a number of choice. Or perhaps comparison of all users showing how many votes they made in days/weeks/months. What is the best way to do this using sql. Should a long running query like this can be a considerable solution. Should this kind of data be prefetched or pre calculated and refreshed after some time? For a real time solution what are the possible ways? If the query is the only way, how can we speed it up? Indexing? Views? Triggers? Procedures? I am familiar with sql but dont know anything more than indexing. So it would help explaining what can help why and where.
