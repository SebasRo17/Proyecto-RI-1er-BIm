All our (my company) currently applications pull information from that database, is their a way to get the following types of databses to either push data or push an event to allow the application to pull data.   * Access   * SQL   * Oracle   * File systems (Files and folders) The issue today is that most of our application spend a large amount of time constantly looking at databases and file system checking to see if data has changed . It would be better for the database to inform the application when data has changed. Are there tools within Visual studio to allow this or are there tools within the database / filesystem to do this? All ready asked this on stack overflow but go no answer. I've been doing some more research but I cant seem to get any further. My manager has asked to investigate it as it would mean our applications are much quicker and efficient.
