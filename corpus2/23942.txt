All programming languages I know of are written - i.e. typed out as lengths of text one way or another. But I wonder if there's any programming language where you can just drag-n-drop the whole program; to get a loop, you select this box over here and drag it to that section of the "code" over there, and so on. And if there isn't one like this, would it fly if one was invented? Personally I don't believe it would be such a good idea, but I'd like to hear what you think.
