I have tried to resolve the problem of the following link How can I solve precision problem I can tell the problem described in that link shortly here, It's no mater how many precision is there after decimal(.) the result should be 2 or 3 precision after decimal as per user requirement.e.g               N[10/3]     3      Output should be as per user wish precision as 2.               3.33     3.00      There I found `NumberForm[]` function as a solution, since the `NumberForm[]` function is wrap up the result, I can't get the result as number out of it. I tried like this               NumberForm[N[10/3],{4,2}]     NumberForm[3, {4, 2}]      Output am getting is               3.33     3.00      But when I try to do further operation, it's not computing               NumberForm[N[10/3], {4, 2}] + 1     NumberForm[3, {4, 2}] + 1      Output               1+3.33     1+3.00      I tried other way also which follows               ToExpression[ToString[NumberForm[3, {4, 2}]]]      OutPut               3.      but I need output as 3.00. Help me to find the solution.
