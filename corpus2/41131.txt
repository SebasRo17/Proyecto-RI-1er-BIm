I have equations written in my notebooks as text (the cells set as Format -> Style -> Text). When exporting the notebook to HTML (File -> Save As.. -> HTML) with the GIF option (the default) an HTML file is produced along with folders: HTMLFiles and HTMLLinks. The HTMLFiles folder contains GIF images of the equations in the text, but they are very low resolution / quality. Is there a way to make Export set them to a higher resolution? motivation: to write equations in Mathematica (it is nice to write in) and output the equations as images to use in a presentation. I have tried: SetOptions[Image, ImageSize -> 5000]; SetOptions[Image, ImageResolution -> 5000]; SetOptions[Graphics, ImageSize -> 5000]; SetOptions[Rasterize, RasterSize -> 1000]; With no luck. Thanks,
