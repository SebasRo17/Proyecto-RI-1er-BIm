Mathematica can't find a solution to this Expectation.                Expectation[f \[Conditioned] 1 - (1 - f)^k >= p, {f, k} \[Distributed]       UniformDistribution[{{0, 1}, {2, 5}}],Assumptions->{p>0}]      But it can find solutions when I substitute specific rational numbers for p. Here's an example                Expectation[      f \[Conditioned] 1 - (1 - f)^k >= 3/11, {f, k} \[Distributed]       UniformDistribution[{{0, 1}, {2, 5}}]]      It can even find solutions when I substitute transcendentals for p. Here's an example.                Expectation[      f \[Conditioned] 1 - (1 - f)^k >= 1/\[Pi], {f, k} \[Distributed]       UniformDistribution[{{0, 1}, {2, 5}}]]      Is there some assumption I could add to the Expectation that would let Mathematica find a general solution? I've played around with various ideas such as p>0 but I can't find anything that works. Alternatively, can someone explain why Mathematica can't find a general solution? P.S. If anyone cares, this question arises out of an attempt to understand subsidized insurance markets. Ultimately, I would like to use things fancier than UniformDistribution over which to compute the Expectation, but until I can get a close form solution to this simple case, more challenging cases look impractical.
