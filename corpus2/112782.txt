Microsoft Guru Eric Brechner discusses measuring "time on task" in his book "Hard Code". The discussion comes up during a section on Agile - Scrum. My guess is that it means "time spent to complete task X", but then he goes on to discuss time on task in terms of percentages by team. So I don't know how to make this logical leap. In the Microsoft context, what exactly is "time on task"? * * * First > The daily stand-up meetings in Scrum are highly organized and collect useful > data. The team organizer (Scrum Master) simply asks all the team members > what they accomplished since yesterday (and how long it took) [...] Then > Tracking how long it took is my team's small contribution to Scrum at > Microsoft. By adding this information to the burn-down data (how much is > left to do), you can produce fantastic cumulative flow diagrams, measure > time on task and work in progress, and better estimate team capacity. > Typical time on task is around 42% for production teams; 30% for teams > focused on communication--like mine--and as much as 60% for co-located > feature teams.
