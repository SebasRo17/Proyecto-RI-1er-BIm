I need to determine the maximum value for `y = a x^2 + b x + c`, where I know the coefficients and the upper and lower `x` values. Say the input values are:               a = 5; b = 1; c = 2; xLower = -5; xUpper  = 5;      Given this input, how do I determine the maximum value for the quadratic function above? My goal is to implement a function that has a signature such as `funcMax[ a, b, c, xUpper, xLower]`. How could I get the arguments for the extremal values using the above input?
