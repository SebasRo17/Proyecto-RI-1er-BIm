So based on my limited understand of how computers work I derived the following question. As you transfer things over circuits the circuits heat up. As they heat up they lose conductivity and ultimately slow down. So how do you calculate the approximate time of transfer for a large amount of files if you take into account for the loss of speed do to drop in conductivity over the wires? To clarify I am talking specifically about local devices, such as HDD to HDD on the same desktop. Also is this even a relative topic? I have noticed slowdown in older drives but I think that was due to the drive itself and not the circuits. This would be useful on older systems though.
