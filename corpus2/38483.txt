(Apologies in advance for the vague and miasmic question) Is there a book, or other resource, there that can explain **using** Drupal, The System, to a web app oriented programmer? I've read through the Apress Pro Drupal Development book and it was a fantastic overview of the system's architecture. That's not what I'm looking for here. Instead I want something that's going to tell/show me "Here is how people use Drupal to manage their sites and build applications". I've been building websites and web applications since the beginning, and whenever I sit down to spend some time with Drupal I find I can't leave behind my concepts of   1. A URL equal one HTML page, and everything flows from there   2. A URL equals a controller action, and everything flows from there and Drupal seems to be built on an entirerly different model. So any books, tutorials, or explanations that start from the above two points and explain how Drupal is different, and what Drupal developers spend their days doing would be fantastic.
