We have a small dev team (only 3 developers) and we recently got a new team member. While he is a smart coder, his coding style is completely different from ours. Our existing code base contains mostly readable, clean and maintainable code, but the new team member is quickly changing many files, introducing ugly hacks and shortcuts, using defines all over the place, adding functions in the wrong places, etc. My question is if others have experienced such a situation before, and if anyone has tips on how to talk to him.
