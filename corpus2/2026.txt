I'm trying to use `Modules` together with functions.               tmp2 = x^2 + 1; f[y_] := Module[{x = 1}, Evaluate[y tmp2]]      This works when I just have               tmp2 = x^2 + 1; Module[{x = 1}, Evaluate[tmp2]]      But `f[1]` outputs $1 + x^2$. **Edit:** After seeing the answers I wonder how I can get something like this to work:               ClearAll[withRules]     SetAttributes[withRules, HoldAll]     withRules[rules_, expr_] :=       Internal`InheritedBlock[{Rule, RuleDelayed},        SetAttributes[{Rule, RuleDelayed}, HoldFirst];       Unevaluated[expr] /. rules]     ClearAll[f, tmp2]     tmp2[y_] = y (x^2 + 1)     withRules[{expr -> tmp2}, f[y_] := Module[{x = 1}, expr[y]]]      **Edit 2:** Maybe it is better if I explain what I'd like to do. I have a lot of calculations in terms of $k_x$, $k_y$ and $k_z$. So, those are outputted in terms of these three variables. However, sometimes I need to integrate such expressions but to do this I need to use spherical coordinates. So I set $k_x = k \sin(a) \cos(b)$ and so on and then integrate. I don't want the transformations always set because I want the other calculations to have $k_x$, $k_y$ and $k_z$ as variables, not $a$ en $b$.
