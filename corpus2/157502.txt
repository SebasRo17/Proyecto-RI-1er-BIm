I am creating a software package that will be useful to programmers, engineers and scientists. List price will be in the region of $1,000 -- way beyond the budget of most open-source developers, hobbyists and enthusiasts. So I am considering two things, the first generous, the second maybe a little greedy:   1. Offering a free license to individual open source developers upon proof of their credentials and details of their project. Possibly also academics too.   2. Making the free license conditional on the developer granting me a commercial license to use the open source code they write in my own projects. In the academic case, it's trickier, perhaps just a credit, a copy of papers, etc. How would (1) and (2) be received? Are there any examples of best practice here, or good precedents I can follow?
