Oftentimes I would find it useful to insert plaintext, to not be evaluated as input, right next to my input code. Is there a shortcut key to insert such a plaintext input box? I have relied on comments (shortcut key `Alt`+`/`), but as I use a touchscreen display and a small Bluetooth keyboard, it is a real hassle to select a line of text and hit `Alt`+`/`. So I was looking for something easier.
