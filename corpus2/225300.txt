I program and I am dyslexic. My vision is excellent. I do poorly processing symbols and am a visual thinker. When I code, I'm slower than normal people because I am unpredictably unaware of the errors I make. I am learning python and the text only development environments cause me a lot of visual stress; I am using Wingware which is somewhat helpful, but cant complete assignments in the time given. Can you suggest an accommodation that would help me? What adaptations would be helpful to me? Is there any way I can automatically find, highlight and fix these kinds of errors? Proofreading, I see what I expect to see or something familiar. I don't notice typos, skip lines etc and the bugs turn up in testing. Even copy & pasting I can miss lines and cause errors. Blocks of text from margin to margin give me headaches as do some color combinations I do not process text as symbols, rather as objects that can be rotated, transposed so that the digits in a number move to different places, I may perceive "123" AS "132", THE LETTERS "pddq", look the same to me. I think of these as tricky - the same shape rotated and reflected.
