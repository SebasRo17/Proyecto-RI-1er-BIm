In my understanding a major point in Continuous Deployment is (well, obviously I guess) that deployment is automatically done as a part of the building process. Conceptually it is easy to understand how the deployment can be done when the target is a website. However it appears hard/impossible to continuously deploy when it is a desktop application deployed via an msi-installer (sorry for my tech background being mainly a Microsoft one)? Are there deployment technologies that cannot be used when continuously deploying? Or rather: Which deployment technologies makes sense in continues deployment?
