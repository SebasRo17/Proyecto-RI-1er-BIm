What are some ideas or structure I can use when assigning EventID to events that will be saved to the Windows Event Log? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UT2UA.png) Some options I've considered   * Sequential (0... int.Max)   * Multiple of 10, where the "0" is replaced with how noisy the debugLevel is set.   xxx0 may represent exceptions, critical information, start, stop etc.   * ...? What numbering approach gives you the most insight when a user describes the event in an email or phone? What is the most useful to support staff?
