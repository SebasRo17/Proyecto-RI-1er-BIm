I have been using _Mathematica_ and _webMathematica_ (with application server) in Windows and it was working fine. Recently we changed to _Linux_ , so I have to install both _Mathematica_ and _webMathematica_ (with application server) in Ubuntu-12.04. I manage to install _Mathematica_ in Ubuntu-12.04 and get it work. Now I have to install _webMathematica_ in Ubuntu-12.04 and deploy it in Application server. This is what I tried base on the link. I tried to install Xvnc, I downloaded vnc for Linux from site. Am not root of the Ubuntu OS, So I have to login as a user and did               cp vncviewer vncserverui vncpasswd Xvnc /usr/local/bin      and I tried to launch Xvnc as               niren@ubuntu-1204-precise-64-minimal:/$ vncserver      I got output is > New 'ubuntu-1204-precise-64-minimal:7 (niren)' desktop is > ubuntu-1204-precise-64-minimal:7 Starting applications specified in > /home/niren/.vnc/xstartup > > Log file is /home/niren/.vnc/ubuntu-1204-precise-64-minimal:7.log Instead of > New 'ubuntu-1204-precise-64-minimal:7 (niren)' desktop is > ubuntu-1204-precise-64-minimal:7 Starting applications specified in > /home/niren/.vnc/xstartup > > Log file is > /home/niren/.vnc/ubuntu-1204-precise-64-minimal.wolfram.com:7.log Since I run the `vncserver` under `niren@ubuntu-1204-precise-64-minimal`. Then I tried to test Xvnc as               mathematica -display :7      but it is not working and it is showing > mathematica: command not found. any suggestion. how can I run the X server to make _webMathemaica_ under Linux work? I am using               OS(Linux): Ubuntu-12.04.     Application server: Geronimo 3.0.1     webMathematica: 3.2     Mathematica(linux version): 9.0.1
