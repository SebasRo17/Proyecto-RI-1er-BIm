In the Ruby on Rails tutorial, I read something that suggested that experienced developers do not use scaffolding since they tend to like to just write the code to connect the MVC on their own. In a different place I read that it is a good idea to use scaffolding because it helps you stick to convention so others who look at and interact with your code will understand what you are doing. I am pretty new to Ruby on Rails but not MVC or web application - should I generally try hard to stick to scaffolding conventions and let it guide me?
