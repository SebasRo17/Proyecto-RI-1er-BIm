My team has about 18 members and the code is generally good, using TDD and good specifications makes for working code. But I think they abuse comments in favor of writing cleaner, more readable code. I would like to introduce them to the concept and I'm wondering how can I do that on a larger scale without sitting with each and every one of them on their code and explaining how it could be improved. This is different from the suggested duplicate because I believe I already know how to write clean code. What I'm looking for is how do I introduce _my team_ to writing clean code?
