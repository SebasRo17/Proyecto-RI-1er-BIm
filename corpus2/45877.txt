I want to make a sytem of equations has the form $$\begin{cases} a_1x^2+b_1y^2 + c_1xy+d_1x + e_1y+3=0,\\\ a_2x^2+b_2y^2 + c_2xy+d_2x + e_2y+3=0. \end{cases}$$ so that the given system of equations has always two solutions $(1,2)$ and $(3,4)$. I tried               f[x_, y_] := a*x^2 + b*y^2 + c*x*y + d x + e y + 3     l = {a, b, c, d, e} /.      Solve[{f[1, 2] == 0, f[3, 4] == 0, 1 <= a <= 10,      1 <= b <= 10, -10 <= c <= 10, -10 <= d <= 10}, {a, b, c, d, e},      Integers]      Now, I want to select two lists in list `l` and make system of equations. For example               u = l[[77]];     v = l[[75]];     w = {x^2, y^2, x y, x, y};     Reduce[{u.w + 3 == 0, v.w + 3 == 0}, {x, y}, Reals]      > (x == 3/10 && y == 3/5) || (x == 1 && y == 2) || (x == 3 && y == 4) || (x == > 25/4 && y == 4) Another system of equations               u = l[[3]];     v = l[[12]];     w = {x^2, y^2, x y, x, y};     Reduce[{u.w + 3 == 0, v.w + 3 == 0}, {x, y}, Reals]      > (x == -15 && y == -6) || (x == 1 && y == 2) || (x == 3 && y == 4) In the above system of equations, the equation `u.w + 3==0` can be factor               Factor[u.w + 3]      > (3 + x - 2 y) (1 + x - y) Now, I consider system of equations               u = l[[8]];     v = l[[75]];     w = {x^2, y^2, x y, x, y};     Solve[{u.w + 3 == 0, v.w + 3 == 0}, {x, y}, Reals]      > {{x -> 1, y -> 2}, {x -> 3, y -> 4}, {x -> 3/49 (16 - Sqrt[109]), y -> > -(11/4) + 85/98 (16 - Sqrt[109]) - (437 (16 - Sqrt[109])^2)/ 9604 + (3 (16 - > Sqrt[109])^3)/4802}, {x -> 3/49 (16 + Sqrt[109]), y -> -(11/4) + 85/98 (16 + > Sqrt[109]) - (437 (16 + Sqrt[109])^2)/ 9604 + (3 (16 + Sqrt[109])^3)/4802}} How can I select two list from the list `l` so that I receive a system of equations in which all of them can't factor and the system of equations has only rational solutions?
