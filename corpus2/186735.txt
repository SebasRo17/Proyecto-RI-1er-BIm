I currently report my production exceptions to a mysql database, where they have been collecting dust for the most part. The problem I faced is grouping the stack traces. I would like to be able to see kind of an aggregate of the stack traces that are the same, so that I can work them into the workflow. I know one issue I have is I get stack traces in different languages, which throws things off, otherwise I'd just do a group by sql command. Does anyone know of any libraries that could assist me with this? As long as I have something where I can put in a collection of stack traces and get out the result, I'm fine. I don't need any direct sql interaction, or reporting or anything like that(but I'll take any suggestions you guys have) Thanks
