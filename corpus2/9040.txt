I'm trying to figure out how to print a message dialog without printing the whole notebook. `FrontEndExecute[FrontEndToken["PrintDialog"]]` displays the print window (just like selecting file -> print but it prints the whole notebook. I have also tried using `FrontEndExecute[FrontEndToken["PrintSelectionDialog"]]` but when the code is run the selected area becomes unselected. I have solved part of the problem with the following               DialogInput[       DialogNotebook[{Column[{Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 6 Pi}],            Row[{Button["print",               DialogReturn[               FrontEndExecute[FrontEndToken["PrintDialog"]]]]}]}]}]];      This prints the entire window including the print button as shown.   ![print output](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GXp1E.png)   This is exactly what I am looking for but without the print button.   Any ideas much appreciated,   Christina
