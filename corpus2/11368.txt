I am interested in improving this plot: ![contour plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qvPAJ.png) which I produced with the following command:               dat // ListContourPlot[#, ContourShading -> False,         ContourStyle -> ColorData[10] /@ Range[10], Contours -> Range[21]/8,        ContourLabels -> None, FrameLabel -> {x, y},         DataRange -> {{-7, 2}, {-15, 15}}, PlotLabel -> "Contour plot of Ï•(x,y)"] &      The actual `dat` is available here; the edge corresponds to zero values (though, it could be set to something else). **Question** > I would like _Mathematica_ to identify the edge of the contours and do a > region plot to avoid the ragged line, or alternatively, to draw a thick line > over it to make it publication-friendly. **Attempt** I guess I know how to find the edge:               dat2 = dat // Image // EdgeDetect // ImageData // Position[#, 1] & // Sort;      On the other hand, these points are not sorted correctly: ![badly-sorted points](http://i.stack.imgur.com/oODeH.png) I supposed I could use 2D neighbours as a criterion for sorting, but I feel there is a smarter way to achieve my overall goal(?)
