This is kind of a new years thing for me as I want to be more entrepreneurial going forward with programming and this is kind of a general question for anyone who may share the same ambitions as me. I have experience with web programming and, although I work full time for a company doing programming, I have some freelance programmers that I work with / employ for small projects. I want to see about taking things to the next level as far as building a small company doing custom development. I'm just not sure how to figure out what niches to target as far as what type of apps to build as demos, etc. I was thinking mobile (maybe Android or iPhone) but am just curious if anyone has any advice / resources. A lot of "web development" seems to end up being just using a CMS like Joomla or Wordpress, for smaller sites, so I want to figure a way to steer clear of this crowd and find some opportunity with companies / entrepreneurs who actually need real programming development done to build apps. Thanks for any advice
