I am trying to do some quantum algebra computations in _Mathematica_. Up to now I was able to make the noncommutative multiplication linear and to factorize powers. However, I still have some issues with associativity. In particular, I would like to be able to remove brackets expressions like `a ** ( b ** c )` and get `a ** b ** c`. The reason for that is that I already have a procedure that substitutes `a^2 ** b` to `a ** a ** b`, but this doesn't work when I have brackets `(a ** ( a ** b ))`.   Does anyone know how to overcome this problem?
