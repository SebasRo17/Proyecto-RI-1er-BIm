Sometimes I have occasion to make big grids of plots. As a toy example:               lots = GraphicsGrid[     Table[With[{a = RandomInteger[{1, 17}], b = RandomInteger[{1, 17}]},       ParametricPlot[Sin[t^2] { Cos[a t], Sin[b t]}, {t, 0, 2 \[Pi]},           PlotRange->{{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}, Frame->True]], {15}, {7}]]      Which is a 7 by 15 grid of plots. For ease of viewing, printing and wider distribution; I will often export this to a pdf.               Export["lots.pdf", lots]      This results in a completely rubbish view. You get giant text labels and a graph too small to even see. This can be rectified by fiddling with the scaling:               Export["lots.pdf", lots, ImageSize->2000]      Now the text labels are more in proportion with the graph size. But how do I know what `ImageSize` should be? It depends on how big your graphic grid is, but I know not the voodoo required to get a good result. Alternatively, how can I get the text size to be proportional to the graph size?
