I am minimizing a nonlinear constrained problem using `FindMinimum`. The problem involves about 200 variables and the function is a black-box which cannot be compiled/optimized (I have set the Method as Automatic). During evaluations, I collect the value of the objective function at intermediate evaluations using `EvaluationMonitor` option. I have a `Monitor` statement enclosing the `FindMinimum` which plots the objectiveFunction against the number of function evaluations. This was the picture. ![objective_fn_against_num_of_fn_evals](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Juk0H.jpg) Is there an option to **(gracefully) terminate** the `FindMinimum` after `nMax` number of function evaluations, returning the best solution of those so far evaluated (like position 25 in the image)? ( `MaxIterations` does not achieve it, since it is a bound on the number of **steps taken** and not the function evaluations).
