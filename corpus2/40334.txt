EDIT: I want to thank you all guys for this unexpected intellectual and artistic journey. Hope you enjoyed as I did. I would like to generate a `circle pack` that mimics this: _(don't pay attention on numbers, and colors at all, at the moment I am interested in circle positions and radii only)_ ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PnJ5y.jpg) or this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/It2s0.png) I am new in Mathematica, could you give me some guidance? Thnx. _EDIT: The question was strictly for planar case (and remains so), however I see @Jacob Akkerboom in his answer added a solution for 3D generalization (thanks!), and, speaking of that, I just want here to bring to your attention this picture:_ ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OoAbX.png) _EDIT 2: There are some applications of circle packing in irregular shapes, like this: (author Jerome St Claire, handpainted)_ ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Bm43F.png) _... and a font called Dotted: (author Maggie Janssen)_ ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1men0.jpg) _... and some logos:_ ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pcXYr.jpg) _... and these hypnotic images: (frompercolatorapp)_ ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SPKKX.jpg) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/oNa4Y.jpg) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/agG2f.jpg)
