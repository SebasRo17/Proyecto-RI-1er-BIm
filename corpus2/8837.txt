I've been playing around with `Resolve` and `FindInstance`. I know that `Resolve` should always be decidable when the domain is `Reals` by Tarski's theorem, but I don't know about `FindInstance`. I tried using `FindInstance` to find a lower bound on the absolute value of a real number, but it didn't succeed.               (* First-order logic characterization of absolute value. a = |x|. *)     MyAbs[x_, a_] := (x > 0 \[Implies] a == x) âˆ§ (x <= 0 \[Implies] a == -x)          (* Returns True, so yes there is a lower bound. *)     Resolve[Exists[l, ForAll[{x, a}, (MyAbs[x, a]) \[Implies] a >= l]], Reals]          (* Returns True, so yes 0 is a lower bound. *)     Resolve[ForAll[{x, a}, (MyAbs[x, a]) \[Implies] a >= 0], Reals]          (* Returns {}, so Mathematica can't find a specific lower bound. *)     FindInstance[ForAll[{x, a}, (MyAbs[x, a]) \[Implies] a >= l], {l}, Reals]          (* Using the standard Abs also returns {} *)     FindInstance[ForAll[x, Abs[x] >= l], {l}, Reals]      Why is `FindInstance` not returning `{{l -> 0}}`?
