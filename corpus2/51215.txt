I know that this question is not about strictly mathematica issue, but I think that in this site should be many pepople that use latex to distribute mathematica source code/examples. If the moderators think that I should delete this question, please tell me.. and I excsuse me, and I´m doing it as soon as possible. I have mathematica source code (with any long lines), and I want to attach to a job(using latex), as an appendix. What do you think is the best way(package) to insert the code (in sourcecode.nb) in the latex document?. I was reading in any posts o LATEX StackExchange about minted(would be neccesary to configure paths and other details, the package seems to be so pretty) and listings package but this packages seems to be more focused in languages as C, C++, java,... to highlight the reserved words. I was reading Highlighting Mathematica code in LaTeX document but I dont´see a suitable solution I was reading about minted and.. I understand that don´t supports Mathematica. http://pygments.org/languages/ but then I found http://pygments.org/docs/changelog/?highlight=mathematica where seems to mathematica be supported. Have you any suggestion?
