I have a huge program that I have been developing for almost 2 years. It will probably go commercial in about 6-9 months, but seeing as it is just me developing it, I'd had almost zero feedback about the code (efficiency, maintainability, proper use of best practices, etc.). I would really like to have someone or several people review it for feedback. So:   1. Are there places that I can get this service. Are sites like oDesk the way to go?   2. Is it safe? Would an NDA be sufficient to protect IP or are there other ways of going about protecting IP?   3. Are there particular qualities I should look at in a reviewer, other than they know the language and maybe some of the issues? In fact, I don't even know if the 3 questions above are the right ones to ask and I should be asking different ones first. Any advice on this subject?
