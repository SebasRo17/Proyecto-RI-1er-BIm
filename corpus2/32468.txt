`ProteinData["A2M", "MoleculePlot"]` gives you a `Graphics3D` object below. I'd like to display multiple of these proteins in **a single** Graphics3D scene. Is there a way to place the `Graphics3D` object returned by `ProteinData[...]` at a specific location and orientation in another 3D scene? Alternatively, is there a `ProteinData` API that (I'm somehow missing and) would give me an object that I could place (rotated and translated) in a new `Graphics3D` scene? ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xKOMX.png)
