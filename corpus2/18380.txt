I want Mathematica to periodically autosave my notebooks to the temp folder. And in case of front-end crash i want to see the dialog after restart with the following choices:   * recover from autosaved drafts   * discard drafts and open last manually saved versions   * start a new session Ideally i would like to make a fully automated solution that doesn't requre to execute any commands each time i open a new notebook. Do you have any suggestions how to implement this functionality? There is a hidden `NotebookAutoSave` option which saves notebook at every evaluation, but it has several disadvantages. It overwrites manually saved notebook and if i accidentally delete an important code (and evalute something) i'm unable to restore from the manually saved file. In OS X a built-in backup system can help, but when notebook is saved after each evaluation i get too many versions. There is also no possibility to distinguish manually saved version from all that autosaves in the Time Machine. Another problem with `NotebookAutoSave` is that it is only triggered by the evaluation. It doesn't help when i write code, open built-in help and front- end crashes during help browsing process.
