There is an open source project that I want to fork for my own reasons. It currently has a Git mirror of its main SVN repository which I can use. What are the best techniques for forking a project whilst still maintaining the ability to merge future changes from the original project into your own forked repository using Git? Please note I will not be using Github at all for development so using any features from that is out of the question. The project will be hosted on a private VPS.
