I have come across this programming idiom recently:               const float Zero = 0.0;      which is then used in comparisons:               if (x > Zero) {..}      Can anyone explain if this is really any more efficient or readable or maintainable than:               if (x > 0.0) {..}      NOTE: I can think of _other_ reasons to define this constant, Im just wondering about its use in _this_ context.
