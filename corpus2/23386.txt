The most common discussion I've seen regarding the pros and cons of REST tends to frame that discussion relative to SOAP. I have no experience in either. I am currently faced with a decision which my lack of experience is making hard for me to evaluate. I am beginning to develop an application that has several components - primarily an administrative aspect that allows the owner to administer several sites - and a public facing user interface that allows the user to interact with data held on the host. I need to evaluate the implications of allowing the latter part to be hosted anywhere and communicate with the former via a RESTful architecture - or demanding that both components reside on the same host. What are the key implications of developing RESTful architecture, particularly with regards to it's capacity in the following areas: 1: Security 2: Performance 3: Interface complexity EDIT: Looking at some of the answers to this question - I should clarify. I'm not looking for a comparison to SOAP - rather an overview of REST applications vs applications where all components reside on one host. (thanks for those answers though!)
