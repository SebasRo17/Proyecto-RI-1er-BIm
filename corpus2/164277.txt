I'm developing a software that contain many modules/Daemon running in parallel manner, what i'm looking for is how to implement that, i cannot use Thread because some of those modules/Daemon are perhaps implemented in other languages (C,java,C#...). For example I'm using C for Hooking Messages exchanged between Windows kernel and top level applications, Java/C# to use some free library to simply parse XML(for example) or to accept and execute commands over the network..this can be done by C Language but just to improve productivity... Finally for GUI I'm using Ultimate++ (c++) that is like the main process that call and monitor(activate/deactivate/get state) of all other modules/Daemon through an interface. I admit that the development of each module/Daemon in a separate language greatly facilitates maintenance, but especially I am obliged to do that.. What is the best practice way to do that ? All helps will be appreciated.
