For enterprise windows-based solutions, .NET is the best choice sometimes. How is Mono looked at by the enterprises who have to use Linux (or rather prefer to use Linux) ? Assuming that the developers aren't a problem and they are familiar with .NET/Mono and other possible competitors such as Java. Would a medium/large company run Mono on their servers as opposite to technologies such as Java? Do you know of any such company ?
