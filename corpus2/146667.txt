I'm learning programming in school and I have this question that's bugging me about data structures and transferring the information stored inside them to databases. We're doing just small systems - registration for an event, point of sale for a local restaurant, sales and inventory, etc Let's say someone registers himself, should it be passed into a data structure and then into the database, or should it just be transferred directly to the database?
