I'm not absolutely sure if this is the right place for this question. But I guess StackOverflow won't be the right place. Is it for any reason a bad way to pass an object to a method from the same class? For some reason I don't feel well with the first solution. The method `Start` starts the game with the given player.               CurrentGame.Start(CurrentGame.CurrentPlayer);      or               CurrentGame.StartWithCurrentPlayer();      But the last method could require a second method like:               public void SetCurrentPlayer(Player player)     {         CurrentPlayer = player;     }
