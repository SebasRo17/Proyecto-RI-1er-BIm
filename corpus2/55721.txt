I have two linearly independent vectors $v_1$ and $v_2$. Is there a way for me using Mathematica to find two linear combinations $w_1$ and $w_2$ such that:   1. $w_1$ and $w_2$ are linearly independent.   2. If I cut $w_2$ in half and re-order the halves to get $w_2'$, i.e. $w_2=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\rightarrow w_2'=\\{4,5,6,1,2,3\\}$, then $w_2'=w_1$? $v_1$ and $v_2$ are chosen such that I am guaranteed $w_1$, $w_2$ exist.
