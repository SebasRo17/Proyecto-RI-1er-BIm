Let $G$ be an arbitrary graph with some number of vertices $||V||$ and some number of edges $||E||$. We can use `Subgraph` to generate, well, a subgraph of `G` with the vertices we desire. However, how can I use the `patt` option for `Subgraph` (or any method) to grab the set of `n` vertices with the greatest degree in $G$? In other words, if we make a list `Sort[VertexDegree[G]]`, how can we select vertices for the subgraph starting from the right-hand-side of the output list then working our way to the left?
