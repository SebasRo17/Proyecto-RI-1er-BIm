Most software developers want to keep application logic in the application layer, and it probably feels natural for us to keep it here. Database developers seem to want to put application logic in the database layer, as triggers and stored procedures. Personally I would prefer to keep as much as possible in the application layer to make it easier to debug and keep the responsibilities of the layers separate. What are your thoughts on this, and what should or should not be ok to implement in the database layer? **Edit** This question is also covered on dba.se, from the DBAs perspective. As programmers.se & dba.se have different audiences and biases, future readers might want to review both sets of answers before deciding what works best for them.
