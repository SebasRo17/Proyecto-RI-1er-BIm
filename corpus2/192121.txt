This isn't career advice, this is more of a question of logistics. When looking at job market and such there is a lower than what I think would be out there of database admins but I'm curious if database admins actually include strictly database developers, or of database developers are more under a blanket term "Programmers" or "Software Developers"? Like someone who enjoys programming SQL/Queries/Stored Procedures and such but probably knows some about settings a database up and such? Would this be under the DBA term or something else? (Since I haven't seen any reports for Database Developer in "job market forecasts" and such)
