In looking at various professional societies the AITP lead me indirectly to the ICCP Certified Computer Programmer certification (and others from the ICCP). I had never heard of this program, but both the AITP and, more significantly to me, ACM have members on the ICCP board. Is anyone familiar with this certification? The webpage isn't confidence inspiring to be honest, but looking at it the program seems aimed at those in the Fortune 1000 internal software world. Anyone ICCP certified in some way? Does it make a positive different for a career in software development?
