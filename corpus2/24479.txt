I want to execute several commands in one text file and use it in notebook by Get[] command. for example:               a=Plot[x^2 ,{x,0,2}];     b=ListPlot[{{0.327081,9.94393},{0.327081,0.102804}},Joined->True];     Show[a,b,PlotRange->All,,PlotLabel->hy]     a1=Plot[26x^2 - 19x,{x,0,3}];     b1=Plot[-2x^2 ,{x,2,3}];     Show[a1,b1,PlotRange->All,PlotLabel->sx]        I want to see both plots.But Mathematica run only last command in text file
