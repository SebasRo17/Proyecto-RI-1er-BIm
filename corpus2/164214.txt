What is the best way to write and run small scripts and tasks that are specific to a particular .Net project? Such things as configuring a database or confirming proper connections to servers. In Ruby, I would build rake tasks for this sort of thing. I am currently using unit tests for these tasks as they are easy to run within VS and they have access to all the necessary libraries and project code. However, this is not really their intended purpose and, with the dropping of Test Lists in VS 2012, it does not work nearly as well as it used to. Is there a better solution than writing a console project to handle these little code snippets I need to run periodically?
