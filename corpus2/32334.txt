I was trying to build a button to create a new document that contained a dynamicaly changing table. In the parent notebook i am using another kernel - not the usual "Local". The problem is that in the created document (using CreateDocument command) the kernel that uses seems to be locked at Local giving no results (or errors). Does enybody knows how the Created Document can use the kernel of the parent notebook ? Thanks in advance!
