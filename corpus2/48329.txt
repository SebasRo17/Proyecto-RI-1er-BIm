There are $100$ `.dat` data files which contain numerical parameters.               m={1,2,.....,34};     n={8,10,12,.....19};     l={67,68,69,...96}       and so on. I constructed a $100*100$ matrix with the code below:               xmatrixx = Table[0, {100}, {100}];     mflatten=Flatten[m];          Do[xmatrixx[[i, j]] = mflatten[[j]], {i, 1, 1}, {j, 1, 34}]];      But I want to put `n` and `l` and the other files in the other rows of the same matrix `xmatrixx`. How can I change the `mflatten` for obtaining `n` and `l`? All the Best
