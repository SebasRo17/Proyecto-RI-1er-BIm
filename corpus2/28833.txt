I bought _Mathematica_ home edition and installed it under Ubuntu. During an Ubuntu upgrade the power went out and wrecked the process. I installed Linux Mate Debian Edition and tried to reinstall _Mathematica_. It refused to license itself claiming that it had been installed on a 'different' computer. The MAC addresses are still the same. Wolfram does't provide support with Home Edition (though I think this is a bug) and suggested that I ask on this forum. Has anyone else bumped into this?
