As a electronic customer, I sometimes have to go to manufacturer's websites to find information about products, drivers/firmware update, etc. More ore less, most of these websites, IMO, are bad. They're slow, not user-friendly (some time, really ugly), and take me lots of time to do what I need to. For example, in Sony's website, I must find "Vaio laptops" in a list of dozens (may be hundreds) products, then find my specific model in a list of hundreds model. Fail! I also see that on several websites, they may be slightly better, but still not good (HP, Dell, Lenovo (somewhat better), ...) Well, they may be have a large back-end system there, but that does not mean they can make the frond-end faster and more user-friendly. Is there an obvious reason that large corporation's website are that bad?
