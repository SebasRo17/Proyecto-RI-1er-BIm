I have a WinXP based laptop with pretty basic hardware configuration by today's standards. I am planning to upgrade to a WinXP based laptop with a lot better hardware. The problem: My current laptop has truck loads of software like cygwin, perl, ruby etc. Installing each software manually is going to be pretty cumbersome. Not to mention customizing the packages. Is there any software (freeware or commercial, both okay) that can migrate my current programming environment with minimum fuss?
