I'm thinking of developing software for Ubuntu and other related Linux-based distros (like Linux Mint). But currently am at a loss for where to start. Would learning Python be enough/good? And what are the other things I should know about before starting this kind of developing? And will I be able to publish my apps to a software store like Ubuntu store even if I am from outside USA/UK? If not, what are the options I have to make my apps reach the audience? * * * As a lot of users had asked, I intend to build applications only for Linux (I'm thinking of Gnome) that will be a bit business and enterprise oriented. Currently I am an Oracle certified Java developer in J2SE and J2ME. And I know Python a bit.
