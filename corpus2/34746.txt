I have about 1,000,000,000 points, which are the longitudes and latitudes of some places in a city, formatted like this: $(106.1231233,41.43234234)$. I also have about 20,000 points which are the longitudes and latitudes of some special places in this city. For every item in the 1,000,000,000 point data set, I have to compute which point in the 20,000 point data set is the nearest. If I were to compute on a brute-force, one by one basis, it might not complete during my lifetime. Is there an algorithm which can make this job less time-consuming? Can anyone help me?
