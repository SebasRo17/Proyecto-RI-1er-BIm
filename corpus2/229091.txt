In my job as an algorithms developer, I am responsible not only for developing algorithms, but also for implementing them, all the way down to writing the code that goes into production. I've heard that there are companies where there is a separation between algorithms development and implementation. The algorithm people come up with the "concept", and don't write any code except for research purposes. Then there are programmers in charge of implementing the algorithms. At my company there are thoughts recently of hiring designated algorithm developers who will not write code, as described above. I am intuitively opposed to that idea, but I've never worked in such a place before, so I may be biased. Is this a viable model for software development?
