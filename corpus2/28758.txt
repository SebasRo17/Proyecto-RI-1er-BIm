I am having a hard time in Stats understanding some basic rules of probability and set-theory, namely $P(A|B)$, $P(A\ \textrm{and}\ B)$ and $P(A\ \textrm{or}\ B)$ where $A$ and $B$ depend on each other. I use _Mathematica_ all the time through my school, and I love to program in my free-time (sometimes writing small scripts for _Mathematica_ ). I can understand confusing subjects that deal with logic when they are in a programming language syntax, so I thought I could understand what's going on better if I had a written syntax to look at. Will anyone bother to help?
