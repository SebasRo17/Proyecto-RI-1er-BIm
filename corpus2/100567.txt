Is it correct to call a loop that you do not know the limit at compile time `"non-trivial"`? If you know that you will be using a value from a class that will be in a range e.g. between 0-1000, is that still non-trivial? e.g. Where ISomeInterface.MAX_LIMIT is always between 1-1000:               public bool someMethod(Type someType, int someId, int someVariable)     {         bool returnFlag = false;         int maxLimit = (Activator.CreateInstance(someType) as ISomeInterface).MAX_LIMIT;              for (int i = 0; i < maxLimit; i++) //is this a non-trivial loop?         {             if (_someSerivce.SomeOtherMethod(someType, someId, someVariable, i))             {                 returnFlag= true;             }         }         return returnFlag;     }      * * * **Edit:** Was uncertain as to whether this was a meaningful piece of terminology. I originally read it in one of Jon Skeet's pieces from yoda.arachsys: http://www.yoda.arachsys.com/csharp/stringbuilder.html (see the section headed _Rules Of Thumb_ ). Do you use this as technical terminology at all?
