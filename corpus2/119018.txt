To my way of thinking, a for loop is used to iterate over a known or determinable range.               String[] names = //something;     for ( int i = 0; i < names.length; i++ ) { //do stuff }      which is equivalent (scoping of i aside) to :               String[] names = //something;     int i = 0;     while (i < names.length )     {        // do stuff        i++;     }      In other words, the `for` loop is simply a (highly useful) syntactic sugar for a commonly used `while` construct. However, I'm seeing a lot of `for(;;)` constructs on the web which are functionally equivalent to `while(true)` What is the reasoning for this? Why would the infinite for loop be preferred over the infinite while loop? // I even saw a java textbook that didn't use while loops at all! Leading to such monstrous constructs as:               String input = getInput();     for( ; !inputIsValid(input) ; )     {        //redo;     }
