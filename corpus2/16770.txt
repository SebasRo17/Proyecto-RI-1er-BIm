I've entered the following functions into my notebook, but the solution to them contains #1's that I can't seem to make any sense of. The functions are:               z := R[r, t]     P := D[R[r, t], t]     eqn := P^2 - (2 x[r])/z - 2 y[r] == 0      sol = DSolve[eqn, z, t]      and the solution returns the following:               {      {R[r, t] ->        InverseFunction[-((Log[Sqrt[#1] y[r] + Sqrt[y[r]] Sqrt[x[r] + #1 y[r]]] x[r])/         y[r]^(3/2)) + (Sqrt[#1] Sqrt[x[r] + #1 y[r]])/y[r] &][-Sqrt[2]t + C[1]]},       {R[r, t] ->        InverseFunction[-((Log[Sqrt[#1] y[r] + Sqrt[y[r]] Sqrt[x[r] + #1 y[r]]] x[r])/         y[r]^(3/2)) + (Sqrt[#1] Sqrt[x[r] + #1 y[r]])/y[r] &][Sqrt[2] t + C[1]]}     }      Any thoughts on the matter?
