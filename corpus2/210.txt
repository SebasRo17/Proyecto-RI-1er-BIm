Take the following code:               p = {3, 3};     Graphics[Circle[{5, 5}, 5], Epilog -> Dynamic@Locator[Dynamic[p]],      Axes -> True, GridLines -> {{3}, {3}}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tLwho.png) Whenever I move the locator close to the original coordinates (marked by the grid on the plot), it quickly snaps back to them. This means that I am unable to position the locator at around `{3.25, 6}`. It will either snap to `{3.0, 6}` or to `{3.5, 6}`. (Please see the image, it is at `{3.5, 6}` there.) Is this a feature or a bug? If it is a feature, how can I turn it off? If it is a bug, how can I work around it? Note that I am using `Epilog` because the graphics in my actual problem are slow to compute/render (large `ListDensityPlot`).
