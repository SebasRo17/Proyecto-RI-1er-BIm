I am using two `For` loops. When the inner loop finishes, I don't want to print but I want to store the result from the inner loop in some variable so that I can call that variable in the future. That result will come in the form of a list. For example, in the 1st iteration,it is returning some value, e.g. {2,4}. in the 2nd iteration,it is returning {3,4}. But I don't want to print them every time. I want some variable to store {{2,4},{3,4}}. How to do that? Here I am retrieving all the data except Null.               tab={{{"option1", "option3", "option4", "optio", "Null",              "Null"}, {"option2", "option5", "option6", "option7", "Null", "Null"},               {"option", "op", "Null", "Null", "Null", "Null"}}};          For[j = 1, j <= Length[tab[[1]]], j++,       For[i = 1, i <= Length[Rest[tab[[1, j]]]], i++,          If[TrueQ[(Rest[tab[[1, j]]][[i]]) == "Null"], count++, count = 0]]      Print[     Table[Rest[tab[[1, j]]][[i]], {i,1, (Length[Rest[tab[[1, j]]]] - count), 1}]] ]
