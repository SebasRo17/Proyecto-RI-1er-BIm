May I ask what is the best way to evaluate               NSolve[{a^10 E^-a - b^10 E^-b ==         0, (362880 +             a (362880 +                a (181440 +                   a (60480 +                      a (15120 +                         a (3024 +                          a (504 +                          a (72 + a (9 + a))))))))) E^-a + (-362880 -             b (362880 +                b (181440 +                   b (60480 +                      b (15120 +                         b (3024 +                          b (504 + b (72 + b (9 + b))))))))) E^-b + 0.99 ==         0}, {a, b}]      I tried several methods but my machine refuse to produce anything. Is the computational complexity really this much?
