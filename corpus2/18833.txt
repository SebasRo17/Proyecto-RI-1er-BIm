> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Why does MatrixForm affect calculations? I am facing a strange behaviour from Mathematica when asking it to invert the following matrix:               m = {{a, b, b, 0, 0, 0}, {b, a, b, 0, 0, 0}, {b, b, a, 0, 0, 0},           {0, 0, 0, c, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 0, c, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, c}} // MatrixForm          Inverse[m] // MatrixForm      It doesn't output the inverse of the matrix but just the command I entered. But, knowing that my matrix is bloc diagonal, when I enter each one of the blocs separately it does compute their inverses. Where is the trick?
