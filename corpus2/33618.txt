How can I make _Mathematica_ output a fraction as `x/2` as opposed to the `x` on top with a horizontal bar and `2` on the bottom? Perhaps I need to work more with `Riffle` but so far I cannot get it. I have tried concatenating strings, but _Mathematica_ reverses the order of the two elements. Specifically, I am trying to put the symbol `theta` with a subscript `i` and then a division by `2`. It is going onto a figure, and is very difficult to read with the vertical division. My code is:               Do[       alabel[i] =         Text[StyleForm[Subscript["\[Theta]", i]/2, FontSize -> 10,                        FontColor -> Black, FontFamily -> "Times"],              {Re[ww[tt[[3]]]], Im[ww[tt[[3]]]]} + .2 {Cos[aloc3[[i]]], Sin[aloc3[[i]]]},              ioffset[i]]       , {i, 1, 6}];          th3 = Graphics[Table[alabel[j], {j, 1, 6}]];      (The coordinate `ww[[tt[[33]]]]` is just some point in the plane).
