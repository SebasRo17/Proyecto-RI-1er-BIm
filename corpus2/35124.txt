Consider a real, vector space $V$ with basis $B=\{v_1,v_2,\dots\}$, and let $\star:V\times V\to\mathbb R$ be a bilinear product on $V$. I would like to implement this product in Mathematica by specifying the action of $\star$ on pairs of basis elements, and by somehow "telling" Mathematica that the product is bilinear. More concretely, I will be specifying elements $v,w$ of $V$ as linear combinations of elements of $B$ \begin{align} v = \sum_i a_iv_i, \qquad w = \sum_i b_iv_i, \end{align} and I would like to tell Mathematica how to deal with products of any two basis elements; \begin{align} v_i\star v_j = \sum_k c_{ijk}v_k \end{align} by telling it how to generate the constants $c_{ijk}$, and then telling it that $\star$ is bilinear so that it can perform the following manipulation: \begin{align} v\star w &= \left(\sum_ia_iv_i\right)\star\left(\sum_j b_jv_j\right) = \sum_{i,j}a_ib_j (v_i\star v_j) = \sum_{ij}a_ib_j\sum_k c_{ijk}v_k\\ &= \sum_{i,j,k}a_ib_jc_{ijk}v_k \end{align} Ideally, I would like to be able to write something like this               Star[5v[3]+7v[6],14v[9]]      and have Mathematica output something like               2v[1]+5v[10]+7v[9]+11v[2234]      depending, of course, on the constants $c_{ijk}$ specified beforehand. I don't really have a sharp idea of how to approach this, any guidance would be greatly appreciated.
