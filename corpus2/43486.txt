I am trying to create a list of simultaneous equations showing steps, where I only need to change a, b and the question number, and maybe a couple of minor things about q (where q is the factored quadratic, and a & b are the integer factors). I am currently using:               a = -2; b = 1; q = 2 (a + x) (b + x);          q1 = Expand[q]; sol = x /. Solve[q1 == 0, x];     TraditionalForm[Grid[{{Grid[{{"2.       (1)      ", y, " = ",         If[Coefficient[q1, x, 2] == 1, "", Coefficient[q1, x, 2]], x,         If[Coefficient[q1, x, 1] > 0, "+", ""], Coefficient[q1, x, 1]},       {"          (2)      ", x y, " = ", , -Coefficient[q1, x, 0],         " ", " ", " ", " ", " "}}]},{Grid[{{"       ", q1, "= 0"}}]},     {Grid[{{"          ", Factor[q1], "= 0"}}]},     {Grid[{{"{x,y} pairs:  ", {sol[[1]],          Coefficient[q1, x, 2]*sol[[1]] + Coefficient[q1, x, 1]},         ",", {sol[[2]],          Coefficient[q1, x, 2]*sol[[2]] + Coefficient[q1, x, 1]}, " ",         " ", " ", " "}}]}}]]      which is a bit messy to say the least, but outputs: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/df4qn.gif) not too far from the desired effect of: $2.\quad\ \ \ (1)\quad \quad y=2x-2\\ \qquad \ \ (2)\quad \quad xy=4\\ \qquad \qquad\ \quad \ \ 2x^2-2x-4=0\\ \qquad \qquad \quad \ \ 2(x-2)(x+1)=0\\ \{x,y\}\text{ pairs: }\{-1,-4\},\{2,2\}$ though I should probably have used a table in my $\LaTeX$! I am sure there is a better, more efficient way of doing this though. Things I would like to improve: better spacing, automatic numbering, randomly chosen integer (or fraction) factors, random `x` sign changes, etc. (Basically a self-generating work/answersheet.) # Update OK, I have replaced ubpdqn's top line with               q = RandomChoice[Join[Range[-5, -1],      Range[1, 5]]] (RandomChoice[Join[Range     [-10, -1],  Range[1, 10]]] + x)      RandomChoice[Join[Range[-10, -1], Range[1, 10]]]     + x);     q1 = Expand[q];     sol = x /. Solve[q1 == 0, x];     eqn = {y == Coefficient[q1, x, 2] x -      Coefficient[q1, x, 1],      x y == -Coefficient[q1, x, 0]};      which generates question using random numbers, but have tried putting this into a table with `n` number of questions & just outputs same question `n` times :/ I suppose copy & paste will have to do for now...
