I'm developing software for about 10 years. I began on QBasic and now I'm developing .NET using C# language. I'm always trying to follow the best design patterns and principals like SOLID. In short I'm very happy with my work while as a tiny ISV I'm free to choose between technologies. Of course we almost develop mid-size web applications for start-ups. Although I'm moving to MS open stack more and more (Ex. MVC, EF, etc.) and I've also tried Mono, _I feel tied to MS_. I seriously want to break this vendor lock-in situation. I want to be able to develop Windows and Web application using a strongly-type open and free (at least more free) language using the best software practices which is more vendor independent. I think I have no choice except Java. Then;   * What is the best way to start breaking this situation?   * Should I migrate to the Java platform? (I know it cost me a lot)   * Then how can I start?    * C# is an amazing language. Some of its features do not exist in Java (LINQ, real generics, async/await, etc.)! How can I get to that?
