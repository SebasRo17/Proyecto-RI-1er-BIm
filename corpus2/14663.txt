I have a matrix: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/omnrx.png) I would like to sum all the first non-zero elements of each row so that I get a value of $$25.5317 + 8.85471 + 6.90018 + 32.9436 + ... $$ and so on and simply ignore zero rows. Similarly I would like to do the same again for the second non-zero elements from each row so that I get: $$29.1235 + 11.0472 + 41.2639$$
