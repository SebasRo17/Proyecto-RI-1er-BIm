I am trying to plot a solution to the heat equation $u(x,t) = \sum_1^\infty \frac{8(-1)^(n+1)}{\pi^2 n^2} \sin(n \pi x) \exp(-n^2 \pi^2) $ I am using the following from another answer here on Mathematica. I am trying to plot it from x=[0,1]. I am trying the following, but it does not seem to produce a plot               f[x_, t_, nm_] := SUM[(8 (-1)^(n + 1)/(Pi^2*n^2))*Sin[n* Pi *x]*Exp[-n^2 Pi^2*t], {n, 1, nm}];          Plot[Table[f[x, t, 150], {t, {0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 10}}] // Release, {x, 0, 1, 0.05}]
