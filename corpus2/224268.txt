The Microsoft Reciprocal License (here taken from the WIX toolset I use) has the following sentence: > For any file you distribute that contains code from the software (in source > code or binary format), you must provide recipients the source code to that > file along with a copy of this license Does that mean I have to provide the source code even if I only use the unmodified (original) DLL in binary format? Note that this unmodified DLL contains code from the software, although it was not compiled by me. What does _provide_ mean? Shall I provide 11 MB of source code as part of my application (install the source on hard disk) or can I provide it as an extra download as well?
