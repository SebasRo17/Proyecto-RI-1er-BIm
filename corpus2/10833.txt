I think this is a basic question, but I am having difficulty finding the answer in the documentation. `Thread` is not what I am looking for, I think. Suppose that I have a function `f` that takes an unspecified number of arguments: **f[a, b, c, ...]** , defined by a declaration like `f[lists__] := ...`. Suppose that I have an argument list `{a, b, c, d}`. How can I obtain `f[a, b, c, d]` from `{a, b, c, d}`? Thanks.
