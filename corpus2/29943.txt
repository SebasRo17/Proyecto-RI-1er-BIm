I am new to _Mathematica_ , so it's probably a small error but I can't figure it out. Here is the code :               DialogInput[{TextCell["Choose your folder:"], InputField[Dynamic[x]],        FileNameSetter[Dynamic[x], "Directory"],        DefaultButton[DialogReturn[x]]}]      When I click on the browse button, nothing happen. Then, when I click on OK, the file system browsing window appears.
