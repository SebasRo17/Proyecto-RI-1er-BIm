I have two sets of x,y coordinates, and want to plot them both on the same graph. With one set, List1 $= \{ \{ x_1, y_1 \}, \{ x_2, y_2 \},\{ x_3, y_3 \}, \cdots \}$ I can use `ListLinePlot[List1]`. But with a second list, List2 $= \{ \{ u_1, v_1 \}, \{ u_2, v_2 \},\{ u_3, v_3 \}, \cdots \}$ I assumed I'd be able to use something like `ListLinePlot[List1,List2]`, but this seems reserved for when the lists have only one of the coordinates: $\{ x_1, x_2, x_3, \cdots\}$. The data in `List1` has to be connected via a line, as does the data in `List2`, but they mustn't be joined together (i.e. I can't amalgamate them into one list). Anyone know how I can plot both sets on the same graph?
