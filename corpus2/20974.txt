I am looking for a way to iteratively select all sublists with the same ID (my 1st column, residual columns are `AbsoluteTime` entries). First, I obtained the list of unique IDs with `Union`. Then I want to use this list for the selection task. I assume that it must work with `Sequence` and `ReplaceAll`, but could not make it work. Here's what I have so far:               ticketList = Union[dataList[[1 ;;, 1]]];     tempList = Select[dataList, #1[[1]] == x &] /. x ->  Sequence[ticketList];      My ultimate goal is to build up a `TemporalData` array with all items which each belong to the same ID. My data is has dimensions `n x m`. The ticket list has dimension `t`. The resulting table should have dimensions `t x i x m`, where `i` is the cardinality of items with the same ID, and the `i`'s sum to `n`. I assumed, that I can then map `TemporalData` on every `t`-th item in order to build the temporal list. I searched the site but didn't find a previous question that seem to address my problem. Maybe I misunderstood the use cases of similiar questions.
