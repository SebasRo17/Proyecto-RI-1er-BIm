Working with big files, I have to convert some numbers that are in string format into real MMA numbers. I know that I can use `ToExpression` but it's slow when compared to another forms. For instance, for Integer case we can compare:               dataInt = ToString /@ RandomInteger[1000, {10^5}];     d1 = FromDigits /@ dataInt; // AbsoluteTiming     d2 = ToExpression /@ dataInt; // AbsoluteTiming          {0.050298, Null}     {0.475669, Null}      It's almost 10 times faster to use `FromDigits`. The question is, how can I make a equivalent for Real cases? Like:               dataReal = ToString /@ RandomReal[1000, {10^5}];     d1 = someFunction/@dataReal;//AbsoluteTiming     d2 = ToExpression/@dataReal;//AbsoluteTiming      I haven't found some Mathematica function to `someFunction`. I miss one way to force `ToExpression` to interpret the string in some specific way.
