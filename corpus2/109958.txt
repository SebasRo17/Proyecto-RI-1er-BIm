A quick and dirty definition of User Story:               "As a <role>, I want <goal/desire> so that <benefit>"      In this commonly accepted definition there is little space for defining business rules, constraints or user input. Trivial example just to illustrate: > >     As a <librarian>, I want to <register new books> so that <students >   > > can find their availability online> In this silly example, where would one define the fields needed when registering a book? Should it be written anywhere? Or should the required business rules be passed as word of mouth by the Product Owner?
