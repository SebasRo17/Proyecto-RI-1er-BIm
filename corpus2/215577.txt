In my web app framework, each page can have a precondition that needs to be satisfied before it can be displayed to the user. For example, if user 1 and user 2 are playing a back-and-forth role-playing game, user 2 needs to wait for user 1 to finish his turn before he can take his turn. Otherwise, the user is displayed a waiting page. This is implemented with a predicate:               def precondition(self):         return user_1.completed_turn      The simplest name for this API is `precondition`, but this leads to code like `if precondition(): ...`, which is not really obvious. Seems to me like it is more accurate to call it `precondition_is_met()`, but not sure about that either. Is there a best practice for naming methods like this?
