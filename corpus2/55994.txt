I am writing a SOAP based ASP.NET Web Service having a number of methods to deal with Client objects. e.g:   * int AddClient(Client c) => returns Client ID when successful   * List GetClients()   * Client GetClientInfo(int clientId) In the above methods, the return value/object for each method corresponds to the "all good" scenario i.e. A client Id will be returned if AddClient was successful or a List<> of Client objects will be returned by GetClients. But what if an error occurs, how do I convey the error message to the caller? I was thinking of having a Response class:               Response { StatusCode, StatusMessage, Details }      where Details will hold the actual response but in that case the caller will have to cast the response every time. What are your views on the above? Is there a better solution? ---------- UPDATED -----------   Is there something new in WCF for the above? What difference will it make If I change the ASP.NET Web Service to a WCF Service?
