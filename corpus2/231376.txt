Take for example this input array:               [2,7,1,4,9]      For this input, I need to produce an array of total 23 elements which contains two elements of 2, seven elements of 7, one element of 1, four elements of 4 and nine elements of 9. Example of output array:               [2,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,4,4,4,4,9,...]      However, this array **needs to be ordered in the way that minimizes the number of same elements appearing next to each other**. The example of such array would be something like this:               [7,2,9,4,9,1,7,...]      The primary goal is to minimize the number of the same adjacent elements. Secondary goal is to distribute elements unbiased across resulting array if possible. Any pseudo code or C#, java, ... would be helpful.
