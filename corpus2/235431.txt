I saw this in code and was wondering if there is any performance benefit to checking the item count prior to looping:               if (SqlParams.Count > 0)         foreach (var prm in SqlParams)             cmd.Parameters.Add(prm);      I always prefer to do a `null` check instead and let the `foreach` loop just hop out if there are `0` items.               if (SqlParams != null)         foreach (var prm in SqlParams)             cmd.Parameters.Add(prm);      Isn't that the better way?
