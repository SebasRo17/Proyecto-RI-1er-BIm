As I get it, domain events imply loose coupling and separation of responsibilities. That's fine. But if domain events are allowed to cross aggregate's boundaries then it is a question how to guarantee that all concerned entities are materialized from persistence storage? For now it looks like events can only bubble through aggregate to the root or be handled by services triggering in-transaction scripts. In the letter case I believe the targeting specifics of the event is lost. Again and again My questions arise from the fact that the whole model does not live in the memory.
