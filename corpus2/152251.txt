There are huge numbers of programmers, especially juniors, who need good assistance in becoming professional. I've heard a lot of about "books every programmer should read", etc. I have two years of programming experience, feel good in C++, but currently have a strange feeling, that I do not know anything about programming. I should read Algorithms by Cormen, Code Complete by McConnell etc., but I don't know the exact steps required to become a professional. What should we do? What should we learn? Operating systems? Computer organization? Algorithms? C++ in depth? How much time do we have to spend to become what we want?
