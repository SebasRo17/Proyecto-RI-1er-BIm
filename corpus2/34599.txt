First I want to solve an equation $F(x,y)=0$ for $y$ by supplying a value of $x$. (suppose obtaining the analytic form of $y(x)$ is too difficult) Then I want to plot root $y$ (numerically calculated) as a function of $x$ by using the following:               Plot[y /. FindRoot[.../.{x->x0},{y, 0.2}],{x0, 0, 1}]      and I got something like the following ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GsPIh.png) I omit `...` here since it is terribly complicated. **Update** : F(x,y) is of the form $\sum_{n,m}a_{m,n}x^ny^m$ and $m$ and $n$ can be as high as 19, which basically makes `Solve` impractical. The result is satisfying except a small number of points near 1.0. Setting another initial starting value of $y$ in `FindRoot` might be an option but it is very tedious and often I cannot find a value of $y$ that fits the whole range of $x$. My question is: suppose I stick with the initial value of $y$, is there a way to just eliminate that anomaly point after I `Plot` the numerical results? Or is there a better way to deal with this kind of numerical problem in general?
