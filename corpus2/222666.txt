I am making a WPF application following MVVM model. I have seen some approaches for applying MVVM. I am concerned about my MainWindow.xaml. In some tutorials I have seen that MainWindow is only hosting a ContentControl, and in some first main page of the application. I am making a wizard type application. There are multiple views with next and back buttons. There is one WelcomeView which is going to be the first view. So my question is that what approach should I use. My window should contain a ContentControl pointing towards MainView or I copy paste all UI elements from WelcomeView to my MainWindow and get rid of WelcomeView. Which is more suitable? What are Pros and Cons of each approach?
