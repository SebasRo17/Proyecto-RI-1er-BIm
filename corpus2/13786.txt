I'm stuck here with my variable assignment in this scenario               AntennaPower[measure_, antenna_] :=       Module[{{x1, x2, sd1} = measure, {xa, ya} = antenna},       N[ sd1*(4*Pi*((xa - x1)^2 + (ya - y1)^2)/1000)]]          AntennaPower[{2000, 0, 1/2}, {5, 60}]     Error message is Module::lvset: Local variable specification {{x1,x2,sd1}={2000,0,1/2},{xa,ya}={5,60}} contains {x1,x2,sd1}={2000,0,1/2}, which is an assignment to {x1,x2,sd1}; only assignments to symbols are allowed. >>
