NDSolve in mathematica drives me crazy and I'm seriously thinking about switching to Matlab because of strange bugs I run into.               ClearAll["Global`*"]     NDSolve[{-(2/x) y'[x] -           y''[x] - (2 Z/a0 1/x - L (L + 1) - Energy)*y[x] == 0,         y[350] == 0, y'[350] == -.0001}, y, {x, .01, 350}] // Flatten     y[1] /. %        Clearly this should be _unsolvable_ by mathematica because I haven't even defined L or Energy. But for some reason, I'm getting an interpolating function as an output, even after I've cleared all my variables! What on earth is going on!? I've been having issues trying to find the wavefunctions for the radial part of the schrodinger equation in mathematica, so additionally, if there are any physicists out there, your help showing me a working numeric integration of the radial part of the schrodinger equation would be greatly appreciated. My full code is:               SolverThingy[n_, L_] :=       (        Rydberg = .5;        En = -1*Rydberg/n^2;        Z = 1;        r0 = 2*n*(n + 15);        rfinal = .5;             solr =          NDSolve[{y''[x] + (L (L + 1)/(2 x^2) + Z/x + En) y[x] == 0,             y[350] == 0, y'[350] == -.0001}, y, {x, .01, 350}] // Flatten;        sol = y /. solr;             int = Integrate[Evaluate[sol[y]*sol[y]], {y, .01, 350}];        (*Normalization*)        normd = 1/int*sol[x]        );     Plot[Evaluate[SolverThingy[10, 1]], {x, .1, 350}, PlotRange -> All}]      For some reason this is NOT the same solution as the analytic solution for the radial equation. And I can't figure out why it doesn't work.
