> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Is Python worth learning? Is it a useful tool? Recently I have seen some videos from MIT on computer programming topics. I found it's really worth watching. Especially the concepts of algorithms and fundamental stuffs. The programs were written and explained in Python. I never had looked into this language before as I learned and doing stuffs with C/C++ programming. But the cleanliness and better readability of syntax attracted me. Of course as a C++ programmer for long time it's the most readable language for me. Also I heard Python library contains solid algorithms and data-structures implementations. Can you share your experience in this language?
