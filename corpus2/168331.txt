Basically, we undid history. I know this is bad, and I am already committed to avoiding this at all costs in the future, but what is done is done. Anyway, I issued a git push origin <1_week_old_sha>:master to undo some bad commits. I then deleted a buggered branch called release(which had also received some bad commits) from remote and then branched a new release off master. I pushed this to remote. So basically, remote master & release are clones and just how I want them. The issue is if I clone the repo anew(or work in my current repo) everything looks great....but when my co-devs delete their release branch and create a new one based off the new remote release I created, they still see all the old junk I tried to remove. I feel this has to do with some local .git files mistaking the new branch release for the old release. Any thoughts? Thanks.
