This answer by @paw have revealed a bug that causes Mathematica v 10.0.0.0 to crash the GUI and kernel. So far the offending code is this:               Needs["QuantityUnits`"]     table = Keys[QuantityUnits`Private`$UnitReplacementRules];          Panel[DynamicModule[{f = ""},        Column[{Text[Style["Mathematica Unit Search:", Bold]],          InputField[Dynamic[f], String, ContinuousAction -> True],          Dynamic[Union@Flatten[StringCases[#, f ~~ ___] & /@ table] //            TableForm]}]]]      This creates a dynamic panel and the crash happens when pressing "panel format" in the suggestion bar. The bug has been confirmed so far only on M10 under Windows 7 64 bits. My skills are not enough to reduce that code to a minimum working example that reproduces the crash, nor I have available Mathematica under other OS. So I'm both reporting the bug and asking:   1. What would be a minimum working example of the crash?   2. Does this crash also in other platforms? The Wolfram Technical Support identification code is: CASE:1566616
