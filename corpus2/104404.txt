We are using ASP.NET MVC 2 with a Controller/View Presentation Layer and Model consisting of A Business Logic Layer, Data Access Layer [Stored Procedures and classes/methods to talk to the stored procedures]. In the business layer and above for most purposes Edit seems to be capable of representing both the creation of an object and the editing of an object. This coincides well with our Repository Design Pattern that defines a "Save" method. We can simply check in the stored procedure if the ID is 0 and then create a new object if it is 0 otherwise we can just update the existing object, since the category id should match one. **The primary point of discussion is if it makes the most sense to split Edit that includes Creation into it's separate parts of Create and Edit beyond the DAL layer.** An obvious example can be shown as routes: _Create_ - http://someurl/somearea/edit/0 _Edit_ - http://someurl/somearea/edit/254 **vs.** _Create_ - http://someurl/somearea/create _Edit_ - http://someurl/somearea/edit/254 **Are there any established standards or best practices in regard to this?** I know this is a small detail, but I think it's logistically an important one.
