I'm trying to ilustrate the difficulties in assigning bins to a data set and then running a comparison of the bins against a binomial distribution for all values- n, p. The code I have so far is (mostly thanks to Nasser):               Manipulate[Show[Histogram[dataB, {-0.5, 7.5, c}, "PDF"],        DiscretePlot[PDF[BinomialDistribution[n, p], x], {x, 0, 20},         PlotStyle -> PointSize[Large]], ImagePadding -> All],       {{c, 8, "Column Width"}, 0, 4, .1, Appearance -> "Labeled"},       {{n, 7, "Number Of Quarters"}, 1, 20, 1, Appearance -> "Labeled"},       {{p, 0.5, "Fair Coin Toss"}, 0, 1, 0.01, Appearance -> "Labeled"}]      The remaining problem, scaling the number of quarters in the binomial to the width of the X axis. Right now my X axis ranges from 0 to 7.5 in agreement with the range of the numbers in my data set. I think I need two X axes. One to illustrate the range of the numbers in my data set. And a second X axis to illustrate the number of quarters in the binomial ensemble (1 to 20). That's what I think. @Nasser
