I learned to program in C many years ago, and used C steadily for about 10 years. These days, I occasionally have to look at C code, because our Informix 4GL RDS customized runners also contain C code, but it is fairly simplistic code. When I was using C a lot, I never remember hearing about of flexible arrays. I am asking this question, because I came across this SO question. Thanks.
