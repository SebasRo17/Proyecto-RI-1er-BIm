## Background: I was writing some code. It looked something like this:               class X     {         private List<int> _myList = new List<int>();         public void MyMethod(int x)         {             _myList.Add(x);         }     }      R# suggested that I make `_myList` readonly. I wasn't so sure, as though I technically could make it readonly, I think it would be slightly confusing to do so, as I'm still modifying the list, just not reassigning it. So while I could make it readonly, I'm not sure if I should. ## Question: Should I make variables like this readonly? **Why?** If not, why does R# suggest this?
