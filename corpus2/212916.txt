In his famous The Free Lunch Is Over article from 2005, Herb Sutter predicted a Concurrent Programming Revolution as big as Object-Oriented Revolution. Has this revolution really happend in years 2005 - 2013? * * * Key points in the article:   * Processor manufacturers have run out of room with most of their traditional approaches to boosting CPU performance. Instead of driving clock speeds ever higher, they are instead turning to hyperthreading and multicore architectures.    * Applications will increasingly need to be concurrent if they want to fully exploit CPU throughput gains.   * “Oh, performance doesn’t matter so much, computers just keep getting faster” statement will be wrong.   * Efficiency and performance optimization will get more, not less, important. Those languages that already lend themselves to heavy optimization will find new life; those that don’t will need to find ways to compete and become more efficient and optimizable. Expect long-term increased demand for performance-oriented languages and systems.   * Programming languages and systems will increasingly be forced to deal well with concurrency. We desperately need a higher-level programming model for concurrency than languages offer today.
