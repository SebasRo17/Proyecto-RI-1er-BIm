Can I depend on wikipedia to learn data structures fully using the list of data structures http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures and the links they refer to? The same question for algorithms http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_algorithm_general_topics ?... What's after learning algorithms and data structures? Specializing in a certain field of algorithms such as computer graohics, memory management...etc? or what could be the plan for mastering programming after knowing the language syntax and the background about program design and programming logic? I asked about wikipedia because i would like to find a complete resource or are least a resource which would be enough for the field of data structures instead of searching for separate articles in different places in other words an alternative to books which may even be more complete.
