I've have two event queues(table mapped queues) based on two different states of same data stored in two different tables. The events are generated on create/update/delete on both the tables. Constrain is that both the tables have to be in sync. The create/update/delete in one table has to be reflected into other table. So the question is that should i use trigger to queue events in table or application/object to queue events in table? and Why? Note:   1. Update on either is capable of generating 3 different types of events. So on application layer extra diff logic would be required to generate correct event.   2. The Negative thing in trigger is that it will introduce duplicate events from both sides. i.e. if some event is processed on one table it will create an event for processing on other table.
