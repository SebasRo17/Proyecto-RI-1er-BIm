I am trying to minimize the sum of squares of a deviation from the mean applying the following:               Minimize[Sum[(Subscript[x, i] - \[Mu])^2, {i, 0, n}], x]      It returns the expression, but I was expecting it to return an answer similar to the one below               Sum[Subscript[x, i], {i, 0, n}]/n      which is the sample mean. Is this kind of minimization possible in _Mathematica_?
