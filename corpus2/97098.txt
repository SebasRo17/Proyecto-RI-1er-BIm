I have keen interest in design patterns. I have been reading a lot about them. Specially, from HEAD FIRST. Can I write about design patterns in my resume? I am a fresher. Going to sit in on-campus placements. Though I think that would impress the interviewer if i am able to defend his questions but, on the other hand I think there can be three points I am worried about:   1. He might ask too deep questions to show me that I have written a wrong point.   2. He might not know about design patterns.   3. Besides he may ask of design patterns that are not in Head First.   4. he bounces on J2EE design patterns, which I am afraid to study right now. Anyways, what i am asking is. do the people who come to on-campus placements for taking interviews have any knowledge about design patterns? If they do, then how much. I am a bit afraid to put this on my resume.
