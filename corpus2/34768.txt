There are so many frameworks for writing GUI application using Python. But is there any one key standard framework? For example we have a bundle of .NET/C# on Visual Studio. I am thinking in other perspectives also. In future if I give an interview for a Python programmer job, which GUI framework will be considered? I also wonder, there is no IDE that integrates the GUI and Python language. Choice of flavor is good but over-choice becomes a distraction.
