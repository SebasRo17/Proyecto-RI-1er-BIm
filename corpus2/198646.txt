In Fred Brook's Mythical Man Month chapter 4 (Aristocracy, Democracy, and System Design) page 49, he says: > As Blaauw points out, the total creative effort involves three distinct > phase: architecture, implementation, and realization ... > > implementer has plenty to do ... designing module boundaries, table > structures, pass or phase breakdowns, algorithms, and all kinds of tools > > ...Meanwhile, on the realization level there is much to be done also. > Programming has a technology, too.

What is the difference between implementation and realization? To me, architecture is related more with specification descriptions or diagrams, whereas implementation is programming/coding which looks like the same as realization.
