I just started with _Mathematica_. I need it for many purposes, but the important one is to read a text data file and extract column values as variables. I have successfully tested the tab delimited data format. Now I have a problem with a file with this format: > 15 lines of comments with spaces and blank lines   >  7 col and 100 lines: Col haves headers.   >  The above is repeated after 3 blanks lines. Any comments and suggestions are welcome
