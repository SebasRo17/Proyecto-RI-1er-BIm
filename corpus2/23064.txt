As most people agree, encouraging developers to make fast code by giving them slow machines is not a good idea. But there's a point in that question. My dev machine is fast, and so I occasionally write code that's disturbingly inefficient, but that only becomes apparent when running it on other people's machines. What are some good ways to temporarily slow down a turbocharged dev machine? The notion of "speed" includes several factors, for example:   * CPU clock frequency.   * Amount of CPU cores.   * Amount of memory and processor cache.   * Speed of various buses.   * Disk I/O.   * GPU.   * etc.
