I can't figure how to draw a line with `PolarPlot`. A vertical line through a is $r \cos(\theta) = a$, so               PolarPlot[a/Cos[theta], {theta, -Pi, Pi}]      works. A horizontal line through b is $r \sin(\theta)=b$, so               PolarPlot[b/Sin[theta], {theta, -6, 6}]       works. (Using `{theta, -Pi, Pi}` doesn't work because of dividing by $\sin(0)=0$ I guess.) How do I draw a radial line with $\theta = \pi/3$? Should be a line with slope $\tan(\pi/3)$. Can it be done with `PolarPlot`? I guess not since you have to give a function of $r$.
