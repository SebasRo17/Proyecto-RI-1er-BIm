I know NoSQL isn't nearly as mature, but it's been about a year or so since I've kept up with anything recent. Is it still "the future", are companies moving towards this, or are they still stuck in relational land? Obviously each has it's pro's and con's, and a lot of companies software is built around the traditional RDMS, but is the general direction moving towards a NoSQL solution? Also what about Jobs? I have experience with C++/Java and have always been interested in databases, I only graduated about 9 months ago with my B.S. in Comp Science, and it's something I'd like to pursue (however I'm only knowledgeable on traditional RDMS). What would be the wisest thing for me to concentrate on at this point?
