I'm putting together a Demonstration which utilizes a function which operates on a (manipulated) `String`, and I'd like the `InputField` to be of the form `InputField[col,String,FieldSize->3]`. Using the default format gives something like this:               Manipulate[col, {{col, "AB"}}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0fpbT.png) which requires use of quotation marks. I'm able to hack the function to take expressions and convert them to strings               f[column_String] := column     f[column_] := ToString@HoldForm@column      but then the `InputField` looks strange for `I` or `E`: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pMITU.png) I found another possible workaround on MathGroup:               col="AB"     Manipulate[Grid[{{InputField[Dynamic[col], String, FieldSize -> 3], f@col}}]]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Rtkkr.png) However, this requires pre-initializing `col` and messes up multiple `Manipulate` instances. Is there a way to have `Manipulate` assume that what's entered in an `InputField` is a `String`?
