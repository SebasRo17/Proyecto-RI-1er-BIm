I have a script with a long loop and very long formatted outputs like the following example code:               Do[Print[Style[Table[RandomReal[], {30}, {15}] // MatrixForm, Blue]], {10000}]      In order to display all the output in the desired format and save them into `*.nb` or `*.pdf`, at least 2GB memory is needed, which exceeds the available upper limits of x86 OS. How can I export the formatted results immediately into a `*.nb` or a PDF file so that the code does not demand so much computer memory?
