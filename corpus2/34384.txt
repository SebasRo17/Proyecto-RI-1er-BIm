Ultimately the goal is to make a manipulate command and turn a line into a circle. So I am supposed to take a line that is segmented into 12 equal lengths.               M = {{1, 0}, {2, 0}, {3, 0}, {4, 0}, {5, 0}, {6, 0}, {7, 0}, {8,      0}, {9, 0}, {10, 0}, {11, 0}, {12, 0}, {13, 0}};     Graphics[{Thin,      Line[M, VertexColors -> {Red, Blue, Orange, Green, Red, Blue,       Orange, Green, Red, Blue, Orange, Green}]}]      Then there is the circle               L = {{1, 0}, {Cos[Pi/6], Sin[Pi/6]}, {Cos[(2 Pi)/6],      Sin[(2 Pi)/6]}, {0, Sin[Pi/2]},  {-Cos[(2 Pi)/6],      Sin[(2 Pi)/6]}, {-Cos[Pi/6], Sin[Pi/6]},   {-1,      0} , {-Cos[Pi/6], -Sin[Pi/6]},    {-Cos[(2 Pi)/6], -Sin[(2 Pi)/       6]}, {0, -1},   {Cos[(2 Pi)/6], -Sin[(2 Pi)/6]}, {Cos[      Pi/6], -Sin[Pi/6]}, {1, 0}} ;          Graphics[{Thin,      Line[ { L   },      VertexColors -> {Yellow, Red, Blue, Orange, Green, Red, Blue,       Orange, Green, Red, Blue}]}]      Now I am trying to merge the two. I noticed whenever I start of with the line command I can't get it to work with manipulate.               Manipulate[Thin,      Line[ Plot[{{1, 0}, {2, 0}}, {x, 0, 3}], {a, 0, 2 Pi}  ]      So now I am not sure how to go about the problem since I can't even begin on it. Should I just use the equation of a line? That doesn't seem probably given the question **If you take a fraction f of a final vertex and a fraction 1-f of the corresponding initial vertex, and vary f between zero and one, you will find that a shape evolves from the initial shape to the final shape. Construct a Manipulate[] function with a slider that varies f that shows your straight line curling up into a circle.** Which makes me think that I need to have the individual vertices's in. Please help, thank you
