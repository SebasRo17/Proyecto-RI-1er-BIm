I want to compile the following function which takes a matrix variable.               ClusterFind =      Compile[{{Inte, _Real}, {Matrix}},      Map[If[Last@# == Inte, Take[#, 4]] &, Matrix], CompilationTarget -> "C",     RuntimeAttributes -> {Listable}, Parallelization -> True];      Here `Matrix` is a $m\times n$ matrix of real,integer or complex numbers. I also would like to know if it is possible to compile without knowing the dimension of the variable matrix beforehand. Can the `Matrix` in the above example be of `PackedArray` data type? **UPDATE** Thanks for the suggestions. I found the following compiled version most efficient as far as speed is concerned.               ClusterFind =      Compile[{{Inte, _Real}, {Matrix, _Complex, 2}},      Take[Select[Matrix, (Last@# == Inte) &], All, 4],      CompilationTarget -> "C"];      BR
