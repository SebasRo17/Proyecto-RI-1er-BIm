I have an app with the following three tables   1. Email (emailNumber, Address)   2. Recipients (reportNumber, emailNumber, lastChangeTime, status)   3. Report (reportNumber, reportName) I have a `C#` application that uses inline queries for data selection. I have a select query that selects all reports and their Recipients. Recipients are selected as comma separacted string. During updating, I need to check `concurrency`. Currently I am using **MAX(lastChangeTime)** for each reportNumber. This is selected as maxTime. Before update, it checks that the               lastChangeTime <= maxTime. --//It works fine      One of my co-developers asked why not use `GETDATE()` as “maxTime” rather than using a `MAX` operation. That is also working. Here what we are checking is the records are not updated after the `record selection time`. Is there any pitfalls in using `GETDATE()` for this purpose?
