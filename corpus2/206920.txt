Do `Areas` in ASP.NET MVC end up being a help or just a drag in the end (because of the URL construction)? Would it be better to have subdirectories inside the main Controllers folder? or are there any other options to organizing a project? _**EDIT_** For example, this is your average link without Areas:               @Html.ActionLink("Home","Index","Home")      and this is your average link with Areas:               @Html.ActionLink("Home","Index", new { Area = "", Controller = "Home"})      Could the following work? (Main controller with subdirectories) ![Main controller with subdirectories](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6Y9N2.png) I'm just trying to find out if implementing Areas in a project is worthwhile, because I also read that it can be problematic when using Dependency Injection. And is there an alternative to Areas?
