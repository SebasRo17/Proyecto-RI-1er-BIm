I am reading _Clean Code_ by Uncle Bob. Because I am not a native-English speaker, I couldn't understand following statement: > Classes and objects should have noun or noun phrase names like `Customer`, > `WikiPage`, `Account`, and `AddressParser`. Avoid words like `Manager`, > `Processor`, `Data`, or `Info` in the name of a class. A class name should > not be a verb. As I know, none of the `Manager`, `Processor`, `Data`, and `Info` is a verb, isn't it? What is the actual point he want to emphasize?
