I'm investigating the cohomology of complex manifolds, and need to construct chain complexes, Mayer-Vietoris sequences etc. I use Mathematica for numerically tracing manifolds with geodesics, but haven't implemented any representation of cohomological classes, differentials and complexes. Has anyone used Mathematica in this area, or anything related to this (eg multidimensional topology)?
