Suppose I'd like to generate a table of integers:               Table[i, {i, 10}]      Great; now suppose I want only the integers that are even               Select[Table[i, {i, 10}], EvenQ]      This is fine for small things, but if I'd like to iterate over say $2^{n}$ things, only maybe $n$ of which will satisfy the predicate, it's a pretty terrible way to do it. Is there some good idiomatic way to do it? I could use a `Do` loop (I guess with `Append`ing?) but there must be a better way, right?
