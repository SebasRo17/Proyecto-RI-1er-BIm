So ... I'm a sysadmin. There are a number of instances where scripting would come in handy(mostly user management ... creating groups, assigning permissions, deleting expired accounts, etc), and I'd like to make a fullblown program. But I don't even know where to start. **Edit** A lot of comments made sense along the lines of "learn what you want to learn." So ... I need to figure out what I want to learn.   A: Is there no such thing as a "beginner" or "building block" language? It wouldn't be any easier to learn C# and move into C++ than it would to just go straight into C++?   B: How do I choose what to learn? I'd like to write a game for my first real project, if that helps narrow it down. (aside from "Hello world" ;) ) There are so many languages out there I don't know where to begin. I don't even know the real difference between C#/C/C++.   C: Once I _have_ picked a language, what's the best way to start learning it?
