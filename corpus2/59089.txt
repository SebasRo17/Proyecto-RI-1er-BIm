I want to convert a polynomial in "standard form" to Chebyshev form. Here's one way to do it:                     (* My polynomial *)           pa = Sum[a[i]*t^i,{i,0,5}]           (* "standard form" coefficients of Chebyshev polynomial of same degree *)           pb = CoefficientList[Sum[b[i]*ChebyshevT[i,t],{i,0,5}],t]           (* helper variable *)           bs = Table[b[i], {i,0,5}]           Solve[Table[a[i-1] == pb[[i]], {i,1,6}],bs]       This works, but is there a better (more efficient, more "Mathematica"-ish) way to do it?
