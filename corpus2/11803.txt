> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  How do I use Map for a function with two arguments? If I have a function:               F[x_,y_,z_]:=x*y*z      and I want to call it with several different x values using `Map` (and y and z fixed), is there a way to do that with a one-liner? That is, for these x values               xVals = {1,2,3,4}      I want to somehow get:               {F[1,10,100], F[2,10,100], F[3,10,100],F[4,10,100]}      If I can do it with Map, it would be great, because I have many cores and want to speed this up with the parallelized Map.
