In an interview with John Hughes where he talks about Erlang and Haskell, he has the following to say about using stateful libraries in Erlang: > If I want to use a stateful library, I usually build a side effect-free > interface on top of it so that I can then use it safely in the rest of my > code. What does he mean by this? I am trying to think of an example of how this would look, but my imagination and/or knowledge is failing me.
