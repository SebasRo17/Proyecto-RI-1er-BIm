Output from built-in _Mathematica_ functions often has this form (e.g. from `Solve`): > {1 -> {166., 254.214}, 2 -> {237.214, 254.}, 3 -> {121., 253.5}, 4 -> > {221.318, 251.682}, 5 -> {45., 246.}, 6 -> {125., 245.214}, 7 -> {166.5, > 244.7},...} How would I efficiently (without converting back and forth from a string) convert this to array of the form: > {{166., 254.214}, {237.214, 254.}, {121., 253.5}, {221.318, 251.682}, {45., > 246.}, {125., 245.214}, {166.5, 244.7},...}
