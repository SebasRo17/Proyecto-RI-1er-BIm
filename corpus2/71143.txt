I have an idea for an open source project. It's about building developing tools for software developers. Yet I have never joined a development team and now I don't know much about these teams except the fact that they exist ;) My questions are:   1. Is there c# open source projects team? Where?   2. How can I offer my idea / code   3. If the groups exist ... should I be the project manager in the sense of offering the scope , versions etc. or let others do it? I know that java and other languages are better starting point for open-source but... I feel more comfortable with C# and the vs developing environment.
