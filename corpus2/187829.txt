I have a question bugging me for some days. I made a webshop for a good friend of me. The problem is I have an OOP class question. People can buy some clothing in the shop. The problem arise how to show different information for different products? What I have now is the following:   * abstract Product class   * Cloth extends Product   * Trousers extends Product Problem is that trousers can contain extra information like:   * fiber type   * structure How can I show those information in the shop? I query for all products and receive the Product class with only the selling price and name? What is the correct way to figure out it is a trouser to show those information like fiber structure on the detail page?
