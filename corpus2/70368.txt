Incoming 10th grader here. I recently posted about a science fair project idea and someone suggested that I do "The Effect of Parallelism on selected computational tasks." I'm having difficulty figuring out what I should do for those "selected computational tasks." I've got about a year and a half of c# experience. I asked on freenode's ##programming and someone suggested I do Ray Tracing (http://65.39.148.34/KB/graphics/Simple_Ray_Tracing_in_C_.aspx). Any ideas for other easy-medium difficulty tasks that I could use in my experiment? Thanks.
