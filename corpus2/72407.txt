I've a simple question about the terminology used in the Delegate pattern; Let's say I create an object that will be responsible to download something from the Net and when it is finished, will call me back with the result. I guess we can call the downloader object the "delegate", since he is doing work on the behalf of my main object. If I'm right 'til here, then, I've a problem with the sample codes I read. The property in the Downloader Class is often named "delegate", and put to Self by the creator of this downloader. Am I wrong or it should effectively be called "delegator" instead ?
