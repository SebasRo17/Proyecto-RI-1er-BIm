So traditional scrum board looks something like this               Backlog       |       Story    notStarted   inprogress    Done     story 1               Story1   tasks            Story 2               Story2   tasks     Story ..     Story n     Epic  x     Epic  x+1      However in general a story has many scenarios and when working with BDD you want to write each scenario for a story as Given, when and then. Also the scenarios don't belong in the notstarted column, inprogess or Done as a scenario is not a task. So you realize that a scenario/s should have their own column between "story" and "notstarted", as a scenario can have many task to be considered done. If you are going to build your task from scenarios then why would you need the story on the scrum board in the first place, maybe they should be left in the backlog. Some people put scenarios on the back of each story. This is a on going debate in my team and I wanted to see if anyone has solved this differently. Cheers!
