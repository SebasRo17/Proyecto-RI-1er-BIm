I've been handed the ER diagram for a quite complex database. Complex to me at least, 849 tables. One of the architects says to understand the code, you need to understand the database and relationships. Now I am basically a Java programmer hence not too familiar with this How do I start? Should I start from something basic like USER or ORDER and see which relationships they have with other tables around them? Any tips or tutorials would help a lot
