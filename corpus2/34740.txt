I noticed the following difference               Assuming[x ∈ Reals, FullSimplify[D[Abs[2 x], x]]]          (* 2 Sign[x] *)          Assuming[x ∈ Reals, FullSimplify[Abs'[2 x]]]          (* Sign[x] *)      While it is clear that the first line of code above returns the correct result, I wonder why the call of `Derivative` fails? A little further investigation shows that               f[x_] := Abs[2 x]      f'          (* 2 Derivative[1][Abs][#1] & *)      which is correct and implies that the difference might come from with or without `SetDelayed`. But I still do not fully understand why the second code failed.
