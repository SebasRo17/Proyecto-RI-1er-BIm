I would like to know what do you think about persisting an "autocomputed property" to the database. For example I have these properties               decimal Price {get;set;}     decimal Tax {get;set;}     decimal PriceWithTax {get {return Price + Tax;}}      I think I need persist `PriceWithTax`. I can use this column, for example, in DB views. But I feel that this solution can lead to hidden bugs. What do you think? Edit: Ok, I try to explain our real problem. We have a class "Order" which has collection of items - class ItemOrders. Class ItemOrder has property Price and class Order has property TotalPrice. And implementation of TotalPrice:               TotalPrice {get { return ItemOrders.Sum(i => i.Price); }}      And we need sorting, grouping in the database. So its not a bussiness rule but a "data rule".
