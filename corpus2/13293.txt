I have some definitions in my `init.m`. E.g. my `init.m` contains this:               hex[n_]:=BaseForm[n,16];      I know that Mathematica puts this in the `Global`` context, and in a default configuration, each notebook's `$Context` is `Global`` and its `$ContextPath` also contains `Global``. So my definitions are automatically available in any notebook I create. However, I prefer the `CellContext->Notebook` option so each of my notebooks automatically gets its own private context. The problem is that this option (obviously) changes `$Context` to something other than `Global``, and it also removes `Global`` from `$ContextPath`. So my `init.m` definitions are not automatically available in any notebook I create. Now, I could type `Global`hex` when I want to use my `hex` function, or I could do `AppendTo[$ContextPath, "Global`"]` in each notebook. But I would rather have `Global`` added to each notebook's `$ContextPath` automatically. Is there a way to get `Global`` into each notebook's `$ContextPath` automatically? Or is there some other way I can make my personal definitions available to each notebook automatically while using the `CellContext->Notebook` option?
