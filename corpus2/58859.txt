I want to hire a programmer freelance to develop a small InDesign plugin, but I have no idea how to go about finding one. Most of the freelance bidding sites are garbage, but aside from finding a few companies from a google search I'm not sure where else to go. Are there any good sites for posting jobs or other good ways of finding a programmer to hire?
