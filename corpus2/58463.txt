First, set up the example `Dataset` from the documentation:               titanic = ExampleData[{"Dataset", "Titanic"}];      Why does this fail:               titanic[GroupBy[Key@"class"], <| "length" -> Length, "max" -> Max|>, "age"]          (* ... Part age is not applicable to {__Association}  ... *)      yet this re-expression of the query works:               titanic[GroupBy[Key@"class"], All, "age"][All, <| "length" -> Length,        "max" -> Max|>]      As do these modifications:               titanic[GroupBy[Key@"class"], <| "length" -> Length|>, "age"]      Strangely, Max doesn't work if substituted for Length above (bug?). Finally, this is not desirable but works without new key names:               titanic[GroupBy[Key@"class"], Query[{Length, Max}], "age"]
