I learned at school as well as I read everywhere else that a good development methodology needs conception and design before coding properly. That is not a new information even for a beginner programmer. However, I wonder if this a good advice because since I started developing in several programming languages I never succeeded to design and conceive everything since the start. I mean, I always melted design, conception and programming. Am I the worst developer in the world, or is the idea we learn at school just an old meaningless _religious_ dogma? How can we even conceive and design something we never experienced and programmed before? Is not that ridiculous? Does not programming lead the conception and design instead?
