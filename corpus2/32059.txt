**Prerequisites**   * some database (here, it's called sakila (mysql standard test db I think))   * a user (with password) that has access to that db (I'll use u:testuser/p:testpass) **Setup - minimal (?) working example** We call                Needs["DatabaseLink`"]      Next we shall use the wizard/connection tool to create a new database connection, like:               c1 = OpenSQLConnection[]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6Jw3z.png) (after creating the new connection, we use the wizard to connect right to the new connection; and obviously, we do **not** tick the "store password in plain text"). Next, we set up another connection:               c2 = OpenSQLConnection["test"]      where `"test"` is the name we used for above connection (we get prompted for the password). Finally, a third connection:               c3 = OpenSQLConnection[         JDBC["MySQL(Connector/J)", "localhost:3306/sakila"],          "Catalog" -> Automatic, "Description" -> None, "Name" -> "test",          "Password" -> "$Prompt", "Properties" -> {}, "ReadOnly" -> False,          "RelativePath" -> False,          "TransactionIsolationLevel" -> "ReadUncommitted",          "UseConnectionPool" -> False, "Username" -> "testuser",          "Version" -> 2.]      (this is exactly copy/paste from the .m file created by the wizard, using `OpenSQLConnection` instead of `SQLConnection`. You can check the `FullForm` of `c1` or `c2` to find its location, on MacOSX, standard: "/Users/username/Library/Mathematica/DatabaseResources/test.m"). And maybe a last one (choose `"test"` in the GUI):               c4 = OpenSQLConnection[]      **The Problem** Execute:               Cases[#, HoldPattern[Rule["Password", ___]], Infinity] & /@ {c1, c2, c3, c4}      > {{"Password" -> "testpass"}, {"Password" -> "\$Prompt"}, {"Password" > ->"\$Prompt"}, {"Password" -> "testpass"}} i.e., `c1` and `c4` (the connections I **opened** with `OpenSQLConnection[]` (without argument)) are sharing my password in plain text! **My Question** Is this a known behaviour? I was using `OpenSQLConnection[]` (using the GUI) frequently, am I doing something wrong? **Edit** See @Murta's answer for an example where the password is visible without using the GUI.
