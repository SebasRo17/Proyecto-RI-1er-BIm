I've searched for a solution to my problem a couple of days, and I didn't find one. Hope you guys can help me. I'm currently trying to solve some graph-theoretical problems. One of them is to find the maximum flow throughout a graph. I've managed to draw the graph in _Mathematica_ , and would now like to use the built-in function `NetworkFlow`. To do this I need to load the package `Combinatorica`, but that gives me problems with "shadowed" functions. I've tried to refer to them by their fully qualified names, e.g., `Combinatorica```NetworkFlow`, etc., but I still can't get it to work. I've pasted in some code which I hope will make it easier to see what I'm doing wrong:               Graph[{Kø -> Ro, Kø -> Pu, Kø -> Pa, Ro -> Ha, Ro -> Be, Pu -> Ha,        Pu -> Be, Pa -> Ha, Ha -> Be, Ha -> St, Ha -> Br, Ha -> Li,        Be -> St, Be -> Br, Be -> Li, St -> Br, St -> Li, St -> Par,        Br -> Li, Br -> Par, Li -> Par},       EdgeWeight -> {"2", "11", "8", "3", "5", "14", "11", "10", "12",         "12", "10", "10", "4", "4", "12", "4", "12", "11", "23", "16",         "10"}, VertexLabels -> "Name", ImagePadding -> 10,       GraphLayout -> "SpringEmbedding"]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HQfjj.png) Which gives me a nice graph. Below is the "real" problem:               Needs["Combinatorica`"]     Graph[{Kø -> Ro, Kø -> Pu, Kø -> Pa, Ro -> Ha, Ro -> Be, Pu -> Ha,        Pu -> Be, Pa -> Ha, Ha -> Be, Ha -> St, Ha -> Br, Ha -> Li,        Be -> St, Be -> Br, Be -> Li, St -> Br, St -> Li, St -> Par,        Br -> Li, Br -> Par, Li -> Par},       EdgeWeight -> {"2", "11", "8", "3", "5", "14", "11", "10", "12",         "12", "10", "10", "4", "4", "12", "4", "12", "11", "23", "16",         "10"}, VertexLabels -> "Name", ImagePadding -> 10,       GraphLayout -> "SpringEmbedding"]     Combinatorica`NetworkFlow[%, Kø, Par]      > During evaluation of In[28]:= General::compat: Combinatorica Graph and > Permutations functionality has been superseded by preloaded functionaliy. > The package now being loaded may conflict with this.
