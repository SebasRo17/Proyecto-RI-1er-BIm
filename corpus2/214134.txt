I'm struggling with a task as I was given to practice UML and use cases. The problem is that I should model computer version of a board game so I am unsure about a few things. obviously it does not matter if you play against the PC or another player, the actions are the same. The game is simply like tic tac toe. E.g. > Actor Player ---(Place a diamond)-----include---->(Check for a > row)---include-->(Swap players) But the game is played on the PC, so is Check for row really a use case? And the same with Swap players? Because the system would do that. On the other hand, if it was not, how could I continue?
