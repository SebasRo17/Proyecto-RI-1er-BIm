We have been using Hosted SVN + Fogbugz for our source control and task/issue tracking. Our developers are very comfortable with SVN and we are hesitant to switch source control (e.g. TFS) providers at this point. However, Management extensively uses Microsoft Project for project management and are considering setting up MS Project Server. **EDIT** With SVN + Fogbugz (or several other task tracking tools), we can create a post-commit hook to update tasks (close/reopen/specify time) from commit messages. Does anyone know of a way to intergrate MS Project Server with SVN? Is it even possible? I searched online but could not find anything. Maybe I did not search correctly?
