Been building a WP7 app and now I need it to communicate to a WCF service I made to make changes to an SQL database. I am a little concerned about security as the user name and password for accessing the SQL database is in the App.Config. I have read in places that you can encrypt the user name and password in the config file. As the username and password is never exposed to the clients connected to the WCF service, would security in my situation be much of a problem? Just in case anyone suggests a method of security, I do not have SSL on my web server.
