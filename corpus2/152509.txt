Some background: I'm employed at a small, Australia-based web agency that is dipping it's toe into Mobile Application development (iOS). The project that I'm working on provides a way for users to save medication dosage information which is sync'd with a backend server. Users must agree to ToS, Disclaimer etc before using the application. This is my first iOS application, and the project is currently over budget. As a result, management is not devoting the resources to Q&A and is pushing instead for more features. I am an employee of the agency, that has been contracted by a non-for-profit. The application will probably be released under our agency's name, but we also have the option of releasing it as the not-for-profit. My question is, if there are bugs found in the application, and as a result a user takes an incorrect dosage of a medication, am I personally liable? Is there anything that I can or should do in order to protect myself personally?
