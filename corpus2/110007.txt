I'm developing a website using Joomla and many other 3rd party plugins and also I want to make some custom components so I'm hiring some freelancer developers and few are an online companies they say located in UK or somewhere. After explaining them about the component's functionality and layouts they are requesting access to my website's FTP, Database, CPanel. In this case how I'm going to protect my website? What if they take my other code and make a clone site or something? Is there any ideas besides company contract?
