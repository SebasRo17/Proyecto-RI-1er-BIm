I have a list of Students that I should display to user on a web page in tabular format.   The items are stored in DB along with SortOrder information. On the web page, user can rearrange the list order by dragging and dropping the items to their desired sort order, similar to this post. Below is a screenshot of my test page.   ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/iPuhT.jpg) In the above example, each row has sort order info attached to it. When I drop John Doe (Student Id 10) above the Student Id 1 row, the list order should now be: 2, 10, 1, 8, 11. What's the optimistic (less resource hungry) way to store and update Sort Order information? My only idea for now is, for every change in the list's sort order, every object's SortOrder value should be updated, which in my opinion is very resource hungry. Just FYI: I might have at most 25 rows in my table.
