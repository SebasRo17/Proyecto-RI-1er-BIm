I've learned a rather succinct way to delete tagged cells using `NotebookLocate`, but I would prefer the notebook did not scroll to the selection just for a delete operation. How can I delete tagged cells without the notebook scrolling? Minimal example:               CellPrint[ExpressionCell[x^2, CellTags -> "oldcell"]];          Button["Remove old cell", {       NotebookLocate["oldcell"];       NotebookDelete[];     }]
