So someone peer reviewed my work, and he told me that I should always sign my commits and tags cryptographically. When asked why, he didn't know to explain it to me, and said "It's just a good thing to do". Trying to avoid an obvious chimpanzee scenario, why should I really? Are there really so many distinct advantages and no disadvantages? **What are the practical reasons which would make me want to sign every commit and tag I make?**
