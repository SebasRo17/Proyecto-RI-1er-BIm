For those of us in consulting OR settings where you bill your hours whats the consensus on this? Should a client be billed for a certain amount of the learning curve? Should your employer be picking up the tab on overhead? Should it be you yourself the developer? Or perhaps a combination of all 3? I am conflicted on this - I've heard it being said both ways - that a client (or project budget) should not have to include the inefficiency of a lesser experienced programmer. And again I've heard it being argued that people learn on the job so projects should include a certain amount of training budget. I usually find that I (and other devs that I work with) work off hours or weekends reading up on technology , design patterns etc, sometimes struggling with a small piece that may go beyond contingency budgets - so most projects that we work on take up a bit more of our un-billed time than whats budgeted. I thought I'd open it up to the Stack-exchange hive mind for more insight from folks with much more experience. I am going to post the same question on the Project Management StackExchange and look at the delta.
