I'm looking for the term that applies to a certain kind of filtering behavior. It's often used in webshop-like interfaces, where large amounts of data are filtered based on a selection of filter criteria. The most distinguishing feature is that _it's impossible to pick a filter criterium that leads to no results_ , as the filters that would do so are hidden with real-time updates. To see an example look at this boot finder section on the blue-tomato.com webshop. Is there a term for this kind of filtering?
