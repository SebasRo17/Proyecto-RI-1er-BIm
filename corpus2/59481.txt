I have a question regarding setting the frame margins of exporting .avi file. I want to make a short video of some pictures I import using Table:               table1 = Table[     [Show[Import[ToString[i] <> ".eps"], ImageSize -> Large], {i, 1, 100, 1}];      These pictures are all fine with 0 image padding, but when I try exporting them to video:               Export["1.avi", table1, ImageSize -> Large,      "FrameRate" -> 4],      And the video cuts them off, as if only showing a thin stripe of the whole pictures. I tried messing with ImagePadding, but that only puts the pictures in the video in the bottom left corner. Is there a way to show the pictures in the video at the center of the screen, when playing? Thank you very much.
