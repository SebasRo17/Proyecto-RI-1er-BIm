I've recently reviewed a resume for a very promising student who is not a native English speaker (I believe his native language is Bengali). His academic record has some gaps, too - he could use a couple of solid data- structure and algorithms type courses. Where would you advise this student to look, in order to find programming/training resources that are likely to be good quality, and in his native tongue? He is far from fluent, and has indicated that the language barrier is too high for him to try a course that's taught in English. Is it even possible for him to both study English and fill in the gaps in his training at the same time, or would you advise that he just do the two serially?
