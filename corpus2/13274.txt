I have searched stackoverflow (and comparable pages) for quite a while now (got redirected from there to this specialized stack), and I surrender. I am trying to evaluate an expression that is small in the end numerically.   Example:               Log[Log[Log[6^5^4^3^2^1]]]=12.9525...        WolframAlpha has no problem evaluating these values for (any/a very high) amount of exponents (I tried it up to 20). I guess it is possible to achieve this in Mathematica aswell? I tried Hold, Defer etc, as described in   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1616592/mathematica-unevaluated-vs-defer- vs-hold-vs-holdform-vs-holdallcomplete-vs-etc   Hoever none of these did what I hoped for. Is it a matter of explaining Mathematica the rules of logarithms?               FullSimplify[Log[x^b], x>0 && b>0] expands it nicely, however that is not what I want (I have explicit numbers). Is there any way to perform the calculations WolframAlpha performs with mathematica (obviously avoiding the WolframAlpha Output Operator ;)) ? Is there some Option/Assumption etc I have overlooked? * * * For this specific question there is a recursive algebraic solution: $$ n^{(n-1)^{...^1}}=e^{\log(n)*(n-1)^{...^1}} $$ and so on, remove a bunch of e-s at the end. I guess Wolfram|Alpha uses this. I would still like to know if theres a true Mathematica solution to this.
