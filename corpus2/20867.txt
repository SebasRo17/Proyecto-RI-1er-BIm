I'm trying to get _Mathematica_ to plot with units, but I'm having some trouble. Below is a minimal example of trying to plot `y = x`, where `x` is a quantity with units. Why does it only seem to work if the units are put directly into the plot function:               (*Define unitful constants*)     x1 = Quantity[1, "Volts"]; x2 = Quantity[2, "Volts"];     (*Try to plot, get an error*)     Plot[x, {x, x1, x2}]     (*But this works*)     Plot[x, {x, Quantity[1, "Volts"], x2}]     (*As does this*)     Plot[x, {x, x1 - Quantity[1, "Volts"], x2}]      There error message is > Plot:plln: Limiting value 1V in {x, x1, x2} is not a machine-sized real > number For reference, here's what I see when I run it ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/u0BPL.png) (View full)
