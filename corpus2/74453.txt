When it comes to very small projects (just a few devs), how effective are distributed version-control systems (e.g., git) compared to systems with a central repository? I like the idea of having a central repository because it seems much more elegant and organized. However, after watching Linus Torvalds's Google Talk, I have my doubts. Are all those benefits really noticeable with such a small project, though?
