Mathematica 10 crashes in the following (simple) situation:               FormulaLookup["gas"]      This command will produce a long list of possible formulas. Then I type the following command below the list (and not run it)               FormulaData[]      When I copy one of the formulas produced by the FormulaLookup command and paste it in the square brackets of the FormulaData command Mathematica crasches. It happens only if the formula list is very long (as in looking for "gas") and not always but almost always. Can someone check if that's a Mathematica bug or some specific problem with my machine? (I'm on windows 8.1).
