This is for Mac users only using MathService (MathService it seems, given that it was created back in 2004, is a power pc code and requires Rosetta to run on Intel). If I type a plot command in another application (in this case TextEdit): ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/w8REL.png) ...and then use Mathematica to evaluate that code within that application using MathService: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mWdMG.png) ...all works fine. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8CWOA.png) But the problem then arises when you want to print the document because the graphic is at screen resolution. Does anyone know how to use MathService to generate print quality plots within other applications? Also in MS Word it seem that only the "Evaluate to Text" service is available which (obviously) returns `FullForm` of the plot rather than the graphic. Why isn't "Evaluate to Graphic" available? Incidentally using Mathematica this way seems to allow multiple undos of kernel evaluations.
