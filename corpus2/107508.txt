I will be mentoring a team of high school students for the FIRST Robotics Competition, most teams here develop[ their robot software using C++. For many of the students on the team this will be their first introduction to programming. I wouldn't have chosen C++ for teaching programming to high schoolers (e.g. Python or Javascript would have been easier I think) but the choice is set. I want to teach them proper C++ (i.e. avoid a mixed C/C++ dialect, i.e. C+) but I don't want to scare them either with needless complexity. For that matter:   * Should I start using STL from day one, esp. `vector` or just stick with standard arrays? Arrays are easier to introduce but the pointer errors may be harder to catch.   * For I/O, should I stick to `cout`, etc. or do you think `printf` would be easier to learn?   * Are there any online resources for C++ that are suitable to use for such young learners? Thanks! **EDIT** : Thanks for so many excellent answers. In addition to _Accelerated C++_ , which is suggested by many people, I have found that _C++ For Everyone_ is an excellent text.
