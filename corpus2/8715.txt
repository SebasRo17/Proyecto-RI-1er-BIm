I have a graph where on my Y axis , I have price and on X axis I have period/time. My range on Y axis is from 10 (lower limit) to 200 (upper limit), so to draw the point on graph I need the Y position of the value for example if my price is 100.50 then how should I calculate Y position of this price . Example: If my upper limit point is (200,HeightOfGraph) that is P1, and the lower limit point is (0,0) is P2, so if height of graph is 100 so if the value is 100 it's y position will be 50 , but how should I calculate it , is there any formula to do this ?
