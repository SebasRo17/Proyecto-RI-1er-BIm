While designing web pages using php, are there standards that should be followed? For example suppose there are two pages. First page looks like this:               <body>     <div>     <?php include 'page2.php';?>      `page2.php` file looks like this:               <?php print 'some text';?>     </div>     </body>      Is such designing a standard practice? Does it affect search engine results?
