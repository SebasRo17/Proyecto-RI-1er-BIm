I am a software engineer engaged in some extracurricular projects outside of my main gig. I was considering hiring a developer on Elance to assist me. Ideally, we would be a collaborative team where I can review their code and our "days" would overlap by a few hours. Ideally, when that persons day is over, I could do code review and then take off where they left off. Has anyone attempted this? Would it be practical to use a Rackspace Cloud Server for this effort where when one developer was done they just saved a VM image that would be accessible by another developer? Our development environment will be ASP.NET 4.0 MVC 3.
