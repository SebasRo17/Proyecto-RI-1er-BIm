I am currently developing an Ajax chat application that uses PHP on the back- end. Some of the features it has right now are different types of users (admin/mod/banned), public and private rooms, commands, and announcements. I recently learned about unit/integration testing and it sounds like a good alternative to manually testing everything every time I release a new feature. How can I get started with adding testing functionality into my PHP application? BTW: The app uses long polling (where PHP holds the connection through usleep() and constantly queries the database until new information is returned) so I think that might be a problem when testing it.
