I'm looking for some implementation ideas to be able to have offline apps sync data to a central server. The server will be Sql Server 2008. The clients will download data from the server when internet access is available and will need to allow the user to make changes offline and then sync the changes back to the server when it becomes available again. The clients will come in multiple flavors ranging from Windows to Android, so whatever I use needs to be easily translated into multiple OSes. I have been looking at using Microsoft's Odata (odata.org) on the server. It looks to have some pretty neat features and appears to even partially support what I want (by means of a concurrency token) -- though I'm not sure how the logic would revolve around the use of this token yet, that's what I hope to get from this. So - my question is this: Is there a 3rd party tool or app that I can use on multiple platforms which can handle offline & sync scenarios? If not, can anyone provide me with ideas on how to implement logic for syncing data back to a server and handle things like conflicts, etc.?
