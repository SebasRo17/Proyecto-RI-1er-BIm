We have sprints of 4 weeks duration. What I have been doing is 3 weeks dev time and 1 week of pure manual/automated testing, stabilization and shipment assurance testing. How to manage TDD within dev time? In my previous experience writing tests and getting 80% coverage requires round about 50% of the development time. Following the same we would get only 1 and a half week of development which is not enough. My actual problem is how to allocate time for TDD? I want to make TDD a mandatory but with these it becomes really difficult for me. Do you think this is correct approach we are using or are we missing something and alter our approach to Scrum?
