I am currently facing a situation where I will need to obfuscate data for legal reasons (these are countrywide rules and not specific to me) I will still need to work with teams outside this area who will still need to access applications/databases for testing/deployment and so on, however the data must be fully obfuscated. What are your experiences of this scenario? e.g. Who owns what stage of the process, what access do the various parties have, how strong is the encryption, how do updates occur
