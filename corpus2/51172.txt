I did what I believe was a thorough search on this topic, but still ended up fruitless. Apologies if there is a trivial solution to this. Is there a way to group control objects together to form collapsible groups, much like cells in notebooks and the animation controls of manipulators? That is, the objects would form a group bound together, so that a click on a "plus" or an equivalent symbol would expand the group so that the objects can be seen and manipulated and another click would collapse the group again so that the objects are hidden. If not, is there another way to handle a large number of controls/graphic objects?
