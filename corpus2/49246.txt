I prefer a sans serif font in graphics, which I do by creating a style for "Graphics" in a stylesheet. However, this does not affect the style used by legend labels:               Plot[{x, 2x}, {x, 0, 1}, PlotLegends -> {"Times", "New Roman"}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/JT9NB.png) Is there any way to change the legend text style in the stylesheet, or can it only be done through the `LabelStyle` option?
