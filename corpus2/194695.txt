I'm looking for an online course that I can use to learn programming using Lisp (especially Scheme), from scratch. I didn't find anything similar on Coursera/Udacity - the only resource I found was on MIT Openware, but I'm not sure if its something that is tailored for an online audience, and also the fact that the lectures are based on the first edition which is not the one I have... I'm not looking for explicit video lectures - a set of good lecture notes, with exercises/assignments and if possible, an exam at the end would be great to get me started!
