I've been programming a new iOS app for about 5 months, and I'm pretty much on the final stretch. My team and I agreed to make the app more simple once we were at this point of the development process. This question doesn't really apply to a whole team (where there are people who do design for a living), but more about from a programmer's mind. I tend to dig into every little detail about a personal project, and figure out a way to create a feature for it as I'm sure most other programmers on here tend to do. While that's definitely not bad, it has to be controlled. So what I'm asking is what you all use as far as technique's and tools to help yourself keep things simple. Or in other words, how you control your programmer-type mind from not getting out of hand :P
