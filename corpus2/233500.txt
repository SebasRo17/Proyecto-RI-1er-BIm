I'm new to Javascript. I'm learning the concept of hoisting in Javascript.   Based on the Javacsript tutorials in Mozilla website, I came across this word `hoisting`. According to those tutorials, **variables in JavaScript is that you can refer to a variable declared later, without getting an exception**. But, my question is on what circumstances is it suitable to use hoisting in a client-side Javascript or why should we use hoisting in Javascript. What are its advantages.
