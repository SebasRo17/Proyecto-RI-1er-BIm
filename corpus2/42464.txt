I have looked at previous questions and I'm aware that this seems to be a known bug: _Mathematica_ giving inconsistent results for symbolic integrals done in different ways. The origins for the bugs seem to be varied. I'm having a hard time tracking down _where_ Mathematica is going wrong with this particular one, especially since I am explicitly assuming that all my variables ($L$ and $\rho$) are positive. I've played around with the assumptions without any luck. Here's my code:               $Assumptions = {ρ > 0, L > 0};          limits = Sequence[{ux, 0, L}, {vx, 0, L}, {uy, 0, ux}, {vy, 0, vx}]          N1 = Integrate[a1 = Exp[-ρ (ux - uy) (vx - vy)], limits];     N2 = Integrate[a2 = Exp[-ρ (ux - uy) (vx - vy)] (ρ (ux - uy) (vx - vy)), limits];     N3 = Integrate[a3 = Exp[-ρ (ux - uy) (vx - vy)] (ρ (ux - uy) (vx - vy))^2, limits];     N4 = Integrate[a4 = Exp[-ρ (ux - uy) (vx - vy)] (ρ (ux - uy) (vx - vy))^3, limits];          int1 = Integrate[4 ρ (a1 - 7/2 a2 + 2 a3 - 1/4 a4), limits]          int2 =  Simplify[4 ρ (N1 - 7/2 N2 + 2 N3 - 1/4 N4)] // Expand      Apologies for the large expressions but the particular simplifcations only happen when all four integrands are included with the correct factors. By comparing integrands it's easy to see that `int1` and `int2` are the same integrals. But for `int1` I get               (1 - E^(-L^2 ρ)) L^2      whereas for `int2` I get               L^2 - E^(-L^2 ρ) L^2 - (7 L^4 ρ)/4 + 7/2 L^4 ρ Log[L]      I know that the outcome for `int1` is correct whereas that for `int2` is incorrect. Any thoughts would be very welcome.
