This question is related to this other one I posted on Stack Overflow some time ago. There, in a beautiful answer, acl (with some unhumble editing done by me) showed that the derivative of `IntegerPart` is calculated numerically by a centered difference method of eighth order. If you read the help for `IntegerPart[]` you'll find: > Mathematical function, suitable for both symbolic and numerical > manipulation. At that time I assumed it was just a documentation (or program) bug. I revisited the problem today because I needed to solve an equation that can be tracked down to something like:               Reduce[IntegerPart@x == x, x, Reals]     (*     -> Reduce::nsmet: This system cannot be solved with the methods available to Reduce. >>     *)      So again, Mma's failure to "symbolically manipulate" the `IntegerPart[]` function is bothering me. And this time, the derivative calculation is not the issue. All these functions `{IntegerPart, FractionalPart, Ceiling, Floor, Round, PrimePi}` share the > Mathematical function, suitable for both symbolic and numerical > manipulation. legend in their help reference. Look at their derivatives:               f = {IntegerPart, FractionalPart, Ceiling, Floor, Round, PrimePi};     GraphicsGrid[      Partition[        Plot[{#[u], D[#[x], x] /. x -> u}, {u, -1, 3},             PlotLabel -> Style[Framed[Hyperlink[#, "paclet:ref/" <> #] &@ToString@#], 16,                               Blue, Background -> Lighter[Yellow]]] & /@ f,        2],       Frame -> All]      > ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OpUIg.png) Moreover, the help file for `NextPrime[]` doesn't state anything about its symbolic manipulation suitability, and the help for `HeavisideTheta[]` says: > HeavisideTheta can be used in integrals, integral transforms and > differential equations. and its derivative is evaluated as `DiracDelta[]`. When you plot these functions you get: > ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/yQMuy.png) So it seems that from the whole set, only `HeavisideTheta` is treated symbolically. However, when you try:               Reduce[HeavisideTheta@x == 1, x, Reals]     (*     -> Reduce::nsmet: This system cannot be solved with the methods available to Reduce. >>     *)      So the "symbolical manipulation" is not there (or so it looks like). So the question is: **What does it mean for a _Mathematica_ function to be "suitable for symbolic manipulation"?**
