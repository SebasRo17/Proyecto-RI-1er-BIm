I am a little confused at how best to visually model a space-based architecture (SBA) for presenting the system/software architecture design to a client. The goal of this modelling is to show:   * The major components of the system (e.g.: databases, server exposed API, client, server workers, client exposed API)   * Interactions between these major components   * Primary end-to-end workflows Currently I am thinking to use BPMN2 notation with swimlanes; and sequence & use-case diagrams in UML2 notation. Not sure if this approach is best, would be great to get some feedback :)
