At the moment I can find the limit of my transfer function as follows:               (5 4001.6`)/(5 4001.6` + (4 + s) (200 + s)) /. s -> 0      This works as I would expect and provides a final value of 0.961553 In this example my value of gain, k, is 4001.6` so re-writing the expression for arbitrary k would give:                  (5 k)/(5k + (4 + s) (200 + s)) /. s -> 0      I want to find a value of k that makes the result 0.95. To do this I was thinking about using a while loop. I thought the while loop could start with k=1, compute the limit, test to see if less than 0.95, and if not increment k by one, and perform the test again, until the correct value of k is found: This is what I have tried:                   k = 1; While[(5 k)/(5 k + (4 + s) (200 + s)) /. s < 0.95, k++]      However I get the error: "ReplaceAll::reps: {s<=0.95} is neither a list of replacement rules nor a valid dispatch table, and so cannot be used for replacing. >>" Any help would be most appreciated.
