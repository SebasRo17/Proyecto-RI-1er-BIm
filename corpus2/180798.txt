Note: after writing this I realize that this question is perhaps philosophical, but I'm interested in how the industry handles this scenario regardless. I have recently been working with a code base that is not yet as testable as it should be. I've seen some junior developers check in code that breaks use cases, which is usually identified by another developer a few days after the check-in. Assuming that we can't achieve code coverage yet, are there technical solutions for holding developers accountable for bad check-ins in addition to a non-technical approach; discussing the commit and having the dev address the issue in a new commit.
