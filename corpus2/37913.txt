I've been given the opportunity to provide a question bank for nontechnical recruiters to ask candidates. However, all of my favorite interview questions require somebody who knows the subject matter to properly evaluate the answer (eg. how would you design X, How do you feel about Y). I'll probably need to have a combination C#/.Net questions and more general programming questions, and the tricky part is they all need to have answers that the recruiters can confirm without understanding them. Any thoughts?
