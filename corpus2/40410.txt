Changing the x-axis is fine and it will allow me to do so. When I want to change the y-axis (2D vertical), an error occurs. It appears as if the mathematica plot is missing some of the graph data. Is there a way in which I can increase the limits to which the y-axis run? Like you add {x, -Pi, Pi} to determine the interval of the x-axis, I have tried similar with replacing x with y or x with the function definition. Code Example: `Plot[{Sign[x] - f6[x]}, {x, -Pi, Pi}, {y, -0.5, 0.5}]`
