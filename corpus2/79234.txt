I have been using netbeans for many years now and recently I have moved from PHP/Git/Netbeans to C#/TFS/VS10. It has been very good so far, yet I miss this one little feature I enjoyed so much in Netbeans is... **local file history**. Whenever I was working on something I could test different ideas and then simply reverting or even comparing changes at different time of the day or even different days. I was wondering if there is any VS10 extension or some sort of plugin that would let me achieve similar functionality (internal version control sort of thing). _I would use TFS but we are only allow to check in our changes when they are actually read for production. Also I can't find revert changes button in TFS. I wouldn't want to create a branch either._ I'm so desperate I was going to put hg or git over my TFS folder just so I can achieve this I'm just hoping there is some better solution for this.
