On the Wikipedia page for Windows, it states the Windows is written in Assembly for the bootloader and task switcher, and C _and_ C++ for kernel routines. IIRC, you can call C++ functions from an `extern "C"`'d block. I can get using C for the kernel functions so pure C apps can use them (like `printf` and such), but if they can just be wrapped in an `extern "C "` block, then why code in C?
