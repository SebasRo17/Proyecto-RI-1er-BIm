Such details are driving me crazy while creating GUIs with _Mathematica_ :               Panel[       Panel["", Background -> Yellow, ImageMargins -> 0, ImageSize -> {26, 26}]       , Background -> Black, Alignment -> Center]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Izw2y.png) Margins above are symmetric in vertical and horizontal direction, let's say I want to take control and specify `FrameMargins`:               Panel[       Panel["", Background -> Yellow, ImageMargins -> 0, ImageSize -> {26, 26}]       , Background -> Black, Alignment -> Center, FrameMargins -> {{1, 1}, {1, 1}}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/i2ewJ.png) Now clearly they are not. I used `1` because then it is easily seen but the value does not matter. Am I missing something? **Edit** With `Framed` it seems to be ok, but one have to add `FrameStyle->None`.
