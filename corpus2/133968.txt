I am new to programming, and at an interview I got a question on regular expressions; needless to say I couldn't answer. So I was wondering whether I should learn regular expression? Is it a must for every programmer of all fields? Or it is a must for programming for some particular fields? Related questions:   * Why are regular expressions so morbidly attractive?   * When you should NOT use Regular Expressions?
