I am a student who just ended my high school last year. I will be entering college any time between march to August. And.. I am thinking of studying Information technology/System as my course in college. The problem is, I am unsure if this is the right path for me. I don't know if this is what I really want for my future later on! Yes, I do love learning more about computers (prefer software to hardware). But what if I don't find them interesting later on when studying? I'm worried about that as I don't wanna regret later on. To add to that, my knowledge of programming and other software development is actually quite low. Can someone advise me on what should I do? Or tell me more about Information technology (what will I study later on in college and the career path)?
