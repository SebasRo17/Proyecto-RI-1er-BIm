I am a software developer with 8 months of experience in the IT industry, currently working on the development of tools for BIG DATA analytics. I have learned Hadoop basics on my own and I am pretty comfortable with writing MapReduce Jobs, PIG, HIVE, Flume and other related projects. I am thinking of taking the exam for the Cloudera Hadoop Certification. Will this certification add value, considering that I have less than 1 year of experience? Many of the jobs I've seen relating to Hadoop require at least 3 years of experience. Should I invest more time in learning Hadoop and improving my skills to take this certification?
