I have a `Grid` (or `TableForm`) object like this `Grid[{{Ins, Outs}, {a, b}, {c, d}, {e, f}}, Frame -> All]` ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nFp9q.png) that I would like to "incrementally reveal" (within a `Manipulate`) in the sense, for example, that one row at a time is revealed with each click of the `Manipulate`. The part giving me trouble is that I want to "fill in" the table from _bottom to top_ , while maintaining the (final) header cells and grid lines throughout each incremental reveal. I started out by filling the yet-to-revealed entries with white space (until they are revealed). This is fine for small tables like this, but I also need it to work for tables with dozens of rows so I am seeking something more systematic. Any hints/tips/nudges would be appreciated. **Edit:** To clarify, the desired behavior is like this:               one = Grid[{{Ins, Outs}, {, }, {, }, {e, f}}, Frame -> All];     two = Grid[{{Ins, Outs}, {, }, {c, d}, {e, f}}, Frame -> All];     three = Grid[{{Ins, Outs}, {a, b}, {c, d}, {e, f}},        Frame -> All];      Manipulate[{one, two, three}[[i]], {i, {1, 2, 3}}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wJoTH.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/MMmel.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/owg6U.png)
