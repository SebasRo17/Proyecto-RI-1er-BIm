Have a very large project more than 70k LOC. The project definitely needs some code refactoring in Core Framework and in other parts as well. There was NO time set in the beginning of the project for refactoring. However with time and more than 40 developers joint and left the project. From my perspective is indispensable. What would be your key points in arguing and defending a proper software development principle?
