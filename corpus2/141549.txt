I'm building a web app and I need a JS framework like Backbone.js to work with my backend provided by Rails that mostly return JSON objects after DB queries. Searching on the web I've discovered Backbone which seems to be complete, quite popular and actively used in development but I've noticed that a lot of things done by Backbone are simply a duplicate of the work done by Rails: for example, validation and models. My idea of "perfect" (for my actual needs) JS mvc (it can't be called mvc but I don't have a better name) is something really simple that has a function for each action in my Rails controller that is triggered by a specific event (user/hash changes, click on a button...) and sends requests to the server that respond with a JSON object then I'll load a template or execute some JS code. **Do you have any concerns about/suggestions for my idea?** **Do you know of some "micro" js framework like what I have described?** **If you have worked with backone.js + rails what can you suggest to me?**
