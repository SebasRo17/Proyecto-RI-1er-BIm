I was told once that the best place to work as a developer is a company where the software you write is what makes the company money, whether it be software production or software services like consulting. This is opposed to a company where the software you write is just to support some other part of the business that makes the money, like manufacturing or finance. I know there are always exceptions, but in general, are employees treated better if they are on the front lines of profit generation, as opposed to being just another cost center? **cost center (n.)** - A cost center is part of an organization that does not produce direct profit and adds to the cost of running a company. Examples of cost centers include research and development departments, marketing departments, help desks and customer service/contact centers.
