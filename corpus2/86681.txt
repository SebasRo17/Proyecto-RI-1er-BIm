I'm learning Ruby on Rails for a new project of mine. I am referring the book 'Agile Web Development with Rails' which shows how to build a shopping cart and they use scaffolding. I'm pretty familiar with MVC architecture and have used several frameworks in PHP to build applications. I've never used scaffolding and I'm not sure if that's the best way to start building an application. Experienced users, please suggest if I should be using scaffolding or should I code manually.
