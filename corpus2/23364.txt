To me it seems these are two different platforms that address similar enterprise(but not only) problems. I'm interested however in problems that Java can solve better than C#/.NET or C#/.NET can solve better than Java. Leaving aside the 'cost' factor, since that is somehow not an issue for big enterprise companies (the developers probably cost more than the licenses from Microsoft - it's just a thought) and even for small projects there are free/open-source tools for .NET so the cost can be zero for the .NET world as well. With Mono, you can port .NET to Linux and MacOS as well so the benefit that Java had(cross platform) isn't THE decision factor to use Java nowadays.. What real world problems can you think of where .NET would be a much better solution than Java, and vice-versa? I'm only interested in solutions to problems.
