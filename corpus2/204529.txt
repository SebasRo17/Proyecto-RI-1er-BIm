We currently have 5 scrum teams that work off their own product backlog for the past year. Each team works on their own dedicated system but underlying technology is the same .Net. There has been a lot of discussion on moving to feature based teams working off a single backlog. The reason is one of our main systems has a significant amount of work coming and their is not enough capacity to deliver all the work in the year. The other reason which I believe is the significant one is it gives greater flexibility to adjust to changes in the portfolio rapidly. A decision been made to change two teams to work on a single backlog but the devs don't have experience on the other systems. One thing we're doing is cross-skilling by moving an experience system developer over to the team. My question is, have you experienced moving to single backlog for two or more different systems. What were your challenges? What did you need to do to get it to work?
