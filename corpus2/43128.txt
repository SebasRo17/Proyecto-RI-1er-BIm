In his last comment on this answer, halirutan shows an example in which the third argument of `Compile` does not have any effect. The example is as follows.               cfu = Compile[{}, Module[{y = {}}, AppendTo[y, 1]], {{y, _Integer, 1}}];     cfu[]      Outputs > >     {1.} >   rather than `{1}` Does anybody know an example where using the third optional argument of `Compile` does have an effect?
