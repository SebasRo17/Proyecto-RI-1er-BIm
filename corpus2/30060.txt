This question is an update and a correction my earlier question: Linear interpolation of a list between periodic anchorpoints (which was nicely answered). Imagine I have a list of the form:               list = {1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,7};      Where we can see that there are an ordered set of integer or real numbered values that repeat themselves some fixed number of times N. Is there a nice one-liner to transform this list into something like:               modifiedList = {1,1+1/3,1+2/3,2+1/3,2+2/3,3,3+1/3,3+2/3,4,5,6,7}      Where each time we see a new value we place an anchorpoint, and then "fix" the points in the array between these anchorpoints so that they lie on a line between successive anchorpoints?
