I am trying to write a code which learns a data set. Now, I want to know the input value for a given output value. Consider, the following code               trainset = {{1,2}, {2,4}, {3,6}}     fn = Predict[trainset]      Now I want to solve for m               Solve[fn[m] == 5, m]      Is there any way to find value of `m`, other than plotting the function looking for the input value which gives `5`.
