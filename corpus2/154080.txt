We are crawling and downloading lots of companies' PDFs and trying to pick out the ones that are Annual Reports. Such reports can be downloaded from most companies' investor-relations pages. The PDFs are scanned and the database is populated with, among other things, the:   * Title   * Contents (full text)   * Page count   * Word count   * Orientation   * First line Using this data we are checking for the obvious phrases such as:   * Annual report   * Financial statement   * Quarterly report   * Interim report Then recording the frequency of these phrases and others. So far we have around 350,000 PDFs to scan and a training set of 4,000 documents that have been manually classified as either a report or not. We are experimenting with a number of different approaches including Bayesian classifiers and weighting the different factors available. We are building the classifier in Ruby. My question is: if you were thinking about this problem, where would you start?
