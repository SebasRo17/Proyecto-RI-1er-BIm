Does anybody have suggestions on creating a flowchart representation of a REST-style web interface? In the interest of supplying thorough documentation to co-developers, I've been toying around in dia modeling the interface for modifying and generating a product resource: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tSwye.png) This particular system begins to act differently with user authentication/resource counts, so before I make modifications, I'm looking for some clarification:   * Complexity: how would you simplify the overall structure to make this easier to read?   * Display Symbol: is this appropriate for representing a page?   * Manual Operation Symbol: is this appropriate for representing a user action like a button click? Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated. My apologies for the re-post. The main stackexchange site suggested this question was better presented on programmers.
