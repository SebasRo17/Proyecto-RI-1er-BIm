There is a feature that has already passed acceptance testing, both internally and by the customer. It is a fully working feature. However, there is now a request to exclude this feature from an upcoming release. According to the customer, this feature should be removed because the users have not been trained on how to use it. What is the best course of action to handle this situation? Should we design software in anticipation that a feature might be excluded last minute using configuration settings? Are there context-dependent solutions that might be more correct in some situations than others?
