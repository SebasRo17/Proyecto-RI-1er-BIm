When Microsoft presented .NET Framework and C# language in 2002, what was the first article to introduce C#? I'm looking for some paper published on MSDN or Microsoft website that would explain the need for another language, talk some background and maybe have some code samples. Also, I'm interested in the original C# introduction, not in a generic .NET Framework document. I remember that early .NET papers were rather foggy and while it is a fair share of fun to re-read them, I aim for a language-centric document.
