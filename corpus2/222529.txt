I am doing a research on this and can't find my answer to this question: > Which interface allows you to use a design pattern that is > characteristically changed with the instantiation of objects? \- in PHP I am studying for an exam on php programming and from the theoretic I can't find an exact answer. I found something related to `Creational Design Interface` and `Factory Interface`, but don't know which one.
