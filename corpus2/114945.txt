I'd like to open source a project of mine under GPL v3. Additionally, I'd like to sell a license for those who wish to use the code in a proprietary application. How do I go about releasing my source code under GPL v3, while also reserving the right to release it under another license of my choosing? Do I still put the GPL header at the top of each of my source files? I'm rather new to the legal side of software.
