I have several DAO classes that implement an interface. In the other hand, I have Service classes that use those DAO implementations. So far all the DAO interfaces are public and I was thinking if would it be better to make them package private and to put the service classes in the same package so they are the only ones being able to use them. The reason is because I wouldn't like that programmers could use DAO implementations in a Controller or a web service without using the service layer. A programmer could think for example that adding a new order is as simple as calling the addOrder dao method, ignoring that indeed there is a service method that does more than that. What do you guys think?
