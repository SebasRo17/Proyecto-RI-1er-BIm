I try to understand why should I "try" a method to catch errors. It looks to me like the concept is: "letting a process run assuming its not properly developed". Should I always assume that a program based on classes and inheritance is bound for unexpected errors, which I should handle with tools like try catch and throw? Should all Java programs be included within try catch framework?
