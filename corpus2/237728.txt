I don't consider myself a highly skilled javascript developer, but I thought I got one thing right for sure: don't create global variables unless you really have to. I've been learning `angularjs` lately and discovered one strange thing, almost everywhere in code samples for angular you can find constructions like the following.               'use strict';          /* Controllers */          var phonecatControllers = angular.module('phonecatControllers', []);          phonecatControllers.controller('PhoneListCtrl', ['$scope', 'Phone',       function($scope, Phone) {         $scope.phones = Phone.query();         $scope.orderProp = 'age';       }]);      Source: official example app https://github.com/angular/angular- phonecat/blob/master/app/js/controllers.js So I assumed I might be missing/misunderstanding something. Any thoughts except "since it's demo code, they don't care"?
