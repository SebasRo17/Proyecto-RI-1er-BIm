According to: Something similar to Objective-C categories in other languages? Static extension methods in C# are `basically the same thing` as Objective-C categories, so I'm going to lump these two features together in asking: Are these techniques the same as traits? Also, can these language features be used to solve problems that typically would be solved with Multiple Inheritance? And, if so, specifically how do they avoid the pitfalls of Multiple Inheritance?
