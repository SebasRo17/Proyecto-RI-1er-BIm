Is it possible to create an automated program that will visit a web page every day? I'd like to make it run in the background (preferably non-visibly) when my computer loads and I have internet connection and navigate to a specific web page. I would think it would be pretty simple, but I'm not sure what language I'd use or what means to do it. Is it possible and by what means could I do it? **Edit based off of comments below** The only functionality the program would need to have is to 1. check to see if it's logged in and 2. log in if it's not. I'd only be using Windows. I'm interested in using existing programs or creating a program myself (for the experience). I'm a noob when it comes to using OSes and machine-based programming (I'm a web guy). Essentially I just thought it'd be a cool thing to create and good practice to learn more OS/offline programming Added thought: I'd also like to make sure it runs once per day, when it turns on (if it was off) or at a specific time if it's been on, but somehow check to see if it's been ran earlier in the day sometime
