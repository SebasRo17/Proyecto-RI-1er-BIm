I have created the picture displayed below, with the following line of code:               Colors = List[Brown, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Pink, Purple, Black];         Show[Table[            Plot[Part[list, i, 2]*Prob[Part[list, i, 2]*n] /. {y -> a,               z -> Part[list, i, 3]}, {n, 0, 3},             PlotStyle -> {Thick, Part[Colors, i]}], {i, Length[list]}],           PlotRange -> {All, {0, 1.2}}]      The array list just contains sum numbers of the form { {a,b,c}, {c,d,e}, ...} and Prob is just some function, with constants y and z which I specify in the above. There are a few questions I have concerning this code: -Note that the axis of the graph appears to lie above zero. I would like to make a graph with its x axis really at y=0. How to do this? -I would like to give every graph in the picture a different label, which is stored in Part[list, i,2]. However, I have two problems: PlotLegends gives an error and I only know how to include text between " ", not a number which is determined by the running of the do loop.  Any help is very much appreciated! ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/iInR3.png)
