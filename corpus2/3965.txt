I am looking to `Import` HDF5 data with compound data. It appears, at least from what I read, that Mathematica 8.0.4 (and previous versions) does not support reading HDF5 with compound data.               file = "someData.h5";     Import[file, "Data"]     Import[file, {"Datasets", 1}]      Returns:               {{"Unsupported Datatype Class", "Compound"}, ... }     Import::h5type: "The datatype of the dataset "\foobar" is not currently supported. "      It has been a while, since Oct 2011 when Mathematica HDF5 and compound arrays was last updated. It was update with info about Scot Martin's HDF5 package. Unfortunately that package appears be a solution for Windows which uses two .Net dlls (hdf5dll.dll and HDF5DotNet.dll) and I have a Mac. Just wondering if there has been any progress? I have looked at using h5dump to create an ASCII file and writing an importer. However there is the overhead of writing the file, reading it, and then parsing it.
