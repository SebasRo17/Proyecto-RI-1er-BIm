My first main language was Java. However, over the years I've dropped Java in favor for Python, JavaScript, bash, etc. I still have advanced reading knowledge of Java, but since I haven't coded in it for so long, my writing knowledge is intermediate at most. The other day, while looking at some old code written in Java, I got inspiration to re-write it as a learning experience to reacquaint myself. It was at that point that I stopped to think that if I wrote this in Java, it would be nice, but when the renewed inspiration had hit me, I wanted to implement it as a web app (it was a game), so other people could play it. So now here's the dilemma: Do I re-write (and heavily refactor) the code I've previously written in Java, and _then_ in JavaScript (for the web version), or do I just forget about Java altogether and re-write it in JavaScript? EDIT: I have no problem writing in Java first and then JavaScript, but I'm more likely than not going to need Java anymore for a long while. What I'm trying to ask is whether or not I should rewrite the old code in Java first, to practice a skill I may not need in the future. The actual languages are less important than that question.
