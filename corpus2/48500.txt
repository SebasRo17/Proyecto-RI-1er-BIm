In the documentation for `GraphicsGrid`, it says > By default, GraphicsGrid will display graphics at their specified sizes So why does it rescale the 3d plots even if I have set the ImageSize option? For example:               GraphicsGrid@Table[Plot3D[Sin[x + y^2], {x, -3, 3}, {y, -2, 2}, ImageSize -> 200], {2}, {2}]      gives the scaled 3d plots, regarding I have set the image size ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/NhhWM.png) while it doesn't rescale the 2d plots ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Yh4hf.png) So why does GraphicsGrid rescale 3d plots?
