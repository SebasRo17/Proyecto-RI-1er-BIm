I recently started learning Android development and I decided to follow the following development processes:   1. Preinstall Scala in emulator   2. Edit source files in IntelliJ IDEA 11   3. Compile the project with sbt in command line   4. Dex generated classes without Scala libraries   5. Build APK and test in emulator In the above steps, except step 3, I think other steps can be easily handled by command line/makefile. So here I am, I want a sample build.sbt to allow me easily specify the following information:   1. Source directories   2. Reference libraries   3. Output directory I am aware of sbt android plugin and sbt idea plugin but I want to avoid them for the following reason: projects generated by android plugin dex Scala libraries for each build but I want to have control on that part: I want to skip Scala libraries for development but include them for release build, which seams requires a lot of digging if I do it with the plugin but can be easily handled if it is done from command line/makefile. If overall what I plan to do makes sense, could someone familiar with sbt provide such a sample build.sbt? I have already spent hours following sbt tutorials but felt it’s so hard to make each seemed simple change to the default behavior of sbt. A side question, it seems that source directories added by unmanagedSourceDirectories get compiled every time regardless of the time stamp. If that’s the case, what’s the point of using sbt? I can just feed all sources files into scalac. **UPDATE**   This is the build.sbt based on Daniel C. Sobral's answer. When I type in sbt compile, it only prints some info like "Set current project to HelloAndroid...". No compilation happens.               name := "HelloAndroid"          scalaVersion := "2.8.2"          unmanagedSourceDirectories := List(       file("src"),       file("gen"))          libraryDependencies := List() // remove Scala's library from dependencies          unmanagedJars := List(Attributed.blank(file("C:/bin/android/platforms/android-10/android.jar")))          target := file("target")      I didn't expect it compiles because I still need to work out the jar files but at least I should get some compiler error. Any hint? **UPDATE** : the sbt compile outputs the following:               [info] Set current project to HelloAndroid (in build file:/C:/Users...     [success] Total time: 0 s, completed May 14, 2012 10:36:23 AM      I have two source files in src directory:               src/com/example/[HelloScala.scala MyActivity.java]      No class file is found under target folder.
