I'm a junior-programmer, and at present I am pursuing a course in I.T. which involves getting to know Java and JavaScript. Should I pursuit a course in C# also? I really like programming, but I had a lousy lecturer, at the beginning... But now I've changed lecturer, and beginning to see the light, but he's confined to teaching only Java. I would like to become a much better programmer, should I do it (C#)?
