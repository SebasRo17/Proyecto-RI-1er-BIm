The solution for a homogeneous second order linear ODE is generally a constant times one function plus another constant times a different function. Sometimes one of the solution functions is singular, i.e. it blows up for some value of the independent variable. An example is Bessel's ODE. If one is just looking for nonsingular solutions, is there some way to have Mathematica discard the singular function so that the required solution is nonsingular? This would be helpful in the case where a large number of ODE's are generated. Otherwise there is a lot of human intervention needed to proceed. In my case, I have the ODE's, and the specific solutions found by DSolve with the singular solutions obvious by inspection. I just want to see if Mathematica can be used to remove the singular solutions.
