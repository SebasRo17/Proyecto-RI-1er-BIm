I am looking at some C/C++ code that appears to have functions that are defined, but never used. This is a pretty tedious process to trace through the code and verify. I've done some surveys and there are a number of tools that can do this type of analysis. Can anyone share any experiences or tips on which tools and techniques are best or alternative methods of verifying this code is in fact not used?
