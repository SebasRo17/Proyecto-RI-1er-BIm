I found some examples of Mathematica's commands usage in an old manual but the program gives me different result than expected               Expand[Cos[x]^3 Sin[x]^2, Trig -> True]      should give               Cos[x]/8 - Cos[3x]/16 - Cos[5x]/16      but returns an unaltered expression. I tried out `Expand` with `Sin[x+y]` added to the expression, factored that and then I get what I expected in the first place. Why is that? I am surprised because I found that example in a book about Mathematica at my university's library. Although the book is from 1991 I don't think an unaltered expression is what `Expand` should return. Am I wrong?
