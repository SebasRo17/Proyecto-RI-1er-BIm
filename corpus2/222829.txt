I'm having quite some doubts here... If I have a table related to **username/password login** how can I assure there won't be any more matches of the **same username and password in the same table** using sql? For example:               >username: username     >password: password      ^this user just signed up. So the following conditions apply: > **1ยบ there can't be any more users named "username"** > > 2ยบ most surely there can't be any more users named "username" **AND with the > same password** so how exactly should I put the keynames in the database? The id is primary, should I put **username AND password** as **_unique_** to form an unique pair and avoid another identical insertion?
