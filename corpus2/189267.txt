I'm curious about what it takes to build a simple and robust RPC framework. I've only looked at a few ruby frameworks but they are all lacking in some way. What I want out of an RPC framework is some kind of registration/discovery mechanism and a simple plugin architecture. Pretty much all the frameworks out there provide a simple plugin mechanism but I haven't found one that provides a simple discovery mechanism. The only one that does provide something in terms of discovery is MCollective but that has its own set of issues that I've run into while trying to use it at work. So how hard would it be to build one from the ground up using tcp sockets or maybe 0MQ? Any issues I should be aware of ahead of time before I start this project?
