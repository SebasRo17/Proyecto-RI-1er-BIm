I have an InterpolatingFunction that I'd like to plot, and I wonder why I have to perform a `ReplaceAll` on the following function:               Plot[Evaluate[IIz[r, t] /. soln] /. t -> 5, {r, 0, 490}, PlotRange -> {{0,       490}, {.000015, -.00035}}, AxesLabel -> Automatic]`      `soln` is the solution to a differential diffusion equation given by Mathematica (v. 9.0.1) as               {{IIz[r,t]->InterpolatingFunction[{{1.*10^-8,490.5},{0.,10.}},<>][r,t]}}[r,       t]}}       When I plot the 3D solution, there is no problem in using               Plot3D[Evaluate[IIz[r, t] /. soln], {r, 0, 490}, {t, 0, 10},   PlotRange ->       {{0, 490}, {0, 10}, {.000015, -.00035}},   AxesLabel -> Automatic]       and I would think that all I'd need to do to plot this in terms of a fixed `t` would be to replace `t` with a constant like so:               Plot[Evaluate[IIz[r, 5] /. soln] , {r, 0, 490},   PlotRange -> {{0, 490},       {.000015, -.00035}}, AxesLabel -> Automatic]`      However, when I input that, I get a blank plot… What gives? For the original differential equation, see this question.
