I have read many articles on the creation of dynamic types and classes at run time. For example, the `TypeBuilder` class in C# lets one create dynamic types. Python has this type function by which one can create dynamic classes. I have certainly good information on how I should create a class at run time, but I don't find enough information on why I should do this. What is a scenario where one would be forced to create types at runtime?
