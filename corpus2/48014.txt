From this list of weather data how can I discriminate only latitude longitude for each station? For example from the following sample I would need only the coordinates:   * "50136","","Aoluguya|Mohe, 15","","CN", **52.13333,122.51667** ,433   * "50246","","Tahe|Ta-He, 23","","CN", **52.33330,124.80000** ,465   * "50349","","Jinsong|Jiu-Hai-Lai, 15","","CN", **51.13330,124.05000** ,610
