My idea is, to create an abstract class / interface which can be extended into a user, and into a usergroup. There actually is a good reason for there being this interface connecting the groups with the users as the only differences between a user and a group is that you can login as a user and you can't as a group, and that a group can contain multiple users or groups. Permissions and stuff are handled without taking notice of it being a user or a group.
