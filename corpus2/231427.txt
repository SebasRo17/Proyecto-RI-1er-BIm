I just wrote a function that spans approximately 100 lines. Hearing that, you are probably tempted to tell me about single responsibilities and urge me to refactor. This is my gut instinct as well, but here is the issue: The function _does_ one thing. It performs a complex string manipulation, and the function body consists mostly of one verbose regex, broken up into many lines that are documented. If I broke up the regex into multiple functions, I feel like I would actually _lose_ readability, since I am effectively switching languages, and won't be able to take advantage of some features regexes offer. Here now is my question: **When it comes to string manipulation with regular expressions, are large function bodies still an anti-pattern?** It seems like named capture groups serve a very similar purpose to functions. By the way, I have tests for every flow through the regex.
