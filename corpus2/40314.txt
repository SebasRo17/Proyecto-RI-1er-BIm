I entered a command incorrectly as follows:                   DSolve[{y'[x]=y[x]},y[x],x]      I am now experiencing:                   DSolve[{y'[x] == y[x]}, y[x], x]      > During evaluation of In[26]:= DSolve::deqn: Equation or list of equations > expected instead of True in the first argument {True}. >>               (* DSolve[{True},y(x),x] *)      How do I recover from this error. I've tried Clear[y'[x]]. That didn't work. D.
