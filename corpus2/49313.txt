Once in a while I have read here and there the size of a project expressed in a matter of `days-person` or `person-day`. I may understand what this means, but I don't know on what do people base themselves to calculate it.   1. What are the variables considered into this calculation?   2. How these variables are used in the calculation formula?   3. Otherwise, how to estimate it grossly, when something is missing from the formula's variables?
