At what level do you prefer to handle Null values in your application? My personal preference at the moment is the DB. When I build a view, I ensure that I return a value in place of a NULL value. So if your front-end app were to connect to the application it would never have to handle nulls. In my VB6 apps, I made liberal use of the IsNull function to handle Nulls. Share your experiences.
