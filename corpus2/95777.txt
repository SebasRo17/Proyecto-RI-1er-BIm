I do programming in an academic setting at the moment, so I can use whatever I want. I'm using the boost graph library for a few things, and I'm wondering whether investing effort in understanding GP more deeply is worth it. I'm curious - is generic programming (GP) used much in industry? My guess is that most programmers are much more comfortable with OOP or are using languages that don't emphasize or support GP, so that outside of calling STL data structures/functions in C++, my impression is that GP isn't used all that frequently in practice. But, being outside industry at the moment, it'd be nice to hear from practitioners on this. (as I'm writing this, I see that generic-programming isn't even a valid tag!)
