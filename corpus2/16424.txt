I have a list like:                  {{{4, 14}, 1}, {{4, 15}, 1}, {{4, 16}, 1}, {{4, 17}, 1},          {{4, 18}, 1}, {{4, 14}, 3},  {4,15},      {{4, 16}, 2},{4,18}}      Now I want to filter this list. First I want to delete lists that have the form: `{a,b}` like `{4,15}` and `{4,18}`. So what remains is:                {{{4, 14}, 1}, {{4, 15}, 1}, {{4, 16}, 1}, {{4, 17}, 1},        {{4, 18}, 1}, {{4, 14} ,3}, {{4, 16}, 2}}      And now I want only the lists which are a minimum: For example now you have a list with:               {{4, 14}, 1} and {{4, 14}, 3}     {{4, 16}, 1} and {{4, 16}, 2}      I want that only `{{4, 14}, 1}` and `{{4, 16}, 1}` remain (minimum of the third number). Finally remains:               {{{4, 14}, 1}, {{4, 15}, 1}, {{4, 16}, 1}, {{4, 17}, 1}, {{4, 18}, 1}      How can I easily do this??
