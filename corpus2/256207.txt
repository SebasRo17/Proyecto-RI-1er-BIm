my question is...how to test API's,in particular restful API'S using Jmeter???I am kind of new in this field....and I was told that there are these test scripts which have to be written to check the API's and given to Jmeter to test it...but I am not sure which scripting language to use or how it is done...I know there are soft wares like rest assured n play work...but I am interested in Jmeter as the testing tool...can anyone be kind enough to clear my doubt or atleast give me a link to any tutorial??? thank you :)
