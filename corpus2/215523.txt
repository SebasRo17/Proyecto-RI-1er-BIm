I've been a freelancer and a coder by night for a while, and recently, I've been hired after several levels of interviews in a nice NY company, even though I've some lacks in specific fields. Is this common for companies to hire seniors with less experience? Will they wait some weeks to respect a certain learning curve? I don't know anything about working in a company, so that's why I worry. After one week, I'm still checking and exploring sources, but after one week of work, it seems that some coworkers are considering that I'm slow. I'm good in maths, physics, algorithms, but still I need to learn about all the templates used in this company. Anyone here already received a less-experienced senior member in his team? Is this acceptable? I'm planing on having a meeting with my boss to stop worrying about that. Sounds like a good idea? [EDIT] Thanks for these answers. I'm definitely a -new - senior developer. I returned to the office with more confidence on Monday. I guess that it's normal to feel a bit incompetent in front of unknown templates/sources during the first weeks when you receive a good pay.
