Look at this:               <?php     echo "Hello World";     ?>     <br />     <?php     echo "Welcome";     ?>      And now look at this:               <?php     echo "Hello World";     echo "<br />";     echo "Welcome";     ?>      Which one of the above examples is considered to better (at least from performance point of view)?. I know the examples are trivial but I want to follow good practice habits from the beginning so when I have more and more lines they would not affect the performance or whatever in a negative way.
