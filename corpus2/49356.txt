I'm simulating the trajectory of a charged particle. I have the coordinates saved in the list $coor$ ({{0,0,0},{0.1,0.1,0.003}, etc}) as the time goes on this array is getting bigger and the computation slower. What is the usual way to solve this issue? I guess that using               coor=Append[coor,r]      is't the best way to save data on the way. Do you have any sugesstions? Thanks
