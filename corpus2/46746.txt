Consider simple example where a set of points is generated and some are displayed.               k = 10^5;     p = RandomReal[{-1, 1}, {k, 2}];     n = 2     Graphics[Dynamic@Point@p[[;; n]], Frame -> True, PlotRange -> 1]      > ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qCbVd.png) Let's plot more and more points from the set:               Dynamic@n     While[n += 100; FinishDynamic[]; n < k - 100]      > ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/iQZJg.png) I find the loop will start to slow down as `n` gets near to 10^5. This should be expected because the code is replotting all the points at each update of the graphics. (Depending on your system, the rate of slowdown my vary.) But each time only 100 points are added while the rest of the displayed image remains the same. Naive thinking tells me that there must be a way to do this better. I have tried many things but with no avail; still, I have a feeling I'm missing something basic.
