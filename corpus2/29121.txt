I've developed some software within my company and we have agreed that the future of the work is to open source it into the public domain. Is there an official contact procedure to contact the Apache Software Foundation, apache.org, to propose a new project? Looking at apache.org I've not been able to find a contact email or enquiry form, so I've resorted to searching lists of people involved in Apache projects and by chance some of them have blogs which may have a contact facility. Seems a bit haphazard way to make an important proposal about a new project, to me. I'm considering Apache as an Open Source Software (OSS) organisation first because   * the project is based on existing Apache libraries and is therefore a practical business problem demonstration applying those libraries, existing on the same open source platform is mutually beneficial - for example library updates may be easier, the project may be easier to find as a related project   * Apache Software License appears to be the most suitable license to use, given that the libraries that the project uses use the same and that ASL seems to be more flexible and pragmatic than GPL and possibly attracts more developers including those with commercial motivation   * Java-based: the project is Java based and Apache is a large, possibly even the largest, independent non-profit open source supporter of Java. I would consider other platforms too and if so would want to know how to contact them. **Background Reading** I've been researching how to Open Source, some notable references so far: (but so far not seen how to contact an OSS organisation once you are nearly ready to publish)   * http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596517960/toc.html?CMP=ILC-search_spot1&ATT=intel-property-book \- book describes all the major OSS licenses and industry stories   * http://producingoss.com/ \- general advice   * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3813613/looking-for-case-studies-of-managing-open-sourcing-code-from-a-company \- my post about how others did it   * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1914104/how-to-license-code-source-but-keep-control-of-it/1914145#1914145 \- I got the accepted answer here
