Our application its pretty simple, will be develop with php and mysql.   * Clients and providers ABMs   * Articles Inventory (we do not manage stock, because we resell from our providers)   * Purchases   * Account balance for our clients and providers Im stuck on accounting tables... Here is my model: ![database design](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jvRmR.jpg) Im in doubt with account table, im thinking about use a Trigger when purchases change Status (delivered to client) then I update Account balance but i dont know if this model its good for manage Accounts for my Clients. Im looking for opinions about my mistakes!! Thank you.
