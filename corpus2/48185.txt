I've always wanted to make my financial `Plot`s look like a Bloomberg terminal. How would I go about making my chart look like one? I am talking specifically about the chart gradient background, the gradient plot fill, the dashed horizontal and vertical markers, and the markers on the right y axis. Here is the image I am using as a template: ![Bloomberg terminal](http://i.stack.imgur.com/H9RrG.gif) Any pointers would be appreciated!
