I'm sorry if this question is too broad, but I hope it's not :) I'm thinking about setting up small & cheap home linux based server (one of those $200-$300 micro PCs), to move my whole development environment out from my laptop (databases, interpreters etc.). The main reason is - while I earn my meal coding PHP, I'd like to try new things that require installing new stuff and I want to keep my laptop running smoothly. Other reason is that I find setting up and maintaining dev environment on OS X somehow disturbing (you just can't upgrade PHP, you have to do some tricks to do this). Setup I thought about is: 1\. Mount server's drive via `Samba` 2\. Use `NetBeans` saving directly to server, work, run apps on server Keeping that in mind, my main (and IMHO quite specific) question is - will it work? I mean - won't this setup slow down my development instead of making it cleaner and separated from development machine? By slowing down I mean: samba issues, configuration issues, gotchas and so on. Technologies I intend to use: `mysql`, `postgres`, `php`, `pyton`, (maybe) `java`, (maybe) `RoR`, (maybe) `Solr`.
