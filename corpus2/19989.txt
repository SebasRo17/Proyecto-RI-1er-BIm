I'm trying to generate all the subsets of a set containing a specific element. For example, for the set {1, 2, 3, 4}, with the specific element I want inside each subset being 4, the required answer would be               {{4}, {1, 4}, {2, 4}, {3, 4}, {1, 2, 4}, {1, 3, 4}, {2, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 4}}      My current code is to do `Select[Subsets[Range[n]], MemberQ[#, n] &]`, where for the above example we would have `n=4`. However, the code seems inefficient and my computer runs out memory for `n>25`. Is there a more efficient way to do so, or is this already the best? NB: I will only need to work with one of the subsets at any point of time, but the `Select` code above doesn't seem to allow me to pick an arbitrary $i^{th}$ subset.
