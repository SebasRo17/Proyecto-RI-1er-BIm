**Manipulate[Timing[Show** [somegraphs[[1 ;; i]]]], {i, 1, 500, 1}] (in Mathematica 8) This is the last line of my function **f[x_]:= Module[....]**. I am trying to combine a list of graphs into a single graph. I want to test its performance so I add an Timing function within the Manipulate function. I want to find out the time it takes when I change the value of _i_. However, the output doesn't change as I change _i_ while clearly the time taken is increased.
