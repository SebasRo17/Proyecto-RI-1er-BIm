I am working with the 3-D coordinates of proteins. The file format I import and modify coordinates of is in the .PDB format, and the string to import is also in this same format. Currently, when I try to export as in "final.pdb", I get: "Export::type: "String cannot be exported to the !(\"PDB\") format." However, when I export with the extension .txt, and use:               Import["final.txt", "PDB"]      The file imports as the protein structure. My question: Is there a way to export using the .PDB extension. Or even force the export. Having the .pdb extension would be much easier for other programs. If there is a way, please let me know.
