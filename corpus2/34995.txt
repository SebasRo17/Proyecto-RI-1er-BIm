So my code is divided into 3 different sections: 1) Calculating clustering coefficient, 2) Extracting degree distribution 3) Using the degree distribution to get the mean of 1000 networks.               N[GlobalClusteringCoefficient[Graph[{1\[UndirectedEdge]2, 2\[UndirectedEdge]3, 3\[UndirectedEdge]1}]]]          VertexDegree[Graph[{1\[UndirectedEdge]2, 2\[UndirectedEdge]3, 3\[UndirectedEdge]1}]]          Output: {2,2,2}      Then:               N[Mean[GlobalClusteringCoefficient/@RandomGraph[DegreeGraphDistribution[{1,2,4,3,5}],100]]]      So, I am copying and pasting the degree distribution generated in the second line into the third part. Instead of doing that, is there a way to assign a variable so it is done automatically? E.g               x = VertexDegree[Graph[{1\[UndirectedEdge]2, 2\[UndirectedEdge]3, 3\[UndirectedEdge]1}]]          N[Mean[GlobalClusteringCoefficient/@RandomGraph[DegreeGraphDistribution[{x}],100]]]      Obviously, this won't work but the idea is I save time, instead of copying and pasting the result from the output, can I make a variable assignment that automates this process?
