There are a lot of methods like this in iOS/Objective C:               - viewDidLoad     - viewWillAppear:     - applicationDidFinishLaunching      I've just been having a discussion with some colleagues about this design choice and why they would choose to be so verbose in preference of the more "standard" ways of event propagation for instance:               - onViewLoad     - onViewAboutToAppear     - onApplicationFinishLaunching      I didn't have an answer and rather put it down to just personal preference of the team designing the language. However, I'm wondering if there's more to it - whether this is a preferred option. Or whether the team just wanted to differentiate themselves from other languages, or from the norm. If anyone has any insight that would be very interesting. Thanks
