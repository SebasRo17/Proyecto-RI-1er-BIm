I just completed a front-end web development course. I now have a rudimentary understanding of what it takes to make a website sorta pretty and minimally functional. I also now know (barely) how to link up to an api via AJAX. I don't know what's next. I know I want to learn what it takes to make real- time collaborative web apps. node.JS? An online course? What should a beginner learn to jump into development of real-time collaborative software?
