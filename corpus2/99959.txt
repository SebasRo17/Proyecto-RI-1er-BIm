A week ago I asked the question; First big project, how to get started. Make menus, save to harddrive etc. I tried to do everything without doing a GUI with Swing but I realized that for every view I wanted to present to the user I had to make a new class. Right now I have 3 menu classes (the mainMenu, computerCategoryMenu,laptopCategoryMenu) I stopped because I would need to make another 6 menu classes and then another 6 if the user registered and another 6 for the administrator of the site. It doesn't look right to me. Furthermore everything looks too static for me. I don't know how to make the administrator add or delete products. Should I store all my products in a hashmap and then get them to show in different menus? Do you think that doing a GUI with Swing will make things much easier?
