I'm currently new to freelancing as a programmer and need to work out what some of the "norms" are without making myself look like an amateur. I've already won some work from a local company doing C# development and quoting an hourly rate for work that i am doing from my office. However on one upcoming project I've been asked to come on-site (client office) to work a full week. Is it reasonable to charge more than my regular hourly rate for working on site? And how should i justify the extra charges?
