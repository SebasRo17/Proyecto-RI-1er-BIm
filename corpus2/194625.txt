Which open source java projects do you know to be **high performance** or **real time performance**? I tried hard to find them on github or google, but couldn't find suitable.   I want to learn from this projects, so will not be as a newbie on my interviews ;)   So far I am going to stick to Play Framework project. Are there better options? P.S. I've seen possible duplicate, but I am looking for a very load intensive applications. As people in Deutsche Bank write.
