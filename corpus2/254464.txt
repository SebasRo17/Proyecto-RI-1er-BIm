I have a JSON like this:               {      "CODE" : [{            "FOO" : "BAR",            "SET" : []            },            {            "FOO" : "ABC",            "SET" : []            }       ]      }      Now, when I try to access CODE[0].SET, I get an error in my browser that "SET" does not exist. I use the json_parse library by Douglas Crockford to parse the above JSON: https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON- js/blob/master/json_parse.js Sorry, in advance, If I have posted this question in the wrong forum.
