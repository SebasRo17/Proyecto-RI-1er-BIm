We were migrating from Java 6 to Java 7. The project is behind schedule and risks being dropped, in which case it will continue to use Java 6. What are the specific improvements in Java 7 that we could go back to our manager with and convince him it is important to use JDK 7? Looking for bug fixes that I could highlight in Oracle Java 7 (with respect to Java 6). Fixes in security, performance, Java 2D/printing, etc. will be more sellable in my case. Compiler fixes for example, will not of much use. [I am going through many sites like Oracle adoption guide, bug database, questions on Stack Overflow]. Update: Thanks for the answers. We rescheduled the update to next release. Closest we got was security. Accepting the highest voted answer.
