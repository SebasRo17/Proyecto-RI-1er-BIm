I have list of data which I visualize by using `ListContourPlot`.               data = Table[RandomReal[i]*RandomReal[j], {i, 5}, {j, 6}];            ListContourPlot[data, AspectRatio -> 1/10, ImageSize -> 700]      ![ListContourPlot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/yF6bd.png) Each column of data correspondes to a segment which has a certain length. For example:               segments = {{0, 5}, {5, 12}, {12, 27}, {27, 32}, {32, 35}, {35, 40}}      Now I would like to rescale the x axes so that the columns have the right length in the plot. If possible also the caption of the x axes should match. -Frink
