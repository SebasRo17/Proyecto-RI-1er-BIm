If I create a notebook `CreateDocument` and I set options such that `Visible -> False`, is there any way to tell if it's still open without setting it back to visible?               outputNotebook = CreateDocument[{}, Visible -> False]      Complication: The initial notebook object reference is reassigned, i.e. I create another document with the same notebook object reference symbol: `outputNotebook = CreateDocument[...]` and then later run the same code. How can I figure out if my first `outputNotebook` (which is invisible) is still open?
