The small company I work for is currently looking for a few good programmers. We have posted job listings in a few places and hit up the local user group boards, but haven't really gotten anything back on any of that. As a developer what elements of a job posting would make you respond:   * Company Name (i.e. Microsoft, Oracle, or in our line of work BAE, Boeing, Lockheed Martin).   * Type of work (This seems kind of obvious, but would be like ROR or Java, etc.)   * Work Environment   * Computers used (MacBook PRO for everyone)   * Salary range   * Other It's a little hard to believe that given the overall job market that we don't even get resumes. We are in a hot market (DC area), but it still seems a bit hard.
