I have a set of points of dimension >3, and I'd like to modify ListPointPlot3D so that the higher dimensions are mapped to different variables, such as color, opacity, point size, etc. so for example               a = Table[RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[3], 4], {5000}];     ListPointPlot3D[a] +some options...
