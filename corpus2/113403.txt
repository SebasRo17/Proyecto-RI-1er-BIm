In language like C or Java, there are things like functions/methods to modularize and abstract stuff. What is there in SQL, specifically for Oracle? I've seen people talking about using views to reduce the complexity in various blogs but there is only so much that can be done with a view. (For example, a bind variable cannot be passed as a runtime parameter to a view). In tools like Oracle Reports the query sometimes gets very awkward running several hundreds of lines. I was wondering what sort of techniques people use to manage the complexity of their SQL? What are the equivalents of functions and methods in SQL to keep SQL from becoming extremely complex?
