Let's say I have a list of precipitation values by hour, each showing how much rain happened in the prior 24 hours, ordered by date. For example:               {         '2012-05-24 12:00': 0.5, // .5" of rain from 5/23 12:00 - 5/24 11:59         '2012-05-24 11:00': 0.6, // .6" of rain from 5/23 11:00 - 5/24 10:59         '2012-05-24 10:00': 0.6, // .6" of rain from 5/23 10:00 - 5/24 09:59         ...         '2012-05-23 10:00': 0     }      Is there a strategy/algorithm to determine how much rain fell in each of the hours? I can't seem to wrap my head around this. I know that it's not as straightforward as just summing the diffs. **Visualization of Dataset**               P(N)    [.....======================]     P(N-1)  [....======================.]     P(N-2)  [...======================..]     P(N-3)  [..======================...]     I want  [..........................=]      Many thanks for any help.
