Starting with Mathematica and working with matrices, I am looking for a way to construct a new matrix B from columns of matrix A. For example, matrix a has 8 columns and 4 rows, I want matrix B to be columns 1,2, 7 and 8. Got this so far:               A12 = A[[All, 1;;2]];     A78 = A[[All, 7;;8]];      ... but have not yet found a way to properly join these two... I did find a way to insert a column in a matrix in the Mathematica documentation, by using a nested Transpose-Insert-Transpose, but did not return the correct new matrix B. Any suggestion is much appreciated. J.
