I learned some javascript as my introduction into programming, and now I'm trying to move on to Java and Python and from there to c++, c#, etc. I've been caught up with schoolwork, so I've had very little chance to learn anything yet, but I have been lurking around SO looking for easy Java questions that I might have asked myself and trying to learn from the answers. I saw one that was kind of interesting. It was a homework assignment about finding the most efficient order of jobs to do, assuming each job took two days and had to be in sequential order. I could have easily done this in javascript, but I'm having trouble figuring out how in Java. With javascript I would just return a two dimensional array. Each element being an array containing the profit and the days to work. Ignoring whether or not that's a stupid way to return data in javascript, what is the proper way to return data like this in Java? In other words, the javascript array I would return would look something like: [ ['1-3-5', 50], ['2-5-8', 90], ['2-4-7', 75] ] In Java, I would have to convert the integers to strings to start off, and then find a way to concatenate two two dimensional arrays... Needless to say, this is the wrong way to go about it.
