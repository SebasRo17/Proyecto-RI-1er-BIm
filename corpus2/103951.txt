I'm familiar with the basics of run-time analysis such as what makes certain types of code O(n) and O(n^2). But I'm having real trouble learning, understanding, and really remembering how to analyze pieces of code that run in other complexities such as O(n log n) or O(2^n). I'm looking for resources that explain in simple terms how these other complexities work and some practice problems to really force my understanding.
