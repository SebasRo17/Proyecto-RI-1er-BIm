I found this link, as an explanation of r/w problem - http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~bart/537/lecturenotes/s7.html But, I'm having problems realizing is there any starvation present here and why? Also, if there is, what should be changed? I would also appreciate help with confirming the answers on the questions that are provided below the lecture: >   * Is the first writer to execute Lock.P() guaranteed to be the first > writer to access the data? > No? >   * Can OKToRead ever get greater than 1? What about OKToWrite? > Yes and No?
