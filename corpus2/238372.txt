I have just acciquired an old Dell Poweredge SC1425 from an old friend, this server will act as a development box for web based applications. All has been going well, I have installed the following packages onto the system. **Packages**   1. Apache2   2. PHP5 (including MCrypt & PHP5-JSON)   3. MySQL   4. SSH Server & Client   5. Git & Subversion   6. SFTP Server   7. VirtualBox   8. Node.JS   9. Python   10. Buildlibs (g++, build essentials, fakeroot, make, checkinstall)   11. WebMin   12. Samba The server is running Debian 7 64bit with the included packages above, I have setup some virtual machines (Windows XP & Windows 7) and what I would like to do is when the user starts the VM I want the OS to start Internet Explorer automatically. The reason why is so that i can test my web based applications on older OS's and browsers. After the user has finished with the box or mistakenly left it switch on for X amount of time, I would like the VM to shutdown automatically and also wipe any data which was added during that session. Am not sure if what I am asking can be done so I thought I would ask.
