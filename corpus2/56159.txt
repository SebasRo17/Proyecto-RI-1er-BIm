Considering a `DatabaseExample` included with _Mathematica_ :               Needs["DatabaseLink`"]     conn = OpenSQLConnection["publisher"];     SQLSelect[conn, "ROYSCHED", "ShowColumnHeadings" -> True]//Short      > > `{{TITLE_ID,LORANGE,HIRANGE,ROYALTY},{BS1011,0,5000,0.1},<<49>>,{PY2008,0,50000,0.1}}` Now with the introduction of v10 and functions such as `Association` and `Dataset`, we can convert this data to a `Dataset`:               sqltodataset[fields_, data_] /; Equal @@ Join[{Length@fields}, Length /@ data] :=      Dataset[Association[Thread[fields -> #]] & /@ data]               data = SQLSelect[conn, "ROYSCHED", "ShowColumnHeadings" -> True];     ds = sqltodataset[First@data, Rest@data];      Querying should now be much faster:               Do[SQLSelect[conn, "ROYSCHED", {"ROYALTY"}, SQLColumn["TITLE_ID"] == "BS1001"], {100}] // Timing     Do[Normal[Select[ds, #"TITLE_ID" == "BS1001" &][[All, "ROYALTY"]]], {100}] // Timing      And it seems to be. Although not quite a fast as I expected: > `{0.171601,Null}` > > `{0.093601, Null}` But at the expense of RAM:               ByteCount[ds]      > `35644` Is there a real upside to converting to a `Dataset`, or should I just stick to SQL to query? And is there a more direct way to convert straight to a `Dataset`?
