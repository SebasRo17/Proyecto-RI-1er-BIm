We're trying to get our company to let us use our own personal laptops for client work. We've agreed that any code/data will be encrypted using something like TrueCrypt, in case a laptop is stolen or lost. However, the company is still skeptical and not sure they want to allow us to use our personal machines for development. They would rather buy us laptops... but we want to use MacBook Pros and they don't want to pay for them. Even if they did buy us laptops, we would stil have the issue of needing to encrypt the code/data in case of theft/loss. Do you use your own laptop for work? What are the arguments for/against this? * * * **UPDATE:** Thanks for all the responses, its given us a lot to think about. This was originally brought up because we were asking for a "personal loan" to buy new laptops for ourselves, and then we threw in there that we would use these laptops for work too - since right now we use our personal laptops occasionally, e.g. at client site or weekend support.
