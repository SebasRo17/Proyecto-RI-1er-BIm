This one I heard when I was recently interviewing a person and asked him why he was looking for a change within an year of joining his previous company. Particularly a company which is known to be in the business of processing high volume transactions, 100s of 1000s of orders flowing through the system every minute etc., etc. (you know what sells, so lets cut it) What the candidate told me was interesting -- he had joined originally hoping to be able to get into the lower layers of the system, understanding the secret sauce that binds a high volume reliable system etc. What he ended up doing was using a lot of tools - open source and commercial, and was in the business of just glueing it all together, which never gave him any understanding of the real deal. There were tight work deadlines too, so he couldn't really get into the hang of at least the open source stuff either. I had to agree here. But tell me then, how would you prevent yourself from degenerating into an API stitching kind of a programmer in this specific situation? Are there any signs in the job interview process itself that signal you of this degeneration?
