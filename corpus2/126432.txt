I've been looking around, but I'm still not sure on the what OpenCL is. Other than multi processor stuff... Is it another graphics API like OpenGL and DirectX? Or something that works alongside OpenGL? I'm planning on learning OpenGL soon (with java if it makes a difference) so I want to know how/which direction to learn it with. Also, I hear things about CUDA which confuses me further. Just looking for some simple clarifying statements. Thanks.
