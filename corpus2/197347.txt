Recently, it was suggested that many projects (where I work) should be implemented using some combination of stored procedures (on SQL Sever / T-SQL), SSIS, and SSRS. In one specific project, SSIS would get a file from a SFTP server. The file contains the daily price of ten stocks. A data warehouse will store the daily price of each stock since inception. As of now, the prices go back twenty-five years. Stored procedures will have the business logic to calculate various performance numbers (i.e. return %) during arbitrary time periods such as the 5 year return at 31 December 2012. These stored procedures would be used by SSRS to create reports for the end users. What are the problems/issues using this approach? I feel that vendor (Microsoft) lock is an issue but I don't see that (unfortunately) being enough to change direction. Also, I have a concern about all the business logic being stored procedures. What are the arguments against/for putting this business logic (i.e. calculation of performance numbers) in stored procedures versus using Java (or some other OO programming language) with ORM (such as myBatis)?
