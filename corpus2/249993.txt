Specifically for a game programmer. If you really needed some assembly routines you could look for help, whereas back in the 80s/90s it was one of the mainstream languages. I read that compilers can generally equal (or beat) most hand written assembly code, so unless you are an embedded programmer who can only program some device in assembly, for example, is there any real point in learning it nowadays?
