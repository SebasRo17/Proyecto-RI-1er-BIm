As I work for a Microsoft Gold Partner, they are keen for me to become certified. They have left it up to me to decide which certifications I want to go for. I had started training for the .NET 4 MCTSs but I am finding them harder than expected. Part of the problem is that I mostly work with 3.5 as my part of job and only work with 4 at home. Should I just give myself a break and go for the 3.5 exams? Would other employers think it was bad/strange that I'm still sitting 3.5 exams in 2011? I would still like to know all the latest technologies but at the moment I'm just finding that there is too much. By the time I'm ready for .NET 4 they will probably have released 5, and the cycle will continue.
