Whenever I write unit tests I have always tried to have a **single assert per test** to make debugging easier when tests fail. However as I follow this rule I feel like I am constantly copying the same code in each test and by having more tests it becomes harder to go back to read and maintain. _So does single-assertion testing violate DRY?_ And _Is there a good rule to follow_ to find a good balance, like just having **one test per method**?* *I realize there probably isn't a one-size fits all solution to this but is there a recommended way to approach this?
