I have enjoyed working with R inside _Mathematica_. But it would be nice If I could have a special R cell. For example, instead of typing               REvaluate["{           data(iris)           reg <- lm( Sepal.Length ~ Species, data=iris )           summary.text <- capture.output(print( summary(reg)) )        }"]      I would change the cell style to the special R code one and simply type in the code as I would do in a terminal window. Like so:                 data(iris)       reg <- lm( Sepal.Length ~ Species, data=iris )       summary.text <- capture.output(print( summary(reg)) )      Is there some way to create such a FrontEnd cell? In the future I would like _Mathematica_ to have code highlighting and autocompletion for such cells. This would make _Mathematica_ the best environment for working with R.
