I am making an application which first imports the data from the Excel file and then uses it in the deployment of a CDF. But is it possible to change the data of the Excel file and see its corresponding CDF without executing the code in the notebook? I have imported y1 and y2 from an excel file. Here is the code.               CDFDeploy[     ToFileName["C:\\Users\\murali\\Desktop","demo2thomson.cdf"],     {DynamicModule[{y =      Import["C:\\Users\\murali\\Desktop\\demo.xlsx"], y1 = y[[1, 1]],   y2 = y[[1, 2]], q1, q2},      Panel@Column[{Spacer[70] Text[         Style["iPhone and iPad quarterly sales- units, million", Bold,           18]], Column[{Spacer[70],          Text[Style["Click on/off:", Bold, 14]], q1 = True; q2 = True;          Row[{Labeled[            Button["     ", q1 = ! q1, Background -> Blue,              Appearance -> "Frameless"], "iPhone", {Right}],            Spacer[19],            Labeled[Button["     ", q2 = ! q2, Background -> Orange,              Appearance -> "Frameless"], "iPad", {Right}]}],          Column[{Dynamic@            BarChart[             Table[{If[q1, y1[[i]], 0], If[q2, y2[[i]], 0]}, {i, 1, 22,                1}], BarSpacing -> 0.8, ChartStyle -> {Blue, Orange},              ImageSize -> {600, 280},              GridLines -> {None, Automatic}]}]}]}]]}]      I am importing these values just as default and want that the end user can change these values. i.e. I don't want the end user to go to the code and execute again and again if he wants to change some of the values of y1 and y2. Is it possible that he can change value and see the difference in the CDF itself?
