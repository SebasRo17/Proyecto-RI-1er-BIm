Inspired by the numerous posts about the importance of learning Lisp/Scheme I started to learn Scheme two days back, I am using the book "The little Schemer" and have completed half of it. But I still haven't learned anything new, the book teaches about recursion which I already understand and uses lambda (which I can think of a way to define a function in C). I still haven't got the concept of functional programming (please point to some example of functional compared to normal programming methods in C/C++ so I can get it). Am I learning in the wrong way? or is "The little Schemer" for a newbie in programming and I should look for some other books?
