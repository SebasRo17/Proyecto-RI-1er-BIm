I know it's a very subjective question , but this is one section of Software Engineering wherein I haven't seen any improvement in terms of how we can do it in a better way. I guess every programmer does documentation with some frustration, but when working I feel it's the most important tool for me. How can the process of creating and maintaining documentation be done in a better way?
