This probably has a one line answer, but I'm totally stuck. I have two tensors, i.e. two objects that depend on NN abstract indices which i've labelled `i[m] (m=1,...,NN)`. I want to keep NN general for now. Each index `i[m]` ranges over the values `{1,2}`. I want to sum over all the `i[m]`s, i.e.               Sum[a[i[1],...,i[NN]] * b[i[1],...,i[NN]], {i[1],1,2},{i[2],1,2},...,{i[NN],1,2}]      The only problem I have is finding a general expression that generates the "array" {i[1],1,2},{i[2],1,2},...,{i[NN],1,2} in the summation. I tried Table but that gives me an array of the form               {{i[1],1,2},{i[2],1,2},...,{i[NN],1,2}}      and I can't get rid of the outer brackets.
