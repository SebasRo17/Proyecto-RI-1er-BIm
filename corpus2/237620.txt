Say your company develops software, and a client wants you to handle their development. It just so happens, that they have their own IT-team, but it is fully tied up, so they outsource to you. The project is in a quotation phase, and your client's Head of IT now asks for a requirement specification (SRS), an architectural specification, and so on. The Head of IT wants to know functions, modules and other decisions that will be in construction. Other than the SRS for analysis, is your company obliged to provide these specifications, even before the project has been confirmed?
