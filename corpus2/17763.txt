I'd like to get football data out of Wolfram|Alpha and into Mathematica 9, but I'm having some minor difficulty. Naturally, I'd like to know how to accomplish this task (details below), but I'm more interested in learning how I should have figured it out on my own.               TeamNames = {"Giants", "Redskins", "Cowboys", "Eagles", "Packers",         "Bears", "Vikings", "Lions", "Falcons", "Saints", "Panthers",         "Buccaneers", "49ers", "Seahawks", "Rams", "Cardinals", "Patriots",        "Dolphins", "Bills", "Jets", "Ravens", "Bengals", "Steelers",         "Browns", "Texans", "Colts", "Titans", "Jaguars", "Broncos",         "Chargers", "Raiders", "Chiefs"};     Table[WolframAlpha[ TeamNames[[i]] <> " in 2010",         {{"Schedule:NFLTeamData", 1}, "ComputableData"}],         {i, 1, 32}]      This code gets the schedules for all but three teams (Cardinals, Bills, Texans). I'm unable to get schedules for those teams through the "WolframAlpha" command, although they are available through the web interface. So here's the (big) question in a nutshell: how do I figure out how to phrase a WolframAlpha query so that it gets exactly what I want? Of course that question is too broad, but I mean that a best answer will not be a simple command that gets the data I want, but a route by which I could have figured it out myself.
