We currently have a large Subversion repository, with a tree like:               root         /libraries             /library1                 /trunk             /library2                 /trunk         /solutions             /solution1                 /trunk             /solution2                 /trunk      There are 81 solutions and 22 libraries. The `trunk` subdirectories were added so we could use branches, but in practice, we don't use branches at all. My question is: if we migrate this to Mercurial, should be set up one big Mercurial tree with the same structure? Or should we create 81+22 Mercurial repositories?
