I would like to know how I to define a function with a nested set of parameters (or whatever you would like to call it). For example, how would I get the following function `A`,               M = m1 + m2;     \[Eta] = m1*m2/(m1 + m2)^2     A[t_]:= M (\[Eta] / M * t)^(1/4);      Such that if I just evaluated `A[5.0]` for example it would return,               1.49535 M Power[\[Eta]/M, (4)^-1]      (i.e. a function of `M` and `\[Eta]`) or something similar, but not `A` as a function of `m1`, `m2`,               1.49535 Power[(m1 m2)/(m1+m2)^2, (4)^-1] (m1+m2)      But, at the same time, maintain a form that I could replace either `m1` and `m2` or `M` and `\[Eta]`, such that both               A[5.0] /. m1 -> 1 /. m2 -> 1     A[5.0] /. M -> 2 /. \[Eta] -> 1/4      would return `1.77828`.
