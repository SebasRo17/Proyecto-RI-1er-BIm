I'm searching for a best way to improve suffix array run time using LCP. My text (about 2 500 000 chars) seems like: 0ricco0eric0america0polo0.... My thoughs:               SA=suffixArray     char=firstChar(input)     s = suffix array index of a first value char           currentWord is area (string) in the text from 0 to next 0 where the substring is found, hence: for founded substring icco would be currentWord ricco          repeat         if pattern in text[SA[s]:SA[s]+len(input)]             break         s+=1     results.append(currentWord)          repeat         if lcp[s]>=len(input)             results.append(currentWord)             s+=1         else:              break      Is this a correct way? Or could you give me an advice how it should be?
