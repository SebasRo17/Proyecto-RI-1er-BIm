I'm pretty new to programming, and I've just started using GitHub to store and hold my source code (I keep losing stuff stored locally). As it stands all that's in there right now are source code files, nothing more, but I expect that to change as time goes on and I get better at this. Given that all the repositories in the free accounts are public, how much do I need to worry about licensing? Would I be fine with just downloading a copy of the GPL, placing a copyright notice in the Readme and calling it a day? I'm fully aware that people can download and modify my stuff, and I'm OK with that, but I at least want to ensure that I get credit for my work should they decide to do so.
