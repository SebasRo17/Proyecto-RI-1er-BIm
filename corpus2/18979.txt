As a freelance programmer:   1. What is your process for gathering requirements from a client?   2. How much time does the requirement gathering process take you? I know this is not fixed, and there are variables such as how prompt the client is in responding and such. In general, accounting for the delay in responses and such, how long does it take to get to the final requirement?   3. Which communication channel (email, phone, instant messenger, other) do you use to gather these requirements?   4. Do you charge for the time spent in requirements gathering?   5. Are there any deliverables in your requirements gathering process? If so what are they?
