I'd like to create proper documentation for a package of mine, and Workbench in principle provides the tools to do this. However, I've split my package into multiple sub-packages (because I found it easier to maintain the code that way), structured as follows:               mainPackage`                `myPackage`                          `subPackage1`                          `subPackage2`                          `subPackage3`      The documentation tools in Workbench are set up in such a way that, out of the box, they only work with one top-layered package. For instance, the _Create symbol pages_ button from the _Documentation_ tab in the PacletInfo.m editor only looks for symbols within the context \$ApplicationName (which you can set in the _Overview_ tab of the PlacletInfo.m editor), and it's not possible for $ApplicationName to have quotes (`). So my question is: does anyone have a workaround for this? I could merge all my _subPackages_ into _myPackage_ , but unfortunately it won't be possible to remove the top-layer _mainPackage_.
