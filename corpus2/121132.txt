I have been programming ROR for about a year now, and I think I am ready to start working on a project for someone else. The problem is that job postings for contractors don't really tell you which specific tasks you should be able to do at different experience levels (in rails and other technologies), so I don't know where to pitch myself. I think I am somewhere between junior and mid-level, but who knows? So my question is: Which actual tasks should an junior programmer be able to do at, say, $35 an hour, which actual tasks should an intermediate programmer be able to do at, lets say, $75 an hour, and which actual tasks should an advanced programmer be able to do at, oh say, $140 an hour? One or two examples should suffice.
