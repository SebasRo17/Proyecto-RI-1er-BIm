Is it possible to introduce scrum to a consulting environment? On any given week I might belong to 4 different teams, each with a different PM, BA and dev team (I am a designer). It doesn't seem feasible, time wise, to be able to be part of that many teams/projects as there would need to be daily stand-ups for each, sprint reviews, etc. I should add these projects are not necessarily software, but mainly ecommerce web projects. Can someone who has done this speak to how you approach it? _Edit_ I think my situation is different and I should have discussed it further. Our dev team is in India, so finding a time in the US morning/India evening for daily stand-ups are hard, especially when we almost always have client calls in the US morning/India evening so dev can be present if necessary. Instead, what our PM's have done is have 1 daily meeting for the US team (BA, Design). However, they go through ALL the projects at once. So, if you're not on that project, you're screwed and have to wait till your project comes up. This can be 30min-75min a day, for me. Insane. This does NOT cancel our weekly status call (30m-1h) with the client (x however many projects you are on). This is obviously not scrum, as there are no devs present during any of this and it's just action items being listed for the US team. However, I'd love to get to a point where our 'scrum-like' dev team (they develop in sprints and have sprint planning meetings) can be part of daily standups with the US team and we transition to an actual scrum framework.
