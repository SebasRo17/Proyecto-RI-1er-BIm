I'm learning new languages as I go along, I write code for very basic programs in multiple languages, and I go to classes. I've read books, articles, lessons, videos, you name it, however I can't seem to get the hang of certain things. For example I never understood pointers - what they are good at. (NOT PART OF THE QUESTION - retagging with "Pointers" is not required...) * * * My question however, is not what pointers do, but instead how can I understand things like that? If, after reading a book or an article about a certain part of programming, and I don't understand, what do I do? Writing code in a certain feature of programming surely helps, however it doesn't actually help with understand that much. The theoretical part is important in understanding.
