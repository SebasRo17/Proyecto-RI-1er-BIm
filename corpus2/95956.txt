At the beginning of this year I was promoted to a lead developer role after our team's lead developer moved to a different department. I have about 5 years of job experience and due to availability and past performance I was management's primary choice for leading the project. I was a little apprehensive but decided it was a good opportunity for career advancement and experience, so I accepted. But my conclusion so far is that I don't enjoy it nearly as much as my previous developer position. Though I have successfully led a team of 5 developers through several releases, I almost never touch any code. Instead I perform planning and design and team management, along with code reviews. The need to keep track of many more things, and have tasks planned so they can be assigned to the team, literally gives me headaches most every day. Even though I rarely work overtime, I feel burnt out most every day when I leave work, and don't think I have even enjoyed off-work time as much as a result. So my question: **how would you handle, or how have you handled, such a situation?** For people in similar situations, did you find ways to better manage your team, tasks and time that made you enjoy the work? Or did you find a way to transition back into a more development-oriented position? I know that lead developer positions almost always pay a higher salary, but I can see myself getting to a point where I care less about money and promotions than I do about my enjoyment of my current job. I have not discussed this with anyone in management as I thought I should try to adjust for at least a year.
