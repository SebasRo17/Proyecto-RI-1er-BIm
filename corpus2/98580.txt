I come to you as a newbie programmer who's been working on his own project (which is progressing nicely). My co-founder has also been learning how to program and has reached a point where he could probably start fixing some things and making some things happen. He asked a very good question, which was "how will this work". Something I could only theorize about as I've never programmed with someone else. Could you advise me on the best work flow. We use git. Should we own specific parts of the system? Checking code in? Code review? How do you work with >1 dev?
