Consider the following example of trying to export the following table:               Export["test.dat", {{{1, 1}, {2, 2}}, {{3, 3}, {4, 4}}}, "Table"];      Now I import to see what I get:               Import["test.dat", "Table"]     {{{1,,1}, {2,,2}}, {{3,, 3}, {4,,4}}}      which contains extra undesirable commas. I've trying making the data type a "List" but that possessing an issue in which elements are not separated by commas. How can I fix this problem so the the imported table is the same as I exported?
