When working with differential equations with independent (e.g. `t` )and dependent (e.g., `x[t]`) variables Mathematica expresses partial and 'regular' derivatives nicely, but not the derivative itself. Can anybody manage to do this? I give an example: Let `f` depend on `x`, `y` and `t`. `x` and `y` depend on `t`. So, the partial derivative ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/a4UTF.png) with e.g. respect to `x` is in Matheamtica expressed by > f^(1,0,0)[x,y,t] , the derivative with respect to the independent variable ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/a9dFo.png) as an example by               x'[t]      . But how can I make Mathematica to show the derivative e.g. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/k9Gy6.png) explicitly?
