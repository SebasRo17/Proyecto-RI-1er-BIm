For keeping the "Administration Panel" secure to those who are logged in, for my web application, is the best practice to use an If/Else Statement?               if($_SESSION['logged_in'] == true) {        include '../styles/templates/admincp/header.php';        include '../styles/templates/admincp/content.php';        include '../styles/templates/admincp/footer.php';     }     else {        include '../styles/templates/login.php';     }      Is this how the "professionals' (such as CMS creators, etc) do this authentication style? OR is there a completely better route and method to the If/Else statement to authenticate pages for logged in users to access?
