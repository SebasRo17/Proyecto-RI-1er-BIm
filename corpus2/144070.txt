I am developing software that uses many calls to a server. On a client side it's a Silverlight application. Almost every time a user clicks on a button in it, it sends 1-5 WCF calls to a server. There can be up to dozen or so users at a time. The server is a database server that serves data to a client. I am an intermediate level developer and am thinking about caching some data and syncing my changes from time to time. Are there any official solutions or technologies for it, like, patterns and such?
