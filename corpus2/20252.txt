I have a large data set of experimental data for which I have determined a theoretical fit. However, for some of the experimental data I took, there was systematic error, leading to the data deviating from the expected fit as shown below (experimental values are plotted on x-axis and theoretical values are plotted on y-axis). ![graph of data and outliers](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4K3Wo.jpg) Is it possible to write some code to allow one to simply click on the outliers and determine their index, or is there any way to do so natively in Mathematica? It would also be possible for me to divide the values plotted on the y-axis by those plotted on the x-axis, but I'm wondering whether there's a general method allowing you to click on to identify outliers on any graph. My code for the graph is as follows (I'm only plotting the first 500 values):               Show[ListPlot[Prepend[Transpose[{experimentalCR[[1 ;; 500]],       theoreticalCR[[1 ;; 500]]}], {0, 0}]], ImageSize -> {500, 500}, AspectRatio -> Full]      A sample of the data can be found here: http://pastebin.com/mA6VxPfw
