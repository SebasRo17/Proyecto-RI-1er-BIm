I have a terminology question. I was searching about tips to design a website that is using less server-side code and more client-side code, and realized I don't really know which exact term to search if there is one. Example: Maximizing CDNs usage for library, using widgets when possible, integration of client-side social-media SDKs. So my question is not about tips themselves, but about the existence of such a term. Edit: I already know about SPAs and Client-Side Javascript Frameworks. This is what brings me to wonder if there's a name to an approach where you focus on client-side code at a point that you maximize external resources.
