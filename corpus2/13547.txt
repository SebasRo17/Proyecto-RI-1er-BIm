I have figures containing several arcs showing the extend of angular measures, and would like to indicate the directions in which angles are measured with arrowheads. How do I add an arrowhead at the "ends" of these arcs? (The "arrowheads" panel in the drawing tools palette is, worryingly, disabled.) For example, I have something like this to start with: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/EVEqD.png) * * *               Show[      Graphics[{Red, Circle[{0, 0}, 1, {0 Degree, 90 Degree}]}],      Graphics[{Blue, Circle[{0, 0}, 1.25, {0 Degree, 270 Degree}]}],      Graphics[{Green, Circle[{0, 0}, 1.5, {0 Degree, 180 Degree}]}]]
