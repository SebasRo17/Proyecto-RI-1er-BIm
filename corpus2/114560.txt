I have always used tabs in all my code (C, C++, python etc.) but I was just going through the Google C++ coding guidelines(1) and I found they they say that you _must_ use spaces and not tabs in your code. I couldn't think of a reason why they ask that. Is it because tabs show inconsistent results across different editors or something similar? Does anyone know what the reason is or might be?
