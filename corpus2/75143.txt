I know it's almost impossible to define and/or measure code quality. Instead of trying to measure it I would like to survey the other developers to see how they _perceive_ the current quality of the code. I would like to stress that I want each developers opinion of the code, not a statistical measure of it. I'm thinking of asking them to rate the code in a few categories like maintainability, consistency, and stability. In addition I'd like to ask them what they think is going well and what they think needs the most improvement. Is this an effective way to get a perception of the code base from the other developers? Am I asking the correct questions? Will this provide useful information or is a useless exercise?
