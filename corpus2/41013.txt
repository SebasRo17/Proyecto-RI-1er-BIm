With the command `ListPlot[data,Joined -> True]` I can visually connect adjacent data points in the array with lines. However, this option appears to be missing in `ListPointPlot3D`? Is there some manner with which to join with to join (with a line) adjacent three-dimensional points? There will be a large number of points in my data structure, and I'd really like to keep the standard output format of `ListPointPlot3D`.
