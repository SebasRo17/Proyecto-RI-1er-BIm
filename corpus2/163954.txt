Are there studies on what effects have programming languages on the brain or for that matter any other artificial languages in general, like mathematics ? Speaking from my personal experience I feel very different every time I speak Italian, I feel like a virtuoso on a quest but at the other end when I coded in machine code in debug.exe I felt like the main charcter in`Ï€(Movie)`. Why do I bring this up because I am suspecting that languages affect your mind and popular legends back this up too often: are full of mathematicians that crossed the Rubicon.
