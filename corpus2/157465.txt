I am currently adding some functionality to a popular open source project. It written in C and in Every file GPL license text is embedded. The functionality I am adding is not supported by the project. So you can say its some sort of extending. My code gets compiled when the main project is compiled. My code is inside the main project and its integrated heavily. Let me explain more thoroughly. Basically I know of two types of linking.   1. My _program_ uses mysql c api. so I link my c code with `libmysqlclient`. Here I am **using** `libmysqlclient`   2. My _code_ adds hash-table functionality on `libmysqlclient` so user can access fields by column name. My project is of second type. Should it be GPL? What about the first scenario (I am curious)?
