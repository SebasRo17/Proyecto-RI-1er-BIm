I have taken a programming course 2 years ago but I haven't worked in programming since then. I recently found a programmer job, but there is no programming team so for me to gain valuable experience from. I am Programming by myself and making changes on a program already made by my Ex-colleague. I need to know what should I do to be on the right track for becoming a professional programmer without a team to take experience from. What are the good practices to improve and what are the bad ones? I'm using VB.Net, ASP.Net and SQL.
