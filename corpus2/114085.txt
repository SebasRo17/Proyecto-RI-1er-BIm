I am working in a software company where we are mostly working on websites which are based on open source like dotnetnuke or `nopcommerce` or any other and i am totally bored with all this as there is no scope for doing something new as most of the code is already done in these open source i know the open source are good for company as they save their time and earn more money but working on open source project is bad from a programmer view ? i learn some good things from these open source also...like entity framework from `nopcommerce` 1.9
