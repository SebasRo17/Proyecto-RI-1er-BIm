Yesterday I had received a great job opportunity. In requirements section I had seen the words:   * solid knowledge of python;   * solid knowledge of java;   * good technical background; Could you give me an answer, what does it mean? How to test my current knowledge? What type of measure will be actually accepted by employer?
