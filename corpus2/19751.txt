I'm trying to separate my document into cell groups, each with their own context (much like the style of code isolation described by the answer here: Localizing variables within a Manipulate), but the I can't get the grouped cells to share a context, even though Notebook's Default Context is set as "Unique to each cell group." I have a simple example. The linked notebook appears as a single cell group (when I look at the grouping bars along the right side of the window), but multiple calls of `Print[$Context]` yield different results. It seems like, once a cell has been created, it's context doesn't change even if I adjust the grouping. What is going on in the simple example I posted, and is there a way to fix these weird context differences/prevent them from happening? Thanks!
