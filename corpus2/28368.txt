I need to be able to import my data and create multiple listlineplots, but my inputs for each plot are very large. I am able to assign variables to each plot and then use GraphicsGrid to view them all, but i have to copy and paste the input for each plot. I am wondering if there is a way to create the plot, store it, then create the next plot and store it along with the first, and so on. This way when i am done creating all plots I can just view them all and compare them together in a grid. I have attempted to use AppendTo, but i am unable to even store two plots, as the first plot is erased in some manner. Here is an example of how I start:                       SetDirectory["Z:\\130709"];             filename = "af.txt";         datafile = Import[filename, "CSV"];             plot = ListLinePlot[datafile]     filename2 ="ai.txt";     datafile2 = Import[filename2,"CSV"];     plot2 = ListLinePlot[datafile2]     AppendTo[plot,plot2]      So I am trying to store the plot, and then my hope is to just change the input filename and continue on to save space. Any help would be appreciated.
