When generating a Sound object by using Sound primitives, like:               Needs["Audio`"]     sound = Sound[ListWaveform[{{1, 1}, {1.496, .7}, {2.501, .3}}, 265, 1]];      how can I get the sample ("amplitude") data which is produced by the Sound primitive at a given sample rate? Obviously one could export `sound` to a wav file and re-import it, but how to do it directly? Or let's say: what is the `Rasterize` function for Sounds, the inverse of `ListPlay`? Sorry for this rather simple question, but I have been looking for some time and could not find anything.
