First of all I want to point out my concern with some pseudocode (I think you'll understand better) Assume you have a global debug flag, or class variable named "debug",               class a :        var debug = FALSE      and you use it to enable debug methods. There are two types of usage it as I know: first in a method :                method a :           if debug then call method b;           method b :      second in the method itself:                method a :             call method b;           method b :           if not debug exit      And I want to know, is there any File IO or stack pointer wise difference between these two approaches. Which usage is better, safer and why?
