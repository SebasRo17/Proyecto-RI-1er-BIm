I'm refactoring some old code. I used really short names for local variables, which I'm coming to regret. **Is there an easy way to rename local variables in scope using Wolfram workbench?** Here is an example How could I change `d` inside `Test`, but not in the `Print` statement?               Test[d_]:=d+1;     (*Some other code*)     Print[d];      Or the same for `l` inside `Module`?               Test1[x_]:=Module[{l},l=x+1];     (*Some other code*)     Print[l];      There is a Ctrl+1 QuickFix rename variable, which I discovered while researching this question, but it seems to work only on the whole file... Using WB 2.0 (anybody even still uses WB 1.1?)
