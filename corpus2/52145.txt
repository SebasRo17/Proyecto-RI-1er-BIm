I just had a technical phone screen w/ a start-up. Here's the technical questions I was asked ... and my answers. **What do think of these answers**? Feel free to post better answers :-) **Question 1** : how would you represent a standard 52 card deck in (basically any language)? How would you shuffle the deck? **Answer** : use an array containing a "Card" struct or class. Each instance of card has some unique identifier... either it's position in the array or a unique integer member variable in the range [0, 51]. Shuffle the cards by traversing the array once from index zero to index 51. Randomly swap ith card with "another card" (I didn't remember how this shuffle algorithm works exactly). Watch out for using the _same_ probability for each card... that's a gotcha in this algorithm. I mentioned the algorithm is from Programming Pearls. **Question 2** : how to represent a large sparse matrix? the matrix can be very large... like 1000x1000... but only a relatively small number (~20) of the entries are non-zero. **Answer** : condense the array into a list of the non-zero entries. for a given entry (i,j) in the array... "map" (i,j) to a single integer k... then use k as a key into a dictionary or hashtable. For the 1000x1000 sparse array map (i,j) to k using something like f(i, j) = i + j * 1001. 1001 is just one plus the maximum of all i and j. I didn't recall exactly how this mapping worked... but the interviewer got the idea (I think). **Are these good answers**? I'm wondering because after I finished the second question the interviewer said the dreaded "well that's all the questions I have for now." Cheers!
