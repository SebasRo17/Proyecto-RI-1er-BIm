I would like to know how can I make a real-valued plot tick pad with a zero to the right of the decimal point on integer values. This is what I have:                Plot[0, {x, 8.5, 9.3},          PlotRange -> {{7.9, 11}, {0, 0}},          Axes -> {True, False},          Ticks -> {Range[0.0, 11.0, N[0.2, 4]]},          PlotStyle -> {Red, Thickness[0.02]}]      The ticks are displayed as `8., 8.2, 8.4, ..., 9., ...`; I want to see them displayed as `8.0, 8.2, 8.4, ..., 9.0, ...`
