I have the code:               theta = 0.1; phi = 0.1;     a = 1 - 3 Sin[theta]^2*Cos[phi]^2;     b = 1 - 3 Sin[theta]^2*Cos[phi - (2 Pi/3)]^2;     c = 1 - 3 Sin[theta]^2*Cos[phi - (4 Pi/3)]^2;     Solve[       a*b*Sin[(Sqrt[3] x - 3 y)/2] ==        a*c*Sin[(Sqrt[3] x + 3 y)/2] ==        -b*c*Sin[Sqrt[3] x],        {x, y}]      which I left running for 10 minutes before aborting. However if I simply replace the constants with their numerical values, aka I replace the last line above by               Solve[       0.965496 Sin[(Sqrt[3] x - 3 y)/2] ==        0.960503 Sin[(Sqrt[3] x + 3 y)/2] ==        -0.984803 Sin[Sqrt[3] x],        {x, y}]      The above runs straight away with no problems. I don't understand why it is doing this. Any pointers?
