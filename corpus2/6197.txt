Say I create a table with three columns of numbers. Is there a way to control the number of significant digits displayed in each column. To make this concrete, take the following command:               Table[{m, Sum[1/2.^n, {n, 1, m}], Sum[1./n, {n, 1, m}]}, {m, 1, 20.}] // TableForm      This produces the following table:               1   0.5         1.     2   0.75        1.5     3   0.875       1.83333     ...     18  0.999996    3.49511     19  0.999998    3.54774     20  0.999999    3.59774      The first column is fine as whole numbers, but I want the second column to have more decimal places, say, eight places, and the third column to have, say, four places. I tried putting one of the `Sum[]` functions inside the `N[]` function, but this had absolutely no effect. Is there another way to individually format each column of output?
