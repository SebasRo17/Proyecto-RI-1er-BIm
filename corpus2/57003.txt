I'm currently stuck on a question for class that asks... "Find a polynomial `p[x]` that you can use to calculate `6 ArcTan[x]` to within an error of no more than `10^(-5)` for all the x's with `-(1/Sqrt[3]) <= x <= 1/Sqrt[3]`." I used a series expansion below.               Clear[x];        approx6arctan[x_] = Normal[Series[6Tan[x], {x, 0, 200}]]      However, this can only generate a function that's accurate only to the fourth decimal, no matter how much I expand the series (200 is already huge). Any hints on how to generate a polynomial that's accurate to the fifth decimal? Thanks in advance.
