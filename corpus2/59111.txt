Many statistical packages provide a "F statistic" and the corresponding p value in their output of a multiple linear regression. I don't find that in the parameters of the Mathematica function `LinearModelFit`. All I can find are the t-statistics for the individual coefficients but no general statistic related to the regression as a whole. I also don't find how to test interactions between predictor variables. Where can I find the general F statistic and see the interactions between my predictor variables?
