This is a question based on this answer by halirutan. Some amazing images can be created with this code, and I was wondering whether it was possible to extend the principle to different shapes. I would like to create images based on the sculptures of Naum Gabo & Barbara Hepworth as shown below: ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7nesm.jpg) ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WM2sp.jpg) Below is an image made with halirutan's code, included to clarify the similarity: ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/l3Auh.gif)               x = 50; drawMe@Table[Mod[i, x], {i, E x}]      My question is threefold really. Is it possible to : * extend this principle to other shapes? * extend this to 3D? * distort the shapes with a mesh distort or similar (see image below)? ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/J4eUz.png)
