So I was reading the flowchart shouldiworkforfree, and I was thinking what does it mean to be given `creative freedom`? as a developer?.. > _"Will they give you creative freedom?"_ For example does it mean, to be given the freedom to design the User Interface/Page on your preferences (and not somebody elses, such as management)? or is it to be given the ability to implement software features without approval?
