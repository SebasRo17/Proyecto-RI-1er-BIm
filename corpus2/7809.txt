Last year I asked how to integrate notebooks to the documentation center in stackoverflow. Back then I was only interested in seeing those notebook and being able to search for them. Unfortunately, it has been painful to write the documentation because of the lack of a good organized stylesheet (Still working on a simple one that does the job). In any case, I would like to revisit part of this question by looking at complete tree of the file organization of a package. In the answers I posted I showed mainly the part for the documentation. ![example](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ogsPR.png) In the picture above I show the folder `SOPackage` which is supposed to be located either in `$UserBaseDirectory` or `$BaseDirectory`. Now that I know a little bit more of stylesheets, palettes and mathlink programs I would like to be able to incorporate them to applications. The question is, can anyone show a a complete tree of an application located in either `$UserBaseDirectory` or `$BaseDirectory` with the folders necessary to make everything work? (By everything I mean, documentation, mathlink/NETlink/LibraryLink programs, stylesheets, palettes and any other thing that you can think of). A place to start is at: http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/tutorial/MathematicaFileOrganization.html But it doesn't seem to have everything. The reason I found out about how to create the structure in the picture above was because of a link acl showed in one of his answers. To clarify again, the question at hand is: Can we show the complete structure of an application in `$UserBaseDirectory` that contains the directories where we put:   1. Documentation   2. Source Code for Mathlink/NETLink/LibraryLink (any other link)   3. Stylesheets   4. Palettes If you can think of anything else that would make the application more complete please add it. At some point I wanted to just ask if it was possible to put stylesheets in an application instead of               $UserBaseDirectory <> "/SystemFiles/FrontEnd/StyleSheets/";      but instead I decided to make a question that can bring all of us the complete file organization for a complete application in _Mathematica_.
