In database schema's, I often notice VARCHAR sizes are rounded to the byte offsets 128/256 or 4096. I've done it before as well, and the idea behind it was probably something with efficiency. However, is there still a valid reason to do so nowadays? I often use '50', '100' or '200' as VARCHAR sizes these days, as they are more natural and typically also shown in validation checks to the user.
