I've been trying to understand the fundamentals of general abstractions and modeling: there are quite a lot of books when you search for abstractions, but most of those seem to be about learning object-oriented programming in a given language. Is there a book out there that's the de-facto standard for describing best practices, design methodologies, and other helpful information about general abstractions and modeling? What about that book makes it special?
