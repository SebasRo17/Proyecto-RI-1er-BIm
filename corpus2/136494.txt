I wonder if there is a better name for a DB API function called `existsByUserNameAndPassword()` which returns boolean. There are more function called like this: `existsByOldId()`... It sounds a little bit unperfect... Is there a better concept for naming "exists" functions? I want to keep the "exists" somehow. To use this functions in a very speakable context like:               if ($DB->existsByUserNameAndPassword($name, $password)) {         // ...     }
