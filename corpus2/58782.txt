How can I write an efficient version of the following statement?               Cases[list, {_, feature_} /; feature < constant]; // AbsoluteTiming      List is of the form, list = {{feature11,feature12},...,{featuren1,featuren2}}. It has a length in the order of 10^5. On my laptop, a Macbook pro from last year it takes around 0.25s. However, I need to evaluate this expression a lot of times. Any suggestion. Thank you.
