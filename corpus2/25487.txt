Something is wrong with my cobweb plot code but I couldn't figure out where do the mistakes come from. So basically we have the iterative map $x_n == x_{n-1}^{2} - 3 \mu$. I would like to draw a cobweb diagram that shows in the range $-\frac{1}{12}<\mu<\frac{1}{4}$ there exists a fixed point $\frac{1}{2}(1-\sqrt{1+12\mu})$. Below are the code and the diagram: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vrHFf.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6mNGh.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/MJM7P.png) My questions are:   1\. Why the diagonal line in the cobweb is not appearing and why is it replaced by a horizontal blue line?   2\. The label on top is wrong and I couldn't fix it.   3\. How can I fix the cobweb code so that I can show, say let $-\frac{1}{12}<\mu=0.2<\frac{1}{4}$ and initial value 2, there is a convergence towards a fixed point $\frac{1}{2}(1-\sqrt{1+12\mu})$. Many thanks. I really appreciate any helps.
