I can't get my head around this. If C is so much used, but C is not C++, can someone explain to me the most important reasons that makes C more used than C++ ? Where is all this C code written for ? Is this about the industrial sector which heavily rely on imperative programming but can't support the cost of implementing or tuning C++ compilers ? Are there that many kernel hackers ? Is tiobe relevant ? I never stumbled into any article or post commenting or explaining how singular tiobe's ranking is, and what it actually says about what the industry likes, and what it can tell about what the industry actually uses, to pinpoint the industry real needs. It's hard to explain. I just find it odd many companies want C#, php, java jobs, and not C or C++ jobs (just relating my unemployment and my interviews here) even if those C/C++ jobs are crap. I would take those instead. Or does this mean language hype plays a strong role here ?
