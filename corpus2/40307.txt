There were some related questions to this one, but in this case we have the function value, the first derivative and the second derivative all equal (that was actually the problem I was solving). We have:               f[x_] := Piecewise[{{3 x^2 - 3 x + 1, x >= 1}, {x^3, x < 1}}]     Plot[f[x], {x, 0, 1.5}]      The answer in those other questions was to use "Exclusions -> None" and it can be used here, but why is this happening since we are good in all derivative information? **Update** Some examples of the related questions are:   * Why does Plot leave gaps in the graph of a continuous function?   * Plot showing discontinuity where it shouldn't   * Mathematica plots a discontinuity in piecewise function that does not exist
