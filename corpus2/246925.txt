I am reading a book called "NoSQL distilled" by Martin Fowler and he writes: > Aggregates can also be used to obtain analytics; for example, an aggregate > update may fill in information on which Orders have a given Product in them. > This denormalization of the data allows for fast access to the data we are > interested in and is the basis for Real Time BI or Real Time Analytics where > enterprises donâ€™t have to rely on end-of-the-day batch runs to populate data > warehouse tables and generate analytics; now they can fill in this type of > data, for multiple types of requirements, when the order is placed by the > customer. But he doesn't explain why can't I do the same things with relational databases and how does the denormalization help to solve this task. Do aggregate and/or denormalization help in implementing Real Time BI and why? What does Fowler mean here? (By aggregates he means documents in databases like MongoDB or other records of data in other databases that have nested structure instead of atomic values and foreign keys)
