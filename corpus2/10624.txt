$$ e^{\pi \sqrt{163}} \approx 262537412640768743.99999999999925 $$               E^(Pi Sqrt[163.0])     N[E^(Pi Sqrt[163.0]), 35]     NumberForm[E^(Pi Sqrt[163.]), 35]      returns               2.6253741*10^17     2.6253741*10^17     2.625374126407682*10^17      That's not the 35 digits I expected. OTOH,               N[Pi* E, 35]      returns 35 digits,               8.5397342226735670654635508695465745      but then               NumberForm[Pi*E*1., 35]      again doesn't:               8.53973422267357      So I'm confused. Why doesn't one `N[]` what the other one does? In the documentation: > **NumberForm** [ _expr_ , _n_ ]   >  prints with approximate real numbers in _expr_ given to _n_ -digit > precision. I read this three times, slowly, went for a cup of tea, and read it again. But 15 isn't 35, or is it?
