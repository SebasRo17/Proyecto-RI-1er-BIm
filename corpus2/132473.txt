I'm just doing a course in communication where we code a server and write design documents. Most of the server is already coded, and from the information given in the assignment we just try to fill in the blanks. I'm not really the team leader, but my two teammates are very passive. We often interpret the assignment differently, and I don't understand their thinking very well which frustrates everyone. I try to explain to them my point of view and acknowledge theirs, but after awhile they just give in to me. I want them to understand me, not give in. Teammate A seems to look defeated after we argue, and he gets emotional when frustrated. Should I be more gentle? We all code together. Sometimes I get lost while coding and after a few hours I have no idea what my teammates have done. I ask them what they are doing from time to time but I don't want to be too controlling. Also I'm confused as to which parts should be mine and which parts are my teammates. If a functionality that they need to code ends up having to use my function and change my function a bit, do I have to code the part that will be in my function?
