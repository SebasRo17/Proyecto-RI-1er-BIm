We've went ahead and purchased Microsoft Dynamics (see edit history for why) in order to write 2 functions to interact with one tiny part of it to fulfill one big need. What I want to know is, from other programmers who have integrated their software with MS Dynamics GP. Is there any way to connect with it (fully) without having to write an interface in C#? We want to use GP SOAP services so we can communicate to it from Delphi and eventually Java, but it seems like the only way we're going to be able to maximize it's usefulness is to write some sort of middleware program in C#.
