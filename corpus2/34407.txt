I wish to generate a surface intensity plot of an Airy disk (or perhaps a two- dimensional Gaussian approximation to an Airy disk) on an (x, y)-plane at a specified coordinate. The hope is to have something like this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Airy-3d.svg with solid surface coloration. I am OK with a decent mesh approximation of a representative curve. Is there a built in method of generating these sorts of intensity plots and treating them like Graphics3D objects that can be translated and placed as desired?
