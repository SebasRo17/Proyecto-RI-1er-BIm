Google's doc on async tasks assumes knowledge of the difference between regular and asynchronously added tasks. > `add_async(task, transactional=False, rpc=None)`   >  Asynchronously add a Task or a list of Tasks to this Queue. How is adding tasks asynchronously different to adding them regularly. I.e. what is the difference between using `add(task, transactional=False)` and `add_async(task, transactional=False, rpc=None)` I've heard that adding tasks regularly **blocks** certain things. Any explanation of what it blocks and how, and how **async** tasks don't block would be greatly appreciated.
