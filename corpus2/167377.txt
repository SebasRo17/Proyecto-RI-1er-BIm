Based on many sources I do not believe the simple definition that aim of testing is to find as many bugs as possible - we test to ensure that it works or that it does not. E.g. followint are goals of testing form ISTQB:   1. Determine that (software products) satisfy specified requirements ( I think its verificication)   2. Demonstrate that (software products) are fit for purpose (I think that is validation)   3. Detect defects  I would agree that testing is verification, validation and defect detection. Is that correct?
