I'm working in a creation of a new system that should be able to change the presentation layer without trouble, also be able to comport web-services, shop areas, internal control of data, creation of reports, multiple web portals, etc. Following this post about the "benefits of multiple Projects and One Solution" on Stackoverflow also in some self-experience I came with the idea of the following structure.   * TestProject.BLL (Business)   * TestProject.DAL (Persistence (Mappings, Conventions etc))   * TestProject.WEB (Presentation Layer)   * TestProject.BASE (Framework) But, after some search on the web, I found that those project are **not** always the type of " **ASP.NET Web Application** ". * * * My question is, what are the types that I should create each project? Should I build them as " **Windows Forms Application** " or what?
