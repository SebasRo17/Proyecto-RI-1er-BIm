I work in a company that sells SaaS web applications for HR and financial issues. Our customers are key accounts to which we guarantee the privacy of their data, for obvious reasons. We need to make usage statistics of our applications by its customers (which links are clicked the most? Which browsers are used the most? What is the average screen resolutions? etc). I personally use Google Analytics on my sites. GA is a very powerful and complete solution for this. But it raises questions of privacy.   * Have you already had this problem?   * Were you able to impose on your customers? how?   * If not, did you use an alternative? or did you develop your own measurement tools of statistics?
