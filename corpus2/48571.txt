My colleagues and I are a bunch of scientists (i.e., untrained in programming) hacking code for data processing. Is there a concise and simple reference that documents idioms, conventions, or guidelines for organizing code? For instance:   1. conventions for using global variables   2. documenting code that is distributed to others (e.g., at least listing all functions contained within a code document at the top of the file) and so on? I'm aware that this is big field and can get into security, unit testing, refactoring, and all these issues, but hopefully there is some primer out there that covers the bare minimum with (extremely) little programming experience? **Edit:** Thanks all -- I aware there are language specific guidelines for (and debates over) use of parentheses, camelcasing (or not) variable names, etc. but I was hoping for basic conventions that apply to most languages. **Edit2:** To narrow it down, these are mostly imperative or procedural languages (e.g., Fortran but one in particular that a lot of my colleagues use is a DSL called IGOR Pro by Wavemetrics if anyone has heard of this one).
