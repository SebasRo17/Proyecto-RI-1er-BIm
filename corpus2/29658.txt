Let's say I print a cell like so.               CellPrint@Cell[       BoxData[" "], "Input", Evaluatable -> True,        CellEvaluationFunction -> Function[Print[#];]       ]      Now I type in several lines of text in the `Cell` in _Mathematica_. For example               1               2      I hit `Shift`+`Enter` and get the following output.               BoxData[List["1","3"]]      But when I do `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`e`, the `Cell`s content is really               BoxData[       RowBox[{" ",           RowBox[{            "1", "\[IndentingNewLine]", "\[IndentingNewLine]", "3"}]}]]      Why doesn't `CellEvaluationFuction` receive the actual cell data? Is there a hidden function/argument that might give me such information?
