I have a very large array like the following:               {{1,10},{8,9},{9,20},{34,40},{41,42},{43,50},{47,53},...};      Now, imagine that every element in the array corresponds to an integer interval. I'd like to delete elements in the array that fall within a larger interval, and whenever there is an interval-interval overlap, I'd like to shrink the intersecting intervals to eliminate the overlap and then add the former section where the overlap occurred as a new element to a separate array (here I'm calling this `overlapArray`). Perhaps this is best explained by example. Looking at the smaller case:               {{1,10},{8,9},{9,20},{34,40}...}      We notice that there is an overlap between the first three elements of the array, and that the element `{8,9}` falls entirely in this overlap section. So we this array becomes the following after our procedure:               {{1,7},{11,20},{34,40}...}          overlapArray = {{8,10}};      Now for the full example, this:               {{1,10},{8,9},{9,20},{34,40},{41,42},{43,50},{47,53},...};      Becomes:               {{1,7},{11,20},{34,40},{41,42},{43,46},{51,53}          overlapArray = {{8,10},{47,50}};      Is there an elegant way to do this with list operations in Mathematica v9?
