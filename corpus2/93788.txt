I am working with ASP.NET Application. The application is great and works fine but it a few flaws. To give you an example,   1. Every control uses an absolute position layout. This makes working with code very difficult in design mode. Absolute position has been used more than 700 times in the code.   2. There are different menus uses instead of one. And to stitch them together, again absolute position is used for each menu control   3. The application is role based. All the roles are implemented using Roles.IsUserInRole property. I would like to use proper permission for every role with page level permission.   4. There are a few security risk in the current code but that is easy fix in current program though.   5. There is no true admin. The top level role act as admin which is also a functional role, used by other members. Now that we are adding new functionality to this code and I mean adding some big functionality, what do you recommend. Should I rewrite this code or work in the existing. I would esp like to fix   1. The layout issues. Remove all fixed positions and make the code clean and easy to maintain.   2. Unfortunately to do so I have to rewrite the menu. Because I want to write one menu instead of 4 being used.   3. In order to achieve point 2 above, I have to crete new roles and provide proper security for the application. My question is **Should I work with the current code or rewrite the existing code keeping in mind that our company is growing and that it may take me 2-4 weeks to do rewrite up.** Would it be bad idea or a good one. I don't have a technical lead in my company.
