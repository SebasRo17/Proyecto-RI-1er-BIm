I have been a software developer for approximately 9 years, starting with part-time work during my graduation year at uni. During these years I worked for number of companies, sometimes changing places twice or three times a year. They say it takes 10 years to reach 'expert' level, and while I don't think I am an expert by any measure and I have certainly met lots of people who are more knowledgeable, smarter and more focused than I am, I think I can safely say that I had my fair share of the whole programming trade and would like to move on to something else. I still enjoy programming, discovering new techniques and learning new technologies, although it got kind of repetitive - I can already see patterns in this process. It was fun to crack open things like say python, node.js, HTML5 etc. but after some time it lost its appeal. Psychology and behaviour was always something I was interested in, especially the practical, applicable bits of it. Recently I've been to some communication skills training and I realised that I have been missing out on the great deal of fun stuff - how people work and communicate, especially in subconscious, non-verbal area. Currently I am thinking of making a career change - ideally to move somewhere my technical skill would still be beneficial in some shape or form, or at least could serve as a bridge while I am transitioning there, you know, the whole gradual, bit-by-bit approach versus swim-or-drown one. I would like to hear your thoughts on this matter and to learn from you what are the possible transitions I can take.
