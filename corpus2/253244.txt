~~I see some evidence (F#) online that functional programming is penetrating enterprise.~~ Where I work we primarily develop VB.NET WinForms applications. The .NET infrastructure for developing WinForms apps is built on OO concepts (classes owning methods) -- think of how a combo box is defined. As a result, it does not appear that even when using F# one is able to embrace the functional paradigm. The examples I find have F# falling back to OO style. Is anyone aware of examples where an enterprise has adopted pure functional style for the development of GUIs? This speaker talks about immediate-mode GUIs which would seem a good fit for the functional paradigm. React.js and Elm language are good fits, but not adopted by "enterprise." I am not aware of an enterprise that is doing truly functional GUIs. I am wondering if pure FP is suited to the task and if someone could direct me to source code examples. I have a hunch that enterprise has long ago taken the OO road and so OO is what the GUI platforms were built on. If FP had been as widely used we'd have the FP GUI libs too.
