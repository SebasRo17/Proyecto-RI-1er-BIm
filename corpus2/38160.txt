I read "for what right-hand sides $b=(a,b,c)$ does $Ax=b$ have a solution", but that question pertains to solving for the unknown vector. I'd like a record of all of the row operations required to put a matrix in reduced row echelon form without LU Decomposition. When I input `RowReduce[{{3, 1, a}, {2, 1, b}}]`, Mathematica returns:   `{{1, 0, a - b}, {0, 1, -2 a + 3 b}}` Howbeit, when I input RowReduce[{{1, 2, r_1}, {2, 3, r_2}, {2, 4, r_3}, {2, 5, r_4}}], Mathematica doesn't manifest explicitly the resource vector $(r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4)$ in :   `{{1, 0, 0}, {0, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 1}, {0, 0, 0}}` ?   How can I oblige it to, whenever matrices are input and not only for this one?
