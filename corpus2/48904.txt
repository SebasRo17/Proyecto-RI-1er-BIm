I was playing around with the printing options because at first my notebook's printout was strangely way too large. However, after apparently solving the problem, now I noticed that when I print out this test graph (adapted from here), the labels and axis titles got smushed in when printing even though they show up fine in both the Working and Printout environment. I tried to remove the formatting of the graph (ImageSize->400, LabelStyle->14, RotateLabel->False) so that MMA would print the graph the best way it sees fit, but that didn't solve the probe Any idea what might have caused this behavior?               energy[theta_, speed_, m_, g_, len_] :=        m g len (1 - Cos[theta]) + (1/2) m len^2 speed^2;          m = 1; g = 9.8; len = 10;          data = Table[        energy[i, j, m, g, len], {j, -4, 4, .01}, {i, -3 Pi, 3 Pi, Pi/20.}];          ListContourPlot[data, InterpolationOrder -> 2, Contours -> 20,       MaxPlotPoints -> 30, DataRange -> {{-3 Pi, 3 Pi}, {-4, 4}},       FrameTicks -> {{{-4, -3, -2, -0, 1, 2, 3, 4},          None}, {{-3 Pi, -2 Pi, -Pi, 0, Pi, 2 Pi, 3 Pi}, None}},       FrameLabel -> {{"\[Theta]'(t)", None}, {"\[Theta](t)",          "constant energy levels for nonlinear pendulum model"}}]      ![Smushed in label](http://i.stack.imgur.com/lj9pM.jpg)
