I used my photo camera to "scan" a heavy dictionary. I tried to have flat images by pressing the margins of the pages with my fingers. The color of the background is (normally) black and my fingers have different colors from the color of the page margins. My questions is: Is it possible to apply Mathematica photo tools to automatically remove the finger tips from the scanned pages? For experiments, you can freely use the following photo               img = Import["http://i.stack.imgur.com/oY9cp.jpg"]      ![photo](http://i.stack.imgur.com/oY9cp.jpg)
