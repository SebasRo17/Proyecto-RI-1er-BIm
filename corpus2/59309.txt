I am a mobile developer in my day job. During my free time (nights and weekends), I develop my personal hobby projects. After I have published my iPhone apps, my company told me they own all rights to any technology related stuff that I create during my term. I read the contract, it is true, it is harsh. Is there better company policy on developing hobby projects? What's yours?
