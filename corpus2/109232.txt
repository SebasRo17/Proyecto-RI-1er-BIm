Looking back on Microsoft's BUILD conference and everything that came out of it, I'm not sure what direction I'm supposed to take as a developer? If I understood it right MS is putting HTML5 before WPF, Silverlight and Flash, and there's also talk about WinRT and Metro UI. I'm going to buy a couple of courses in the winter but I'm not sure what to choose? **I KNOW**   WinForms   MVC3   LINQ   CSS2   jQuery   json **LEARNING**   HTML5   CSS3 What else?
