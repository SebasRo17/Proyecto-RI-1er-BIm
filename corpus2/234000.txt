I'm not too experienced in the regard of configuring IIS/ASP.net. A client has asked me to extend the functionality of a custom web application I didn't develop. Unfortunately, they don't have the original Visual Studio project/source code. I'm trying to pull the application off of their production IIS server and configure it for development on my machine. I've already setup a new website instance in IIS on my machine and copied the code to it's directory. When I access it (`http://localhost`), I'm currently receiving a null reference in the application. Obviously, this is a pretty generic error the can be caused by a bug, but I feel it's related to IIS's configuration. I've made sure both sites are using the same .NET version and they are also both running in integrated pipeline mode. Any ideas on what else I should look into? Production server: Server 2008 R2 (64bit), IIS 7.5 Development machine: Win7 (64bit), IIS 7.5
