Consider the following limit.               Limit[(a - Sqrt[a^2 + x])/(a^2 - a*Sqrt[a^2 - x]), x -> 0, Assumptions -> {a > 0}]      Mathematica 9.0.1.0 gives `-1/a`, which is the correct answer. Notice that this limit is not trivial to compute, because both the numerator and denominator vanish when `x=0`. Therefore, L'Hopital's rule is required here. Now remove the assumption.               Limit[(a - Sqrt[a^2 + x])/(a^2 - a*Sqrt[a^2 - x]), x -> 0]      For this, Mathematica gives `1/a`, which is incorrect for general `a` (although it is correct for `a<0`). Is this last result a bug, or am I missing something?
