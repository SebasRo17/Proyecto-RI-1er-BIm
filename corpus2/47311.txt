It seem there's this promising function in the callback object provided to MathLink C functions:               struct st_WolframLibraryData     {         /* ... */         int (*evaluateExpression)(WolframLibraryData, char *, int, mint, void *);         /* ... */     };      If this does what it seems it does, it would save the boring and lengthy code that comes with managing a `MLINK` object for some purpose. But I'm lost at interpreting the arguments (and if the second one is supposedly the string to execute, why is it not `const`?).
