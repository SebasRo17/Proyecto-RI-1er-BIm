I am a sandwich training student in a company that has a little informatics service who develop web app Until today, they work with simple php, a little CSS and no version control. So, the code becomes unmaintainable. The project manager would like to use php object, and i am the only one with some knows in it. But i am still a beginner with no experience in web dev, and after some search i am afraid to building a php MVC alone. So my question is : Should i convince the team to start using a framework like symfony ( i'm feeling ok to use it ) with the big change it impose to the team, or simply bring a better work structure with version control and tools like an ORM ? Thanks for your help EDITED : with the hope it's now understandable
