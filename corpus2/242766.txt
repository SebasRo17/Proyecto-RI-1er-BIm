Assume we are getting some statistics from a customer which we analyse and we send our comments to the customer. Now, the customer tells us that the statistic they computed between January and March are based on a wrong methodology and sends us corrected series. We want perform analysis with the wrong and with the correct set of data, which are huge and only differ from January to March, so that we want to avoid data duplication. Therefore, we need something like _synthetic database records_ implementing the following logic:               synthetic[1] = wrong_data     synthetic[2] = correct_data between Januar and March, wrong_data otherwise      With this, we can easily perform our analyses on synthetic records. Should such synthetic records be implemented in the application logic or on the side of the database? What are common pitfalls of such an implementation?
