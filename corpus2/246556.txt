I'm wondering if anyone knows of a language that supports automatic- evaluation. (not sure this is the right term. so let me describe what I mean below) For example, a program asks for an `int` as its input, one can give it `2 + 2`, which evaluates to an `int` with value `4`. Of course, one can certainly make a program that accepts this using any language, but I'm wondering if there is any language that natively supports this. What are the plus and down sides of this? P.S: My "ultimate" goal is to decide whether to do this in a language that I'm designing. So I'd appreciate any input especially with regard to design.
