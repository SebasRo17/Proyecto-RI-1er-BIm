Inspired by Implement Sleep Sort: > Sleep Sort is an integer sorting algorithm I found on the Internet.

I would like to know if it is possible to implement this in _Mathematica_. As a version 7 user I would of course like to see a solution that works there, but I think that `RunScheduledTask` may be needed to accomplish this.
