o create a scoring system with time and correct answers for a game? up vote 0 down vote favorite I have a small mobile quiz game, which consists of 30 questions, and a timer which starts from 0 seconds, and goes all the way up to 1 hour. Below you can see that my timer starts from 0, and it is displayed in the format of MM:SS.               var timestamp = new Date(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);          function pad(n) { return ("0" + n).slice(-2); }          Number.prototype.pad = function (len) {         return (new Array(len+1).join("0") + this).slice(-len);     }      So, what I actually need is, some kind of formula, or system in order to receive a final score. So the more correct answers a user has, and the faster finishes the quiz, the more points gets. I know that this is kind of unrelated question for this forum, but I'm kind of stuck. I would like to hear your opinions, about the scoring system. So the smallest score should be 0, and the highest, well no limit.
