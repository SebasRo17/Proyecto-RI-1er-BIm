I'm reading Ralph Kimball's books and I'm currently exploring the following data warehouse schema. ![AdventureWorks 2008 Data Warehouse Schema](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GydiG.png) Are both dimension & fact tables populated during the data warehouse creation/update? How often? What about the DimDate table? Do we populate it with all possible dates or only with date used by facts tables? **What is the standard process of generating a data warehouse?**
