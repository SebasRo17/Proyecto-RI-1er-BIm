My question is very simple: Can I use a CPOL project within a MS-PL project? I would like to add a CPOL project to my MS-PL solution, modify it and use it as a tool which helps me compiling my project. I found this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/hGqHO.png) I personally would say, that the CPOL should be compatible with the MS-PL. But I've got nearly no experience with licenses and I am no layer. So I would be really thankful if anyone could tell me whether I am right that the CPOL is compatible with the MS-PL.
