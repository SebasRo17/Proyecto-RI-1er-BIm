I am currently in a Data analaysis job and I am using mainly SPSS (Statistics) and a rather unknown scripting language to make nice tables. My problem is, that there are multiple script files for both programs with thousands of lines of code. Currently, they are copied each month to a new folder, modified as needed and executed. Predictabely, there are a lot of copy and paste errors and searching for the start of an error is a huge pain. I was thinking about source control, but I am not really familiar which one meetes the following criteria: 1\. checkin from the windows explorer or Notepad++ 2\. Committing to the same project from different folders. 3\. Has anybody good ideas or best practice suggestions? I am using a little bit SVN for several small C# programs - but is there a better tool for Source code management under theese circumstances?
