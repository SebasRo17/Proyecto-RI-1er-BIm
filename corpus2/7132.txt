This being the Q number 2K in the site, and this being the day we got the confirmation of mathematica.se graduating soon, I think a celebration question is in order. So... What is the fastest way to compute the happy prime number 2000 in Mathematica? **Edit** Here are the **Timing[ ]** results so far:                {"JM",      {5.610, 137653}}      {"Leonid",  {5.109, {12814, 137653}}}      {"wxffles", {4.11, {12814, 137653}}}      {"Rojo",    {0.765, {12814, 137653}}}      {"Rojo1",   {0.547, {12814, 137653}}}
