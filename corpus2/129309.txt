Back in the 80s colleges were teaching Pascal because it is easy to learn, while myself and many others like me were learning BASIC because it was not only easy to learn but accessible and also fashionable (for an extremely liberal definition of fashion) It has just occurred to me that empirical data on the actual programming languages kids are choosing to use should be a good indicator of which language would be the ideal first choice for educators. Please note that this question is not "what do you think is a good programming language for kids?"
