I have some data of type `{{x1, y1, f1}, {x2, y2, f2}, ...}` and want to do `ListContourPlot`. However, there is a problem that the data `f` is not smooth enough and has small errors. Here is a toy example illustrating the problem:               data = Flatten[         Table[{i (1 + RandomReal[0.1]), j (1 + RandomReal[0.1]),           i + j}, {i, 0, 100}, {j, 0, 100}], 1];     ListContourPlot[data, Contours -> {80, 120}, ContourShading -> None]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/g4ndv.png) I would need to smooth the lines in the above curve, to get something like ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ueqyd.png) Any ideas to get this kind of smoothed plot? Thanks! And here is the figure from real data (which is too large to paste here), which I need to smooth: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zSztT.png) I find this thread InterpolationOrder for ContourPlot related. But I was unable to get the method work in my case because of (I guess) different input. **Note added:** Thanks a lot for the answers! Those answers works great for the toy example, but for the real data I still cannot get smooth lines so far (edit: so far means before the great guys update their answers ^_^. Now it worked great). Here is my data and plotting function, just in case you would like to give a try. I will also investigate why those interesting methods fail to work when I apply it to data... https://www.dropbox.com/s/2pgobgrhbo42f4v/contourData.dat               data = << "contourData.dat";     ListContourPlot[data, Contours -> {2.30, 6.18},       ContourShading -> None]
