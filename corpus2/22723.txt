After bashing my head against the brick wall that is XAML, I've decided to come here and ask other people if they are as frustrated as I am. So,   * Do you like XAML? Please justify.   * Is XAML the problem, or the lack of good tools? My issue could be resolved if the binding system gave me a file-line number location of the binding that's failing. This isn't a XAML issue so-much-as a debugger issue. Apart from the issues with tooling, I find that XML does not make a suitable programming language, and that XAML has workarounds to fix things that wouldn't have been a problem in any other "real" programming language. For example, string formatting on a binding. XAML also breaks when you need to step outside the hierarchical structure for things like context menus. Because they are defined within the xaml hierarchy people assume that they are part of the visual hierarchy too, which is not the case. This can lead to subtle binding issues, which are difficult to debug etc. As a comparison, HTML-CSS-Javascript works well because each part handles a specific part of displaying a web page. HTML for data and layout, CSS for style, and Javascript for execution. In contrast, XAML is trying to do everything and fails. Please note, I love WPF, so don't take this as a critisism of WPF, Silverlight or any particular WPF/Silverlight control. I'm only interested in a discussion about the XAML language.
