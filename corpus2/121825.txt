I have learned in Agile Development that: > Refactoring is the process of clarifying and simplifying the design of > existing code, without changing its behavior. I have heard about some GUI refactoring tools like ReSharper and DevExpress Refactor Pro! Here are my questions:   1. How does it takes place in the Software development process and how far it effects the system?   2. Does Refactoring using these tools really speed up the process of development/maintenance?
