Recently I worked on developing a new component with a coworker. I would say that our contributions were about a 80/20 split, myself having contributed 80% of the work toward the component. My coworker likes to spam the other developers in the department with information and updates about whatever he's been working on, including e-mails specifically discussing our new component. This behavior has resulted in my coworkers (including management) mistakenly believing that he is the primary and most authoritative contact for discussions about this component, despite the fact that he was the minority contributor. I feel that his constant updates have given him a higher profile than me with respect to this project. Can I recover from this, and if so, how do I do it? I don't think that out-spamming the spammer would be effective, nor do I like adding additional noise to my colleagues' inboxes. **EDIT:** Thanks for the answers so far, they are all really good. To help clarify the situation I'd like to follow up with some additional info about his communication. First of all, he typically does not tell me when he's about to send out an e-mail, much less run it by me for review before sending it out; I am unaware of these messages until they arrive in my inbox. Secondly, there has been more than one occasion where his communication contains information that is outright incorrect; he is not familiar with some of the code that he is discussing. I wouldn't mind him being the point of contact if it wasn't for the fact that he is essentially being given credit for the project because of it. Management is perceiving the situation as if he was the one who wrote the 80% and I wrote the 20%, when in reality it's the other way around.
