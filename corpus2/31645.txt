I am trying to solve a maximization problem, where my variable can only take a limited number of values. (Probably) the easiest example would be               dom = {0, 1/2}; NMaximize[{x^2, Element[x, dom]}, {x}]      While the `Element[x,dom]` syntax works just fine for `dom = Integers`, I keep getting error messages for any other domain. (edit: this seems to be because my chosen domain is invalid to use with âˆˆ) edit: I also tried the `MemberQ` syntax as stated below:               dom = {0, 1/2}; NMaximize[{x^2, MemberQ[dom, x]}, {x}]      This seems to be an acceptable constraint, but for some reason _Mathematica_ seems unable to find a value that meets the constraint, as I get the following message: > NMaximize::nsol: There are no points that satisfy the constraints {False}. Any other ideas? edit: just to clarify. I need to restrict the variable(s) to a finite set of real numbers, hence I cannot use ">=/<=" constraints to get the job done. The above is just the simplest application I could think of.
