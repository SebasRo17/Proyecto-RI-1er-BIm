I am looking forward to develop a desktop application using python. I am a beginner and I do not have sufficient expertise in python. I am a java programmer. Although I have some experience in building UIs using swings, I see that apps developed on swings are too damn slow. Well this might be one reason why many of the major implementations are done in C/C++ as in browsers/games etc. Developing a UI in C++ might be a better option but I prefer to chose a high level programming language over C/C++. So I have opted for python presuming that it would perform well over java swings as python itself is natively build on C/C++. So can I go ahead with this assumption that python is better than java swings to develop a UI? Or do you suggest a language that is better than python to develop UIs? If at all I go ahead with python, which toolkit should I use Tkinter or wxPython and why? please help me.
