I know of lots of software that is open-source. For at least some of it, someone, somewhere must have written the first version alone. How does good open-source software become well known? I'm most interested in the first steps. How does software written by one person gain its first new contributors? I'm looking for practical advise. I've started a project here, called aodbm. What steps can I take to give it the best possible start?
