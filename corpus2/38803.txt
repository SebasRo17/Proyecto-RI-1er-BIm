I have a long list of triples, each looking something like `{AGO, 1988, 2345.23}`. Some of these, however, have an integer in the third spot, like this: `{IND, 1993, 4345}` because of the nature of the original data. I do not want integers, because I have to Log this data eventually. So I thought I would map the following function through my list:               fn[s_List] :=  s //. {a_, b_, c_} /; IntegerQ[c] -> {a, b, N[c]}      It does not work. I want it to put "4345." in place of "4345". However, I can use the following to get a very good approximation:               fnn[s_List] :=  s //. {a_, b_, c_} /; IntegerQ[c] -> {a, b, c-.00001}      But, even though the loss of precision is not important for this project, I'd like to know why my first function does not work. I have been working with these kinds of replacement rules a lot recently, and this one seems pretty simple. Any help is very much appreciated.
