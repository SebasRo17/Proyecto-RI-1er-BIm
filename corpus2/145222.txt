I have a .NET library, with some WebControls. These webControls have Embed Resources.   And we declare them like it, in all webcontrols for each cs file: Something like this:                [assembly: WebResource("IO.Css.MyCSS.css", "text/css")]         namespace MyNamespace.MyClass         {              [ParseChildren(true)]              [PersistChildren(false)]              [Designer(typeof(MyNamespace.MyClassDesigner))]              public class QuickTip : Control, INamingContainer              {             //My code...               }         }      Would it be a good idea to create a cs file and include all WebResource declarations there? Example a cs file with just:                    [assembly: WebResource("IO.Css.MyCSS.css", "text/css")]          [assembly: WebResource("IO.Image.MyImage.png", "image/png")]     //And many other WebResources of all WebControls of the Assembly
