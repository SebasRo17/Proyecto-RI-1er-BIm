We've all been there - a product feature is called "gold", and then a week before launch they decide it is to be called "platinum". Luckily, you had some nous about you so the UI code is easy to change. But...what about all the variables and methods? Sure, you could change all these but what about the testing time? Obviously Resharper or some other enterprise level refactoring tool may help but how do you sell a zero-value proposition to the business? After all, that text change on the front screen is just a 2 minute job - right?
