In order to provide a more comprehensive educations for computer science students at my old university, I'm trying to develop an open source group they can contribute to. What should I be looking for in project ideas so that they provide the maximum educational value for students who aren't very experienced in real-world projects? What should I be avoiding when deciding what to do?
