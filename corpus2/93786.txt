### Background Over the past 2 years, we have built us a decent team of developers. The CEO of the company and myself have been working closing to make sure we are moving done a good path. As our department as grown, I've been telling the owner we need a manager/director over us that understands technology, but can lead the company on more of the business aspects of running an interactive development shop. He's gone out and done just that, I didn't get to meet the man before his first day, but quickly got his CV. He had owned a company in the late 90's that was bought out and has been working as a consultant since then. Most of his knowledge was in large corporate systems. We build web applications and sites for medium sized companies. And that is where the issues are starting to crop up. He's brought up on several occasions our need to switch to Flash, Oracle and J++ for the sites and applications we are building. Versus the LAMP stack we are using now for 90% of our development. The new guy is very smart when it comes to the business side of technical projects, but he is trying to lead the technical direction. And he and I aren't seeing eye-to-eye for a couple of upcoming projects. ### Question Now, I don't want to go into the issues with those comments. I want to ask how I, as the Senior Developer, can work with our new Director to ensure the success of our department within this company. While also keeping our developers happy, and working with the technologies that we enjoy, and are comfortable with.
