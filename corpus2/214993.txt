I saw how Struts 1 lasted from 2000 to 2013. I hear that people are moving from Struts 2 to Spring. But for a project that may need to be maintained for a decade or two, would it be advisable to opt for a framework or directly code with `servlets` and `jquery`? Can a system architecture really be designed keeping in mind a particular framework? **What really is the market life of a framework? Do the creators of the framework create it with the assumption that it would become obsolete in a decade?**
