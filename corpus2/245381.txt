Does anyone have a good mental model or metaphor for functional programming which references something in the real world? Object Oriented programing intuitively makes sense to me. There are things that have properties and sometimes they also can do stuff or perform calculations on their properties (methods). (Ex: Car, Shape, Cat). I bear functional programming no ill will whatsoever and I am not interested in a debate about the virtues of the two. I just need a metaphor or mental model to work with as I have with Object Oriented programming. What are some good mental models or real world metaphors for programming in a functional paradigm? There is something about functions composed of functions processing functions which leaves one without a firm place to stand and cogitate.
