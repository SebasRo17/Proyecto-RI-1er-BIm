There is a project that is written in python which works great and is under the BSDv3 license. I wanted to use it as a base template for a ruby project instead of starting from scratch. I'd be refactoring (converting) the code from python to ruby, as if the author wrote a ruby gem along with his python library. My question is what proper credit should be given to the python lib author?   Just mention that the gem is based off the python lib or more extensive?
