When I was using the modernizr file, I came across this problem where in I need to source a file and call the script.               <script src="js/modernizr-min.js"></script>     <script>     if (!Modernizr.input.placeholder){           $('input[placeholder], textarea[placeholder]').placeholder();     }     </script>        Why is that the script does not work when embedded within the same script tag. I have across this situation many time, but failed to understand what causes this problem. Is that the scripts have to be written in two different script tags to make it work or else what fails it.
