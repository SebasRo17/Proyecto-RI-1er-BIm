Currently I do a lot of development on my free time to improve my productivity at work. I've got around 50 man hours of unpaid work into a few pieces of software, but I'd rather not have them end up on work computers until they're licensed to prevent redistribution without my permission. Of course, I'm not charging them or anything. I just want to make sure I'm protected legally in the event they decide to try and package it and sell it as their own. I made sure before starting that I didn't sign any agreement that they own everything I work on for the remainder of the time I spend at this company. I would like an in-house licensing solution. IANAL, so writing a license wouldn't be the best thing I could do. Are there any free, copy-pastable, licensing solutions (copy-pastable in the way the GPL is copy-pastable) that explicitly prevent redistribution without my permission?
