I've often searched for answers relating to " **best practice** " when writing code. And I see many questions regarding what is best practice. However, I was thinking the other day. Who actually determines what this best practice is? Is it the owners or creators of the programming language. Is it the general developer community that is writing in the language and it's just a gut feeling consensus. Is it whoever seems to have the highest prestige in the developer world and shouts the loudest? Is best practice really just another term for personal opinion? I hope this is a constructive question. If I could word it better to ensure it doesn't get closed please feel free to edit, or inform me otherwise.
