I have been working with Sparklines, thanks to some code found here. Here is what I am using:               sparkline[data_] :=      DateListPlot[data, {1997},        FrameTicks -> {{Automatic, Automatic}, {{{2007, 1, 15}, Red}},          None}, Axes -> False, Frame -> False, Joined -> True,        PlotRange -> All, Filling -> Bottom, AspectRatio -> 0.2,        ImageSize -> 120]      Here is my data:               data={{0, 0.00342768669164354`, 0.00503464769633257`, 0, 0.000187`, 0, 0,            0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}, {0.0415627991238424`, 0.0545451018506565`,            0.0395873926886832`, 0.0284671754269643`, 0.0390903566779343`,            0.0344695110117644`, 0.0326128167712641`, 0.0380630684019641`,            0.0358499768032886`, 0.0241216221583061`, 0.0421644617338612`,            0.013010650199335`, 0.0249861212092993`, 0.0052690153372215`}};      I have been arranging them in charts, like so:               Grid[{{"Topic No.", "Sparkline"}, {"1", sparkline[data[[1]]]}, {"2",         sparkline[data[[2]]]}}, Frame -> All,       Background -> {None, {LightGray}}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ov1CR.png) What I am trying to do, so far unsuccessful, is find options to put lines within the Sparkline to indicate a specific date. i.e. is there a way that I could add a line for the year '2005' in the example above? The beauty of the Sparkline lies in having no frame or printed axes, but most of the Mathematica commands that come to mind rely on those. My end goal would be to have something like this (where the line is at 2005, although this is just a mock up): ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/h1zlc.png)
