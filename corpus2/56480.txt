I'm trying to do some optimization based on interactive parameters, then compute and present stuff based on the optimized results. In trying to do that, I came across some strange behavior I can't figure out. When I write either:               Manipulator[Dynamic[y], {0, 1}]     Dynamic[NMinimize[(z - y)^2, z]]      or even:               DynamicModule[{y},       Manipulator[Dynamic[y], {0, 1}]       Dynamic[NMinimize[(z - y)^2, z]]     ]      it runs incredibly slower than:               Manipulate[       NMinimize[(q - p)^2, q]     , {p, 0, 1}]          The first two are much, much slower, to the point they slow down my whole session, and I can't figure out why. Any ideas on how to speed it up?
