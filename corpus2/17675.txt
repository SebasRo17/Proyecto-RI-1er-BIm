I was asked today if I had experience with "Service Oriented Architecture" and although I think I do. The concept, to me, seems so muddled I don't know how you could honestly answer that question anymore. I resorted to Googling the term in an effort to get a concise definition of the concept and how it differs from other architectures. After reading a number of articles on it, the only common thread I seem to be able to find is a system with multiple components that talk to each other over some kind of interface, with perhaps a slight preference for XML/SOAP. It seems like almost any application could be defined as SOA, especially a web application. Has this term fallen into the "Web 2.0" trap and become a term meaning whatever you want it to mean? Am I way off base here? When you guys hear the term does it mean anything specific to you? If so I'd love a concise definition that clearly demonstrates what is and what specifically is NOT SOA.
