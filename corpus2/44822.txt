Using M9, OSX 10.8.4, most parts of the `Frame` in the following overlay disappear (also partially occluding some `FrameTicks`) when scrolling the mouse after the output is generated. Note the 10,000: the issue doesn't occur for much smaller `ListPlot` arguments. Can anyone replicate?                   With[{t = Table[Random[], {10000}]},      Overlay[{          ListPlot[t, Frame -> {True, True, True, False}, Axes -> False,          FrameStyle -> {Automatic, Blue, Automatic, Automatic},          PlotStyle -> Blue, Joined -> True, AspectRatio -> 1/10,          ImageSize -> 800, PlotRange -> All],          ListPlot[t+1,          Frame -> {False, False, False, True}, Axes -> False,          PlotStyle -> Darker@Red, FrameTicks -> {None, None, None, All},          FrameStyle -> {Automatic, Automatic, Automatic, Darker@Red},          Joined -> True, AspectRatio -> 1/10, ImageSize -> 800,          PlotRange -> All]}]      ]      Resulting in the following: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2aYNP.png)
