We have 10 distributed teams in our company and we are developing 3 huge web applications. A lot of time of our developers is spent with writing emails. We are using scrum and for that we had a daily stand-up meeting, but other questions regarding product features, design issues are always communicated via email? Is there a method or techniques available to reduce the time which is used to communicate!
