In responsive design, elements are hidden in the page with `@media` queries and `display: none` in CSS. Ok. In my design however browsers that have less than `800px` in width should avoid loading some content at all. When accessed with on a device with more than 800px of screen, the page loads fully. In mobile devices or even on desktop with less than `800px` of width some content is hidden. I want to make the page load faster for low-resolution devices and avoid loading chunks of content that the user will never see. How can I go about this?
