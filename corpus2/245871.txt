My project leader uses project based prefixes for class names, lets say projects name ABC, he create User class name as ABCUser. and he says he do this becasuse if he wants to make User.aspx Users get mixed. so I told him why not use namespace (Entity.User ie.) to make it specific but he against it. I would like to hear from you guys' opinion on this subject. We code c#.net and using visual studio for projects.
