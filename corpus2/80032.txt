I'm currently developing, on an independent basis, an application that is highly domain specific; a niche application if you will. This is all well and good, of course; but there is one problem; I'm not in a situation where I have a natural tester group. The issue is not really one of finding testers for technical accuracy; the application in question has the twin benefits of being (at least for now) dead simple in design and implementation, and having a developer that is also has the appropriate domain knowledge. Despite my relevant knowledge, however; I am not actually in the target audience for the application, leading to problems in identifying useful features for future implementation, among other things. What then, are the avenues to explore with regards to actually finding end users?
