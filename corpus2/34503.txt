In a previous question of mine, I asked how one might draw an Airy disk on a plane: Generating an Airy disk on a plane, and recieved some impressive answers from the users Timothy Wofford and m_goldberg Might it be possible to have a 2D plane in the contexts of a Graphics3D environment, and generate an Airy disk wherever one clicks (a simpler 2D Gaussian curve would also be just fine)? Or, perhaps more simply, to generate such disks at a specified set of two-dimensional coordiantes? The hope is that this can be done s.t. overlapping sections of one or more curves can be summed.
