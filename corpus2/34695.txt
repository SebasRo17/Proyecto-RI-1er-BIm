I was wondering, *for which countries is the proportion of _Phone line users to population greater than or equal to that of the United States_?* This is what I inputted below, but the list of countries seem too great.               countries=Last/@Take[Reverse[Sort[{CountryData[#,"PhoneLines"], #} & /@CountryData[]]], All]      Someone suggested I use "Select", but I have difficulties wording it.
