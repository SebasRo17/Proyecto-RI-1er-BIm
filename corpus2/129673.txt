I have been tasked with using coded UI to measure performance on a proprietary windows desktop application. The need is to measure how long it takes for the next page/screen to display after a user clicks on a control. For example - a user enters their ID and PW and clicks sign-in. The need is to measure how long it takes for the next screen to display when the user clicks the sign-in button. I understand the need to define what indicates the screen is loaded and ready for use. One approach is to use control.WaitForControlReady and use BeginTimer/EndTimer. Is coded ui a dependable and accurate way of measuring time?   Is WaitForControlReady the best method to determine when a control is ready for use?
