Before Martin Fowler's book "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code" came out, we used to call major changes to code "rearchitecture" and minor changes "cleanup". IMO, refactoring techniques are all common sense / obvious things we've been doing forever. Do you think refactoring was ever anything new? Perhaps just a way to trick management into allocating time for code cleanup?
