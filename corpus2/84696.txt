I've done a bit of work with CodeIgniter and a lot with straight PHP... I had the opportunity to use asp.net mvc3 recently and was absolutely blown away with my productivity. Despite not "knowing" the framework, the combination of scaffolding + intellisense + code generation through the context menus left me feeling just as productive with asp.net as with PHP. I've evaluated YII, CakePHP, symfony (a long time ago, pre 2.0), and Kohana... and while YII seems most promising none quite matched up to my experience with mvc3.
