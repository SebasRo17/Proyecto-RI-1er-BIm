For string constants its usual to use a class with `final String` values. But whats the best practice for storing string array. I want to store different categories in a constant array and everytime a category has been selected, I want to know which category it belongs to and process based on that. Addition : To make it more clear, I have a categories `A,B,C,D,E` which is a constant array. Whenever a user clicks one of the items(button will have those texts) I should know which item was clicked and do processing on that. I can define an `enum`(say `cat`) and everytime do               if clickedItem == cat.A      ....     else if clickedItem = cat.B      ....     else if       ....      or even register listeners for each item seperately. But I wanted to know the best practice for doing handling these kind of problems.
