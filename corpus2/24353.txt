First day at work for a new programmer. Assuming that the company has covered all the usual corporate stuff (benefits, paperwork, health and safety and so on), **What are the things you should be talking a new developer through to get them up to speed and productive as soon as possible?** In additional what are the key things in making this process a success? What have you seen work particularly well? (Edit: Added a bounty. The current top answer is fine but I'm still thinking there is more that can be done to make a programmers first week as useful to them as possible. Really hoping for insights from good and bad starts to jobs people have had).
