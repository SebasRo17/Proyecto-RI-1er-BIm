I've felt frustrated in the past with some jobs due to management marginalizing my talent, even after "proving" it to them for several years. Things like choosing to rewrite a single method from scratch (just building command parameters and executing a stored procedure, returning the result), instead of using code I wrote, that is in production in multiple apps, just because I wrote it. And the flimsy BS excuses they used to justify it. The funny thing is, I'm the ONLY ONE at the company that complies with coding standards, patterns and practices, analysis, unit testing and code coverage! How do you handle a job that is making you feel like you are wasting your talent and marginalized?
