I need to design a database table that holds the data of programmers work hours. The problem is that I have a compound type - two pieces of data belong to a category. Specifically, the work hours are classified into categories: design, program, test, troubleshoot, etc... and each category is divided into two types: hours spent at work and hours spent at home. How can I design a compound type in the database side? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gXob9.jpg) I thought about storing the two types in one field like "6,2" but that creates more problems to resolve. I would now have to convert and split data along with worrying about localization issues, missing data, or if another location was added to the categories. * * * Clarification:   Asking my question a different way, it's relatively easy to design a table without compound types like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/izuiu.jpg) But how to deal with it when each category is split into two types?
