_Mathematica_ 9.0.1, Linux. I try to save a plot as a pdf. I tried four different options. In each case some errors appeared as blank space ![image 1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DH4aL.jpg) ( http://yadi.sk/d/h1koyDci4z3rc ). I also tried to save as eps. Another problem appeared -- there is no half letter on the Labels: ![image 2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1VaSg.jpg) (see here http://yadi.sk/d/OBRDmp3z4z42U ). The same figures are saved very well in _Mathematica_ 7 without an error. Is it possible to solve this problem?
