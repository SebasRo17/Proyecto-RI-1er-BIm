In a talk about time management, a famous computer scientist said: > "One machine in your life is the right number." He recommended a laptop with a docking station. After trying this approach for about a month, I miss my more powerful desktop (i7 quad core hyperthread), but it is not in my technology road map (or budget) to upgrade from my old Intel Core 2 Duo (2006) notebook this year. What strategies can help me use the desktop while at my desk and without much manual effort the notebook when I am on the go?
