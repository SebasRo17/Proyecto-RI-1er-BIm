I have often come across claims that source code is read much more than it is written and just wanted to do a little calculation like: > If you write a line that takes me 5 minutes longer to read because you were > to lazy to write a comment for 5 minutes it will cost us n*X if 5 minutes of > programmer time cost X. Then I realized that I not only lack n to do the calculation but also have never seen any evidence for the claim that code is read much more than it is written. Is that just a fishy "well it is only written once so it has to be read a lot more" argument or are there any studies on the subject that you know of?
