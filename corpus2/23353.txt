When I evaluate this code:               RSolve[{y[0] == y0, y[t + 1] == (1 - (t + 1)/100) y[t]}, y[t], t]      I get an RSolve::bvnul error. I don't understand why. Yet, if I run this code, I get the sequence I want.               FoldList[#1 (1 - #2) &, 1, Range[1/100, 1, 1/100]]      The motivation for this problem is a discrete mortality model in which hazard increases in a linear way until age 100. I'd like a closed form solution for the sequence for an arbitrary maximum life span.
