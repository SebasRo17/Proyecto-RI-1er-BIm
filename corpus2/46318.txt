I am having troubles with my notebook. I succesfully defined Asymmetric Laplace Distribution at school using `SplicedDistribution` function, and _Mathematica_ was able to compute (about 30sec) `Mean`, `Variance`, `Skewness` and `Kurtosis`.   Now, I am at home and _Mathematica_ can compute only `Mean`?! I am running _Mathematica 9.0.1.0 Student Edition_. Where is the problem during switching machines? I can make upload of notebook if needed. ![SplicedDistribution problem](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BHUqR.png)               AsymmetricLaplaceDistribution[ θ_, τ_, κ_] =        SplicedDistribution[{ κ, 1/κ},{ -∞, θ, ∞},{ LaplaceDistribution[ θ, τ κ],                                                   LaplaceDistribution[ θ, τ/κ]}];      and then               ALD = AsymmetricLaplaceDistribution[ θ, τ, κ];      and after               { Mean[ALD], Variance[ALD], Skewness[ALD], Kurtosis[ALD]}      yields (but only @ school computers? why?)               { θ + τ/κ - κ τ, ((1 + κ^4) τ^2)/κ^2,       -(( 2 (-1 + κ^6) τ^3)/(κ^3 (((1 + κ^4) τ^2)/κ^2)^(3/2))),       (9 + 6 κ^4 + 9 κ^8)/(1 + κ^4)^2}      **Edit** : I just find `Moment[ dist, r]` works fine up to `r = 10` what I tested. But still, `Variance` does not.
