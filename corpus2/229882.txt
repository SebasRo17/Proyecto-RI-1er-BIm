I am trying to create a timer that ever x minutes it will call to a server, get a JSON file and do something with it. The merits of that system are not in question right now, the question involves getting the JSON file. Currently I am using kimonify from KimonoLabs to create a JSON file from some other site. They suggest I use               function kimonoCallback(data) {         // do something with the data         // please make sure the scope of this function is global       }            $.ajax({         "url":"http://www.kimonolabs.com/api/9ey3ljcs?apikey=d753b0c5546495826e7aaa5422f59e30&callback=kimonoCallback",         "crossDomain":true,         "dataType":"jsonp"     });      At the same time I was pursuing other methods and was getting a parse error, and I found this solution. So far both used `&callback=` what is so special about `&callback=` that makes it more preferable to something like `.done()` or `success:` I am guessing it has something to deal with Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
