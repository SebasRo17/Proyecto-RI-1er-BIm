I would like to crop the hexagonal close-packed system as a hexagon and not as a cube. I would like to use the following `volumetricPlot` already given on this exchange by Jens.               volumetricPlot[latticeType_] := Module[       {        img = LatticeData[latticeType, "Image"],        r = LatticeData[latticeType, "PackingRadius"]        },       Show[        img /. Sphere[pt_, r_] :> {},        Map[         RegionPlot3D[(EuclideanDistance[{x, y, z}, #] < r),           {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1}, {z, -1, 1},           Mesh -> False,           PlotStyle -> Opacity[.5]           ] &, Cases[img, Sphere[pos_, _] :> pos, Infinity]]        ]       ]            volumetricPlot["HexagonalClosePacking"]      However as a newbie to _Mathematica_ I am not sure how to change `RegionPlot3D` to crop at the hexagon boundaries. Any thoughts?
