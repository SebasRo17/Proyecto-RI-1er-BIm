I have just begun to learn Django/Python/Web Development. This problem has been troubling me for a while now. I am creating an application with multiple templates in Django. I have a views.py which is basically just rendering the responses to the respective templates and I have a models.py where I have structured my DB. In one of my templates, I need to upload an image (which I am able to do) and I need to run a logic which is based on the features of the uploaded image (not yet done). This logic involves a lot of heavy calculations. After performing the calculations, the logic should return some processed information (coordinates) to the template. I have been able to do all this actions successfully in a standalone python desktop application calling python files one after the other. However, since I now want to make this a web application I have begun using the Django framework. I have done a lot of searching but I am still not able to figure out where exactly should I place this Python file containing all the logic. Should I have another class based file `(logic.py)` and call it from the `view.py`? I googled and found that many developers are placing their business logic in their models.py in Django. However, I feel it is intuitively not right since model should exclusively communicate with the back end. Any help would be appreciated.Thanks in advance.
