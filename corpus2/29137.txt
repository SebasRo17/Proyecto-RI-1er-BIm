I'm primarily an ASP.NET developer and the single thing i've been introduced to in recent years that has had the most dramatic impact on the quality of the code I write has learning how to use IoC containers to manage dependencies between different layers of the application efficiently. I've recently made it my hobby to learn Ruby (and Rails) for personal projects, and I love the language so far. However, one of the things i've noticed from the various tutorials and references i've been using, has been that there has been no mention yet of using IoC. This is in stark contrast to .NET where it is (and where it isn't, should be) drummed into developers at an early stage. I appreciate that one reason why dependency injection may not be necessary in Ruby, is that everything in a class is public and virtual so open to modification so it's not really needed in order to write good unit tests. But there are of course many other benefits to using IoC containers such as the decoupling options this brings, managing object creation and lifetime etc. Is dependency injection used in Ruby? If not, why is this not an issue?
