I used to heavily rely on session variables in the past, but have recently found many of them to be unnecessary, using things like query string parameters instead. A colleague of mine refuses to use session variables. Is this a realistic goal and should session variables be avoided for any practical reasons? Can session variables be avoided completely (except for session cookies to allow logins) and would this result in better designs? Some of the reasons my colleague has for not using them:   * Untyped nature of session variables    * Session time-outs causing loss of state    * Global scope nature of session variables    * Load balancing servers losing sessions (.Net specific?)    * Application pools/servers restarting   * They are unnecessary
