Is it possible to apply a color function to ContourPlot or DensityPlot that is function of x, y and z, and not simply of z? Example:               ContourPlot[Cos[x] + Cos[y], {x, 0, 4 Pi}, {y, 0, 4 Pi},       ColorFunction -> (If[#1 > 1/2, Red, White] &)]      but colored only for x > 2 Pi (obviously, there are alternative methods for this example, but typical cases are more complex)
