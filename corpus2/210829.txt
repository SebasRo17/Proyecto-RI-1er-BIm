I'm rather new to the broad world of Git. I have read the manual and have been practicing but I am confused about few aspects of it, which I couldn't figure out after searching for. I'm wondering:   * In a project (post first commit), when is the right moment to stage source files? Right before committing? Right after adding/deleting or modifying?   * If files are staged midway between two commits, and then they get modified, what happens with Git? Does it need care about content changes when it was stated and what it become since?   * If I create a new file, stage it and then want to delete it, why does Git ask me to use "-f" flag and a simple "git -rm file.ext" won't work? I have read "What stage means" and various other subjects of the manual and other tutorials on Git but as I said, I still don't understand the above matters. So, if you could, please answer the questions with your own words and examples so I might have a better chance of understanding it. Thank you.
