**question:** i need to use mathematica to write an intermediate value theorem's algorithm, but i don't know how to write in a module form... i have a function and then, we need to set up a range and also its stepsize... **example:** f(x)=8x-12x^2+4x^3 range=[-0.5,3.5] stepsize=1 thus, x={-0.5,0.5,1.5,2.5,3.5 } compute f(-0.5),f(0.5),f(1.5),f(2.5),f(3.5) a series of element will showed y={-7.5,1.5,-1.5.7.5,52.5} **condition:** an interval of x will be choose when it consists a -ve value and follow by a +ve value in its function value. **result:** since {-7.5,1.5} and {-1.5,7.5} hence subinterval[-0.5,0.5]and [-1.5,7.5] selected. **question (cont)** random choose a value from interval(s) selected and run a newton method step x[n+1]=x(n)-(f[x(n)]/f'x(n)]
