Under _More Information_ in the help page of `ViewMatrix` the following entry can be found > With the setting `ViewMatrix->Automatic`, explicit forms for the matrix `m` > can be found using `AbsoluteOptions[g,ViewMatrix]`. Trying this with a basic example               gr = Plot3D[Sin[x + y^2], {x, -3, 3}, {y, -2, 2}];     AbsoluteOptions[gr, ViewMatrix]          (* Out[11]= {ViewMatrix -> Automatic} *)      shows, that this does not work as I would have expected it. Even setting `ViewMatrix` explicitely to `Automatic` does not help. I tried this on Linux and MacOSX. Can someone tell me how this is supposed to be used and how I can extract explicit values for the viewing matrix which is used for the projection?
