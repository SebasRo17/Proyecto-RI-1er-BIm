A few years ago somebody created a bunch of really awesome and quite popular shell scripts. They don't work in the latest version of Mac OS X, because a filepath has changed. All you need to do is edit the file path (in four different places) to make them work again. The code is posted on a private website without any source control, the author hasn't updated them in almost a year, and this bug is fairly long standing now. It is clearly open source, and intended to be used/modified/whatever, but he hasn't released it under any license. I want to fix the bug, and post it on GitHub, preferably under a public-domain style OSS license. I wonder what the legal ramifications might be? The code is fairly simple (under 300 lines), but I couldn't rewrite it without reading every line of his code first. At the very least it needs to be moved to a website that will not vanish at any time (there is a tilde in the URL... university account?), and the bug needs to be fixed since many of the target users don't know how to go in and fix it. I have sent an email to the author, but my experience is when simple bugfixes aren't being applied to popular project, emails will never receive any response. For the purpose of this question, lets assume he will not reply to my email.
