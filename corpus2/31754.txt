A number of functions provide for results to be wrapped in an arbitrary head. This is very important in cases where the results should not be evaluated. Take `Level` as an example:               expr = Hold[{2/2, g[8/4], 1/0}];          Level[expr, {-2}, Hold]      > >     Hold[1/2, 1/4, 1/0] >   `Cases` however provides no such parameter, causing undesired evaluation:               Cases[expr, _Times, 3]      > Power::infy: Infinite expression 1/0 encountered. >> >   >   >     {1, 2, ComplexInfinity}  (* failure *) >   How can this behavior be attained?
