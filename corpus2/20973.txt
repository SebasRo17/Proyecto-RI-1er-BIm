I would like to have that kind of cylinder with `Dashed` edges (including the bellow inner ring): ![Edged Cylinder](http://i.stack.imgur.com/D7u61.png) I've been trying that:               opt = {Mesh -> None, PlotStyle -> {Lighter@Black, Opacity[0.3]}};      Show[{     ParametricPlot3D[{r Cos@th,r Sin@th,#},{th, 0, 2 Pi},{r, 0.3, 0.31},Evaluate@opt] &/@ {0,2},      ParametricPlot3D[{# Cos@th,# Sin@th,z},{th, 0, 2 Pi},{z, 0, 2},Evaluate@opt] & /@ {.3, .31}}      ,PlotRange -> All, Axes -> False, Boxed -> False, ViewVertical -> {1, 0, 0}]      But I can't find out how to dash the edges. According to that answer I've been trying that:               tube = ParametricPlot3D[2 {Cos[t], Sin[t], u}, {t, 0, 2 Pi}, {u, -5, 5},                               Mesh -> None, PlotStyle -> {Opacity[0]}];     tube /. Polygon[a__] :> {EdgeForm[{Dashed}], Mesh -> All, Polygon[a]}      But it only dashes the mesh: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GTF9U.png) And belisarius has been trying that:               RegionPlot3D[1 < x x + y y < 2 && -2 < z < 2, {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2}, {z, -1/2, 1/2},                  Mesh -> False, BoundaryStyle -> Directive[Red, Thick, Dashed],                  BoxRatios -> {1, 1, 1/5}, Boxed -> False, Axes -> False]       Which doesn't give the transparency: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tY6v7.png) Thus, **my question is** : is it possible to construct the first picture cylinder with `Dashed` Edges?
