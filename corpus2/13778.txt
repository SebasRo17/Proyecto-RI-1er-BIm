I'm pretty sure about `Who` but when ? The one with proficient knowledge of programming and software development or the one who's just a beginner in cyber ( programming, to be precise ) world ? I'm persuing bachelors right now, when its preferable for me( and folks like me) to read this **_Must read for programmers_** book ?
