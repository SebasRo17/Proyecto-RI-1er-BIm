I know a few programming languages. The most marketable ones being Java, Javascript, as well as non-trival stored procedures. I also know some Python, Actionscript and a few dinosaurs language. I am starting up a toy project with Scala/lift. I enjoy each language for its own features and the paradigms they encourage. I am interested in the concept of a polyglot programmer and becoming one. What are the steps to being a true polyglot programmer? (I.E. I don't just know different languages, I know them well, and know good design patterns for them.) Is this something that can be made marketable?
