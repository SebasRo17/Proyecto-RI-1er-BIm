The documentation for `Texture` states that " ** _other filled objects_** " can be texturized: > `Texture[obj]` is a graphics directive that specifies that _obj_ should be > used as a texture on faces of polygons and other filled graphics objects. And also: > Texture can be used in FaceForm to texture front and back faces differently. Though I fail to apply a simple texture to any of the following objects. It seems like that "other filled objects" only include `Polygon`s and `FilledPolygon`s, and `FaceForm` does not work with those.               img = Rasterize@        DensityPlot[Sin@x Sin@y, {x, -4, 4}, {y, -3, 3},          ColorFunction -> "BlueGreenYellow", Frame -> None,          ImageSize -> 100, PlotRangePadding -> 0];     {      Graphics[{Texture@img, Disk[]}],      Graphics[{FaceForm@Texture@img, Disk[]}],      Graphics[{Texture@img, Rectangle[]}],      Graphics[{FaceForm@Texture@img, Rectangle[]}],           (* Only this one works *)      Graphics[{Texture@img,         Polygon[{{0, 0}, {1, 0}, {1, 1}, {0, 1}},          VertexTextureCoordinates -> {{0, 0}, {1, 0}, {1, 1}, {0, 1}}]}],      Graphics[{FaceForm@Texture@img,         Polygon[{{0, 0}, {1, 0}, {1, 1}, {0, 1}},          VertexTextureCoordinates -> {{0, 0}, {1, 0}, {1, 1}, {0, 1}}]}]      }      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3M0Id.png) **Edit:** It turns out that "Applying `Texture` to a disk directly isn't possible" (according to Heike, thanks s.s.o. for the link). This unfortunately means that:   1. the official documentation of `Texture` is wrong (or at least is misleading, as graphics objects usually include primitives);   2. either `Texture` is not fully integrated with the system, as it is not applicable for such primitives as a `Rectangle`, which seems to be just a very specific `Polygon`; or `Rectangle` is something else and is defined some other way at the lowest level than a `Polygon` (maybe it is some OS-dependent object). Frankly, it is quite hard to imagine what kept developers to include this functionality, but I must assume they had a good reason.
