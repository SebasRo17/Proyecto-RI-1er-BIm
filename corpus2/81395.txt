I have been an active professional software developer (mostly utilizing .NET) for the past five years and, without being too full of myself, I would say I'm a very competent developer. I stay intimately up to date with the latest tools, the industry, and modern standards/practices. I work for a fairly high- level IT company and I swing just fine with the rest of them. I am even up to date on the latest team dynamic methodologies and feel like I have good leadership/management/people skills. However, I never got my degree. I learned and am learning everything I know on my own from hundreds of books and experiences. I ran my own software company for a while until it took a big hit from the economy a year or so ago. It took a LONG time and A LOT of applications, but I finally found the job I have now. Like an idiot I dropped out of college to forgo paying more tuition and I started my company and as life goes, I now wish I had stayed and got the degree. I have student loans that are in default and I'm working my hind end off to pay off those debts now that I am making a fair amount of money again. I have hit too many ceilings without this degree. For one, I will never make as much as someone with the same level of knowledge and experience, but also has a degree. Also, the amount of effort it took to get a job in the industry without a degree was exhausting and depressing. Now I am wondering what the best way for me to go about getting my degree is?   1. Are there online schools that would offer this degree?   2. Would an online school even be a good choice?   3. Would my knowledge and experience in the industry help me finish schooling faster/cheaper?   4. Have any of you ever found yourself in a similar position? If so, how did you overcome all the barriers put in front of you?   5. Have any of you ever had student loans in default and tried to go back to school later? How did you deal with that and how did it affect you?
