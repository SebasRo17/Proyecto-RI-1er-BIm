I'm working in a small startup as the sole developer in my spare time. We might need some more development help and are looking at an Indian company which comes recommended by someone we know (although they are not very technical). I'll be having an informal chat with them, and thought I'd see if people here had some wisdom regarding what to look for and good questions to ask. At least I thought I'd try to get some:   * Code examples   * Info on any policies they might have regarding documentation of code   * Some background on the people we will be working with If you guys can think of anything else I should be particularly on the lookout for, or have any other tips to run the conversation, your input would be much appreciated! ** **Update** ** To be clear: I have some about what questions to ask a sole developer/freelancer. In this instance I will be talking to a an Indian company offering outsourcing services. I'm curious to know whether there is any particular issues I should be aware of, and if someone with this kind of experience have any hard earned wisdom to share. See MainMa's answer for one such point, although it's not developer-specific. I see the title of the question has been slightly modified so it no longer correctly conveys what I was trying to ask.. maybe this was the wrong place for this question. :/
