I have an application that queries a MySQL database many times for data. At the moment, Mathematica and MySQL are running on the same box and yet it takes over 1.6 seconds for the query to run and return a value. This feels very slow, and I was hoping somebody might give me counsel on how this might be sped up.               AbsoluteTiming[      SQLSelect[commodDB, "tbcommodprices", "price",          SQLColumn["ticker"] == "LAV05 Comdty" &&          SQLColumn["whichprice"] == "last" &&          SQLColumn["date"] == "2005-09-01"];]          {1.6093750, Null}
