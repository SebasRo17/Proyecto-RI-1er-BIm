How do you deploy your website in Azure so that it looks exactly like when you run it in your localhost? This is a very simple website that I created following the ASP.NET MVC4 tutorials. However, I added a new background image and it doesn't show. Is there anything else I need to do to make sure all of my files are being deployed? Here is the code that "should" be on my site. This is the pone in my solution.                <head profile="http://gmpg.org/xfn/11">      <title>LOTUS Marketing Solutions</title>      <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1" />      <meta http-equiv="imagetoolbar" content="no" />      <link href="~/favicon.ico" rel="shortcut icon" type="image/x-icon" />      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />      <link rel="stylesheet" href="Content/Site.css" type="text/css" />      <script type="text/javascript" src="Scripts/jquery-1.4.1.min.js"></script>      <script type="text/javascript" src="Scripts/jquery.jcarousel.pack.js"></script>      <script type="text/javascript" src="Scripts/jquery.jcarousel.setup.js"></script>      @Styles.Render("~/Content/css")      @Scripts.Render("~/bundles/modernizr")      </head>      this is what I "actually" showing on the site view source code                 <head>         <meta charset="utf-8" />         <title>Home Page - LOTUS Marketing Solutions</title>         <link href="/favicon.ico" rel="shortcut icon" type="image/x-icon" />         <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />         <link href="/Content/css?v=Zxt_kvPMVcEtaCRbYJCSpGOy25BUARXyn8EetggjSF01" rel="stylesheet"/>              <script src="/bundles/modernizr?v=qVODBytEBVVePTNtSFXgRX0NCEjh9U_Oj8ePaSiRcGg1"></script>            </head>      clearly, something is wrong. The contents are not remotely alike! I was able to pull this out **CA0058 Error Running Code Analysis CA0058 : The referenced assembly 'DotNetOpenAuth.AspNet, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=2780ccd10d57b246' could not be found.

[Errors and Warnings] (Global)** Could this have something to do with the problem?
