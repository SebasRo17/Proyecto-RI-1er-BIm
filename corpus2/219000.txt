This is probably something that should go to the legal department -- presuming they have any inklings about software licensing -- but what software license should I use against code developed for use at a publicly funded institution (in the UK)? Specifically, it's internal-use code for various university systems. I believe it should be open source -- and feel that the MIT license would be most appropriate -- but I have a feeling that certain proprietary procedures and policies, that might be revealed by the code, _may_ be restricted. ("May" in italics, because I'm not 100% sure: As a publicly funded body, I am under the impression that anything that doesn't conflict with the Data Protection Act 1998 should be made available under the Freedom of Information Act 2000.) This is largely moot, because the source won't be published publicly. (Although, presumably, if anyone requests it, then that's allowed; providing sensitive information is redacted.) However, I'm interested to hear others' thoughts on the matter.
