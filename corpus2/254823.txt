I understand the reasons why I would prefer `let a = f(x)` over `let a() = f(x)`, especially when f takes is a long running function. I also think it is correct to say, that, considering lambda calculus origins of functional programming `let a()` is truly functional, while `let a` is not. Please correct me if I'm wrong on this. However I have no clue which expression will actually be better:               let a = 4      or               let a() = 4      Is there any reason I would prefer one over the other?
