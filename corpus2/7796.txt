I'm trying to solve a system of equations:               Solve[ A1 D1 + E1 H1 == 0 && A2 D1 + A1 D2 + E2 H1 + E1 H2 == 0 &&            C1 F1 - E1 G1 == 0 && C2 F2 - E2 G2 == 0 && A1 - B1 + C1 == 0 &&             A2 - B2 + C2 == 0 &&  A3 - B3 + C3 == 0,                  {A1,A2,A3,B1,B2,B3,C1,C2,C3,D1,D2,E1,E2,F1,F2,G1,G2,H1,H2}]       Since we have more variables than equations, we have more than 1 solution satisfying the above equations but I don't want Mathematica to give me all possible solutions -- I would like just only one. **1\. How do I get Mathematica to give me just one possible solution?** One way I thought about doing this is to plug in random numbers such as `A2 = 1/2, B2 = 1, C2 = 1/2`, etc. so that all other variables are determined. But this isn't a very effective strategy in case the numbers I plug in do not satisfy all of the above equations. (One reason why I don't want all possible solutions to a system of equations is because suppose I am working with 30 equations and 80 variables. Then this is crashing Mathematica.)
