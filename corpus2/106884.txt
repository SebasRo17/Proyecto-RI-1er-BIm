Most of the logic for my webservice involves talking to our suppliers webservices. (checking availability ordering ect) They dont have a test environment and the majority of calls cant be run arbitrarily (for example a cease would be run once and would actually stop a service). Is it feasable to run unit tests in this environment? I could simulte typical responses but im worried that hardcoding supplier responses would undermine the point of unit tests.
