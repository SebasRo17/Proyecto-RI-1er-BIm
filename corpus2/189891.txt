I know some a few programmers at my work around 40 years old. I don't remember seeing a programmer at work who is 50+. We have 600 people, of which probably 100 are programmers. Is it uncommon to still be working as a programmer at 50+? One can argue, you would be better off managing people, but not everyone is good at that, and some people just want to do the actual work because of passion, etc. Would it be weird if you are still trying to work at 50, or even 60? I imagine it could create all sorts of social issues, i.e. working in games where most people are very young, straight out of college, etc. I feel it would make it hard to form friendships, due to age difference. Or how would your expertise be considered compared to others, etc. Anyone has experience or opinions about these?
