I enjoy learning new things, and thus I want to pursue a career where I can continue to do so. I'm currently doing my Master's thesis and will finish my degree beginning of next year. After that I'm at a crossroad of what to do next. My examiner wants me to continue my academic studies and apply for a doctorate degree, and I can't say I'm entirely against it; where can you learn more than by doing research? At the same time, however, I imagine that you'd get more practical experiences by going to industry. Then again it is always the risk of ending up in the guinea pig wheel and doing mindless work and never progress. And at research you might only research just that and never look at anything else. And let's not forget the higher salary in industry (at least when you compare the pays in Sweden, but I am willing to work for less if I get to learn more). So what to do?
