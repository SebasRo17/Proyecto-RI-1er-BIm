I am learning about Agile Methodology i.e. Scrum. I have a very basic knowledge of Scrum. Please guide following:   1. What is role of `Product Owner` in daily Scrum, if he/she is part of this meeting?    2. In real world scenario `Product Owner` is the person who is customer. A team member can be nominated as `Proxy` of product owner?    3. Can we say that `Project Manager` who directly interacts with customer is nominated as proxy of `Product Owner`?    4. When we use term `External Stakeholders Engagement`, are we referring to `Product Owner` or else?
