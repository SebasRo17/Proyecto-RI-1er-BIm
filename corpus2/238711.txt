Following is a question that I had posted at the incubator-storm-user mailing list (verbatim). I had decided to open up the question here as well, because it also contains a conceptual side to it, which might be answered by non-storm users. > I am no python expert and am also a newbie to storm. > > I have gone over the storm source code in order to see how to add jars to > the classpath. Obviously, the preferred mechanism is the fat jar (as > specified in Micheal Noll's tutorial and another post on the storm-user > mailing list). The second seemingly available mechanism is via the > `USER_CONF_DIR` which amounts to `os.path.expanduser("~/.storm")` but this > does not allow for topology independent versioning of the same jars (e.g. > `apache-commons-aaa` version x and version y). There does not seem to be a > third way. Many other Java based technologies do give a way to amend the > classpath. Why doesn't storm? To generify the question a bit, why would a (clustered) java software framework/container not supply a mechanism for adding app specific dependent jars, but force you to use fat jars?
