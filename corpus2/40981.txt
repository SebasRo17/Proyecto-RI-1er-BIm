I was executing a long Mathematica Notebook over night. The Mathematica instance is running on a Linux workstation (in a vnc server session to be precise). Now I cannot access this session anymore, which means that I likely loose the output data which was produced during the run. I can still login on the workstation as the same user and run Mathematica there. I know from the process list that Mathematica is still running, but I cannot access the GUI anymore. So, if there would be a remote control for Mathematica from command line or a second worksheet, which allows me to save the worksheet, I could prevent the data loss. I already tried to run a second instance of Mathematica but it seems that I cannot even see the Kernels there. Any ideas? It would save my day.
