Is it possible to insert a trigonometric function into a matrix which will be able to be used dynamically, as an element of one of the vectors of the matrix? I'm trying to perform an operation like the following:               A1 = {{1,        0,        0},           {Sin[phi], Cos[phi], 0},           {0,        0,        1}};          A2 = {{Sec[phi], -Tan[phi] ,0},           {0,        1,         0},           {0,        0,         1}};      I'd like to be able to multiply those two matrices:               A1.A2 (*For mathematica*)     - or -     A1*A2 (*For humans*)      Figuring this out will hopefully allow me to create a function such that it simplifies the transformation process. This will allow me to write a function like the following:               trans[x_,y_]:= A1.A2.{x,y,1};      Note that **phi represents a random value** which I'd like the matrix to respond to, for example:               x = {2,4};          A = {{Sin[phi], 0},          {0,        1}};          A.x = {Sin[2], 4};
