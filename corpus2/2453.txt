We construct a graph as the following.               node = {11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16};     edges = {11 -> 14, 11 -> 16, 12 -> 16, 12 -> 15, 13 -> 15, 13 -> 16,               14 -> 16, 14 -> 15, 15 -> 16, 15 -> 13, 16 -> 15, 16 -> 14};     vertexposition = {{6.51493919050084`, 44.04756585632944`},          {75.59445680043342`, 50.47455242214042`},          {87.32825501506514`, 13.395648943951699`},          {28.795707353492418`, 3.420138063734413`},          {60.729164933330765`, 16.915777496473908`},          {51.85158892659126`, 25.803692768150313`}};     Show[         Graph[node, edges, VertexCoordinates -> vertexposition,                VertexSize -> {"Scaled", .02},VertexLabels -> "Name"],         Frame -> True, FrameTicks -> True, ImageSize -> 600]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/o7hDI.png)   1. Now in the above graph how can I can control the size of the `Arrowheads` and thickness/color/opacity of the lines?   2. Is there any options that I can use to make the graph aesthetically more eye catching (sorry for using a qualitative term!)?   3. Without using `Show` can I display the frame and the axes values directly in a `Graph`?
