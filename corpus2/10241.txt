I have a list of lists that are not of the same length (for example, `{{6}, {14}, {6, 26, 30}}`), but I have to compare every element in the $n^{\text{th}}$ sublist with the corresponding $n^{\text{th}}$ odd number. So, 6 in the first sublist with 1 (first odd number), 14 in the second sublist with 3 (second odd number), 6 with 5 (third odd number), 26 with 5, 30 with 5, etc. I tried to make another list with odd numbers, but I really don't know how to program the case when the comparison is with only one element in the sublist (e.g. sublists 1 and 2) and with multi-element sublists (e.g., 3rd sublist).
