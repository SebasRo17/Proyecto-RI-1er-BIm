Tried posting this on main StackOverflow site, but no replies in 5 days.   I am having ongoing problems trying to implement a very simple MSMQ solution: 2 PCs (not servers) running Win7 and Win8 respectively. Each one monitors data from a hardware system, and periodically saves the data in a local private queue as a DataSet. Old code on a 3rd PC running this code is able to receive or peek the messages fine.               Dim qInfo1 As Object = CreateObject("MSMQ.MSMQQueueInfo")     qInfo1.FormatName = "DIRECT=TCP:192.168.1.123\private$\queue_1"     Dim q1 As Object = qInfo1.Open(MQ_RECEIVE_ACCESS, MQ_DENY_NONE)          Dim qInfo2 As Object = CreateObject("MSMQ.MSMQQueueInfo")     qInfo2.FormatName = "DIRECT=TCP:192.168.1.120\private$\queue_2"     Dim q2 = qInfo2.Open(MQ_RECEIVE_ACCESS, MQ_DENY_NONE)          Dim qMessage1 As Object = CreateObject("MSMQ.MSMQMessage")     qMessage1 = q1.Peek          Dim qMessage2 As Object = CreateObject("MSMQ.MSMQMessage")     qMessage2 = q2.Peek      However, when I try the following .Net code, it doesn't work.               Dim q1 As MessageQueue = New MessageQueue("FormatName:DIRECT=TCP:192.168.1.123\private$\queue_1", QueueAccessMode.ReceiveAndAdmin)     q1.Formatter = New XmlMessageFormatter(New Type() {GetType(XmlDocument)})     Dim q2 As MessageQueue = New MessageQueue("FormatName:DIRECT=TCP:192.168.1.120\private$\queue_2", QueueAccessMode.ReceiveAndAdmin)     q2.Formatter = New XmlMessageFormatter(New Type() {GetType(XmlDocument)})          Dim msg1 As Message = q1.Peek(New TimeSpan(0, 0, 1))     Dim msg2 As Message = q2.Peek(New TimeSpan(0, 0, 1))      Originally I was getting "Access to the queuing system is denied". I researched possible fixes, and implemented the following:   * Made sure all PCs are in same domain.    * Turned off firewalls   * Gave Anonymous Login full privileges.   * Allowed Nonauthenticated Rpc on both machines. The "old" method also required some of the above changes. It works just fine. After the above changes, the "new" .Net method no longer gives me an access denied message, but neither does it retrieve the messages. It always just times out. As I change the timeout parameter, the timeout takes longer or shorter, but always happens, even though there are messages in the queue. During development (with everything on the same PC) either method worked perfectly. Now that I'm peeking remote queues, the .Net method won't work. My work-around is to use the older method, but that is not as robust. There is no timeout parameter, so the receiver program just hangs on the peeks exactly as if there were no messages in the queue. I've made progress, as the .Net method isn't getting access denied errors, but it is not seeing the messages in the queues, hence the timeouts. Any ideas how to solve this?
