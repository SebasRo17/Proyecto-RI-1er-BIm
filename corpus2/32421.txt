I have been a software engineer / graphic designer for a few years and have recently been considering furthering my education in the field. (It was actually a very generous Christmas present) I would primarily be interested in something like Human Computer Interaction or a similar "creative technology" that involves heavy UI/UX Design, prototyping or Information Architecture. Anyways - I still plan on working full-time and was looking into part-time distance programs and was wondering if anyone had some experience with pursuing a similar degree (either from a distance or in-person) and could share their experiences. Thanks!
