I have reduced an error in my program to this line of code:               FindRoot[Nest[# (1 - #) k &, 1/2, 2^4] - 1/2, {k, 3.5}]      It works for $2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4,$ but then for $2^n, n\ge5,$ it stops. Nothing happens. _Mathematica_ is "thinking" forever. `FindRoot` is not doing a single iteration. Why does this happen? I have some ideas of my own, none of which have gotten me anywhere:   1. The values are very small, is it a precision problem?   2. Maybe I'm not using `Nest` properly?
