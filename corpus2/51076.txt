I have some code that is failing because of NullPointerException. A method is being called on the object where the object does not exist. However, this led me to think about the best way to fix this. Do I always code defensively for nulls so that I future proof code for null pointer exceptions, or should I fix the cause of the null so that it won't occur downstream. What are your thoughts?
