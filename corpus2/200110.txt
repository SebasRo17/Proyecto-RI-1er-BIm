Say you have a list of "vehicles" - you have an observableArray of these ko.observable()s. You let your user add a new vehicle with the following:               var emptyVehicle = {         "make": "chevrolet",         "model": "corvette"     };     app.on('CLICKED_ADD_VEHICLE', function () {                 var vehicle = new vehicleViewModel(emptyVehicle);                 vehicle.hasWheels(true);                 innerModel.sets.push(set);             });      If they save the vehicle, you get a real vehicle from your dataservice, and then replace the blank one with this:               app.on('CLICKED_SAVE', function (oldVehicle) {                 var newVehicle = new vehicleViewModel(dataservice.createVehicle(oldVehicle));                         innerModel.vehicles.remove(oldVehicle);                         innerModel.vehicles.push(newVehicle);             });      I know I'm leaving some code out here, but this is more of a practices/approach question than a code question. Is this an acceptable approach to adding new items to a list? New up a temporary template, and throw it away in place of an actual item if the user saves?
