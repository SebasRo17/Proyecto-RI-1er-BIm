I just went to my first hackathon (London GreenHackathon) and I want to go to lots more. Specifically, hackathons that have a theme of helping people or making the world a better place in some way. I know about Random Hacks of Kindness and a couple of others but is there some central aggregator that will help me find out about hackathons? Also, if anyone else can suggest specific hackathon initiatives I should check out that would be handy too. I'm in London but obviously for other people reading this question other locations will be of interest.
