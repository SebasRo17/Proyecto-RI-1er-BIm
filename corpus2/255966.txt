I am working on a huge web application designed long back. I have to configure it so as to make it work on a cluster. I have configured a tomcat cluster for this purpose. Now I know I need to make the objects being added to the session serializable. For that I want to know what is being stored in my sessions, when I log in. Additionally how do I know (log maybe) that session state is being replicated among the tomcat workers?
