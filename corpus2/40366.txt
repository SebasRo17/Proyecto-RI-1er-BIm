I've been looking at some matrices in Mathematica and I've noticed something very weird: They're extremely temperamental when it comes to dot products! For example, if I have the following,               i={{1},{2},{3}}     j={1,2,3}     k=i.j      the as far as I remember I should get a $3x3$ matrix since we have `(3x1).(1x3)` and the 1s "cancel" to produce 3x3. But I get this error: > >     Dot::dotsh: "Tensors {{1},{2},{3}} and {1,2,3} have incompatible shapes. > " >   But then if I do `j.i` I get `{14}` which is correct. Also, I've noticed sometimes with more complex matrices `i` and `j`, that if I set `k=i.j`, no calculation will be done, and the output will just show the two matrices in juxtaposition. But if I just do `i.j` (without the `"k="` part), a calculated output is shown. Does anyone know what the heck I'm doing wrong? This is driving me crazy!
