When solving an ODE with NDSolve, Mathematica returns an interpolation function. I need a discrete sampling of this function however. Naively, I can write this as (example):               slv = f[t]/. NDSolve[f'[t] == -f[t], f[t], {t,0,10}][[1]];     result = Table[{T, slv/.t->T}, {T,0,10,0.1}];      This is very slow for large times and fine sampling, and I have to do this for a large number of functions. But in principle, Mathematica must already store a discretized representation of the function for the interpolation function. Is there a way to access this? Or do you have suggestions on how to make the code above faster? Thanks!
