In many of articles I've read, finding a mentor is often suggested. One to who would guide, teach and more. (I wouldn't know the details, I don't have one, yet.) So, who was your mentor, if any? I have only had indirect mentors: professor at university, manager at work whom I've watched and learnt from the most. And otherwise, Twitter has been a great place to follow the professionals and discover more about the technologies that interest me. But I still wonder how I could find one because I can sense that I might be lacking in my experience. Ideas?
