I'm refactoring an expense tracker system using Object Calisthenics. I'm able to bring my Class down to five attributes. How do I go forward from here? This is my class right now.               public class Expense {         private Identifiers ids;         private AmountInCurrency amountInCurrency;         private Remarks remarks;         private UserList userList;         private ExpenseDate expenseDate;     }       Identifiers has attributes expenseId and reportId AmountInCurrency has an amount and a currency Remarks has a string with remarks. UserList has a List which is List as User has only userName (String). ExpenseDate is a Date object. Also I have a sql database where i'm storing the contents of the Expense object. Should I directly pass the expense object and retrieve the primitives or should I create an entity object which takes this expense object as a constructor argument? NOTE : This is not production code, I'm doing this just as an exercise.
