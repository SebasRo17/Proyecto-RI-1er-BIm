I have two jee web apps that are going to be published on the same physical server, but on different network addresses. **APP A** : Listens to a port on a public IP address and makes synchronous invocations to app B if necessary. **APP B** : Listens to a port on a private IP address and makes synchronous invocations to app A if necessary. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zfoDg.png) For connecting APP A with APP B, I am considering the following alternatives.   * RMI    * Message Queue    * Lightweight ESB Please tell me if you see any clear advantage supported by facts on any of them, or if there's another technology I should consider.
