I'm a front-end developer that is looking into mobile apps development. When I'm searching for ways getting into app development PhoneGap comes as first and most familiar language stack development method. It's really sweet that I can develop an app with HTML/CSS/JavaScript using PhoneGap APIs. But is PhoneGap scalable enough? How far I can go with it in making complex apps and large scale apps? Why and why not I should start learning Objective-C to get into app development?
