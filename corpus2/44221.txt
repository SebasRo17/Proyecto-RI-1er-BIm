I am trying to solve a system of four equations in four variables. I have read a number of threads on similar issues and tried to follow the suggestions. But I think it is a bit messy because of the logs and cross products here. This is the exact system:               7*w = (7*w+5*x+2*y+z) * ( 0.76 + 0.12*Log[w] - 0.08*Log[x] - 0.03*Log[y] -                 0.07*Log[7*w+5*x + 2*y + z]),        5*x = (7*w+5*x+2*y+z) * ( 0.84 - 0.08*Log[w] + 0.11*Log[x] - 0.02*Log[y] -                 0.08*Log[7*w+5*x + 2*y + z]),             2*y = (7*w+5*x+2*y+z) * (-0.45 - 0.03*Log[w] - 0.02*Log[x] + 0.05*Log[y] +                 0.12*Log[7*w+5*x + 2*y + z]),                     1*z = (7*w+5*x+2*y+z)*(-0.16 + 0*Log[w]- 0*Log[x] - 0*Log[y] + 0.03*Log[7*w+5*x + 2*y + z])      This is an extension of a consumer demand system and we, theoretically, know that there exists a unique solution to this system that is positive. **Trys**   * Solve & NSolve : As there should be a solution I tried these, but neither works. I guess that the system has too many logs to handle.   * FindRoot : I started with an initial value of (14,15,10,100) which I get from my data. FindRoot returns the last value (which does not satisfy my system) and the following message. > FindRoot::lstol: The line search decreased the step size to within tolerance > specified by AccuracyGoal and PrecisionGoal but was unable..... ` I tried different initial values, including the value returned by FindRoot. I tried to analyze the pattern of the solution value at each step. I didn’t see any pattern, but noticed that the z values become negative early in the process. So, I put bounds on the values. This just stops the code at the minimum value of 0.1. I also tried an exponential system instead of log - same issues.               Reap[FindRoot[{            7*w == (7*w+5*x + 2*y + z)*(0.76 + 0.12*Log[w] - 0.08*Log[x] - 0.03*Log[y] -                  0.07*Log[7*w+5*x + 2*y + z]),            5*x == (7*w+5*x + 2*y + z)*(0.84 - 0.08*Log[w] + 0.11*Log[x] - 0.02*Log[y] -                  0.08*Log[7*w+5*x + 2*y + z]),            2*y == (7*w + 5*x + 2*y + z)*(-0.45 - 0.03*Log[w] - 0.02*Log[x] + 0.05*Log[y] +                 0.12*Log[7*w + 5*x + 2*y + z]),            z == (7*w + 5*x + 2*y + z)*(-0.16 + 0*Log[w] -0*Log[x] -0*Log[y] +                  0.03*Log[7*w + 5*x + 2*y + z])},           {{w, 14, 0.1, 500},{x, 15, 0.1, 500},{y, 10, 0.1, 500}, {z, 100, 0.1, 500}},            EvaluationMonitor :> Sow[{w, x, y, z}] ]]        * FindMinimum : As we can write this problem as a minimization problem, I tried this (following the suggestion here). The value returned did not converge the system or equations to zero. I tried with only the first two equations, and that sort of converged to zero.              {g1,g2,g3, g4} = {                7*w - (7*w+5*x+2*y+z)* (0.76+0.12*Log[w]-0.08*Log[x]-0.03*Log[y] -                       0.07*Log[7*w + 5*x + 2*y + z]),                5*x - (7*w +5*x+2*y+z)*(0.84-0.08*Log[w]+0.11*Log[x]-0.02*Log[y] -                       0.08*Log[7*w + 5*x + 2*y + z]),                2*y - (7*w+5*x+2*y+z)*(-0.45-0.03*Log[w]- 0.02*Log[x] + 0.05*Log[y] +                       0.12*Log[7*w+5*x+2*y+z]),                1*z - (7*w+5*x+2*y+z)*(-0.16+0*Log[w]-0*Log[x] - 0*Log[y] +                       0.03*Log[7*w+5*x+2*y+z])};          subdomain = 0 < w < 100 && 0 < x < 100 && 0 < y < 100 && 0 < z < 100;     res = FindMinimum[{Total[{g1,g2,g3,g4}^2],subdomain},{w,x,y,z}, AccuracyGoal->5]             {g1,g2,g3,g4}/.res[[2]]      Hope this is engaging enough for the experts here! Any ideas how I should find the solution or why can’t I? It’s the first time I am using Mathematica, and unfortunately the first time I am empirically solving a system/optimizing! Thanks a lot.
