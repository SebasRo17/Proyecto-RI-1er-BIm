My background has largely been manual testing and I started learning core java to be able to work with Selenium. I am wanting to write couple of reusable method, like reading/writing data from csv, excel, word etc. I created a class named - FileHandler and created method for this. Hence this class deals with all sorts of files - csv, excel etc. But going by the OOPs concepts (and if I have understood them right) I should be creating an Interface and implementations for this Interface, and instead of directly dealing with specific implementation I should be working with reference of type interface. i.e.               public interface FileHandler {     }          public class ExcelHandler implements FileHandler {     }          public class WordHandler implements FileHandler  {     }      My question - is this right approach in my scenario should I just create one class to handle all file input/output operations? Though I am yet to figure out what goes in interface as methods like -               getExcelData(String filePath, String workSheet, String row, String column)      would be specific to only reference of type - ExcelHandler and does not make much sense keeping them in interface.
