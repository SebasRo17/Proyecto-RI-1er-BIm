I wonder what is the best practice for interpolating curves? Usually I'm using `BSplineCurve` and adjusting `SplineWeights` so it would fit better (assigning more weight around sharp edges to drag the curve closer to it). Or if I can guess what formula describing the points I use `FindFit`. But often I can't guess the formula and adjusting weights is very tedious so it's easier just manually draw the curve along the points. So what is the best way to join points in _Mathematica_? Consider these five sets of points describing five resonance curves for example:                data = {{{100.434, 0.}, {102.461, 0.0909091}, {104.392, 0.318182}, {105.321, 0.545455},               {106.226, 1.}, {107.108, 0.545455}, {107.965, 0.318182}, {109.608, 0.136364},               {111.154, 0.0909091}},              {{100.434, 0.}, {102.461, 0.06}, {104.392, 0.22}, {105.321, 0.46}, {106.226, 1.},               {107.108, 0.4}, {107.965, 0.12}, {111.154, 0.02}, {113.958, 0.}},              {{100.434, 0.030303}, {102.461, 0.0505051}, {104.392, 0.0909091},               {105.321, 0.272727}, {105.867, 0.494949}, {106.226, 1.}, {106.582, 0.636364},               {107.108, 0.212121}, {107.965, 0.0505051}, {111.154, 0.}},              {{100.434, 0.}, {102.461, 0.0555556}, {104.392, 0.333333}, {105.321, 0.611111},               {105.867, 1.}, {106.226, 0.944444}, {106.405, 0.583333}, {106.582, 0.777778},               {106.933, 1.}, {107.965, 0.444444}, {109.608, 0.166667}, {111.154, 0.0555556}},              {{100.434, 0.0188679}, {102.461, 0.0566038}, {104.392, 0.}, {105.321, 0.54717},               {105.867, 0.849057}, {106.226, 1.}, {106.405, 0.433962}, {106.582, 0.886792},               {106.933, 0.924528}, {107.281, 0.660377}, {107.965, 0.320755},               {111.154, 0.0566038}}}
