Let's take the following simple and funny case               S0 = ParametricPlot3D[{t*Sin[t], t*Cos[t], t}, {t, -100, 100},           BoxRatios -> {1, 1, 1}, AxesLabel -> {"x", "y", "a very long label"}, ImageSize -> 550]      which gives this ![plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/O2rYB.jpg) We see, that the label of the z axes is printed horizontally by default, thus wasting a lot of space. In two-dimensional plots however, this can be easily fixed with the option `RotateLabel -> False`. Is there something similar for three-dimensional plots for rotating and printing vertically the z label? Many thanks in advance.
