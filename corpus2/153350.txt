I've really fallen in love with unit testing and TDD - I am test infected. However, unit testing is normally used for public methods. Sometimes though I do have to test some assumptions-assertions in private methods too, because some of them are "dangerous" and refactoring can't help further. (I know, testing frameworks allow testing private methods). So it became a habit of mine that the first and the last line of a private method are both assertions. However, I've noticed that I tend to use assertions in public methods (as well as the private) just "to be sure". Could this be "testing duplication" since the public method assumptions are tested from the outside by the unit testing framework? Could someone think of too many assertions as a code smell?
