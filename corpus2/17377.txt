I am trying to solve Ten True Sentences Puzzle. > Take a look at the following sentences: > >   * The number of times the digit 0 appears in this puzzle is **_**. >   * The number of times the digit 1 appears in this puzzle is **_**. >   * The number of times the digit 2 appears in this puzzle is **_**. >   * The number of times the digit 3 appears in this puzzle is **_**. >   * The number of times the digit 4 appears in this puzzle is **_**. >   * The number of times the digit 5 appears in this puzzle is **_**. >   * The number of times the digit 6 appears in this puzzle is **_**. >   * The number of times the digit 7 appears in this puzzle is **_**. >   * The number of times the digit 8 appears in this puzzle is **_**. >   * The number of times the digit 9 appears in this puzzle is **_**. > > > Fill these sentences with digits such that all the sentences holds true. I wrote the following code, but it didn't work.               Do[       If[Tally[Range[0, 9] ~Join~ x][[All, 2]] == x, Print@x],       {x, Tuples[Range[0, 9], 10]}] // AbsoluteTiming      How can I imporve my code? **Updated**               Compile[{},        NestWhile[Join[{1, 7, 3, 2}, RandomInteger[10, 6]] &, Range[0,9],            Tally[Range[0, 9] ~Join~ #][[All, 2]] != # &],         CompilationTarget -> "C", RuntimeOptions -> "Speed"        ][] // AbsoluteTiming
