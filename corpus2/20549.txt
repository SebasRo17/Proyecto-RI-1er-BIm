I want to speed up my code and I have two ideas, but I don't know how I can implement them. Here is a little part of my code, which I want to improve:                  R[FK_, f_] :=            FixedPoint[               Integrate[PDF[f, x]*x , {x, 0, id[Q[FK, #], #]}]               *If[CDF[f, id[Q[FK, #], #]] == 0., 0.1, CDF[f,id[Q[FK, #], #]]]               *id[Q[FK, #], #] &          , seedR] ;      1) You can see that the function is evaluated `id[Q[FK, #], #]` 3 times. That is unecassary. Normaly I would use a Module structure, define a new variable `idd = id[Q[FK, #], #]`, like                   R2[FK_, f_] :=            Module[{iddd},            FixedPoint[              iddd = id[Q[FK, #], #] &;              Integrate[PDF[f, x]*x , {x, 0, iddd}]             *If[CDF[f, iddd] == 0., 0.1, CDF[f, iddd]]             *iddd &           ,seedR]];      but this does not work. Do you have any idea? 2) Probably a easy one:                   If[CDF[f, id[Q[FK, #], #]] == 0., 0.1, CDF[f, id[Q[FK, #], #]]]      This involves the funtion `CDF[f, id[Q[FK, #], #]]` two times. One time should be enough. How can I do this? Thanks Peter
