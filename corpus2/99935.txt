> **Possible Duplicates:**   >  MonoTouch vs Objective-C for iPhone/iPod/iPad development   >  As a C# developer, would you learn Java to develop for Android or use > MonoDroid instead? I'm very curious about the tools named MonoTouch and MonoDroid to create applications for Android, iPhone and iPod by using c# code. Question:   * Are these tools good enough to create applications that will be used in different environments?   * Can these tools replace the orgininal way of creating application? If you create an application for Android, you often use Java to create it.   * How different is it to create a application with Mono for Android compare to creating an application for Windows Mobile Phone?
