The problem I described below is an simplified way of expressing it.(Sorry that I still did not figure out a way to copy the code to here.) The actual equation is like![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/skUP2.png) What I am trying to find is what value of `a` will leads to a non-zero value of H.So that the `FindInstance` is my first choice, but it could not solve it. I tried to understand the the behavior of the two functions by plotting them out. I first plot the left side of the first function, by setting B constant,and plot the left side with respect to H. It looks like this.![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/MFfUI.png)![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rY5jB.png).It has a singularity point when H=B. I also plot second equation by setting B constant.And plot the right side of the equation with respect to H.The result is increase monotonic until it reaches infinity singularity when H=B. I tried to solve this set of equations.![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/swVn1.png) But when I try to use Solve,Eliminate,Reduce , they told me "The equations appear to involve the variables to be solved for in an essentially non-algebraic way ". Then I tried to use Nsolve to do it by setting one of the variable constant. But it told me it could not solve it.![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/sNAwa.png) So that I tried to use FindInstance to solve it. But it gives me this result.![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/X5H73.png) But the k needs to be summed, which is not a variable. Then I tried to write it a little differently.It pops up some other problems as said below.![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jB5ks.png) I tried to simplify the problem to find out the problem. It gives me this.![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8twL8.png)
