I want to create a standalone mathematica executable. I would like to have some view capabilities like CreateDialog or TabView or those kinds of things. I would like my users to have an interface to input dynamic strings and variables. I want to do something like this:               function = TabView[{        "General" -> Column[{           Row[{TextCell["Project Name:"], InputField[Dynamic[proj]]}],           Row[{TextCell["Number of Inputs:"], InputField[Dynamic[num]]}]           }],        "Another Tab" -> Plot[x^2, {x, 0, 10}]        }, ControlPlacement -> Left]      Anyone familiar with this process?
