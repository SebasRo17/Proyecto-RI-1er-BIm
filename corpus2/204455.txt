I am an objective-c/iOS apps developer and I was wondering if I perform Unit Tests on my code, how should I go about it? What is unit test anyway? Ain't I testing a specific part of code while running the whole app itself? What is its use? I have read few articles, wikipedia etc. but I am not sure whether unit testing is a time consuming or a time saving process. I know the definition but I am in the dilemma about its purpose. Plz guide a new bee here. :) Have already gone through the following: Unit testing best practices for a unit testing newbie
