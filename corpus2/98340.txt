The licenses I know, including open source and the less restrictive ones like BSD, make it mandatory to:   * Retain the copyright notice, and/or:   * Indicate that the precise part of source code was written by the original author. Let's say I want to share source code I've written and I want to grant all rights, including the right to:   * Remove the copyright notice or substitute another one,   * Sell the source code or use it in a commercial product with no restrictions,   * Never indicate that this source code was written by me¹, but at the same time disclaim any warranty as it is the case in BSD license. Are there licenses which match this case? Note: public domain is not a solution, since the term is unclear and change from one country to another. * * * ¹ Why would anyone do that? Because we all have pieces of code which are not worth real licensing, but still useful for the community (example: removing diacritics from a text). Providing it "completely free" is in this case much for friendly that saying that in order to use your code, the person must read a few paragraphs or pages of an UNREADABLE ALL CAPITAL text, understand it, accept it, and then copy-paste your name and copyright notice every time the code is used.
