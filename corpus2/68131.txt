I just joined a team who has been working in a project for over a year and a half, there's a lot of docs to read (specs, requirements etc..) , and project's repository is full of branches and tags also their are a lot of defects and bugs that need to be corrected , so i'm just kind of in a scary situation now. I should maybe mention that the project uses J2EE, WebServices. So if anyone has any advice on how to approach this . thanks.
