I think i've understood more or less what a parsed Scheme program looks like (a binary tree with atomic values on the leaves, if i have understood correctly). Can anybody please define to me, or give a reference, what a _state_ (or a _computation_ ) of a Scheme program is? Is it just the current binding plus a position, or a stack of positions, on the syntax tree? (In such a case, i would appreciate a reference for a formal definition of Scheme binding as well :).) Is there some simple description, like the one for the Turing Machine (the program + the current content of the tape + the current position on the tape)?
