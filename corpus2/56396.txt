I have written a function `Fun` as below:               Fun[x_Symbol, xrange_, imageSize_, axeslabel_] :=      Plot[x^2, {x, xrange[[1]], xrange[[2]]},         ImageSize -> imageSize,         AxesLabel -> axeslabel]          Fun[x, {-1, 2}, 400, {"x", "y"}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XRgbe.png) However, I'd like to rewrite it to use `OptionsPattern`               RewriteFun[x_Symbol, OptionsPattern[Plot]] :=        Plot[x^2, {x, -1, 2},          ImageSize -> OptionValue[ImageSize],          AxesLabel -> OptionValue[AxesLabel]]          RewriteFun[x, ImageSize -> 400, AxesLabel -> {"x", "y"}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pERvd.png) I have two problems.   * I don't know how to deal with an option like `{x, xmin, xmax}`.   * I don't how to get the kind of syntax coloring the varible `x` has in `Plot[x^2, {x, -1, 2}]`. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ajifs.png) So my question is: How do I revise the `RewriteFun` to solve my problems?
