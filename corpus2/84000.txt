Any news whether the official Mango release will allow sideloading of apps? I mean ability to deploy apps without going through the MarketPlace? I would like to see the ability to deploy my own apps on my own device without using third party services and paying extra fees. I don't plan to publish apps publicly. (I tried ChevronWP7 and it couldn't work as intended. Probably obsoleted by MS.)
