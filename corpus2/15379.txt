I have been developing on Android for a couple months now, and building upon one in house program I found the scalability to be lacking. I have that gut feeling that if I applied some OO Design Patterns I would get an overall better program in speed, scalability, and readability. Do any of you SOdians have some ways you applied a/many design pattern(s) that just seem to fit extremely well with the way Android works?
