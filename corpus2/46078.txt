I'm plotting an hemisphere with               radius = 5;     Height = 0.2;     SphericalPlot3D[ radius, { θ, 0, π/2}, { ϕ, 0, 2 π},                       BoxRatios -> { 1, 1, ((0.5 Height)/(radius) + 0.03)}]      and I'm using `BoxRatios` to flatten the hemisphere so that it has a "height" of 0.2.   Is it possible to manually write/show the $z$-axis values so the visible range is not `{ 0, radius}`   but `{ 0, 0.2}`?
