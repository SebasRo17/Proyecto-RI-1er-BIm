Why dialogs created with `CreateDialog` cannot correctly show content with transparent background? The following example generates a plot, with white background, though it should be gray, as that is the default color of the dialog window of Windows. If, however, I move a window in front of the dialog covering it halfway or totally, the background reverts to the default panel- gray (see figures below).               CreateDialog[DocumentNotebook[        Plot[Sin@x, {x, 0, 2 \[Pi]}, Frame -> True, Axes -> False,          Background -> None, ImagePadding -> 30, ImageSize -> 300]        ]];      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Pg6Uk.png) (Left: the new dialog as it appears. Middle: covering the dialog halfway with another window, then removing the covering window. Right: Covering the window fully, and then revealing.) The following approach does not work either:               Background -> Directive[Red, Opacity[0]]      This behaviour is more emphasized if the content is dynamic:               CreateDialog[DocumentNotebook[Column@{          Slider@Dynamic@n,          Dynamic@Plot[Sin@x, {x, 0, n \[Pi]}, Frame -> True, Axes -> False,             Background -> None, ImagePadding -> 30, ImageSize -> 300]          }]];      While it appears first with white background, even mouse movements cause it to turn into the desired gray color. My problem is that I have a gui, where a plot is created and updated in real time. I would like to have its background to be the color of the underlying panel, but it continuously switches between white and gray during updating. Any idea how to overcome this?
