I am building a service that finds popular posts from several blogs. What criteria could I use to define what the most popular posts are? For example, I track Facebook and Twitter share counts for every post of every blog and I rank the blog posts for their share counts. But that isn't the best solution because some bloggers can increase their sharing counts with fraudulent shares. What would be a better set of critera to rank what the most popular posts are?
