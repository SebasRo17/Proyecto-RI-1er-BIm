I am a new grad with what appears to be my first job lined up (1 solid offer, another place still courting me, so not sure exactly what I will be doing yet). What advice do you wish you had when you started out? In terms of making the best impression? In terms of making sure to get the best reviews? In terms of setting oneself up for the best career growth?
