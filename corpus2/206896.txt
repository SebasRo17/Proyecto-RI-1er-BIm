I am working on an e-commerce website. There is a case where I need to fetch the whole data in database through a third-party API and send it to an indexing engine. This third-party API has many functions like getproducts, getproductprice, etc., and each of those functions will return the data in XML format. From there I will take charge, I will use various API calls and will handle the XML data with XSLT. And will write to a CSV file. This file will be uploaded to an Indexing engine. Right now I have details of 8000 products to feed the engine, and almost all time the this process takes about 15 min to complete, and sometimes fails. I can't find a better solution for this. I am thinking about handling the XML data in C# itself and get rid of XSLT. As I think, XSLT is far slower than C#. Is it a good Idea? Or what else I can do to solve this issue?
