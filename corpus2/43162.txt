If I want to get the list of k-partition, and the rule are below:   1. here are `k` partitions   2. all elements of partition are in the range of 1 to 30.   3. the total of element from each partition equals to 30. For example, if `k=5`, the partition includes {1,1,1,1,26},{1,1,1,2,25},{1,1,1,3,24}...... Many thanks!!!
