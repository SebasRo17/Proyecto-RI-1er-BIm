I've read Where are octals useful? and it seems like octals are something that were once upon a time useful. Many languages treat numbers preceding with a 0 as octal, so the literal `010` is actually 8. A few among these is JavaScript, Python (2.7), and Ruby. But I don't really see why these languages need octal, _especially_ when the more likely use of the notation is to denote a decimal number with a superfluous 0. JavaScript is a client-side language, octal seems pretty useless. All three are pretty modern in other sense, and I don't think that there would be much code using octal notation that would be broken by removing this "feature". So, my questions are:   * Is there any point of these languages supporting octal literals?   * If octal literals are necessary, why not use something like `0o10`? Why copy an old notation that overrides a more useful use case?
