I am discovering web services to implement in my ASP.Net website. I visited many sites about Why use webservices and read many articles and found out that web services are good when you have something that is used frequently without loading your page. I want to know some other example scenarios where web services are used. Whether i can use web services in sending an order form to database or it is just for textbox box auto completion like google and etc. **Note:** I know web services can be used from mobile, web or desktop applications. But My question is   **_When do I use web service in ASP.Net Application?_** Some articles I've read so far   * Codeplex   * How to create a Web service using Visual Studio.net   * w3school
