I have a reservation system that I have coded and my final task is to allow the user to enter a set of dates and then show them all available options. The reservation table is set up with `unit_id`, `check_in` and `check_out`. There are twelve different unit numbers. So I have to somehow iterate through them and find the units that have no taken dates during the date range the user has put in. Just having some trouble conceptualizing what needs to happen. Pseudo code               $units = array (all the units);          foreach($units as $key = $value){              Run a query searching through all reservations for that unit,          if the unit is available, add to our $available_units array for the view later          }      Checking availability has me stumped too though. What is the most efficient way to use the customers available date range and compare to the date ranges in the db?
