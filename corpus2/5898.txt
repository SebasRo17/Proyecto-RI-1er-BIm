This question is a continuation of this. As answered by J.M., I am able to iterate a solution. However, I am unable to plot it. I am sure that this has to do with my inability to understand how the plot routine works and I can't seem to figure it out:               state = First[       NDSolve`ProcessEquations[{D[u[t, x], t] == D[u[t, x], x, x],          u[0, x] == 0, u[t, 0] == Sin[t], u[t, 5] == 0}, u, t, {x, 0, 5}]]          NDSolve`Iterate[state, 5]     NDSolve`ProcessSolutions[state, "Forward"]          Plot3D[      Evaluate[u[t, x] /. NDSolve`ProcessSolutions[state, "Forward"]],      {t,0,2},      {x, 0, 5}      ]      gives me a blank plot with no curves. What am I doing wrong? I can't omit `{t, 0, 2}` as that would give me an error.
