After spending some time using the Mathematica documentation and this Mathematica.SE _answer_, I implemented the Runge-Kutta-2 routines. I am hoping someone can validate what I did and tell me that it is correct (especially the Butcher Tableau I used) and the step size $h = 0.1$.                 ClassicalRungeKuttaCoefficients[4, prec_] :=         With[{amat = {{1/2}}, bvec = {0, 1}, cvec = {1/2}},          N[{amat, bvec, cvec}, prec]]            {xf, yf} = {x, y} /.          First@NDSolve[{x'[t] == -y[t], y'[t] == x[t], x[0] == 1,           y[0] == 0}, {x, y}, {t, 0, 6},           Method -> {"ExplicitRungeKutta", "DifferenceOrder" -> 4,          "Coefficients" -> ClassicalRungeKuttaCoefficients},           StartingStepSize -> 1/10];            xl = MapThread[Append, {xf["Grid"], xf["ValuesOnGrid"]}]            yl = MapThread[Append, {yf["Grid"], yf["ValuesOnGrid"]}]      We can find a closed form solution to this problem as:                 s = DSolve[{x'[t] == -y[t], y'[t] == x[t], x[0] == 1, y[0] == 0}, {x, y}, t]      Lastly, is there an automated way to update and step through each variant of RK-2, RK-3, RK-4, ... without having to manually enter the Butcher values (in other words, I want to step through each variant of RK-n and compare the errors (a table of that would be great))? There is a hint of this at _Wolfram's Reference page_. Note: I am embarrassed to say that I did not totally understand ClassicalRungeKuttaCoefficients (other than the coefficients).
