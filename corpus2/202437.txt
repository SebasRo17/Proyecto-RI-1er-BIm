I have been asked to make a mobile app for a friends website. The website is a Multi level marketing site that sells products and franchises. A client logs in in to the website and can view his or her dashboard ( user can view team members, business volume, commissions, invoices, etc.) The app is supposed to bring the dashboard to user's mobile devices (w/ some added features). The company does not have any APIs that deal with interaction or authentication, and I am new to the whole secure login side of app development. My questions is this, how do I let the users gain access to their information via my app from the secure website when there is no API?
