Pappus graph is one of many graphs whose various data is contained within Mathematica. Mathematica typically keeps several ways of representing such graphs:               GraphData["PappusGraph", "AllImages"]      will give its several representations: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2INoM.gif) I found these images pretty amazing - they look very different! _How to create an animation that will gradually go through all representations of Papus graph?_ For example, to clarify the question, this is an animation made by Mark McClure created by transitioning from one to another "hardcoded" plot of the same graph: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/D7mjJ.gif)               vc1 = # - {1, 1} & /@ {{0, 2}, {1, 2}, {2, 2}, {1, 1},        {0, 0}, {1, 0}, {2, 0}};     vc2 = {{1/2, -Sqrt[3]/2}, {-1/2, -Sqrt[3]/2}, {-1, 0},        {1/2, Sqrt[3]/2}, {1, 0}, {0, 0}, {-1/2, Sqrt[3]/2}};     vc[t_] := t*vc2 + (1 - t) vc1;     Animate[       Graph[{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7},         UndirectedEdge@@@{{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 7}, {7, 6}, {6, 5}, {5, 1},           {1, 6}, {4, 5}, {4, 7}},         PlotRange -> 1.1, VertexCoordinates -> vc[t]],       {t, 0, 1}, AnimationDirection -> ForwardBackward]      How to do it for any graph that is available in Mathematica currated data, for representatios given by `GraphData[<graph name>, "AllImages"]`? EDIT: This is part of the animation obtained with DyckGraph, using belisarius' solution: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/lRqfp.gif) Also, BrouwerHaemersGraph: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fraOH.gif)
