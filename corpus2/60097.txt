I'm a student working on my B.E(CS) and my question is the following:   1. Is testing in the software field needed?    2. If we create a software with great care, then why should we test?    3. After testing can we be **sure** that we have achieved this goal (the product/software works as intended) because we have done the **testing** for it? Is it possible? My question: **Is testing of software needed**?
