I got involved in a discussion recently on how to handle refactoring in general (which is an interesting topic in itself). Eventually the following question was brought up: **How does one handle merge conflicts that occured due to that someone did a refactoring of a part of the code, while someone else was working on a feature for the same piece of code?** Basically, I have no idea how to deal with this in an efficient manner. Are there any best practices that one should follow regarding this? Is there any difference on how one should handle this for a system with tons of legacy code?
