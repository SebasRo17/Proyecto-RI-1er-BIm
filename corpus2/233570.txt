How does the client know to send request to server only when the confirmation box result is ok and stay on page if cancelled? Also, is this mechanism any different in ASP.Net and ASP.Net MVC? I want to know the internal working of when user clicks OK/cancel what happens internally. How does browser come to know it has to proceed to server call or close itself and do nothing? What I have researched so far tells me, that on a web forms page, the Page.IsValid property is somehow responsible for browser to determine the outcome.Is it correct? Also what happens with MVC?
