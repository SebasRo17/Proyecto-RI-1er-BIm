_Mathematica_ provides nonlinear, unconstrained test problems here:               Needs["Optimization`UnconstrainedProblems`"]      and LP test problems here:               ExampleData["LinearProgramming"]      Does anyone know a good source of constrained nonlinear problems in _Mathematica_ format? Also nice to have, but not essential, would be mixed integer linear and nonlinear test problems.
