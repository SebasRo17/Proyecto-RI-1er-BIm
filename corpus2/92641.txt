I have used RAD tools for windows and web development for many years (primarily Infragistics). I invariably find myself in some situation where I have a very difficult time figuring out what is going on because these controls have layer upon layer of indirection and abstraction. This goes for all sorts of RAD tools, including AJAX update panels, AJAX grids, etc. More than once I have found myself asking "Is this worth the trouble?" For all the trouble and time I take debugging what often are bugs or quirks in these controls, would it be better to just code my own AJAX? Code my own extra functionality instead of using these RAD tools? The other problem with them is it keeps us unfamiliar with the technology they are using, for instance I have never done my own AJAX because I have always had update panels etc. But I imagine this would be useful to know. What is your take on this? Note: Please don't just say "Well you should try XYZ RAD tools instead of Infragistics...they are better". This isn't a debate on the RAD tool itself. This question is about RAD tools in general, not the merits of the one I mentioned in my question.
