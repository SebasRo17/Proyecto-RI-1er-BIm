I am presently an employed software engineer, less than a decade out of college. Given where I would like to be in my career, I am currently looking to sharpen my skills to find my next job. However, I feel that I have certain technical deficits, from my degree and work choices, that make it difficult for me to study on my own or pass muster in the positions I hope to achieve. Because of this, I am trying to find a professional mentorship or continuing study group for practitioners beyond my workplace, as I believe I would benefit from having someone with more experience elucidate areas that I might wish to build competence in. I believe this would also help identify material that I would not otherwise be able to find on my own. This is especially true for the algorithms training that I missed in college. While trying to shore this up, I have participated in Top Coder, Coursera, MIT Open Courseware, and Project Euler. I have also purchased, digested, and worked with many books focused on CS and programming. This is well and good, but having this process be solely self-directed is both isolating and lacking in necessary social feedback on how my studies connect with the real world. As such, I am curious what resources might be beneficial for someone looking for a human component to studying SE/CS outside of the workplace. Would it be valuable if I started a group myself, for people looking to study these areas? * * * _Full disclosure: This is a new account, because I prefer to separate this question from my professional identity. I almost feel embarrassed by it, to the point of not asking, which is precisely why I feel it may be valuable for others here._
