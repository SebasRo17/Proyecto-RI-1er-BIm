MVC is used a lot (not only in web apps) and it seems it's the 'go to' approach when designing software. There are also a lot of MVC versions. My question is: what was before MVC? How did people structure large software systems? Obviously 'separation of concerns' wasn't invented with MVC (even if it wasn't called that). I assume this type of thinking, which is crucial for building and maintaining software, was present long ago. But in more technical terms, how was software structured before MVC?
