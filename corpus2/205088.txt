I have been programming for a while, and the edge that I am missing over other programming is algorithms. I know what is linked-list and binary tree, but I dont know many more of them. I failed on 2 interviews, because of exercises that demanded me to know some data structures algorithms. I am also starting to build a javascript project which has some heavy processing, and I need to know a few good frequently used algorithms?
