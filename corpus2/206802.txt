I'm about to improve my skills in all that is related to designing applications from scratch using proper OOD principles, involving MVC pattern and using TDD approach to do it. I have a project for that. I also finished reading a book by Matt Zandstra: PHP Objects, Patterns and Practice And my question is still left unanswered... How do I start designing from scratch? Should I start using TDD immediately? It doesn't feels comfortable when u have nothing implemented yet. Should I use code spaghetti just to build working prototype first, understand the scope and needs and only then rewrite all using proper OOD and TDD? I'd love to get any advice, how to work towards something considered "RIGHT TO DO", or any book that will actually lay down things of how to build the applications form scratch, or design an architecture and dependencies, rather than just throwing lifeless implementation sample codes of Design patterns like Zandstra did. Thanks! **UPD:** Basically, my question is: Is it a good idea to immediately start new project from using TDD and proper OOD, or first write something that works using the most horrible and fastest ways and then refactor everything or rewrite from scratch after you got some idea of how you want your application to look like?
