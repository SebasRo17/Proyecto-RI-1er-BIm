I'm about to implement my own very simple programming language, and an interpreter to execute code in that language. The language will be very basic. Example code:               var x = 3     if x > 2 print x     if x < 2 print "hello"      The language wouldn't feature anything more complex than single-line `if` statements. This is because it's the first time I'm attempting something like this, so I'm starting small. The interpreter will be written in Java, and thus execute the code with Java operations. My question is this: I know that the topic of creating compilers and interpreters is very complex. But since I'm new to this, I believe I should start with basic techniques and approaches. **What should I learn before starting to work on this project? Especially what kind of knowledge regarding parsing and interpreting should I learn before starting?** Is it enough to just 'break down the text into substrings, and then more substrings', or should I learn more advanced techniques and apply them? **The knowledge and experience I acquire are meant to allow me to later build more knowledge on top of it when I continue learning and implementing interpreters. But shouldn't be 'too much' for a first attempt.**
