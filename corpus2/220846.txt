I read on a similar forum http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8117530/examples- for-acceptance-criteria-for-a-user-story about putting in the acceptance criteria for product backlog item. I am working on a Scrum based project and I need more info as my backlog item is as follows - UserProfiles ( I am using this in the title field in tfs 2013) and the description contains all the "As a user I want to be able to create new users and assign permissions' The acceptance criteria talks about how the user interacts with the UI (as discussed in one of the answers in the above link - which is very logical) For example   * As the user clicks on the home button, system will bring up 3 options   * And then the user can enter their user name  Is this the right approach I am using to use title for PBI and put the actual user story in description field in tfs Thanks in advance
