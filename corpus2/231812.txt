From what I've gathered: **Project Manager (PM)(or Business Analyst (BA))** : Decides EVERYTHING. Capable of solving problems. This means he or she will have the skills necessary to look at data and other relevant information in order to determine where the losses are within a company. He or she must be skilled in negotiation, listening, motivational speaking and will also be a good team leader.   * Responsible writing the BRD, where contained are all the Business Requirements of the users/customers.   * BAs serve as a communication conduit between the stakeholders and the team **Software Architect** : The Architect is the interface between the dev team and the stakeholders. They need to be able to understand the business side and the technical details. Architects see what you need now, what you mean when you say what you need, and design a software strategy that will give you what you need today, and a home that you can grow into (and from) in the future. **Scrum Master** : Priority # 1 is to remove impediments as reported by team. He should also constantly look out for potential impediments.. and more importantly impediments that are there but not yet identified. Impediments are opportunities. So scrum-master should avail these opportunities all day long to bring his team(s) to hyper productivity. (avail = use or take advantage of) It appears several of these roles overlap one another. Please help clarify this issue. Some kind of story that strings together all these people would really help! Thanks much.
