I've tried to calculate few classic sums using Dirichlet regularization:               Sum[n, {n, 1, ∞}, Regularization -> "Dirichlet"]     Sum[n^2, {n, 1, ∞}, Regularization -> "Dirichlet"]      I get expected results: `-1/12` and `0`. But when I start sum from the `0`, I notice an interesting pattern: $$ \sum_0^\infty n^k - \sum_1^\infty n^k = (-1)^{k+1}\frac{1}{k + 1} $$ I'm having trouble understanding this. Is this some misuse of Dirichlet regularization in _Mathematica_ , or some interesting (or not) thing in the math itself?
