I am trying to isolate each of the blue painted fingernails in the image. However, I am not sure what approach should be considered due to the white design on each nail interrupting the otherwise uniform nail color. This of course, makes `EdgeDetect` a lot harder to apply. Any suggestion would be appreciated.               i = Import["http://i.stack.imgur.com/46JAy.jpg"]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/EMCMt.png) **+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ UPDATE +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++** Thanks to both Belisarius and Vitaliy Kaurov for your in depth responses. I am trying to consider a more general case such as the following image. I would like to use an edge detection approach to find the area of the nails. using a `MedianFilter` does help a lot and isolates the nail areas. However, what would be the next step in using the result to detect the nail areas? I am guessing that I would need to 'complete' the circles of these lines first. Is there a better approach? Perhaps measuring the density of the lines would be the best...               i = Import["http://i.stack.imgur.com/6khSE.png"]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6khSE.png)               EdgeDetect[MedianFilter[i, 4]]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FFNy5.png)
