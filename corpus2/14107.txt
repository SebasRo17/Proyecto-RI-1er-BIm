I wish to plot the graph of a surface while being able to change a parameter. My current code is               ContourPlot3D[(Cos[Pi/4]+x Cos[0]Sin[Pi/4]+y Sin[0]Sin[Pi/4])^2 ==       (1+x^2+y^2)Cos[a]^2, {x, -10, 10}, {y, -10, 10}, {z, -10, 10},       {a = 0 .. Pi}, AxesLabel -> {x, y, z}]      I don't want to do it with `Manipulate[]`, since I don't a the graph of the surface of a given "a" between 0 and Pi, but the graph of the surface with "a" from 0 to Pi.
