I want to plot a two functions together that looks like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/JyJHB.png) But I am only able to come up with this;"which is clearly wrong"               Plot3D[{x^2 + x + y^2, x + y}, {x, -20000, 20000}, {y, -20000, 20000}]      I have looked through the help section but somehow I am not getting how to change it. Ps: I do not care about the range that its plotted in.
