Say I have a number $n_{max}$. I want a command to generate a table like               1 1     2 2     3 3     4 4     ...     nmax nmax      where the second column is editable, and this table can be evaluated so that Mathematica treats the table as the set               replacement = { 1 -> 1, 2 -> 2, ...}      (The point of this is so that I can replace the original list using /.replacement). So for example, after generating the table above, I can edit the second column as follows               1 A     2 B     3 C     4 D     ...     nmax FF      and this output re-evaluates into set               replacement = { 1-> A, 2-> B, 3-> C, F-> D, ... , nmax-> FF}
