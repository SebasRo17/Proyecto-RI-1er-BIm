Exchange 2010 has a delegation model where groups of winrm cmdlets are essentally grouped into roles, and the roles assigned to a user. ![Exchange Roles Image](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CYzCU.jpg) (Image source) This is a great & flexible model considering how I can leverage all the benefits of PowerShell, while using the right low level technologies (WCF, SOAP etc), and requiring no additional software on the client side. ![image of how Exchange 2010 remote admin works](http://i.stack.imgur.com/G44ru.jpg) (Image source) **Question(s)**   1. Is there a way for me to leverage Exchange's delegation model in my .NET application?    2. Has anyone attempted to imitate this model?   3. If I must start from scratch, how would I go about imitating this approach?
