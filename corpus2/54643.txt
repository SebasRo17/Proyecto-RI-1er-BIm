Normally, when you use `Dynamic` with a CPU-intensive expression, the expression only gets evaluated when a symbol in the expression changes. This doesn't seem to work with `RegionNearest`:               d = RegionIntersection[Ellipsoid[{2., 2.}, {5, 3}],         Ellipsoid[{5., 3.}, {4, 3}]];         nf = RegionNearest[d];     pt = {0, 0};      `Timing[nf[pt]]` tells me that this takes .6s on my PC (side question: why does this take so long? I thought this would be equivalent to finding the nearest point to each of the two ellipsoids, then checking if that point is contained in the other.) Now when I write:               Dynamic[nf[pt]]      The Mathematica kernel goes to 25% CPU utilization (one core) and stays there, even when nothing changes. Is this a bug? **ADD:** as @Nasser remarked in a comment, `Dynamic[nf[pt]]` doesn't make much sense on it's own. My actual code was:               LocatorPane[Dynamic[pt],      Show[       Graphics[Dynamic[Line[{pt, nf[pt]}]]],       RegionPlot[d]]]      But `Dynamic[nf[pt]]` is the simplest way to reproduce the problem.
