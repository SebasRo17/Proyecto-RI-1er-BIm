I am in the process of trying to identify a suitable project for my final year at university. How important is it that the project be unique? I really want to do a project with the Kinect and am eagerly awaiting the official SDK. As yet I am struggling for an idea. However, I have looked at kinecthacks.com to see what other people have been working on, and a few of these ideas interest me. Would you think it is ethical to take one of these ideas and implement yourself? Obviously one would try to implement additional functionality on top of what is already there? Thanks.
