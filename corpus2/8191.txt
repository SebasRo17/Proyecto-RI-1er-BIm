I've got a Plot of a list of functions from this previous question of mine.               rp[x_, r_] := 1000 x (r + 1)/(r + x)     ratios = Table[10^n, {n, -2, 2, 4/10}]     Plot[Map[rp[x, #] &, ratios], {x, 0, 1}, Evaluated -> True]        ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/S3qyq.png) Now I want the sixth function, where ratio = 1, to be plotted with a `PlotStyle -> AbsoluteThickness` parameter. How can I do this?
