I am having some problems setting up the MUnit testing framework for a J/Link project and would be grateful for advice. I _do_ have J/Link working when running or debugging the .nb notebook in workbench, just can't get it going when trying to run or debug the .mt unit test file. I did the following steps, following the documentation as closely as i can. I created a fresh J/Link project, right-click the inner project folder and choose New / TestFile, and I get a tree like the following in the package explorer of workbench:               fooProject     +-- javaSource     +-- JRE System Library [1.1]     +-- fooProject     |   +-- Java     |   +-- Kernel     |   |   +-- init.m     |   +-- fooProject.m     |   +-- fooProject.mt <---- this is my unit test file; can't get it going     +-- fooProject.nb     <---- this one works well      I put a couple of functions in my .m package file:               (* Mathematica Package *)     (* Created by the Wolfram Workbench Feb 3, 2012 *)     BeginPackage["fooProject`", {"JLink`"}]     (* Exported symbols added here with SymbolName::usage *)      KvpQ::usage = "Tests whether its argument is a KVPair or KVP, that is, a list of two values, the first of which is a string or symbol Key.";     Begin["`Private`"]     (* Implementation of the package *)     SymbolQ[x_Symbol] := True;     SymbolQ[___] := False (* all other cases produce False *);     KvpQ[kvp_List] := (Length@kvp === 2 &&        (StringQ[kvp[[1]]] || SymbolQ[kvp[[1]]]));     KvpQ[___] := False;     End[]     EndPackage[]      Then I open the MUnit Test file, fooProject.mt, do `Ctrl`+`K` and choose the test template, and then fill it out:               (* Mathematica Test File *)     Test[         KvpQ[{}]         ,         False         ,         TestID->"fooProject-20120203-Q0O8P9"     ]      Now, following the directions at the wolfram site on J/Link launching, I create the new configuration as directed accepting all defaults. Then when I try to run the unit tests, I get a dialog with the unsettling message:               The selected file is not a Mathematica notebook or scrapbook file.      Please make sure that a file with extension .nb or .mscrapbook      is selected, then try the run again.      This leads me to suspect that MUnit testing just isn't supported for J/Link projects, which would make me sad :( But it's more likely I've just done something silly wrong. Again, I'd be grateful for any advice or guidance. Thanks.
