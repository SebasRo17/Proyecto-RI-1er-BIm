I believe that this is a doc error in V10 (this was programmed to be but not implemented). The new `VoronoiMesh` should work for 3D set of points. The `DelaunayMesh` function works. Here is a doc example:               pts = RandomReal[{-1, 1}, {25, 3}];     DelaunayMesh[RandomReal[{-1, 1}, {25, 3}]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qjDiH.png) But if you try:               pts = RandomReal[{-1, 1}, {25, 3}];     VoronoiMesh[pts]      You get the error: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/g3UrU.png) Docs for Voronoi say: > The cells will be intervals in 1D, convex polygons in 2D, and convex > polyhedra in 3D. Tested in V10.0.0 for Mac and Win.
