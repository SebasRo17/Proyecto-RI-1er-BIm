I would like to keep the ordering of the bra ket-print but right now this doesn't happen. Any Idea? I tried playing with HoldForm but then i could evaluate the expression inside properly               Ns = 1;     Table[      (Ket[(Replace[ Quotient[i - 1, Ns], {0 -> "\[UpArrow] ",           1 -> "\[DownArrow] "}] <> ToString@Mod[i, Ns])]       Bra[(Replace[        Quotient[j - 1, Ns], {0 -> "\[UpArrow] ",           1 -> "\[DownArrow] "}] <> ToString@Mod[j, Ns])])          , {i, 1, Ns*2}, {j, 1, Ns*2}   ] // MatrixForm      Right now this gives: ![bad braket](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qzzxa.png) I would like it to give something more like: ![good braket](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nnhIj.png) Thank you
