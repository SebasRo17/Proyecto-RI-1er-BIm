This is something that bothered me a lot at school. 5 years ago, when I learned SQL, I always wondered why we specify first the fields we want and then where we want them from. According to my idea, we should write:               From Employee e     Select e.Name      So why the norm says:               Select e.Name -- Eeeeek, what e means ?     From Employee e -- Ok, now I know what e is      It took me weeks to understand SQL, and I know that a lot of that time was consumed by the wrong order of elements. It is like writing in C#:               string name = employee.Name;     var employee = this.GetEmployee();      So, I assume that it has a historical reason, anyone knows why?
