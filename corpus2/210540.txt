I saw these question in our school's past paper, and I'm wondering if this is a valid question. > How big is `bool` in C and C++? > > A) 1 bit > > B) 4 bit > > C) 8 bit > > D) 1 byte > > What is the smallest unit of memory C or C++ use? > > A) 1 bit > > B) 4 bit > > C) 8 bit > > D) 1 byte The answer to both are D, but I am thinking if this is inappropriate. EDIT: 1 byte is not necessarily 8 bits on some systems. See this StackOverflow post.
