If I quote a paragraph from Wikipedia about _Optimization_ : > In computer science, program optimization or software optimization is the > process of modifying a software system to make some aspect of it work more > efficiently or use fewer resources. In general, a computer program may be > optimized so that it executes more rapidly, or is capable of operating with > less memory storage or other resources, or draw less power. And about _Scalabilty_ : > Application scalability refers to the improved performance of running > applications on a scaled-up version of the system. What's the difference? They both end up improving the performance of the system. Are they the same, if so, why are their names different?
