From its description I thought that the normalizations of the directions `d_i` of the semi-axes did not matter when using the `Ellipsoid` function. Indeed, the following two commands give the same output:               Needs["MultivariateStatistics`"];     Graphics[Ellipsoid[{0, 0}, {1, 1}, {{0, 1}, {1, 0}}], Axes -> True]     Graphics[Ellipsoid[{0, 0}, {1, 1}, {{0, 100}, {100, 0}}], Axes -> True]      However, if the normalization of the two directions is different, I get a funny behavior. Basically, the radii are multiplied by the normalization of the first direction vector. Use for example:               Graphics[Ellipsoid[{0, 0}, {1, 1}, {{0, 100}, {1, 0}}], Axes -> True]      Does anyone know what is going on?
