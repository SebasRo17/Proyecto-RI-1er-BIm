I have an equation that I evaluate at some point (let's say $x=1$) that have terms of the form               f[1,y] D[g[1,y],{y,2}]      Is there an easy way to replace [1,y] by [x,y] with a simple replacement rule? The thing is that               g[1,y] /. g[1,y] -> g[x,y]      will indeed replace g, but it won't work for any of its derivatives, and there are far too many functions and derivatives for me to make a replacement rule for all of them. Would there be a clever way to do this? So far, my only solution has been copy-pasting my equations in Word and using the text replacement tool in there. It would be neat not having to go outside of Mathematica to do this though.
