A lot of sources (e.g. Wikipedia) mentiones System requirement specification and Functional specification as two separate entities. However, Wiegers in his book writes: > The software requirements specification is sometimes called a functional > specification, a product specification... This is very confusing for me as I thought FS describes just functions while SRS whole system. From this point of view, FS would contain both non functional and functional requirements and everything else.
