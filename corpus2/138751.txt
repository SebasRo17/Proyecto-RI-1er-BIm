So the client I am working for right now is really big on load time speed, so we try to shave every micro second possible. We found a file the other day that was pulling some word press blogs and it was adding a solid second to the load time. Now I didn't write that particular script and perhaps I can go optimize it later, but for now, what I did was make a script that writes the output of the wp script to another file, then I simply reference that file when we need it. We run a cron on the script I wrote so it checks the wp script every so often and outputs any updates if needed. That obviously really made things faster but I just have never done it before so I am curious about it:   * obviously we have a file with 777 permissions, what are my security concerns for this?   * Is this a good strategy to cut down in the future when the processing doesn't have to be done at the time of load?
