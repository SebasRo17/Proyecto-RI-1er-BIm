I've been a full stack .net developer for several years now using C#/MVC4/SQL Server and have never taken on a freelance project. This is because up until now I have worked only as a full-time consultant by hour or on start-ups for equity. Also, I have only worked on very large complex projects that needed to be built for scale and thus had many layers. I'm now faced with a potential client who wants a website that is fairly easy:   1. Existing client-side   2. Build new database of products   3. Create a few pages to existing client-side    4. Add search/filtering functionality to search products in the database My usual development routine for building complex, scalable applications is very much overkill for the task so I'd like to use a CMS for the first time. Being that I'm a .NET developer, Orchard CMS looks great and I'd like to jump right in. I'm trying to come up with an estimate on the work but I'm not familiar with how freelance projects work in regards to source code. After I set everything up do I expose the WebMatrix project to the client so they can begin using the CMS as the administrator, adding content through the dashboard, etc themselves or do I only publish the end product and they have to come back to me for me to add functionality through the CMS dashboard? Obviously the agreement can be either way, but do programmers generally charge more for actually exposing the project and dashboard to the client or is this generally by default for CMS projects? As a side question, should I feel obligated to even disclose the use of a CMS behind the scenes (Assuming that I actually charge for the true time taken to set up the CMS)?
