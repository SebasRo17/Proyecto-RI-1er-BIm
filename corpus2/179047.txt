I notice two types of design used in web applications, some with a particular subdomain for users contents, and some with same URL structure for all the accounts. Ex: `unique.domain.com` and `another_unique.domain.com` for subdomains for sites like blogspot, wordpress, basecamp etc. while in the other approach `domain.com/action1` and `domain.com/action2` the content is shown according to the user logged in, but the URL is same for every user. What are main differences between both of these kind of design?
