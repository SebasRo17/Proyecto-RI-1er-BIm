I've recently done some Java programming for an android app (though my question is not android specific), and was wondering if what I was doing was just a lot less complicated, but generally the same as what a professional mobile app designer would do. I kind of asssumed that an app designer working for, say, the BBC would use an expensive software package, and maybe a different language. So my question is **what language would they be using?** Maybe they would use one that would work for both Android and iOS?
