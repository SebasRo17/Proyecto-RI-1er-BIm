I have been put in charge of managing and leading a team of programmers based in India. I have a feeling there are some cultural issues to overcome, aside from the obvious English 2nd language ones. For example, from my past experience working with Indians, I sense a certain reluctance to ask questions or advice, even when requirements are not clear. More than once I have seen Indian developers say they understand the requirements when they really don't, then just make their own unilateral assumptions about how things should be, and plough ahead on that basis without consulting with anybody else, so that we only realize a week or two down the line that they've been developing something completely other than what we wanted. Is that a general cultural thing, or did I just see a bad sample? Have you managed or worked with Indian teams? What other advice could you offer as to how best to manage and otherwise relate to them?
