When people mention COBOL, it's usually either met with a snort or groan. I don't know much about COBOL, but I've seen some programs written in it. I can see that it's wordy, and to uninitiated eyes such as mine, unintelligible. But, really, aren't all programming languages complete gibberish to a lay person? I understand that it works, works well, and is still in widespread use in the industries it was designed for. Aren't those the hallmarks of a good language? What's so bad about COBOL?
