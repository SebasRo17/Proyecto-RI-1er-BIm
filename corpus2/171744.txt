I am trying to get some advice on what order I should learn about SQL Server, LINQ, and Entity Framework to be able to better work with ASP.NET Webforms and MVC. From what I've been able to learn so far, many recommend learning LINQ or Entity Framework before learning SQL Server. It also appears that many companies are looking for people with knowledge in LINQ-to-SQL and Entity Framework without mentioning SQL Server. However, my understanding is that LINQ-to-SQL and Entity Framework translate code into SQL Server queries, making this a poor approach. Is there a correct or best order in which to learn these technologies?
