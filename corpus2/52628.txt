I'm currently design an application that involves a lot of calculation. Now I have generally two possibilities which I have both tested: 1) During startup of the application I calculated only the most important values and these values that consume a lot of time. So the user has to wait approximately 15 seconds during startup. But on the other hand a lot of user interactions require recalculation so that the user often has to wait 2-3 seconds after clicking somewhere until the application has calculated and loaded all values 2) I load everything during startup. This takes from 90 to 120 seconds... This is quite a long time, but the big advantage is that all the user interactions are executed immediately. So what would you generally consider the better approach? Loading all time- consuming operations during startup or when needed?
