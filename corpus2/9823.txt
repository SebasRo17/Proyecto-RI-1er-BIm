I'm trying to calculate pH values of solutions containing water and acetic acid. The relevant equations have been defined and I now want to find a solution using Mathematica. For a specific acid concentration (0.0001) I can do the following.               Solve[(concentrations && equilibrium && requirements) /. {c2 -> 0.0001}]      But I would prefer to solve the system of equations once and then insert the acid concentration. But the following code does not work               Solve[(concentrations && equilibrium && requirements)] /. {c2 -> 0.0001}      Which throws the following error               Solve::ratnz: Solve was unable to solve the system with inexact      coefficients. The answer was obtained by solving a corresponding      exact system and numericizing the result. >>"      My working code so far is shown here               concentrations = cHp == c1 + c3 && cOHm == c1 && cCH3COOm == c3 && cCH3COOH == c2 - c3;     equilibrium = 10^-14 == cHp cOHm && 1.1614 10^-5 == cCH3COOm cHp/cCH3COOH;     requirements = cHp > 0 && cOHm > 0 && cCH3COOH > 0 && cCH3COOm > 0;     Plot[-Log[10, cHp] /.        Solve[(concentrations && equilibrium && requirements) /. {c2 ->            x}], {x, 0, 0.00010}, PlotRange -> {2, 9}]
