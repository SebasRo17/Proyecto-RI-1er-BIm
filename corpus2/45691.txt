![Test](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Z8psG.png) I'm trying to make a function to simulate a finite bar and get the electric field, i did it by put 22 funnels together but is too slow and is not very accurate; does anyone have any function to replace this thing? PD: this function is:               Total[Table[1/Sqrt[x^2 + (y + i)^2], {i, -5, 5, 0.5}]]      Final Result: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/svVTh.jpg) Thanks!
