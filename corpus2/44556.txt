I am multiplying three matrices that should give me a diagonal matrix but instead of zeros for the other entries I get very small numbers. Can someone explain what is going on here and how I can fix it? This is what what I've been doing:               P = {{.7, .15, .15}, {.2, .8, .15}, {.1, .05, .7}}     (* {{0.7, 0.15, 0.15}, {0.2, 0.8, 0.15}, {0.1, 0.05, 0.7}} *)          S = {{7, 0, -2}, {10, -1, 1}, {4, 1, 1}}     (* {{7, 0, -2}, {10, -1, 1}, {4, 1, 1}} *)          Inverse[S].P.S     (* {{1., -1.38778*10^-17, 0.}, {-6.66134*10^-16,        0.65, -5.55112*10^-17}, {1.66533*10^-16, -1.38778*10^-17, 0.55}} *)
