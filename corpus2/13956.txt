![overview](http://i.imgur.com/GMOm4.png) This is a follow up to the OCR question I had earlier. What I want to do is to use Thinning to create "skeletons" of images of characters and then compare their shapes, utilizing such properties as the slopes/lengths of the edges. The problem is however that I have not been able so far to access the graph Thinning produces. MorphologicalGraph is what I have found in the documentation but this removes a lot of information. And for comparing graphs so far I only have found IsomorphicGraphQ which doesn't seem to offer much customization (tolerances for matching). The code below demonstrates the problem I have with my current approach. Because MorphologicalGraph reduces the Thinned images to a very similar shape for all these characters, the code will deem a "C" character similar to "I" and "S":               Graphize[u_] := MorphologicalGraph@Thinning@ColorNegate[Import[u]]     whichQ = Graphize["http://i.imgur.com/2Fxyh.gif"] (* C *)     i = Graphize["http://i.imgur.com/SPp7R.gif"]  (* I *)     c = Graphize["http://i.imgur.com/SeXA7.gif"]  (* C *)     s = Graphize["http://i.imgur.com/aguQ6.gif"]  (* S *)     IsomorphicGraphQ[whichQ, i] (* -> True *)     IsomorphicGraphQ[whichQ, c] (* -> True *)     IsomorphicGraphQ[whichQ, s] (* -> True *)
