I like "red/green/refactor" for RoR, etc. just fine. My day job involves batch processing very large files from third-parties in python and other custom tools. Churn on the attributes of these files is high, so there are a lot of fixes/enhancements applied pretty frequently. Regression testing via a known body of test data with expected results does not exist. Closest thing is running against the last batch with new test cases hand coded in, make sure it does not blow up, then apply spot-checking and statistical tests to see if data still looks OK. Q>> How to bring TDD principles into this kind of environment?
