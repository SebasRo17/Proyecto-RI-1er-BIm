Wikipedia says that Agile is a type of "RAD" which I guess is incorrect. From what I know, Agile was developed becasue RAD itself was not that sucessfull in 90'S (too rigid for changes). Or am I wrong? A reference from a book Radical Project Management (Thomsett) > "..new development fad such as RAD, Agile, Object oriented..." CISA Certified Information System auditor: > ..aware of **two alternative** software dev. methods: Agile and Rapid > Application Development Agile management for Software: > Agile methods are mostly derived from lightweight approach of RAD. Software estimation best practices: > The major methods of sw. dev. can be summarized as follows:   >  1\. Waterfall ..   >  4\. RAD   >  5\. Agile The point of this question is:   **Is Agile type of RAD or standalone development approach?**
