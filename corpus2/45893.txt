I need to solve this equation.               v'[t] + v[t] == 1/(1 + Exp[-v[t]])      I tried to solve it using RungeKutta method described in Wolfram tutorial(http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/tutorial/NDSolvePlugIns.html#51030643) But, I get some errors. I was wondering if anyone can help me to correct the error. I am still trying to figure it out. Appreciate any help. Thanks.                CRK4[]["Step"[rhs_, h_, t_, x_, xp_]] := Module[{k0, k1, k2, k3},       k0 = h xp;       k1 = h rhs[t + h/2, x + k0/2];       k2 = h rhs[t + h/2, x + k1/2];       k3 = h rhs[t + h, x + k2];       (k0 + 2 k1 + 2 k2 + k3)/6]     CRK4[___]["StepInput"] = {"F"["T", "X"], "H", "T", "X", "XP"};     CRK4[___]["StepOutput"] = "XI";          CRK4[___]["DifferenceOrder"] := 4          CRK4[___]["StepMode"] := Fixed     a = NDSolve[{v'[t] + v[t] == 1/(1 + Exp[-v[t]]), v[0] == 1},        v, {t, 0, 100}, Method -> CRK4]      But, It gives an error. I actually want to plot a graph of V vs t.
