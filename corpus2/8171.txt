Is it possible to make a plotted curve interactive in the sense that when hovering over it a line is drawn from the "hovered" point to one (or both) of the axes. I did do my homework, I just can't figure it out. Edit: Let's say I plot this curve:               Manipulate[Plot[Sin[a x],{x,0,Pi}],{a,1,5}]      Whenever the mouse hovers over a point on the curve a line is drawn from that point to the x-axis.
