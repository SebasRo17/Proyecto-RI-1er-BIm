I have the function               a = 1 - 3 Sin[theta]^2 Cos[phi]^2;      which I solve for 'phi' when $a=0$               sol = Reduce[a == 0, phi]      which gives me the result ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/x1Om6.png) How do I turn this output into a nice list of results for desired values of C[1], much like Solve[ ] would give me, so that I can use Plot[ ] and visualise the functions?
