By default, the _Mathematica_ documentation opens with the "Details" section collapsed. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/E4KRI.png) This is _never_ what I'm looking for â€” in fact, I've lost count of the times I've sought help on a feature and not found it anywhere on the feature's documentation page (at least not until I remember this shortcoming). Is there a way to configure _Mathematica_ doe that the "Details" section of the documentation opens is expanded by default?
