I have a list which is something like this:               {3,4,5,6,7,10,11,12,15,16,17,19,20,21,22,23,24,42,43,44,45,46}      What I'd like to to is get the intervals which are in a "continuous" sequence, something like:               {{3,7},{10,12},{15,17},{19,24},{42,46}}      and get the extremes. Note that the original data (of which this is a small excerpt) shows no sign of regularity or repetition. Numbers start from 1 and get up to 200 (these numbers come from applying Position[] to an array). Any pointers/ideas?
