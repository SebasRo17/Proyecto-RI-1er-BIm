How can you determine objectively, over time, that you are getting any better at producing code? For example, I may sit here and feel that "I know `<language>` now, and I use `<technique>` now, so I must be better." But this does not account for my own bias, or the fact that I may be getting better at a slower rate than intended, or I may actually suck at `<technique>` and not realize it. What methods are available for one to **objectively** rate one's own abilities? What about to objectively compare them to their peer groups?
