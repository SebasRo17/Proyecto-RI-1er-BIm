I am a graduate student in aerospace engineering. A lot of my Master's thesis has been on developing an OOP software architecture in MATLAB to facilitate control of Arduino-based vehicles (blimps, cars, quadrotors, etc). All my code is heavily documented, but my thesis itself needs to be more than a reference of every class and method - it needs to describe at a high level how each piece works together, and _why_ my architecture is the way it is. I only have a minor in computer engineering and I consider myself a pretty competent programmer, but I have no experience writing this kind of document. What kinds of things need to be included in the document? (Diagrams, paragraph explanations of how each class operates, etc)? I don't want to just rehash my code comments (although at the start of each file there's paragraphs of comments about how that class relates to other classes). I also wonder if it's necessary to get rather technical (I implement some fairly advanced MATLAB concepts [that is, advanced for non-computer engineers] such as listeners and callbacks); my audience also hails from an aerospace engineering background. Examples would be appreciated if they exist. **EDIT** : The part my audience really cares about is not the software architecture (the stuff this question entails); this document is really for people who will use my work in the future - who are **not** computer engineers! So I guess the main question is, what needs to be in the document such that people who are not up to speed on the project (and we can assume competent with the language) can understand the architecture, maintain and use the software?
