I am solving a system of 15 simultaneous linear equations using `Solve`. On running the code, I get a message saying "A very large output was generated" with options for viewing the ouput. I want to use the solution inside a larger program where the next step relies on the ouput of `Solve`. I am stuck unless there is a reasonable way for me to capture the output from `Solve`. Is there a way to do this?
