Currently at work I'm helping put together and create eLearning courses within Flash. Our senior programmers have knowledge of how to do this, Although - I would like to know how you could go from converting a eLearning course from Flash into a application for Mac and PC, looking similar to Garageband's music lessons?   * What programming language was used to create Garageband on Mac?     * What is the best way to create a application that will work on PC, Mac, iPhone, iPad, Touch etc, Rather then using flash and Actionscript to create online based applications, that will only work in a browser on Mac and PC?   * Any further tips? Thanks Josh
