This is a problem I come across pretty often. Basically we are using an application to make art content. Often times this requires writing custom tools for it. Sometimes you run into parts of the application where doing something is not directly supported in the UI, which means it will either be a little more involved or communicating this to the software company that makes this software so they can address it in the future. But I see some of the more experienced people suggesting to use methods that are extremely inefficient. For example let's say you want to access the value of the last item in a 10M item array. Let's say it's not directly doable. So you could write some code that would be inconvenient in this case because you just want it directly doable in the app. But instead of this, they suggest you to let's say create a spare property for each item in the array, that will basically store the same thing, and then by using a built-in tool which will go through each element and set the value of ALL these new properties to the last item read. So it will be like:               for i=0 to array.Length:         new_property[0..array.Length - 1] = array[i];      So this will indeed give you the last item when the operation is done, but it will be extremely slow. How can you communicate this to the people suggesting these methods? Because they think it's quite reasonable and since they have more experience and this is mainly an art application, it shouldn't involve more work for us/them.
