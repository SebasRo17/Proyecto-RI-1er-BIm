I want to plot the real part of the `SphericalHarmonicY[1,1,θ,φ]`. That is, I want to plot $$ - \frac{1}{2}\sqrt {\frac{3}{{2\pi }}} \cos[\phi ]\sin[\theta ]$$ To do so, I evaluated the following expression:               SphericalPlot3D[-(1/2) Sqrt[3/(2 π)] Cos[φ] Sin[θ], {θ, 0, π}, {φ, 0, 2 π}]      But the result I got doesn't show the negtive part. What is wrong? ![spherical](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XF1eS.gif)
