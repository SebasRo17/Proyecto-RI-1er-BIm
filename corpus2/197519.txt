If I download a module for Python (such as alglib) and installing is simply a matter of running               python setup.py install      Where should I be keeping the files I download, or the files that get created after I run setup.py? Is there some neat folder in the python directory that people put these modules before running setup.py? Can I move the files around after running it? Can I delete them... or will that stop them working? I couldn't find any recommendation here: http://docs.python.org/2/install/ Also I am running windows and installed python through python(x,y)
