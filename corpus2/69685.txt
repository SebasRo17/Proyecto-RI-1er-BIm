Some projects only allow committers to submit patches because they wish to keep their IP "clean." not only can non-committers not submit patches, but committers are forbidden from looking at your code lest they become tainted by intellectual property of unknown provenance. instead, you are invited to start a discussion on their listserv or submit a ticket, and then the committers will decide if your feature is worthy.
