I am just starting a new position and using **svn** rather than **git** (my favorite). With **svn** if there are any conflicts will I see them after an svn update or after an (attempt) to svn commit? In other words will an **svn update** merge remote changes into my current (uncommited) working copy? I want to be sure not to mess up before my first **svn commit** if things are not good as I am new to this system! :) Obviously I have also made a manual copy of my new code in case I run into any issues :) fyi, I am on Ubuntu 11.10
