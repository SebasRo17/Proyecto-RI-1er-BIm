I am wanting to re-write my login scripts for clients websites to make them more secure. I want to know what best practices I can implement into this. Password protected control panels are in their abundance, but very few seem to impliment best practices in terms of code writing, speed and security. I will be using PHP and a MYSQL database. I used to use md5, but I see that sha256 or sha512 would be better (together with secure hash and salt). Some login scripts log the ip address throughout the session or even the user agent, but I want to avoid that as it isn't compatible with proxy servers. I am also a little behind the best practice in using sessions in PHP 5 (last time I read up was PHP 4) so some best practices with this would be helpful. Thanks.
