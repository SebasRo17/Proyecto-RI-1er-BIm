I am interested in making a vehicular network simulator (vehicular network as in vehicles can be equipped with radios and when they come in range they can talk with each other). I want to be able to scale to 1000s of nodes if not more. I am quite frankly torn on how to do, or even which language to use or whether I should instead be using some other piece of software/code. I know that this should depend on a lot of design decisions that I may have, but it would be great if somebody can point me towards the right direction. I was planning to use a multi-threaded architecture, but not sure whether it will add to the complication or make it easier. Also if I go for a multi- threaded architecture, do you think that the Go language will be a good choice? I have a few years of experience in Java, but haven't done any big project, and essentially no experience in Go.
