I have a model which sources its data from a MySQL database using a `load()` public method. If I have a collection of models, I have to loop through each model and call its `load()` method individually; meaning multiple queries are executed which is slow and inefficient. Should I have something like a `populate()` method on my model that is called from a controller (MVC) and fills the model with data so that the MySQL queries are as few and efficient as possible? Or is there a better way to do this? I'm worried that if I load model data from outside the model, I'm leaving proper encapsulation behind, and bloating my code with nearly-the- same-but-not-quite copypasta.
