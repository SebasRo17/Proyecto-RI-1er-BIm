I am unhappy with the following mapping:               ParametricPlot[{Re@Sin[u + I v], Im@Sin[u + I v]},      {u, -Pi/2, Pi/2}, {v, -Pi/2, Pi/2},      ColorFunction -> (ColorData["DarkRainbow"][#3] &),      ImagePadding -> 20,      ImageSize -> 400,      PlotPoints -> 30]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/VwoCa.jpg) because of the distinct coloring of its left and right part. I found a certain fix with this:               ParametricPlot[{Re@Sin[u + I v], Im@Sin[u + I v]},      {u, -Pi/2, Pi/2}, {v, -Pi/2, Pi/2},      ColorFunction -> (Blend[{Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, LightBlue, Blue,            Yellow, Green, Red}, #3] &),      ImagePadding -> 20,      ImageSize -> 400,      PlotPoints -> 30]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/iY1J8.jpg) But I really would prefer to use one of the inbuilt gradients to color my figure according to its polygon size or "mesh density". Thanks in advance for your suggestions.
