I'm considering the reengineering of my web development ecosystem. We use Git very successfully to deploy new changes to our Production, Staging, and Development servers. Traditionally, I've always had a copy of Apache on my local machine - in the interest of keeping my local machine as lean as possible, I'm considering running Apache in a non-local VM and syncing changes somehow. My initial thought was to run something like `rsync` and `cron` (Mac development system) to monitor the directory for file changes and then sync them up. I have been tempted to use a separate branch in Git and writing a hook to have the Apache server pull in the changes, but versioning all of my changes may be unproductive, particularly on very experimental additions. My question is, is there something I'm not considering in this workflow? This particular project requires ColdFusion, so am I going to realize significant benefits over not having Apache/CFIDE locally?
