How do you organize your software assets (source code and resources), your "active" and "past" projects, and your Software Department processes/work- instructions (including source code conventions, rules, and reviews process)? For example, one approach would be to use "Trac" with databases for "Software Assets" and "Software Process". Another would be to have databases for "Project A", "Project B", and "Software Process". Is your source code "by-project", or "by-all-in-department", or "by-product"?
