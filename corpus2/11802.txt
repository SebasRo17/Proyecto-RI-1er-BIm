I'm planning on using Vincent Driessen's branching model which I found great for my current development. I think Vincent approach is very general to any development project but I'm finding it difficult to handle the following scenario. I'm working on an application that will be branded to several customers, so each one of my bundles is a different branch that I `rebase` from `develop` branch each time a new build is going to be released. Each brand has its assets (images and text) and they do not conflict with changes in `develop` branch because in that branch I never touch the assets. My question is, now that I'm planning on using it, how can I handle different versions based on the same code base but with different assets?
