I am very new to _Mathematica_ and have a question regarding plotting a ODE boundary value problem. Let say I have an ODE               alpha = 1/2;     beta = -5;     eq = beta*f'''[x] + alpha*f[x]*f'[x] == 0     bc = {f[0] == 0, f'[0] == 0, f'[10] == 1};      NDSolve[{eq, bc}, f[x], {x, 0, 10}]      I want to plot `alpha*f''[0] + (f''[0])^3` vs `beta`. In the plot, `beta` should take the range [-5, 5]. `NDSolve` should use shooting method for the numerical solution. Also, how I can extract data from that plot as a .txt file.
