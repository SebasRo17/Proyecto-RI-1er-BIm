I have been programming almost exclusively in C/C++ for the almost 3 years now (not including college) and feel stagnated (not to mention working on proprietary code for the most part). So I decided to change my career path and jump into web devlopment by learning Rails. The problem is not the learning but getting a Rails/web dev job. Since I don't have any real work experience in RoR, the one way to get noticed is through side projects. There's a lot of basic advice about building up a resum√© in a new technology: creating a project on GitHub, for example. But being new to the whole web development world I don't know what constitutes as a good project that shows that I am good programmer and not just an eager enthusiast: things like my testing methodology, coding standards, design patterns, programming practices, and so on. How do I come up with a project that'll demonstrate these things?
