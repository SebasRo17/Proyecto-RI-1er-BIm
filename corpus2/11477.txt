Suppose you run into a bewildering Mathematica result (which happens to me several times per Mathematica session, even after a 20-year acquaintance), such as, for example:               MatchQ[42, _?Function[x, True]]     False      So you go pore over the docs, but you still can't figure out an explanation. Then what? > What tool can one use to figure out why Mathematica's evaluation is > different from what one expects? PS. By sheer luck, I had read something a few days earlier that helped me figure out the answer to the one above, but I would have never guessed it without that prior hint. Yes, after knowing the answer I can zero in the place in the docs where the mystery is solved, but _only then_. This is why the documentation does not go as far in such situations as one would think: if one knew where in the documentation to look, one wouldn't have been puzzled by the original result in the first place. Here's a different hint: when completely nonplussed, what could be more fitting than to interrogate the documentation for ?
