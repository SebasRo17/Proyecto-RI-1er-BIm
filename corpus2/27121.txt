What's the difference between               projection= Table[Conjugate[autoVett[[k]].someVector1], {k, 1, r}]     Dimensions[projection]      that gave me as results `{12}` which is ok.               Dimensions[baseComp]     {8}     Dimensions[Transpose[{baseVector}]]     {12,1}     startState =        KroneckerProduct[baseComp, Transpose[{baseVector}]] ;     Dimensions[startState]     {96,1}     scompoStartState =        Table[Conjugate[CCNOTHvec[[k]].startState], {k, 1,          Length[CCNOTHvec]}];     Dimensions[scompoStartState]     {96,1}      What's the difference between a `{12}` vector and a `{96,1}` vector? I need to have just 96-dimensional vector.
