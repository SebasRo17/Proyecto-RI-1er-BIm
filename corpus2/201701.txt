I wonder if object initializing have some performance gain in ASP.NET website. I have an office mate that told me that object initialization is much readable and faster than constructor. But one of my office mate disagree with that and said that it always depends. For example I am doing this:               using (var dataAccess = new DatabaseAccess { ConnectionString = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["test"].ConnectionString, Query = query, IsStoredProc = true })     {         //some code here     }      Is it better if I will do this way?               using (var dataAccess = new DatabaseAccess())     {         dataAccess.ConnectionString = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["test"].ConnectionString;         dataAccess.Query = query;         dataAccess.IsStoredProc = true;     }      Thanks in advance guys! \--- **EDIT** \---- is this somehow much better:               using (         var dataAccess = new DatabaseAccess          {             ConnectionString = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["test"].ConnectionString,             Query = query,             IsStoredProc = true         }     )     {         //some code here     }
