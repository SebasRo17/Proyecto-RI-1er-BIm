I’ve started my career as a Software Tester but after 3 years I realized, it didn’t give me the so called job satisfaction and I made a brave decision to jump into software development arena. Finally I have become an Android Mobile developer and completed 1 year of experience. I love my job and I love every bit of it, but going forward I’m wondering what the scope for mobile developers is?? Developers who work with C# or Java have their larger scope and they can become architect etc in future. But as a mobile developer what can I achieve.. Mobile development architect is not something practical because mobile projects are small and it does not require much technical ability like j2ee project needs. Should I change my career track to Java or j2ee or something from mobile?? Any advice is appreciated.
