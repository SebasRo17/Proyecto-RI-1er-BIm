I am not sure if this question is considered too broad, but I would like to reach out to my fellow programmers to see what alternatives are out there for saving data using jquery. I have a content management system that generates an set of HTML pages called an IETM (Interactive Electronic Technical Manual). The HTML pages are written in HTML and uses jquery. The ITEM is meant to be light weight, portable and run on most modern browsers. I am looking for a way to save data. I have considered cookies and sqlite. Are there any other alternatives for saving data using jquery?
