So I think this might be **me** soon!   Excuse my ignorance in this post, I am not formally educated and young! =S   (Taken from http://theoatmeal.com/comics/design_hell) ![alt text](http://i.stack.imgur.com/r3lVG.png) Im building an inhouse application for a bank and it might not be big but its the largest project I've worked on. ## Issues I can't do much about   1. There is tons of beaurocracy in doing anything, it took 4 months to get them to sign a contract with me.   2. I have to work with Finance managers, who have never worked with someone making software for them.   3. I am not usually taken seriously because I am young. ## My Problems   1. The managers don't give a crap about the Bank and they never bother to read my emails most of the time, or give me any input on mockups or demos. I spent 20 hours over 2 days on the last mockup and they would rather crap on the phone than attend the meeting!   2. New features keep coming and going like hot cakes and they just cannot decide which ones are important. Or they don't care to discuss it! And the top dogs keeps reminding me of the dealines!? ## My question So Im going straight to the top dogs to politely try to change things. These guys however are older and won't give me much time, **I need a very convincing, quick, succinct way to explain to them how important it is that their "managers" communicate with me and tell me what the heck they want and what they don't**   Any funny presentations or pictures like oatmeal would be really awesome to show the top dogs. ## Other Solutions I was thinking of   1. Signing up for teambox.com (as opposed to email!)   2. If in 3 days I dont get a response on a feature it is NO MORE!   3. I display features on a board and they get 5 secs to tell me if its important or not. Any more policies I should adopt? Any other ideas? Thanks so much, Gideon **EDIT** * * * In response to the first comment: The departmental heads (top dogs) are the people really looking forward to shiny software that will solve all their problems. They are more or less the stakeholders but I don't interact with them much, I only interact with their subordinates(the managers).
