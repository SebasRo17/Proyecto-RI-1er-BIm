Imagine I provide some random input to function like `FindInstance[]`, and I observe that, despite the existence of good solutions, the function will, with some probability, indefinitely evaluate without success. For an example, please see my earlier question: Why is FindInstance failing when I relax a set of constraints? Can I somehow force the function to return, say, an empty list {} after some time $T$ has passed?
