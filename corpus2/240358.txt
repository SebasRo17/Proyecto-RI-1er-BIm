Yesterday I read a tweet disparaging Jersey with JAX-RS due to run-time errors. Spray.io was mentioned in the tweet: > Not even 5 minutes using Jersey / JAX-RS and already a runtime error due to > a missing annotation. That's why I like @sprayio: type safety. https://twitter.com/gbelrose/status/467295643053338626 How does `spray.io` provide type safety? Could you please give an example?
