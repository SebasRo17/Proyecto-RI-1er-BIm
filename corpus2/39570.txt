I'm working with economic data and realized that I could extract it directly from _WolframAlpha_ using _Mathematica. So I did it. I extracted the GDP data of the country I'm studying.               nominal =        WolframAlpha[        "nominal gdp of brazil", {{"History:GDP:WorldDevelopmentData", 1},          "TimeSeriesData"},         PodStates -> {"History:GDP:WorldDevelopmentData__Linear scale"}];      So until now I'm ok. The trouble begins when I try to plot it using `DateListPlot[nominal]` because I just get an empty frame? I noticed that the GDP comes in US dollars and maybe some additional parameters are needed. I looked for it in the doc but couldn't find the solution. Thank's for the help. Here goes a sample of what I got > >     {{{1960, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0.}, Quantity[1.51656*10^10, > ("USDollars")/("Years")]}, >        {{1961, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0.}, Quantity[1.52369*10^10, > ("USDollars")/("Years")]}, >        {{1962, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0.}, Quantity[1.99263*10^10, > ("USDollars")/("Years")]}, >        {{1963, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0.}, Quantity[2.30215*10^10, > ("USDollars")/("Years")]}, >        {{1964, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0.}, Quantity[2.12119*10^10, > ("USDollars")/("Years")]}, >        {{1965, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0.}, Quantity[2.179*10^10, > ("USDollars")/("Years")]}, >        {{1966, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0.}, Quantity[2.70627*10^10, > ("USDollars")/("Years")]}, >        {{1967, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0.}, Quantity[3.05918*10^10, > ("USDollars")/("Years")]}, >        {{1968, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0.}, Quantity[3.38759*10^10, > ("USDollars")/("Years")]}, >        {{1969, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0.}, Quantity[3.74589*10^10, > ("USDollars")/("Years")]}......... >
