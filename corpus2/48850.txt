I have a list of city names (of arbitrary length), f.e.               c = {"BAL", "NYC", "LAS", "AUS"};      and the distances between them :               d = {232, 318, 467, 285, 670, 530};      With               m = (Flatten /@ Transpose[{c, DiagonalMatrix@Table["x", {Length@c}]}])~Prepend~({""}~Join~c)      I get: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nszrd.jpg) Now, misusing `Mathematica` as a typewriter:               m[[2, 3]] = d[[1]];     m[[2, 4]] = d[[2]];     m[[2, 5]] = d[[3]];     m[[3, 2]] = d[[1]];     m[[3, 4]] = d[[5]];     m[[3, 5]] = d[[6]];     m[[4, 2]] = d[[2]];     (* etc. *)      I get: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1GDy7.jpg) 1st question: How can I automate this? 2nd question: How can I get a graph of these distances? Thank you in advance for any help
