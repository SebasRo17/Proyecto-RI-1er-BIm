For someone who has not worked anywhere in Java Technology except learning just the core concepts in his Masters (MCA) and Graduation (BCA, bachelor degree course):   1. Is it possible to get job anywhere in Java technology? Considering he/she has not studied it in regular college and not First Class throughout except BCA, MCA (in case of Indian or international companies).   2. How will he/she get his/her dream job (in the Java field) and what are the prospects for his/her career life?   3. If the knowledge he received in his grad/univ is not enough, than what more should he do to make this his specialty before getting started for the search job or to increase job offers? All kinds of suggestions are welcome. And thanks very much for kind suggestions.
