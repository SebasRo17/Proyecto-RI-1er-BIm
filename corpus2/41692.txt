I need to take the `KroneckerProduct` of the an $n \times n$ identity matrix and a $1 \times n$ row vector (let's call it $T$), both of which are numerical. As in: $S=I \otimes T$ (where $\otimes$ denotes the Kronecker product) More specifically I have:               k = 3;          chebT[0] = 1;      chebT[1] = 2*t - 1;          chebT[n_] := chebT[n] = Expand[2*(2*t - 1)*chebT[n - 1] - chebT[n - 2]];     Tstar = Table[chebT[n], {n, 0, k}]          i = IdentityMatrix[k + 1] // MatrixForm     S = KroneckerProduct[i, Transpose[Tstar]] // MatrixForm      but this gives the message: > Transpose::nmtx: The first two levels of the one-dimensional list {1,-1+2 > t,1-8 t+8 t^2,-1+18 t-48 t^2+32 t^3} cannot be transposed. >> I can use loops to manually calculate the Kronecker product, but I would rather not. What am I doing wrong? Do I need to use `Array` instead of `Table`? Edited to include the whole (and correct) code.
