From my understanding about Linear Interpolation especially of that of Newton's Divided Difference Polynomial, we could get the value of `F(x)` from the given set of coordinates. But would it be possible of the if `x` values itself is an expression, like `0.25X` and having a constant value of `0.5`. I don't know if I get the correct understanding of the NDDP: Linear Interpolation correctly given the scenario. Given the set of coordinates. How would I find the value for `X = 0.4x` where `x = is integer constant to the plane`               X     Y     0     0.25     0.25x 0.5     0.5x  1     0.75x 2     x     4
