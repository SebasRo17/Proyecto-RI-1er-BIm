I'm thinking of working with some other people on a c++ or java project. Usually for small projects, we collaborate mostly through emailing source code files back and forth, but on a larger scale, it becomes too easy for things to go wrong. I read up on version control systems such as git and it seems to fit my needs of collaboration, but the problem is that tutorials show these tools being used through the command line, which could probably become tedious very quickly. I could use the git integration included in most IDEs, but I don't know what to do in the case of working in different IDEs or more importantly on different OS's. How do most teams handle problems like this? What tools do they use? And how do they handle linked libraries? Any advice would be extremely helpful!
