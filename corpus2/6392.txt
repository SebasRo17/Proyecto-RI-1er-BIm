I am currently trying to write a script that takes a curve $C$, a starting point $p$ and a direction vector $\vec{v}$ and calculates the path of a beam starting at $p$ in direction $\vec{v}$ when it is reflected on $C$. The idea is basically: (Numerically) find the (first) crossing point of beam and $C$, calculate tangent in that point, calculate new beam direction, repeat. Now, if my curve is point-wise not differentiable (in my case: $C$ has "kinks"), I would like to treat it as a limit case where both smooth curves around the kinks are considered, so the calculation forks and I get 2 possible beam pathes. For this, I need the left and the right side derivative of this point. How do I get those in Mathematica? Also, if somebody knows a better way or this has already been written and is public, I appreciate any clues, of course.
