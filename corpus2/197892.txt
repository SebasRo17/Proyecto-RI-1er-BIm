I want to see all user-made definitions in a Scheme REPL, both loaded from files and entered at the REPL. Is there any way to "dump all definitions"? E.g. if there is:                   (define (plusone x) (+ 1 x))         (define (plustwo x) (+ 2 x))         (define (plusthree x) (+ 3 x))      then I want to see all of these definitions, but only those defined by the "user" - something like ",showmealldefs" or thelike. Can this be done, and if there is no general way, can this be done in Gambit-C? (I tried (apropos ""), and this is not what I mean.)
