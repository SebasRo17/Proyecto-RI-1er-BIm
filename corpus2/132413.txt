I'm working on a CMS that will be used by others and I'm trying to figure out what the main body of the site page should be called. Originally, I was going to call it "content" - but perhaps "body" or "page" would be better.               <html>     <body>         ....         print $content;         ....     </body>     </html>      This isn't just a question about markup class/id names. It's also about what the name means to people when they first hear it. I want people to know that ____ is the main area of the page.
