On my web page, if I wish to display dynamic dropdowns (e.g city names based on country selected), I can do it using AJAX. But I can also do it using a REST call. So which should I use? My problem is I really don't get the difference between REST and any other HTTP browser request.(a.k.a a form submit). I have looked at the formal definitions of REST and it seems identical to a HTTP request. So how is REST inherently different from AJAX?
