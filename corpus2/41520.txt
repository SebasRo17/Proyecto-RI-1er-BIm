I use _Mathematica_ 9 on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS x86 (64-bit). My computer has an Nvidia graphics card, for which I installed `primus` and `bumblebee`. If anyone is in a similar situation, I would like to know if they have solutions to the following two related problems:   1. _Mathematica_ does not need OpenGL when it's not rendering any 3D graphics. For this reason I find it convenient to run the program without `optirun mathematica` or `primusrun mathematica` most of the time. However, I noticed that if I do make a `Plot3D` or related command, _Mathematica_ will crash. Is it possible to set the program up in a way so that it doesn't crash, but rather shows an error message, or just doesn't show output, if no 3D rendering is possible?   2. `primusrun` extends `optirun` functionality by saving power when the graphics card is not in use. I suppose that for this reason, if I'm not actively rotating a 3D graphic, it goes blank in a session of `primusrun mathematica` rather than `optirun mathematica`. When using the less efficient `optirun`, all functionality is available and runs as expected. Did anyone figure out a workaround for this? I'm asking on this site rather than AskUbuntu because the solution, if it exists, probably lies in changing _Mathematica_ preferences rather than `primus`'.
