I have some logical relationships that I ultimately want to pass to `NMaximize` as constraints: `{x => a, y => a, a => x || y}` `NMaximize` is picky about its input format though, so I'm feeding the expression into `BooleanMinimize` before, which produces something like: `{!x || a, !y || a, ...}`. `NMaximize` can't handle unary negation, but accepts `x! = 1`. I looked at `BooleanConvert`, but most of the forms still use logical negation. What's the best way to deal with this?
