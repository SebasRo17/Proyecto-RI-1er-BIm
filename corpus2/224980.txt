I know _log rotation_ is a feature seen in application servers like Oracle's Weblogic. I would like to understand:   1. What is actually meant by log rotation?   2. What is it useful?   3. Who performs the task? Is this duty performed by the logging frameworks that the developers use or is it handled by the servers themselves? Would log rotation be available in a server like Weblogic if the application doesn't use any logging framework(not `java.util.logging`) and simply rely on `System.out.println()` and `System.err.println()` etc?
