From the Documentation, > Tick mark lengths are given as a fraction of the distance across the whole > plot. I wish to have identical _tick mark lengths_ for both horizontal and vertical ticks and I wish them to look outside of the plot area. For this I multiply the horizontal tick lengths by `GoldenRatio` that is the default for `Plot`-like functions:               Plot[Cos[x], {x, 0, 10}, Frame -> True, Axes -> False,      FrameTicks -> {{{0, 0, {0, .2 GoldenRatio}}, {Pi,           180, {0, .2 GoldenRatio}}, {2 Pi,           360, {0, .2 GoldenRatio}}, {3 Pi,           540, {0, .2 GoldenRatio}}}, {{0, 0, {0, .2}}}}]      ![plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/N6pL3.png) As you see, the horizontal `TickLabels` are positioned correctly but at the bottom and at the top the real length of ticks are ignored and `TickLabels` are positioned as it is by default (if I remove the `GoldenRatio` multiplication). Is it possible to position `TickLabels` correctly?
