I have an application that has about a dozen reports that provide totals and summaries of data in the database based on date ranges given as parameters. The application is near the end of user testing. The end-users are saying that the numbers in the totals don't match what they expect based on test data they have entered. It seems like the developers and users interpret the data differently. How can I document the reports in a way that the users will be able to see which records are being counted,summed etc to get the totals, without overwhelming them with technical details? So far I have tried to write out the queries used in the reports in pseduo- code, but it seems too technical and I'm worried I'll just get the same 'The report doesn't produce the correct data.'...
