I feel like I am forgetting something obvious, and will remember or be ashamed as soon as an answer turns up. However, I cannot for the life of me get all of the directories in the current working directory. That is, given the following folder structure:               a     -c     b     -c      I would expect               FileNames["*",{"*"},Infinity]      to return               {"a","b","a/c","b/c"}      But instead I get               {"a/c","b/c"}      I tried playing around with `Infinity` in the typical `Level`s in Mathematica (such as {1} vs. 1), but MMA complains about syntax. For the above example, how can I view a complete list of subdirectories. I came up with the following, but it doesn't seem exactly elegant:               RecursiveDirectory[dir_] :=       Module[{allDirs, allDirsCheck = {}, tempDirs},       allDirs = Select[FileNames["*"], DirectoryQ[#] &];       While[allDirs != allDirsCheck,        allDirsCheck = allDirs;        tempDirs = Select[FileNames["*", allDirs], DirectoryQ[#] &];        allDirs = Union[allDirs, tempDirs]        ];       allDirs       ]      This function gives me:               In[30]:= RecursiveDirectory["*"]     Out[30]= {"a", "a\\c", "b", "b\\c"}      As expected. What is a nicer way of doing this?
