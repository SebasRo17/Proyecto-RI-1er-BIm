I have been doing programming for about a couple of years. I am currently in University 2nd year. In most universities here, the problem solving from sites like uva.onlinejudge.org and projecteuler.net are highly valued. Even in some job interviews, a decent number of UVa solutions is considered a good quality. But for some reason, I find these boring. These seem to have more mathematics rather than programming. When the students around me are busy in solving UVa problems, I find myself trying to make a real program with file manipulation etc. When they are trying to calculate the complexity etc of an algorithm in the algorithm course, I try to directly code them rather spend time in boring mathematical analysis. A few days ago, I got selected to be part of an university team for an inter- university programming contest. But I got so bored by the 4-5 preparation and selection mock contests, I decided not to participate and my teachers got a bit displeased with me, one even got a bit furious I guess. So am I going the wrong way? I mean I like solving problems, but not that much. I am more interested in practical problems rather than efficiency-hungry simplicity-eater theoretical problems. Is very advanced skill in theoretical problem solving really needed to become a good programmer? And I mean a good programmer, not a good computer scientist. Thanks.
