I have a system of difference equations in an exponential steady-state balanced growth setting; all variables grow at the same steady-state rate, say, $g$. I use the notations as follows: Variable $X$ at time $t$ is denoted by $X(t)$. As any variable grows at the rate of $g$, $X(t)$ can be expressed as $X(t)=X(0)e^{tg}$, where $X(0)$ is the initial value of $X$. Now, my equations system is this:               X(t)=Y(t-a)     Z(t)=X(t-b)     Y(t)=pZ(t-c)      Variables with time notation are endogenous variables: $X$, $Y$, $Z$. Variables without time notation are exogenous: $a$, $b$, $c$, $p$ and also the initial values of the endogenous variables, $X(0)$, $Y(0)$, $Z(0)$ are exogenous. You can interpret these equations as saying that, as for the first equation, $X$ at any time is equal to $Y$ of $a$ periods ago. I would like to do two things using Mathematica: First, find a solution of the three endogenous variables $X(t)$, $Y(t)$, and $Z(t)$ expressed with exogenous parameters given in the model and with the growth rate $g$. Second, plugging successively one equation into another yields what can be called 'characteristic equation' of the system. I would like to generate the simplest expression of this characteristic equation. I know it will be consisted of $g$ and the other exogenous parameters. You can verify this by manually solving the model. (In this sense, in this model, $g$ is endogenously determined by the exogenous parameters.) Any help will be greatly appreciated!
