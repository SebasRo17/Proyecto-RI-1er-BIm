I would like to make a small animation : **1-We start with a random distribution of gray points :**               Graphics[{               Black, Rectangle[{-2, -2}, {2, 2}],               Gray,Point /@ RandomReal[{-2, 2}, {4000, 2}]},               PlotRange -> {{-2, 2}, {-2, 2}}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Yol5O.png) **2-Then I would like that those points progressively color themselves to obtain the following** :               Graphics[{               Black, Rectangle[{-2, -2}, {2, 2}],               Pink,Point /@ RandomReal[{-2, 2}, {1000, 2}],               RGBColor[.4, .4, 1],Point /@ RandomReal[{-2, 2}, {1000, 2}],               Green,Point /@ RandomReal[{-2, 2}, {1000, 2}],               Yellow,Point /@ RandomReal[{-2, 2}, {1000, 2}]},               PlotRange -> {{-2, 2}, {-2, 2}}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/w3a0W.png) Ideally : -the points progressively adopt the color. All at the same time, at the same rate (2 seconds ?) -OR each points suddenly change color but just 100 at a time. **3-Finally, once the point are colored i would like to see them move, to join their piers like such :**                normalRDN[μ_, σ_, No_] :=      RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[μ, σ], No]               Graphics[{       Black, Rectangle[{-2, -2}, {2, 2}],       Pink,Point /@ ((normalRDN[#, .5, 1000] & /@ {-1, -1})\[Transpose]),       RGBColor[.4, .4, 1],Point /@ ((normalRDN[#, .5, 1000] & /@ {-1, 1})\[Transpose]),       Green,Point /@ ((normalRDN[#, .5, 1000] & /@ {1, -1})\[Transpose]),       Yellow,Point /@ ((normalRDN[#, .5, 1000] & /@ {1, 1})\[Transpose])},       PlotRange -> {{-2, 2}, {-2, 2}}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WWCBL.png) I am not sure of the means available for doing such animations, thus my illustrative codes might not be relevant.
