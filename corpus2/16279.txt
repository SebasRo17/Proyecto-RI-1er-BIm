Here are two examples:               RowReduce[{{3, 1, a}, {2, 1, b}}]      evaluates to               {{1, 0, a - b}, {0, 1, -2 a + 3 b}}      but               RowReduce[{{1, 2, 3, a}, {4, 5, 6, b}, {7, 8, 9, c}}]      evaluates to               {{1, 0, -1, 0}, {0, 1, 2, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 1}}      The result is independent of `a`, `b` and `c`. Since I want to know the steps of reduction, I add `a`, `b` and `c` for bookkeeping. But it does not work in the second example. Is anything wrong or is any way to keep track of the steps of reduction?
