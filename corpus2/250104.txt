I am developing a media server, the basic functionality is to serve an image, which is done the following way               /media/:id      where :id is the id of the image. You may want to ask for a specific size, with some rules I will provide. Eg:               /media/:id/50x50     /media/:id?witdh=50&height=50      Question: Which option do you think is better? I believe the second one to be more RESTful and beautiful, but we will be using a CDN and varnish for cache, so if we get               /media/:id?width=50&height=50      or               /media/:id?height=50&width=50      we will have 2 hits when we should have 1 Any advice?
