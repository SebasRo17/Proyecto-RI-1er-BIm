What percentage of time is saved and costed doing TDD. I assume this percentage of cost and reward changes during a projects life- cycle. I'd imagine the **initial phase** has a lot more cost but little rewards attached. Further on (during **re-factoring** ) you get the benefit of your tests. I've heard anywhere from **30-50% of your time** is writing unit tests. However that doesn't take into account the **time saved** from writing those tests. What's everyones' experience with this? Wes **EDIT** Whats the time saved as well as the time cost? In bug fixing and refactorablity?
