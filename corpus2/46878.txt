A few weeks ago, I viewed in the Mathematica Documentation any page withmultiple examples using diferent styles dpending on the value of the number in position (i,j), but I can´t remember... and I can´t find it. How can I use BLACK color to Print numbers that are close to the maximun? and much light gray as much close it is to the minimum ?               a = {1, 3, 6, 3, 2};     b = {3, 2, 5, 6, 9};     c = {2, 7, 3, 1, 6};     TableForm[{a, b, c}]      In this case, 1,2,3 appear with light gray, and 9 with BLACK!!! I remember... in that page there was many examples. Can you help me?
