Ok, I hope this is not too much confusing (with my poor English). I want to build a small .Net 4.0 app which monitors several other applications on a Windows Server OR on a regular Windows PC. It will have a WPF GUI with a variety of graphical controls. The app will be used in the following scenarios:   1. If installed on a PC it should run as a “normal” single Windows desktop app   2. If installed on a Server, it should run as a Windows Service. To use/manage the app it must have the same WPF GUI as in scenario 1 and the GUI should be run on the Server or on a remote PC At the moment I consider to write the application logic and connect it to the WPF GUI using a self-hosted WCF Data Service IN BOTH SCENARIOS. Since I’m not a pro developer I suppose it’s possible that I've missed something ;-) Will this work? Are there other/better solutions? Any answer or comment is highly appreciated.
