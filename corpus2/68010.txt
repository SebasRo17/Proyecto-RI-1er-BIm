When I was working on a programming project. I came across a problem where I had to store data in two different variables. The first one was a piece of data, and the second one was, well, another piece of data, and the order in which the information arrived really didn't matter. So I had to make a choice: I could have either named them `city1` and `city2`, or I could've named them `firstCity` and `secondCity`. With the issue of time in mind, I simply decided to stick to `city1` and `city2`. But, what would've been a ~~better~~ good choice, or at least what could I have done instead?
