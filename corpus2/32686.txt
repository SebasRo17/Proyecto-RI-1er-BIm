I'm really finding many ambiguities in how I really should interpret the histogram of an RGB image? I could understand what the height denotes, but did not understand how the pixels get plotted on a single dimensional x-axis. Also, is it possible to plot the image onto histogram3D? I tried after converting it to separate RGB images but I get an error that says it is not able to calculate the "bins" the diagram. Thank you
