If you drag & drop, you're letting the editor to build code for you. Surely that means you're not really programming. You're building an application that has no proper code logic, correct? I drag simple controls on a web form in .NET, but surely you cannot rely 100% on building an app that way? Though some tutorial books in .NET have you dragging and dropping all over the place. An example, reading from a database using ASP.NET. You can drop SQL controls onto the markup, or you can program the retrieval in the code behind. I prefer the code behind as you have proper control imho. Thoughts?
