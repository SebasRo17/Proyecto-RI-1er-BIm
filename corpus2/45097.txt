I want to solve this equation:               sol = NDSolve[{10000 u'[r] (1+u'[r]) -       1.`*^-6 (r + u[r]) (u[r] + r u'[r]) +       10000 r u'[r] u''[r] +       10000 r (1 + u'[r]) u''[r] == 0, 10000 u'[1] == 3.001, 10000 u'[3] == 1}, u, r,        MaxSteps ->Infinity]      the error message is:               FindRoot::sszero: The step size in the search has become less than the tolerance       prescribed by the PrecisionGoal option, but the function value is still greater than       the tolerance prescribed by the AccuracyGoal option. >>      NDSolve::berr: There are significant errors {-0.000159873,0.000479427} in the boundary      value residuals. Returning the best solution found. >>      what option should I add into `NDSolve` to resolve the problem? thanks
