What if I want to also decouple my application, from classes like Product or User? (which usually have more than one instance) Take a look at this example:               class Controller {         public function someAction() {             $product_1 = new Product();             $product_2 = new Product();             // do something with the products         }     }      Is it right to say that Controller now depends on Product? I was thinking that we could decouple them too (as we would with single- instance objects like Database) In this example, however ugly, they are decoupled:               class Controller {         public function someAction(ProductInterface $new_product) {             $product_1 = clone $new_product;             $product_2 = clone $new_product;             // do something with the products         }     }      Has anyone done something like this before? Is it excessive?
