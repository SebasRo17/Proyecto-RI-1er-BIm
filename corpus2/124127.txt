I am on my final year on CS, working on my first significant project, so I thought its about time to learn and use build tools. I have read about Maven mainly and heard about Ant. I would like to know your opinion about which I should learn to use for a project that will be developed only by one person, keeping in mind the learning curve, and the functionality that will be useful in this case.
