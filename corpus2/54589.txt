n = 10;          board = ConstantArray[0, {n, n}];          diag1[x0_, y0_] :=      Module[{x = x0, y = y0},       While[{x != 1 || y != 1},        x--;        y--        ];       While[{x != n + 1 || y != n + 1},        board[[x, y]]++;        x++;        y++        ]       ]      I have an n by n matrix of all zeroes. On a given coordinate in the matrix, I need to increase everything in its major diagonal by one. A runchart of this works fine. All that this does, is increase the (x-1,y-1) by one. I believe that the while loops are only executing the statements once, but I can't be sure.
