My desktop is fine, except that I like programming while reclining on a couch. My legs hurt after sitting too long in an office chair. Is there anything like a keyboard, trackpad, and monitor combo that I could hook up to my desktop (8 feet away from the couch), so I can work on the couch? I was thinking of buying a laptop for this purpose, but I'm looking to save money.
