In Emacs/Xemacs, there is a rectangle feature, such that you can delete, copy, etc., "rectangles" of text. Now suppose I have two text files, each containing one column of numbers. Is it possible to use Mathematica to "paste" the columns of text, side by side (perhaps separated by at least one space)? For example, suppose I have two text files:               (* file 1 *)     1     20     300          (* file 2 *)     4     50     600      I would like to be able to obtain a single text file like this:               (* file 3 *)     1   4     20  50     300 600      Do you have any ideas of how I can do this efficiently? The ideas I have (like stripping and joining row-by-row, and adding the appropriate number of spaces) are really complicated, and I feel like there must be an easier way. Thanks!
