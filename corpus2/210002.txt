I'm looking for a tool for team of programmers. Generally we are split in two groups, we are building two applications on the same framework and in the same moment we are building the framework. I'm looking for a tool, which can make better our communication. The problem to solve is, one team solved a problem in first application and give some code to framework, but the other team doesn't know about this and invents a wheel. The documentation doesn't solve the problem. I'm thinking about a blog on Wordpress -- you solved a problem, so you should give a post: add some tags, description, file names etc.
