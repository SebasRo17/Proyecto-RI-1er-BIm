Does a cracker need to know the number of iterations a hashing algorithm uses to compute a hash? If they don't know it, how do they figure it out? How much longer does it take to figure it out, than if they didn't know? I can only guess that they try a number of the most common passwords, and try it with different iterations, and see what amount of iterations returns the most correct passwords. Would this even work though?
