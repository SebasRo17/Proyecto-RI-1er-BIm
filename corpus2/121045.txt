I am sure everybody has had his/her share of regex woes. We have a big application with around 30 developers working on a mvc3 web application , and the two fold regex validations (front-end and server side) is becoming a nightmare to maintain. Is there a way to keep all the regexes in one place ? so that they can be used as attributes for entities and also be used for validations in the controller?
