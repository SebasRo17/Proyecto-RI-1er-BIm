I have pieces of code, written in java, which I can convert in jar and run from the terminal. I also have some node.js script, which I would like to run before running these jar files. So the process of running my project is as follows: > Start mongodb from terminal->Run Node.js script-> Run the java code(jar > file) So I want to know, is there a way I could automate my project by just calling some one single file instead of running so many files separately? if so, how?
