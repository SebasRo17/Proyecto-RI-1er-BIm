I'm having some difficulties with the command `StreamPlot` in _Mathematica 7.0_. Here's the basic plots I'm doing :               StreamPlot[{x, -y}, {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2}, Axes -> True,     AxesOrigin -> {0, 0}, FrameTicks -> None,      StreamPoints -> 12, StreamScale -> 0.15, PerformanceGoal -> "Quality"]          StreamPlot[{y, x}, {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2}, Axes -> True,      AxesOrigin -> {0, 0}, FrameTicks -> None, StreamPoints -> 12,      StreamScale -> 0.15, PerformanceGoal -> "Quality"]      Here's the output, which I find ugly : ![Ugly output](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IvJw2.jpg)   * How can I define the number of arrows heads to be drawn on each curve? Currently, there are too many arrows on the curves. I would prefer a maximum of two (or maybe three) arrows per stream curve.   * How can I make the output perfectly symetric? Look for example at the second picture, which is terrible.   * How can I remove the straight stream lines?
