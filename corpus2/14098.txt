I would like to perform matrix multiplication modulo 2. Hence, instead of the usual: `A.B` I did: > `Inner[#1*#2 &, A, B, Modulus[#1+#2,2]&]` However, it does not work, since `#1+#2` (in the modulus) only adds the first two inputs, whereas, I want it to add all its inputs (like `Plus` does). I want to define a function that just adds up all its inputs, modulo 2 **and it can take in variable number of inputs**. In otherwords, I want to define a `addmod` which takes in variable number of inputs and adds them (modulo 2): > `addmod[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0] = 1`, `addmod[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, > 0, 1, 0, 0] = 1` and so on. Note, the input is not a list here. Hence I cannot say something like: `addmod[list]=Fold[Modulus[Plus[#1+#2,2],2]&,0,list]` I would be happy to get some help on this. Sorry, if i am missing out something basic. Thanks very much.
