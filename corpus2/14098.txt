Before you start coding something, how do you prepare yourself? Do you make diagrams, pseudocode, mockups or any of that kind of stuff or you just start coding and see what comes along the way. Personally, I prefer to jump into the code as fast as possible when I am comfortable doing what I have to do. If something is more complicated or a problem occurs, I normally take a sheet of paper and start writing pseudocode down since I have less trouble concentrating that way (I guess that's kinda weird and hard to explain, but whatever...It works!) I guess everybody has there own strategy, so what's yours?
