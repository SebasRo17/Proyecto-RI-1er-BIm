What I want is pretty simple, nevertheless, after half an hour I have only unsatisfying solutions here. Let me ask you who might work more often with _Mathematica_ 's GUI elements: Is there a way to implement a dialog in _Mathematica_ which works in general like the autocompletion popup. > ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FF8x9.png) The dialog doesn't has to popup automatically but it should have the following features:   * it is a **fixed** list of entries, where the first entry is always selected and you can use the arrow keys to navigate up and down   * on `Enter` or `Esc` the dialog closes where in the first case, some identifier with the selected entry is returned   * I can use a unique "short-key" which lets me directly select and return one of the entries. So for instance if my list of choices is `{"Module","Block","With"}` I could use e.g. `m`, `b` and `w` to select the corresponding entry. I have played with various dialogs, button bars and `EventHandler` without luck. Bevor I investigate further, I thought asking is probably the better choice.
