I do not know if there is special programming in C# for the web or it is the same?. If it is the same then what are the topics that I should focus on in C# in order to use it building web application by ASP.NET (Web forms or MVC). For example, if I want to build a website for one of the health centers, will I need a lot of knowledge in C#? So,   * What are the topics that I should focus on in C# so I have enough confidence to build small - medium websites?
