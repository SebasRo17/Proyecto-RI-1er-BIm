Suppose I have a file with multiple tables, each separated by a line beak, like this:               banana yellow     apple red     grape purple          fire red     water blue     sky blue          parrot green     whale blue     cat yellow      I need to create three lists of ordered pairs out of this single file. If I had just a single table, I'd simply use `data = Import["file.dat", "Table"]`, but in this case I don't know how to tell _Mathematica_ to split into three tables and that I need a `data1`, a `data2` and a `data3`.
