To the best of my understanding the schedule for the project is derived using the effort estimates for the individual tasks (in person hours), and the number of relevant resources used for the particular task. As discussed in this question, we are starting a project using a new platform, featuring a brand new API and feature-set. How do we estimate the schedule of the tasks involved in the project, knowing only the top level task breakdown? Also, if some efforts are allocated to the tasks, the estimations would have a wide probability distribution. What is the best way to communicate the same to management?
