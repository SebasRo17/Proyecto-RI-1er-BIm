I have a list of Values and a list of variables. I want to set the Values into Variables. Assume the following code:               Values = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6}};     VariableS = {{x1, x2}, {x3, x4}, {x5, x6}};          VariableS[[1]] = Values[[1]];          FIntegrate = Integrate[f[x], {x, x1, x2}]      I want to use `{x1, x2}={1, 2}` and get `x1=1 and x2=2` and finally caculate the definite Integral`FIntegrate` .But I can not set the `x1=1 and x2=2`. How can I to do that ?
