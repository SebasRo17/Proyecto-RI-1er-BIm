I know the example usages of MakeBoxes in the Tutorial like this. but I want to know a subtle distinction between (1) and (3)               gplus /: MakeBoxes[gplus[x_, y_, n_], StandardForm] :=       RowBox[{MakeBoxes[x, StandardForm],         SubscriptBox["\[CirclePlus]", MakeBoxes[n, StandardForm]],         MakeBoxes[y, StandardForm]}]      In(1)               MakeBoxes[gplus[a, b, m + n], StandardForm]      Out(1) > RowBox[{"a", SubscriptBox["[CirclePlus]", RowBox[{"m", "+", "n"}]], "b"}] In(2)               MakeBoxes[gplus[a, b, m + n], StandardForm] // RawBoxes      Out(2) > ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uyfK2.png) In(3)               gplus[a, b, m + n]      Out(3) > ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Nz6td.png) I had thought that if I type the In(1) then it will be like to Out(3). I want to know the diffenrences after In(1) enter typing and In(3) enter typing. When I type the shift-enter keys. what the front end mechanism does like RawBoxes to do.
