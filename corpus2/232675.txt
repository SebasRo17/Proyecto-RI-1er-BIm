The burn down chart displays a clear deadline and the progress towards the deadline. When the progress is slow and the completion of the committed work is at risk, people start to get sloppy on design and code reviews and on the depth of testing. Quality suffers. The question is whether in your organization you were successful to maintain high quality standards regardless of the time remaining to the end of the Sprint. Another question is whether perhaps it is best to drop the burn down chart to somewhat reduce the pressure or even move from Scrum or Kanban or other agile methodology that doesn't mandates iterations.
