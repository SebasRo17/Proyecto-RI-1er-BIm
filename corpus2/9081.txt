I am curios to use .NET for some web applications (e.g. ASP.NET MVC 2). However my budget is limited so I would like to use Mono on Linux. I have never used Mono before, and I haven't read about any bigger sites that is using Mono+Linux on the server in production. What's your experience using Mono on Linux in production? How is the performance and stability compared to .NET on Windows Server? Is there any popular sites that is using it in production? Any articles available online were they share their experiences?
