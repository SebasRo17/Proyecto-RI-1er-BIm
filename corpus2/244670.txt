I am not understanding the output of this ,               #include <iostream>     using namespace std;           // pointers and arrays      char ch1 = 'a' ,  ch2= 'b';          char ch3[6] = {'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g' , 'h'};          char *ptr[3];           int main ()     {         ptr[0] = &ch1 ;              ptr[2] = ch3;         cout << &ch1 << endl;     }         The out put is abcdefgh . isn't &ch1 supposed to give the address of ch1 ? I cannot make sense why the output should be abcdefgh.
