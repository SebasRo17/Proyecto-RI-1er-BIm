How many directed graph nodes are typically represented in the browser? I'm working with some large data-sets with nodes and edges more then 400,000. I'm wondering if I am going down a fruitless path trying to represent them in the browser via arbor.js or similar JS libraries. What's the most effective way to allow a large number(large relative to my domain of real estate transactions, maybe 1-10,000) of users to visualize and browse a large directed graph of up to 500,000 records?
