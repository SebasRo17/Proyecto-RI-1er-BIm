I'm working with an ASP.net developer, under a boss who doesn't have much technical knowledge. I'm doing the front-end work, and and a database expert doing the backend. However, recently, he said that he would be working on the API for our site- I asked why, thinking we should do the web version first, assuming the API was for mobile apps. However, he said that he would just make a single API to work for all the web and mobile apps, and I would do the front-end for that. Is it just me, or is this a little crazy? If I'm doing front-end, it means there's going to be _two back-ends_ , because I'm going to have to use PHP or something to curl his API to the site, which is twice the loading time as normal. Thank for any help in advance. Also, I happen to be "the intern", so I'll have some but not very much pull with this issue.
