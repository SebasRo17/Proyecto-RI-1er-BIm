As far as programming languages go, I love C#, and for that matter all the good that comes from the .net framework (LINQ, etc). My main concern is I seem to be churning out too much code, and using OOP, I have a concern my code isn't always that easy to manage. I want to continue using C# and .Net, but are there any other approaches to applying the language to get overall less code, and easier to manage compared to text book OOP? Thanks in advance!
