I have a php website that will be experiencing high levels of traffic in a few weeks. We scaled the servers to accept the traffic, but want some sort of fallback page in the event that something happens. Does anyone know of an easy way to implement this? My initial thought is to check for the headers when the page is requested, but don't quite understand if that will even matter. Does the user even receive the initial http headers, if they get a `504 Gateway Timeout` error? Would something like checking the result of: `var_dump(http_response_code());` in a conditional even reach the client?
