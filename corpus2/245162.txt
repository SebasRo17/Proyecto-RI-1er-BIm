I previously posted a question [link] on programmers.stackexchange.com asking when it makes sense to adopt an existing enterprise scale agile framework and when it makes sense to allow your own enterprise scale agile framework to emerge (e.g. through trial and error). This question takes the previous question a step further and asks for **the factors that are important for success** when you have decided to go down the route of letting your enterprise scale agile framework emerge? \-- Downvoters: down voting without adding a comment provides no opportunity for improving the question. Please let me know why you are down voting so that I can improve the question.
