According to the documentation when using `DateList` but not giving it a year it should use the current year. It is not doing that for me. Instead it uses 1900. Evaluating the example in the documentation:               DateList[{"2/15", {"Month", "Day"}}]      results in               {1900, 2, 15, 0, 0, 0.}      when I would expect               {2012, 2, 15, 0, 0, 0.}      Am I reading the documentation wrong, or do I have some setting set wrong somewhere, or is this a bug if some kind?
