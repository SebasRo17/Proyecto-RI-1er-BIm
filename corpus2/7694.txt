Mathematica has quite a nice `ScalingFunctions` option to `BarChart`, `BubbleChart` and the various financial charting functions, which simplifies log scaling, reverse scales and so on. Consider:               test = FoldList[0.85 #1 + #2 &, 0.,        Abs@RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[0, 3], 25]]          {0., 1.40961, 4.59418, 9.49233, 11.4004, 9.93797, 11.0347, 11.0437,      9.39412, 8.46501, 10.5416, 10.3413, 9.60696, 8.47968, 9.45521,      9.44406, 12.3554, 15.3821, 17.8863, 15.5349, 17.2376, 18.3164,       18.5506, 16.459, 14.6381, 13.7955}          BarChart[test, Frame -> True]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/m9fU8.png)               BarChart[test, ScalingFunctions -> "Log", Frame -> True]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nHmaK.png) As has been previously noted on the site, the option actually works for `ListPlot` and `ListLinePlot` (but not `DateListPlot`) as well, even though this fact is not documented.               ListLinePlot[test, ScalingFunctions -> {"Log10", "Reverse"}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZFC2Z.png) However that breaks down where there is a frame. The tick labels (`FrameTicks`) are now the _rescaled_ values, not the original values. The data are correctly rescaled.               ListLinePlot[test, ScalingFunctions -> {"Log10", "Reverse"}, Frame -> True]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/07Uqd.png) Obviously the undocumented insertion of this functionality into `ListPlot` and `ListLinePlot` only affected `Ticks` and not `FrameTicks`. Is there any way to get the correct tick labels back?   Even better, is there a reasonably straightforward way to use `OptionValue[ScalingFunctions]` to ensure that _custom_ tick mark placement is correct when the data have been rescaled like this?
