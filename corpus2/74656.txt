I have seen some source code containing Copyright notice in the beginning of the file. Most of them are either GNU General Public License or Apache License. If I want to develop any open source software what are the steps should I follow? Do I need licensing my software by registering somewhere, or I just add the text like described in Apache License 2.0. If I modify source code of another open source software then what should I do? Should I seek permission from them?
