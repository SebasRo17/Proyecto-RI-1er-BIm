I've been thinking about trying to get through the SICP again, this time well- armed with a better idea of what the SICP is meant to accomplish, and being older and wiser than my first attempt back in university. I've been told by old hands that the MIT Scheme is the _only_ scheme I should think about using, and that other schemes lack features that make the SICP harder to accomplish. "There's a reason all the 'SICP-in-X' end with chapter 3. Other languages can't support what's in chapter 4." When I asked what's in chapter 4, the answer is, "You'll have to get through the first three chapters to understand." Which is very Zen, I admit, but not helpful. The only things I can think of that older lisps have is dynamic scope and fexprs, but those don't seem to be the issue. What features does MIT Scheme possess that makes it "ideal" for getting through SICP? (Other than that it's the target language of the book, of course.)
