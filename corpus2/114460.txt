There is a lot of buzz around Dart recently, often questioning Google motivations and utility of Dart as replacement for JavaScript. I was searching for rationale of creating Dart rather than investing more effort in ECMAScript. In well known leaked mail its author is saying that > Javascript has historical baggage that cannot be solved without a clean > break. But there is only one concrete example given (apart of performance concerns) of "fundamental language problems", which is an > existence of a single Number primitive So, my questions are:   1. How an existence of a single Number primitive can be a "fundamental problem"?   2. Are there other known "fundamental problems" in JavaScript?
