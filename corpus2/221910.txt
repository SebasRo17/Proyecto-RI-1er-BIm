Admittedly new to this but I wanted to understand why there is a gap between Red Hat's JBoss EAP project (their _enterprise_ version) and JBoss AS/Wildfly/community project. Looking at this post from Red Hat, it seems that they don't withhold the source/patches. Makes sense since withholding the source would be a GPL violation, which in spirit wants source distributions so end users can recreate/reuse the binaries. So if the sources are identical, then why isn't the AS/community version **_exactly_** at par with the EAP version? Shouldn't they be bit-exact, like having the same SHA256 value? It appears that the AS/community version usually lags by several hundred patches (from here, "Intro" section) > _Talking about the latest JBoss Application Server is always tricky.

(a single Maven server should suffice). I mean look at the popularity of CentOS (the community version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux) - the community IS interested in using software in production without RedHat's blessings/support. So, what am I missing here?
