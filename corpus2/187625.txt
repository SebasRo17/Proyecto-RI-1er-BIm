I need to write some code to integrate a machine with a coin acceptor. This coin acceptor (euro's dollars etc), has several connection methods. The manufacturer wrote a C++ dll and a C# invoke example to use it with an usb connection. Its the only provided coding sample i could get my hands on so far. However also two other connectors are available One is yet to me unknown, seams some hardware io port. The other is a CC-talk connector. From what i've read about it, that's some kind of slow RS323 serial connection protocol that works in 2 ways and is commonly used in billing systems. I never heard about it before until now. SO I wonder if I should use it too. What I think of it is that it might be a pretty old protocol, but i am not sure. There is not much "CC-talk" on forums and only a few questions on stackoverflow. That might be a hint that it is old, or that it is something high secure and secret?. I'm looking for a bit guidance here, to decide where i put my energy. Might there be some programmers here perhaps who are familiar with CC-talk What is your opinion about it, is it an outdated protocol for old hardware these days mostly replaced by usb or tcp/ip networks. Or is there something very specific about it, and good about like well perhaps be able to create secure transactions and stuff like that. Just for the record my device and the coin machine are on a 1 meter distance, so i will not have problems with signal lose. (if that was good about cc-talk)
