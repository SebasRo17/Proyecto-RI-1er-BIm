Or in other words, what specific problems did automated garbage collection solve? I've never done low-level programming, so I don't know how complicated can freeing resources get. **Update** \- apologies for the unnecessary concision, please let me expand my question: The kind of bugs that GC addresses seem (at least to an external observer) the kind of things that a programmer that knows well his language, libraries, concepts, idioms, etc, wouldn't do. But I could be wrong: is manual memory handling intrinsically complicated?
