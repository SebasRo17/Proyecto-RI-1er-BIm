I came across this license:               /**      * The author disclaims copyright to this source code. In place of      * a legal notice, here is a blessing:      *      * May you do good and not evil.      * May you find forgiveness for yourself and forgive others.      * May you share freely, never taking more than you give.      */      Would this have the same legal bearing as the WTFPL license?
