This chromogram shown here represents data (mouse activity patterns during visits) for ~20 physicians in a study, each of which may have a variable number of visits in the study (physicians are color coded; also the last 2 digits in the XXX-YY). So each row represents one visit. Row and Column are used to layout the graphical elements including the XXX-YY annotation (the arrow is due to using Rule in key-value pairs). The query looks something like this:               Column[#,ItemSize->90]&@  PACE[VISITS] /.            v_String:>Row@{PROVIDERCOLOR@v ->  Graphics[VGr[v/.PACE[V1]],ChromoGrOptions]}      Taking the resulting expression as argument, how can the spacing be adjusted so that there is more space between distinct physicians' data? A method I want to avoid, if possible, is to restructure the data and call `Column` separately perhaps with different padding parameters. Though perhaps it's possible to apply `Map` or `Thread` or combinations, to effect that rewrite. Thoughts?
