I have a couple projects that depend on additional files, like images or config files. When compiling and installing a programs like `Okular` with `cmake`, I can specify an installation directory and let `make install` install to that. Somehow, that program will figure out that all its dependencies are within that folder, not withing the main Linux file system. So far, I had absolute paths, like `/etc/config.ini`. The problem is that I cannot test the program without it installing it to my system any more. How can I do that easily in C++ and Python?
