I've seen an interview with Richard Stallman some time ago, and he was asked a question about security and Windows OS which he answered saying that there are some relatively bad design decisions that were made when creating the Windows OS. These design decisions (according to R. Stallman) were known at the time for creating security vulnerabilities later on. Can anyone explain what he's talking about ? The video with the interview can be found here http://rt.com/news/richard- stallman-free-software-875/ \- it starts at 8:30.
