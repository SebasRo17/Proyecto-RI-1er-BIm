I'm very new in this area but I spend a long time to read about all this methodologies (SSADM, AGILE, RAD, SPIRAL, WATERFALL, INCREMENTAL, DSDM, XP, Iterative) in detail, how do they work, the advantageous and disadvantageous and ... Now the bad part part is: I understand them all separately but can't understand :   1. Is it like one of them let say **SSADM** ( WITH 5- 7 STAGES ) is what we try to achieve and we should use the rest (RAD, AGILE AND ..) to do so.   2. Or its like some of them are the main Categories like (SSADM, AGILE) and the rest becoming their subcategories?   3. Or no there are all separate things with no connections which in this case i can't understand stuff like this from Wikipedia: > SSADM is a waterfall method for the production of an Information System > design. SSADM can be thought to represent a pinnacle of the rigorous > document-led approach to system design, and contrasts with more contemporary > Rapid Application Development methods such as DSDM.
