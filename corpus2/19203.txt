I am trying to get an exponent vector from a list of monomials. I am using the `CoefficientRules` command; however, it is returning a list that includes the coefficients of the monomial. I don't need the coefficient and need to remove it before I can use the exponent vector, however I am finding this quite difficult.               poly = x^2 + 2 x*y + y^2;     monomialList = MonomialList[poly];     alpha = CoefficientRules[monomialList]          {{{2, 0} -> 1}, {{1, 1} -> 2}, {{0, 2} -> 1}}      Is there a way to remove the -> and the value that follows it, or a better way to generate the exponent vector?
