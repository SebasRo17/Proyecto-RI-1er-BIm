Is it possible to define variables dynamically? Last night I was writing some code (C and VB2010) and I ran into a problem related to defining variables in my program. The variables needed depend on the number of entries added by the user and the number of users. Even using dynamic memory allocation we have a size limit, but I wonder about this type of thing sometimes. We can define as many variables as we need (to a limit of course) when writing the code, but can't we define more at runtime? For example: say your whole program is done and when user says 'x', this cannot be created as variable; rather we require a variable to store that x. Why cant we make x a variable at runtime? Can't we build a bridge between compile-time and runtime with some rules?
