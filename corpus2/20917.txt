I am trying to run the following integral in version 9.0, but it fails:               Integrate[      2 I (-1 +        x) ((-8 + 12 x - 6 m\[Pi]^2 x - 2 m\[Pi]^2 x^2 -         4 x^3)/((1 - x)^2 +         m\[Pi]^2 x) + ((4 - 2 x + 4 m\[Pi]^2 x - 8 x^2 +         6 m\[Pi]^2 x^2 + 6 x^3) Log[         1/((1 - x)^2 + m\[Pi]^2 x)])/((1 - x)^2 + m\[Pi]^2 x)), {x, 0,        1}, Assumptions -> m\[Pi] > 0 && m\[Pi] < .1]      Version 9.0.1: ![Version 9.0](http://i.stack.imgur.com/V0LB0.png) But in version 8.0, it works: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CQEZj.png) Is this a bug, or is the integral really non-convergent? What's a possible workaround, since I don't have easy v8 access?
