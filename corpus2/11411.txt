I have the following data:               data12 = {        {1, 981.946, 978.783, 978.783},        {2, 813.948, 810.783, 810.667},        {3, 743.422, 743.447, 744.062},        {4, 715.382, 715.478, 715.326},        {5, 690.345, 696.075, 691.664},        {6, 862.126, 870.902, 860.371}     };      I want to make a `ListLinePlot` using the first row element (the index) as the X coordinate, and for the Y coordinate, the difference between the second and third value in row (generally speaking, the difference between two generic columns). How can I do it? Thanks in advance for your reply. === EDIT === I've found this solution:               ListLinePlot[{#[[1]], #[[2]] - #[[3]]} & /@ data12]      Is it a good solution, or is there a better way to accomplish this?
