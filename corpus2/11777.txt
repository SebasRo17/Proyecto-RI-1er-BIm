Is it possible to create a C++ program using MathLink that will invoke the Maple kernel and execute a very basic Maple command using OpenMaple? I'm envisioning the following:               Install["MapleLink"]      starts the external program MapleLink and installs the _Mathematica_ definition RunMaple.               ?RunMaple          RunMaple[expr] returns a string which is the output when Maple executes expression expr      A sample output:               RunMaple["seq(i, i=0..3);"]          "0, 1, 2, 3"      I'm also open to using J/Link.
