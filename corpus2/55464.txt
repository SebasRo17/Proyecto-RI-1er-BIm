I have Mathematica 9.0.1.0 and I've recently noticed that whenever I press the equals sign and type something like Sech[x]^2, I get the message: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dFYfV.png) I then tried other search queries, such as p^2, Hamiltonian, and 40 degrees 39'44''. I keep getting the same message, though. What's strange is that, regardless of the search query, Mathematica still correctly interprets the input. Does anyone know why this message appears? I only started seeing it a week or two ago. Thanks.
