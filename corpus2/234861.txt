Design by Contract says, in terms of the function talking: "you give me all the right parameters and I'll give you exactly this kind of data" ...in essence. So, given that, should I use up resources checking the output? I should check for properties that the function does not guarantee its output possesses, but the properties the function guarantees need not be checked, right? Here's an example:               class Transition_Manager {         string str = generate_non_null_string();         process_using_a_function_that_can't_handle_null_strings( str );     }
