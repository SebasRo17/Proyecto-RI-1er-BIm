we have a cross-platform middleware product which we typically end up customizing/bug fixing on a per client basis. In some cases, providing updates as often as once/twice per week. We have a lot of trouble efficiently managing and releasing the updates to our clients. I've done some digging, but I can't find anything to specifically address this problem. Can anyone share their experiences - how do you deal with this scenario, or do you know of a good software delivery cms?
