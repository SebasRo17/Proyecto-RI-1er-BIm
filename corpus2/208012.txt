I'm currently at the beginning of a build. We are requiring a lot of back end functionality around Clients/Users/Groups/Roles. However, these aren't required for Sprint 1 which is acting as a MVP release. But I want to ensure we are preparing for this enhanced back-end in the future. This is easiest by defining an interface to the User Management system without actually building all of it yet. How would you organise this in a Scrum project environment? Obviously, in order to decide how the interface needs to look. We need to decide on it's functionality. But in doing so, we'll be getting very close to speccing the entire thing out. Which isn't required for several months! (This is a Team Foundation Scrum 3.0 workflow for those interested)
