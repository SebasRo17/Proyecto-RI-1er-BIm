I'm a new programmer and want to ask senior programmers (programmers who have some experience in the real world). I do my work and after coding, my project gets completed but honestly speaking I don't remember the code, classes and frameworks name and their properties. Sometimes even I doubt myself that did I made this? Is this normal with all programmers or am I the silliest programmer who couldn't remember the code and classes/properties names? **Edit:** I think many of programmers are getting me wrong here. I said I forget frameworks names, classes' names, property names but I start remembering my own code once I start working on it again. My question is do you remember syntax and classes/property etc. names?
