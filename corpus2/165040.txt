Alright, this question stems from the fact that there are very few online resources for learning JMF. The books that are available are quite old, some of them out of publication.   This question is an extension to my other question where asked I for the name of a book that I could use to learn JMF.   So, is there a major difference between JMF 1.0 and JMF 2.1.1?   Should I go ahead and buy a book that covers JMF 1.0?
