Suppose in some ORM based project (say Hibernate) I am trying to fetch only few columns rather then the whole Object with may be more than 20 attributes. I am writing HQL like `"select attr1, attr2 from Entity "`. I know I am not taking advantage of using Hibernate because I will get the result in Object form only and then I have to do explicit casting for it. But whether it will be a right approach to achieve optimization from database prospective or because I am performing some explicit casting the cost will still be same?
