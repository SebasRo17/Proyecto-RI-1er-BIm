I will briefly explain my situation. I have a website in PHP, this website is powered by a custom framework + some "plug-in" made ad hoc for it. I am the only developer of this. Until now I just test locally any changes than I upload the php files via FTP. I don't feel confortable anymore with this. The code base has grown quite a lot and I need some sort of system that helps to keep track of changes (line by line) and can restore to an old version easly if something goes wrong. Are there any good solution for this? Note: I never used something like version control or subversion because I think they are too much for this situation (I am the only developer and I just need basic feature) Note2: Something with a nice web interface would be perfect, I can pay for a good service too As now I found:   * http://beanstalkapp.com/   * http://github.com/   * http://www.codespaces.com/   * http://codesion.com/   * https://bitbucket.org/
