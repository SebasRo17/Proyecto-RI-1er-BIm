I'm trying to syntax highlight this expression: x=$\sqrt{\pi }$//N and from various sources I've learned that x (the assigned symbol) belongs to context Global while the Pi and N belongs to System. So I set out to change the style of both using a hodgepodge of tips I gleaned from this StackExchange as well as from StackOverflow. However, the weird thing is that the style changes do not add to each other. If I change the style of System, any previous style change to Global would be wiped away, and vice versa. In other words, I can have syntax highlighting for either System, or Global, but not both. This could be seen from these screenshots (sorry for the small font, code added): * * * First line:               SetOptions[$FrontEndSession,       "AutoStyleOptions" -> {"SymbolContextStyles" -> {"System`" ->            RGBColor[211./255, 54./255, 130./255]}}] (*magenta*)      ![System Magenta](http://i.stack.imgur.com/w2whO.png) _Setting System style: magenta_ * * * Second line:               SetOptions[$FrontEndSession,       "AutoStyleOptions" -> {"SymbolContextStyles" -> {"Global`" ->            RGBColor[181./255, 137./255, 0./255]}}] (*yellow*)      ![Global Yellow](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3qXqO.png) _Setting Global style: yellow; when evaluated, previously set System style was wiped out_ * * * Could anyone guide me toward getting syntax highlighting for both of them? I really hope MMA has better syntax highlighting on their future releases.
