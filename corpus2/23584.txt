So I have not been able to find any examples of the Manipulate feature for two ODE's. I would like to plot a graph of x[t] vs. y[t] and manipulate the initial conditions, v and theta. Thank you very much for any help you can offer.               k=.313     g=9.81;     NDSolve[{x''[t] == -k x'[t] Sqrt[y'[t]^2 + x'[t]^2],      y''[t] == -k y'[t] Sqrt[y'[t]^2 + x'[t]^2] - g, x[0] == 0,      y[0] == 0, x'[0] == v Cos[theta], y'[0] == v Sin[theta]}, {x,      y}, {t, 0, 10}]
