I have a couple questions with regard to the GNU GPLv3 license. My application is closed-source and I do not intend to actually release it to the public. However, it does _generate_ commercial items. The use of dlls licensed under the above license are used and _linked_ to the software that generates these commercial products. I would just like clarification, that because the software is not actually being distributed - only what the software generates. Therefore, no release of source etc would be required. The licensed dlls are not modified in any way. Secondly, out of interest. When a GNU GPLv3 is used by commercial software (let's say this software is released). This time the licensed material is a EXE and not a .DLL and therefore not actually _linked_ to the code of the software. Rather the software is executing the licensed software directly and sending it command line style arguments and using what the exe returns. Would the source code have to be released? Thanks, I am new to the realms of these licenses and slightly confused.
