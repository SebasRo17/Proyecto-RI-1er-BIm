For some functions in _Mathematica_ it is important to use `RuleDelayed`. One prominent example is the `EvaluationMonitor` for functions like `NMinimize`               NMinimize[x^4 - 3 x^2 - x, x, EvaluationMonitor :> Print[x]]      Here it is inevitable to use `RuleDelayed` because otherwise `Print[x]` would be evaluated too soon. **Question:** Is there a comprehensive list of options which require `RuleDelayed`? Btw, the reason why I need this list is to support this correctly in the IntelliJ Plugin for Mathematica: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zJ1rv.gif)
