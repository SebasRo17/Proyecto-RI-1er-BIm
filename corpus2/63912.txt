I am looking for practical tasks to get experience with Python. Just reading the books and not doing any tasks in the language is not effective. I solved some problems on the Project Euler and TopCoder and it helped me to learn the syntax of the language better. But those tasks are hard algorithmically, but as a rule is quite simple from the point of view of programming. Now I'm looking for an interesting open source project in Python, participation in which will help me to better understand the OO-model of language. Although, this is my first step with Python, in general, I am an experienced programmer and I can be useful for a project. May be someone can suggest something?
