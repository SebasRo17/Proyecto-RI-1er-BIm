I'm trying to plot a graph wit a logarithmic y-axis. Since I'm exporting the graph to pdf and later printing it, I want to manually set the frame and tick marks to a reasonable thickness. However the logarithmic tick marks do not change their thickness. (Note: I exaggerated the thickness of the tick marks on purpose to illustrate my point.)               LogPlot[x^2, {x, 1, 3}, PlotStyle -> Red, Frame -> True,     FrameStyle -> Directive[Black, AbsoluteThickness[2]],     FrameTicksStyle -> Directive[Black, AbsoluteThickness[2]]     ]      ![Plot with Logarithmic Ticks](http://i.stack.imgur.com/e89fq.png) I'm working with Mathematica 10 on Mac OS X 10.9.4. In Mathematica Version 9 the logarithmic tick marks change their thickness as expected. Can anyone reproduce this behavior? Is this a bug or did the FrameTicksStyle change in Mathematica 10?
