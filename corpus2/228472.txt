I'd like to include some data from a GPLv2 licensed project in my MIT licensed project. More specifically, I want to use the data from the other project as the training data for my machine learning algorithm and I'd also like to include the trained model in my project. I don't want to include the whole project source code, just those data files. I will not modify them. I also want to have the trained model in my project which I think is derived work? Can I create a folder for those data files, add a copy of the GPLv2 license, make it clear that my project is MIT licensed apart from that folder which contains GPLv2 licensed files? Does the trained model also have to be released under GPLv2? If so, can I also keep it in that folder?
