Having a life partner definitely affects an individual's career. For e.g. A programmer spends hours on the computer for work. A spouse working in the same field as yours would not mind adjusting with the household chores. On the other hand, a partner from some other field will not understand the significance of your work, and this may create problems in one's married life. Apart from this factor, what do you think are the other factors which are affected with the choice of partner from the same field? And how useful it is for programmers to have a spouse from the same field as you are working?
