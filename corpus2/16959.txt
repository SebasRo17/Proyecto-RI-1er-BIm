I need to get _Mathematica_ to evaluate the logarithm of a negative real number using the lower branch instead of the upper branch, so that while               In[1]:=   Log[3.2]     Out[1]:=  1.16315      I need               In[2]:=   Log[-3.2]     Out[2]:=  1.16315 - 3.14159 I      and not               Out[2]:=  1.16315 + 3.14159 I      I have already defined my own function `loopLog` that does this:               loopLog[x_: NumericQ] = If[Element[x,Reals], Conjugate[Log[x]]];      But I am not able to get it to perform any of the usual simplifications or manipulations using this function. For example, when I want to differentiate loopLog, I get               In[3]:=   D[loopLog[x],x]     Out[3]:=  If[x \[Element] Reals, Derivative[1][Conjugate][Log[x]]/x]      Instead of the much needed `1/x`. What is the cleanest way to define such a logarithm function in _Mathematica_?
