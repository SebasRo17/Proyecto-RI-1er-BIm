When I am learning a new language, I often don't need much more then simple comparison to languages I already know. For example each language uses its own Scope rules and Dynamic vs Static typing etc... Is there a good way to keep track of it? Are there good organized resources for finding out this information? I find that going through 500 pages of a book when 10 pages would suffice is very inefficient.
