I want to solve a three-equation system, but I need to constrain two of the variables so that they can only take one of several discrete values that I would specify (this is a circuit design problem where I need to find a resistor that can have a continuous range of values and two standard capacitors). I attempted to use Solve[] using the logical OR operator || to constrain the two variables, but Mathematica tells me that the system is not a quantified system of equations and inequalities. Does anybody know of a solution to this? Here's the code:               Solve[{       (10*^3 == 1/(2*Pi*Sqrt[10000*r2*c1*c2])),       (20 == 3*Sqrt [r2*c2]/Sqrt[10000*c1]),       (3 == Sqrt[r2/10000]*Sqrt [c1*c2]/(c1 + c2)),       (r2 > 5000),       (c1 == (10*^-12) || (100*^-12) || (22*^-12) || (0.001*^-6) || \         (0.01*^-6) || (0.1*^-6)),       (c2 == (10*^-12) || (100*^-12) || (22*^-12) || (0.001*^-6) || \         (0.01*^-6) || (0.1*^-6))},      {r2, c1, c2}]
