This is probably very easy for someone with more experience, but I am trying to plot only two Normal distributions, but for some reason my Method plots 4, instead of 2. I have:               Plot[Evaluate@       Table[PDF[NormalDistribution[μ, σ], x],             {μ, 6, 7}, {σ, 1, 2}],       {x, 0, 12}, Filling -> Axis]      which plots: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/N8qyI.jpg) My intention was to plot $Normal(\mu_1,\sigma_1)$ and $Normal(\mu_2,\sigma_2)$ instead of all the 4 possible combinations of them. Thanks!
