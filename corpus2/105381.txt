**The context:**   * it's an internal project (that I don't think a lot of people use)   * it's old   * we're updating it **The issues:**   1. it abuses the mvc framework (no use of models, business logic in views, etc)   2. what we're being asked to do is small, but because of the low cohesion we have two options:      1. continue to botch things     2. move large chunks of code around or rewrite the thing **The solutions (I see):**   1. continue working with it, ignore best practices in favor of being done soon and not introducing new bugs by refactoring/rewriting   2. refactor/rewrite I guess my question is really: if I want to make large changes to this project, how do I do propose that without insulting anyone? Or would it be better for me to simply go with the flow even if that means (metaphorical) duct-tape sometimes?
