I have a long _Mathematica_ notebook where some cells on multiple levels are closed for clarity. When I export the notebook as a _PDF_ via `Print` or `Save as`, the print only contains the opened cells. I want to be able to print all cells - even the closed ones - into the _PDF_.   When I open them via `Cell -> Grouping -> Open all Subgroups` my actual notebook is changed destructively, and I have to re-close certain groups by hand because there's no proper undo. Did I miss any option?
