I'm considering re-reading Steve McConnell's excellent "Software Project Survival Guide" and perhaps applying it verbatim to my next project. However, one thought struck me: the book was written in 1998, before Scrum and other agile methodologies became popular. Are the teachings of this book still relevant in light of the newer methodologies? Or are they compatible? If the latter, do you have any experience of agile projects run according to McConnell's book(s)?
