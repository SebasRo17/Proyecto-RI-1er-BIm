I have a complex non-binary graph model.   Each tree node can have multiple children&parents (a node can also have a connection to it's "brother"). A node is represented as square on screen with lines to the connected nodes.   For that I want to use Draw2D and GEF libraries. The problem I am facing is the graph layout. I need a nice algorithm that can reposition the square nodes and the connections with minimum intersections and also make it symmetric as possible.
