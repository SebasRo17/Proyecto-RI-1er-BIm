I want to find out how easy or hard the transition to C / C++ is for a mid- experienced Java programmer. I've already read the questions about "C++ for Java Programmers" and "Is it necessary for Java programmers to learn some C/System programming?". Everything sounds very interesting, but I want to specifically add the aspect I have experience in Python programming as well. I'm aware that you are able to run python on the JVM with jython, but I think it will provide better experience to get exposed to new concepts and to explore Python's origins. My target environment is mainly Linux. Could you estimate (perhaps even tell from your own experience) how hard it would be and especially give a hint as to whether it would be better to go with C or C++ in order to interact with Python?
