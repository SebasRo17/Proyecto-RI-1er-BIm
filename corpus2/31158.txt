To generate 3D mesh TetGen can be easily used. Are there similar functions (or a way to use TetGen) to generate 2d mesh? I know that such functionality can be easily implemented but I would like to use a Mathematica provided function, as I need to experiment with number of nodes in elements and so on. I just want to solve PDE using FEM not really to play around with mesh generation.
