I'm trying to figure out what the benefit to having a WYSIWYG HTML editor over hard coding, outside of, say, accessibility. It seems like a waste of time to learn how to use something like Dreamweaver over Notepad++. Am I missing something here? Every time I've ever used one, I end up going back into the code to fix the problems the visual editor made.
