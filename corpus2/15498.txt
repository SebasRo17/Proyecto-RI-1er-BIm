I use Mathematica with R because I am able to keep my code and output organized with the notebook interface. Although I can get R structures into _Mathematica_ using REvaluate, I can't figure out how to get textual output, from say:               summary(fit)      Perhaps this can be done by redirecting output to a temporary file, like the case of plots, but I wonder if there is a native solution.
