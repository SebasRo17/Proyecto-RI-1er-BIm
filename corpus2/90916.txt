I did my degree in physics and moved later into programming. I have two and a half years experience under my belt and like to think I write good code. I am, however, concerned that not doing a compsci degree has left holes in my knowledge. I would like to fill those up now since I know I want to be doing programming for the rest of my career. What skills/techniques did you learn in your compsci degree that one wouldn't pick up from on-the-job programming?
