We recently discovered a locale specific issue in our application and while it was easy to fix (once we figured out what was going on), it got the team I'm on thinking about unit testing practices in this regard. We would like to catch these issues sooner, ideally before they're discovered by a customer, and we want to protect ourselves from reintroducing locale specific bugs in the future, but duplicating every unit test in at least one other culture seems like a lot of overhead. How do you or how would you approach multi-locale unit testing?
