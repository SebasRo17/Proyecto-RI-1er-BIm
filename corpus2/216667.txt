I am working on a tool which has been developed for the use in my organization. Recently the management decided to make this open source. This will be the first open source contribution from my company and by me . How can I make a project open source which will also show that this is from this organization? Is just naming it as orgName_toolName sufficient or is there any other practice that is followed? I am planning to make this available in Github.
