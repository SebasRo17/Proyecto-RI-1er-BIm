I want to solve this equation:               X(i, j) + C*Y(i, j) = Z(i, j)      Where               i = 2         j = 2     C = 5     X(i, j) = {{1, 1}, {1, 1}}     Y(i, j) = {{2, 2}, {2, 2}}      How can I get _Mathematica_ to solve for values of `Z(1, 1)`, `Z(2, 1)`, `Z(1, 2)`, `Z(2, 2)`? I’m relatively new the _Mathematica_ , and I’d like to solve these 4 equations, but I’d also like to be able to scale up i and j (to say, 10) without rewriting the code. Any syntax help would be very helpful. My code looks like this, but I can’t get _Mathematica_ to find the solution.               Solve[       Table[Subscript[X, i, j] - (C*Subscript[Y, i, j]), {i, 2}, {j, 2}] ==         Table[Subscript[Z, i, j], {i, 2}, {j, 2}], {X, Y, Z}]
