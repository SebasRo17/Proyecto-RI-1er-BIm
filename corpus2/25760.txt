I'm trying to count the number of times multiplication appears in an expression (for the purpose of constructing a ComplexityFunction that would help me simplify a terrible algebraic expression for later numerical crunching in matlab). For example, I consider the following expression to involve 3 multiplications:               a b c + d e      two in "abc" and one in "de". I've tried Level, but unfortunately mathematica sees the term "abc" as one "Times" with three arguments:                In:= Level[a b c + d e, {-1}, Heads->True]     Out:= {Plus, Times, a, b, c, Times, c, d}      In principle I could reverse-engineer the multiplicity of arguments of "Times" from the above, but that seems like an unnecessarily cumbersome way. i'd greatly appreciate any help.
