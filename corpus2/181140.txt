I was using a popular music package (Ableton Live) when I opened the legal section of the helpfile and saw that the program contained code licenses that appeared to be both free as in freedom and free as in beer. I cannot find an online copy, alas, but if necessary I can list the licensed packages. As far as I can see there are 3 possibilities here:   1. A fairly large company is violating code licensing - highly unlikely, if that were so why would they include the license text?   2. It's actually legit for some reason to charge money for and close source of a package that contains opensource code - this is news to me, definitely.   3. I am misunderstanding something - highly probable.
