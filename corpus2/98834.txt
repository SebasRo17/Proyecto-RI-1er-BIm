Given the following scenario:   * There is a public website (with about 50-100 visitors a day)   * Visitors register for the services offered by the company who owns the website   * Visitors tend to give wrong information regarding address and phone number that slows down the process of their registration, therefore their transactions and general happiness about the services of the company   * Generaly the address validation adds value to the website I am looking for a service for a reasonable price, that has:   * Up to date postcode and address database    * Easy to integrate API   * Address validation check    * All this with a reasonable price I am looking specifically looking in the UK. What I have found so far are companies having these services for on ridiculously high price. We are also considering buying the PAF database from RoyalMail and implement such a service for ourselves. Any help, suggestion is very much appreciated and thanks very much in advance!
