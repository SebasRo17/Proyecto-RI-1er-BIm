This question is related to the following: Speeding up Import and Export in CSV format Stream CSV files Reading periodic elements from a large file I have a set of very large CSV files (a few hundred MB), a sample file is available here. RAM limitations make it quite cumbersome to use Import. I am only interested in a subset of data from the file:   * I want to read data from just a few columns   * I want to read data from every 256th row starting with the 3rd row                  columns = {3, 4, 5, 8, 12}; first = 3; step = 256;      I am interested in methods that minimize memory and speed up import.
