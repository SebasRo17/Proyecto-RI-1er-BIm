So I have a method that's something like this:               -(BOOL)isSingleValueRecord      And another method like this:               -(Type)typeOfSingleValueRecord      And it occurred to me that I could combine them into something like this:               -(id)isSingleValueRecord      And have the implementation be something like this:               -(id)isSingleValueRecord {         //If it is single value         if(self.recordValue = 0) {                  //Do some stuff to determine type, then return it             return typeOfSingleValueRecord;                  }         //If its not single value          else {             //Return "NO"             return [NSNumber numberWithBool:NO];         }     }      So combining the two methods makes it more efficient but makes the readability go down. In my gut, I feel like I should go with the two-method version, but is that really right? Is there any case that I should go with the combined version?
