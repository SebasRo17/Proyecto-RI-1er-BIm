Consider a box which contains 30 balls. 10 red, 10 white and 10 blue balls. There will be picked 4 balls randomly, without putting the balls back to the experiment. My question is: How do I create a distribution of this senario, so I can find the probability that none of the 4 balls are red, and to calculate the mean and variance? I am aware the math is: $$\frac{20}{30} \times \frac{19}{29} \times \frac{18}{28} \times \frac{17}{27}=0.1768$$ But I need to convert it into a distribution and use the Probability function.
