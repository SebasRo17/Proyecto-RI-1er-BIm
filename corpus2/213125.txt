Often I am writing a function that returns multiple values, such as a pair of coordinates:               function get_coords() {       return ???;     }      If I was using a language like Python, I would use a tuple:               return (x, y)      Or, in an OOP language like Java, I would create a custom coordinate class:               class Coordinates {       public int x;       public int y;            public Coordinates(x, y) {         this.x = x;         this.y = y;       }     }      Then return like this:               return new Coordinates(x, y);      **On to JavaScript.** In JavaScript, we have the option of returning a simple object:               return {x: x, y: y}      or a Java-like approach, with a custom object:               return new coordinates(x, y)      Are there any reasons to use one above the other?
