Like every author needs to read a lot of classical literature to develop his own style, and like every chess player read and analyze former champions games before, I think also every programmer needs to read a lot of high quality code. When it comes to Java source code, what are your recommendations as "reading". Which open source projects, libraries in the past you found yet easier to grasp and easy to read but also very good examples of what "high quality" code looks like?
