I have been programming in the same Object Oriented Programming language for many years (Windows-based). The problem is this particular language is not very popular, and not one of the hottest ones in demand in job postings and such. Should I be worried? Would a Java employer understand that I'm a programmer and can pick up any language in a matter of a week or two, or would they be under the impression that since I haven't programmed in their specific language professionally, then I'm just not qualified? PS. As far as learning, I do play around with different technologies at home. But at work, I'm pretty much stuck with the same language.
