I have some data which I want to plot in a simple bar chart:               example = {{"Knowledge", 2}, {"Comprehension", 4}, {"Application", 0}, {"Analysis", 1}, {"Synthesis", 0}, {"Evaluation", 2}}      The first element of each pair should be the bar label, and the second should be the height of the bar. I can get the desired result using:               BarChart[Last[#] & /@ example, ChartLabels -> {"Knowledge","Comprehension","Application","Analysis","Synthesis","Evaluation"}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/y6FKi.png) But my real question is this: Though               First[#] &/@ example      Returns               {"Knowledge", "Comprehension", "Application", "Analysis", "Synthesis", "Evaluation"}      When I try:               BarChart[Last[#]&/@example, ChartLabels->First[#]&/@example]      I get a graph without labels: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/y6ydg.png) This seems like strange behaviour, can anyone shed some light, or suggest a fix?
