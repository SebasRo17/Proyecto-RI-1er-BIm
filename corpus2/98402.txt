It roughly three weeks I will be taking a Parallel programming class that is taught using C for the assignments. I have a fairly strong interest in the subject at present and my C skills aren't terrible but I feel like I need to brush up on C as the last class I had that actively required programming in it was 8 months ago. I took an Embedded Systems course in the spring so I understand the concept of deadlock, semaphores and the "shared data" problem. It was primarily iOS programming code wise so my C skills haven't seen loads of use from that context either. If I had to guess as to an area of especially stringent re-study I would select pointers and memory allocation as that seems to be the primary challenge. I believe the class covers MPI and OpenMP so I may take a look at those in advance. Am I on the right track or am I missing something entirely?
