The following command does what I want:               TrigExpand[ Cos[a + b]^2]          (* 1/2 + 1/2 Cos[a]^2 Cos[b]^2 - 1/2 Cos[b]^2 Sin[a]^2 -         2 Cos[a] Cos[b] Sin[a] Sin[b] - 1/2 Cos[a]^2 Sin[b]^2 +         1/2 Sin[a]^2 Sin[b]^2 *)      Unfortunately, it does not apply the distributive property of the product in another case, that is the one I am interested in:               TrigExpand[ Cos[c*(a + b)]^2]          (*  Cos[c*(a + b)]^2  *)      How can I tell _Mathematica_ to do that initial step?
