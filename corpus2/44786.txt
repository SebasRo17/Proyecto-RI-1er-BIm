For example assume that the following code is given               f[x_, y_]:=        Block[{a, b},           a = Sin[x];           b = Cos[y];           c = a + b        ]      and I want to change it into (without doing too much typing myself)               prepareAB[x_, y_] := {Sin[x], Cos[y]};          f[x_, y_]:=        Block[{a, b},           {a, b} = prepareAB[x, y];           c = a + b        ]      Is this functionality available in workbench?
