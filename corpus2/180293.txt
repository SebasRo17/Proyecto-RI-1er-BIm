**Background**   I have a requirement where I need to remove a few nodes in a network based upon a command given by the user. To keep the nodes from transmitting or receiving data I thought of changing its IP address to some other address. Before I change the address I want to save the node's IP so that I can re- assign the original IP back to the node after the simulated network outage is over. My problem is how to efficiently save the nodes' IP addresses. Should I use a linked list or a hash table?
