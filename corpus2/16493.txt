It is easy to insert a Hyperlink to a notebook file, or to an internet address, in the middle of a text style cell (Ctrl+Shift+H or menu: Insert->hyperlink). Trying to create a hyperlink to a file extension different than a notebook (e.g. a PDF file), after waiting for a while, returns nothing (...should it return an error message?). Converting a hyperlink (e.g. for a website) into InputForm, Raw InputForm or FullForm doesn't reveal any secrets (returns a string). One needs to go to the cell expression level to see what makes it different. So, what is the best way of adding a "`SystemOpen` link" in the middle of a text paragraph?
