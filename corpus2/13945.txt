Some time ago I decided to outsource web development projects (php coding & design). I've opened small office abroad with manager and couple of programmers and designer. I just started but already have a problem controlling their work. Some programmers are fast, others work much slower. I pay them fixed salary, so it matters for me if they do their job on time. When they work from office, I at least have a person responsible for the project to tell if they really worked. But sometimes they work from home and in that case I have no way to know if they really spent that time working on some issue. Some of my ideas were: controlling amount of code done with svn, strict deadlines, everyday reporting.. But nothing seems perfect to me. It creates even more work from my side. Can anyone suggest a way of fair judgement on how much really time was spent on actual work? How to stimulate people to work? Maybe create some bonus system if work is done fast? Any idea/experience on this topic would be highly appreciated.
