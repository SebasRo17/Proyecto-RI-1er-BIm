I was trying to adapt the `BoxWhiskerChart` to obtain a minimalistic quartile plot, like this: ![Quartile plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/F1mF4.png) What I obtained is the plot below that is, however, unsatisfying; the median markers should be circles, but they are instead slightly squared. ![Quartile plot with wrong median markers](http://i.stack.imgur.com/G7n4K.png) The code:               data = Table[        RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[μ, 1], 100], {μ,          RandomInteger[{-2, 2}, 10]}];     filledCircle[size_] := Graphics[{Black, Disk[]}, ImageSize -> size];     BoxWhiskerChart[data,       {{"Whiskers", Black},        {"MedianMarker", filledCircle[10], Black},        {"Fences", None}},       ChartBaseStyle -> White,       Frame -> False,       Method -> {"BoxRange" -> (Quantile[#,              Range[0, 1, 1/4], {{1/2, 0}, {0, 1}}] &)}       ]      As an alternative, I've tried to rasterize the circles; the shape is now correct, but we get a lateral shift of the median marker.               filledCircle[size_] := Rasterize[Graphics[{Black, Disk[]}, ImageSize -> size]];      ![Quartile plot with shift](http://i.stack.imgur.com/T8F1p.png) Does anyone have a better approach or solution? Or should I just build my own function?
