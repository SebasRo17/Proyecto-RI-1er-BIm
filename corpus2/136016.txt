Our database does not have any audit functionality.   * It does not records who inserts the record or who who changes it   * It does not keep a history of the changes made   * Nothing can be restored if something goes wrong   * There are many other short comings for example the database does not have any data integrity, anything an be thrown in, no check on different fields, duplicates etc My question is, who's job it is to put this functionality in? An ASP Developer who knows basics of SQL and who interacts with the database regularly. Or an SQL Administrator who's sole job is to work with the databases, optimize it and maintain it? At this point we do not have an SQL Administrator, but can hire one. How big of an undertaking this should be for a developer to fix the above issues?
