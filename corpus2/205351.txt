I am aware of the floating point errors as I had gained some knowledge with my question asked here in SE Floating Point Errors. What I am finding it difficult to understand is, the output of the following program.                       double d1 = 0 + 1.123 + 2.456;             double d2 = 3.579;                  float f1 = 0f + 1.123f + 2.456f;             float f2 = 3.579f;                  long l1 = (long)(0 + 1.123 + 2.456);             long l2 = (long)3.579;                  System.out.println(d1==d2);  // Output = false;             System.out.println(f1==f2);  // Output = true;             System.out.println(l1==l2);  // Output = true;      > Why is the output " **false" for double** and **not for float** , even when > float is single precision 32 bit and double is double precision 64 bit. > Oracle docs Any help with this would be highly appreciated.
