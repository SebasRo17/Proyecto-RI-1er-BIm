I have a string variable. I want to obtain another string which contains the representation of the string variable content itself.               s = "a \n b"      I need to get a string containing the exact characters from above, including the escape character `\` and the `"`:               r = "\"a \\n b\""      Is there a function that can do that? The output should be similar to `repr("a \n b")` from Python: _This function makes an attempt to return a string that would yield an object with the same value when passed to`eval()`_
