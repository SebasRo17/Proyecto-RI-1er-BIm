I cannot find how to use relative paths in Mathematica. My directory structure is simple.               Import["G:\\Research\\Acc and Vel Runs\\5-24\\Mathematica\\Data\\250 \     Acc.xls"][[1]] // TableForm        That demonstrates the absolute path by using the insert path from the menus. I want this notebook to be portable. I want to give someone the "Mathematica" directory and I want them to be able to run the code. I don't want the paths to break because It will be run on a different machine. Basically I just want to use a relative path starting at the Mathematica level shown above.
