For example:               Grid[{{10!}, {5!}}, ItemSize -> Full, Frame -> All]      What's the real value of `Full`? How can I map the `Full` to a 2-d array? `{{1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ... }, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ... }}` Similarly there are some other values like `{Scaled[.3]}, Automatic`, If I can get the absolute values, then I can map them to the corresponding values in HTML files for example, weight height. Sometimes after rasterizing something to pictures, we can get the dimensions of the images. The tricky here is after exporting `Grid` content to HTML files(render as text), the `ItemSize` information is lost? One background: my old question about ItemSize output in HTML files (Is there any other easy ways?) I've wrote one mapping function, This is the effect web page, however I cannot find the NB files after one time I re-installed OS... so...I need re-think the problem.
