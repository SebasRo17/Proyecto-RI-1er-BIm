So 4 times a year we have an innovation week (to even out the odd sprint releases). This whole week is dedicated to experimenting with new technology/ideas that could potentially help progress the software department or the company as a whole, and serve as sort of a starting point for new ideas and brainstorming. For example, the last one contained a lot of projects. One was the re-design of our web app into more of a Web 2.0 look and feel using JQuery and a lot of cool CSS tricks. Another was a proposal for a new bug tracking software as opposed to the clearly outdated one we use, and another was a very cool JQuery/Js design that could show the same page to multiple users on different computers and allow each of them to take "charge" of the page, disabling the other one from doing anything, and vice versa, seeing all updates in real time -- sort of like Netmeeting through Js. Well, this is my first one as a new employee so I wanted to think of something cool. We get one week (anywhere from 40-60 hours or so), and we usually pair up or do this in groups of 3-4, depending on how many projects there are. Projects have to get approved but usually that doesn't prove to be too difficult. We are in the financial analysis software industry if the domain was leading you guys to think of anything helpful. I am primarily working on a web app in MVC 2 at the moment using a lot of JQuery and a C# backend. Do you guys have any idea of something that would be cool/beneficial/worth it?
