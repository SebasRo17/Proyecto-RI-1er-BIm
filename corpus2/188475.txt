I am new to C# development and wish to create a more responsive UI. In my preliminary research, I have seen two methods for achieving this:   1. Multi-threading in conjunction with the BackgroundWorker class.   2. The newer Async/Await modifiers.  Does newer mean better? What's the difference between the two methods? If I wish to create a new project, how do I choose which method to go with? EDIT: Maybe I should specify. I am creating a Windows Forms application, where all necessary data will be saved/loaded on the local disk. I will also be communicating with several USB devices.
