I'm looking for a tool to do system wide dependency analysis in C# code and SQL Server databases. It's looking like the only tool available that does this might be CAST (CAST software), which is expensive and it does **lots** more besides that I don't really need. C# code through to database column dependency would be hugely useful for many reasons, including: \- determining effects of database changes throughout the system \- seeing hot spots in the database schema \- finding dead stored procedures, tables, etc. \- understanding the existing code base Do such tools exist?
