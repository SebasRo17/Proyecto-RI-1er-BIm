I am trying to write a function which creates a `Grid` which has no value in the starting and when some value is passed to it, it should show that value in that `Grid` dynamically. But it is not changing it dynamically. The two user defined functions are               createGrid[rows_, column_] := (list = {};        For[i = 1, i <= rows,i++, (individualColumns = {};        For[j = 1, j <= column,j++, (Subscript[e,i, j]="";individualColumns = Append[individualColumns,Subscript[e,i, j]];)];      list = Append[list, individualColumns];)]; layoutGrid[list])      This createGrid function generates null values which is then passed to user defined function layoutGrid.                layoutGrid[list_] :=      Panel[Grid[list, Background -> LightBlue, Spacings -> {0, 0}, ItemSize -> {0, 0},   Alignment -> {Center, Center}],ImageSize -> {780, 480}, Background -> LightBlue]      I am calling the createGrid function by passing 20 rows and 20 columns as arguments.               Dynamic[createGrid[20,20]]      It creates the `Grid` having 20 rows and 20 columns having no value. In createGrid function, variable Subscript[e,i,j], i defines the row number and j defines the column number After building the empty `Grid`,when I am assigning some value to Subscript[e,1,2] like               Subscript[e,1,2]=10;      It does not show in the `Grid` dynamically. Why?
