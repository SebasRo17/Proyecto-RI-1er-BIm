Most examples of using assertions that I find seem to be about dealing with _runtime errors_ , such as out of memory conditions. That's not what I'm after. One good example of using assertions to detect bugs is the following excerpt from the Wikipedia article about assertions:               int total = countNumberOfUsers();     if (total % 2 == 0) {         // total is even     } else {         // total is odd and non-negative         assert(total % 2 == 1);     }      Here, the programmer erroneously assumed that `i % 2` can only have two distinct values, and the assert will catch that bug. What other good examples of using assertions to detect bugs are there?
