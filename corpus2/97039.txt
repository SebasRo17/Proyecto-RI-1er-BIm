I've just started getting to grips with event driven programming and I'm finding delegates and events to be very useful. Since starting to see the potential I've began using them all the time to solve problems such as updating displays between controls and calling stored procedures following updates etc. I'm starting to use them so frequently that I'm creating and subscribing to events more than I'm actually calling methods manually within the code. Are there any rules to follow in order to know when an event should be used or just a plain old simple function call? Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks
