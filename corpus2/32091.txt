I have a `list` of points (e.g. `{1.2,0.4}`) which I export to a file using               Export[fileName, list];      I want to add a line before the end of file. For instance instead of ending the file with               1.236677 4.64567567     1.236677 4.64567567     1.236676 4.64567567      ending like               1.236677 4.64567567     1.236677 4.64567567     1.236676 4.64567567     # a blank line here      I tried appending `{}`, `{,}`, `""` to the list, but none of them added a blank line. I need this because xmgrace is not parsing the last line of the exported mathematica file: it expects a blank line before the End of File. * * * EDIT: As pointed out in the comments by Kuba and Pinguin Dirk, appending `""` works on Windows XP (and probably others.) I'm using OS X.
