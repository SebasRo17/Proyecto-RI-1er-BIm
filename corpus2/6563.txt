Is there a shortcut to inserting a `CounterBox` as you type in text mode? I haven't yet made extensive use of them but I can foresee them in my near future and the current method of inserting them is a little bit of a pain. Here is the current method: Start by opening a new notebook. Create a text cell with the following content: > The current counter of title is: XXX. Select the XXX and go to `Insert > Automatic Numbering...`. This will give you some options. For Counter leave it as it is (Title). And select "This counter object". After clicking OK now the XXX will be replaced by 0 since the current count for title cells is 0. If you now create a Title cell above the one you just created then that 0 will become a 1. I don't mind using the little GUI asking me what counter to insert. What I do not like is having to go to `Insert > Automatic Numbering...` all the time. I would actually prefer if possible to do some sort of input autoreplacement but this clearly would not work since we need to define what gets replaced. I thought about maybe using input alias but this again requires me to define the inputs. What I want to be able to do is something like this... > The current counter of title is [AliasDelimiter]ref[Title][AliasDelimiter] and get > The current counter of title is 0 I'm trying to emulate $\LaTeX$ here using ref. I don't know if I have explored this question enough but so far I'm running out of ideas to make the process of entering counterboxes as painless as possible. The last idea I had was to create a palette with an input box in which you entered the tag or counter but then I realized that even if this is possible (I highly doubt it is) it would then just be the same as the `Insert > Automatic Numbering...` gui. So the question again: Is there a some sort of shortcut to inserting a `CounterBox`?
