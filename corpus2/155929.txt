I want to use JTAPI (1.4 - latest) to create an app that will call my phone whenever I need it to. I downloaded JSR043 (JTAPI specification) and have been reading the API docs and it seems pretty straight forward with respect to _how to code JTAPI_. However I seriously doubt that getting a Java app on my laptop to call my cell phone doesn't require some 3rd party or middle man service provider and possibly other entities/configurations as well. So I ask: besides using the JTAPI in my Java code, what do I need to install or set up to have a Java app that calls my phone? Thanks in advance!
