I'm hoping to give a talk at RubyKaigi this year, and I'd like to know what makes a good talk proposal. RubyKaigi is a conference run by Ruby enthusiasts (as opposed to it being a trade conference, or an academic conference). The proposal form can be seen here. So far, my draft proposal about a program I'm working on mentions:   1. What the program is useful for and why it is relevant.   2. How it works.   3. What topics it touches upon (such as metaprogramming and testing) Is there anything that I should mention in my proposal? Also, how thorough should I be in my "Details of your talk" section? Should I be exhaustive, or only have a couple of short paragraphs?
