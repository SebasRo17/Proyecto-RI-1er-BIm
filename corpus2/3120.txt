How do you put corresponding values from different lists together according to some operation? E.g. I have three lists giving the velocity in the x, y and z direction respectively. I'd like create one list giving the 2-norm, $\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$. I would be able to do it procedurally by using for example MapIndexed on one of the lists toghether with Part, I suppose. But I'd like to know if there is a more elegant solution.
