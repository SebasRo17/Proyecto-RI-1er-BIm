I would like to export an arbitrary `Graphics3D` object as a text file containing:   * list of vertices    * vertex normals    * triangle faces `Export["foo.obj", g]`, `Export["foo.pov", g]`, and `Export["foo.stl", g]` are all unsatisfactory as they lack the `VertexNormal` data. I started writing my own exporter but it's getting a bit painful as it seems there is no easy way to convert `GraphicsComplex` object containing `Polygon`s of order greater than 3 and converting them to triangles without recreating a triangle tessellation from scratch. Has anyone done this before and would like to share their code? Or is there an undocumented function I could use? Here is an example `Graphics3D`:               g = RegionPlot3D[(x^2 + y^4 + z^4) - (x^3 + y^2 + z) > 1/2, {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1}, {z, -1, 1}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/kOtLQ.png)
