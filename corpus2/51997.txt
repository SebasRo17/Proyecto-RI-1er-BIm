I'm not sure of what type of problem my issue falls into, so I haven't been able to search forums with any success. If this has already been solved then my apologies! Essentially I'm trying to set a list equal to a calculated value then call that list back.               -15*0.1 + 6*0.1          (* -0.9 *)          -15*0.1 + 6*0.1 == -0.9          (* True *)          a[-15*0.1 + 6*0.1] = 5          (* 5 *)          a[-0.9]          (* a[-0.9] *)          a[-0.8999999999999999`]          (* 5 *)      I've reset _Mathematica_ 9.0.1.0 according to this guide http://support.wolfram.com/kb/3274 to no avail.
