On my current project we're using Jenkins to monitor our builds. Now they want me to write a Jenkins plugin to add some more monitoring parameters. I've taken a look at how the status monitor plugin works, and I can't figure some things out. I've tried to look for documentation for writing a plugin, but that seems to be sorely lacking. (the site only mentions how to generate the base project, and refers to a tutorial that's not that informative) What I'm trying to do is just add some options to each build, add a link, and a monitoring page. Adding to the main page is apparently done by adding the action, but I'm still trying to figure out the rest. And how it all ties in. Does anyone have any pointers, or a place where I can find some decent documentation?
