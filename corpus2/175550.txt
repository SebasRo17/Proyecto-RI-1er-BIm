I am given a set of sets:               {{a,b}, {a,b,c}, {a,c}, {a,c,f}}      I would like to have a data structure to index those sets such that the following "lookup" is executed fast: find all supersets of a given set. For example, given the set {a,c} the structure would return               {{a,b,c}, {a,c,f}, {a,c}}      but not {a,b}. Any suggestions? Could this be done with a smart trie-like data structure storing sets after a proper sorting? This data structures is going to be queried a lot. Thus, I'm searching for a structure that might be expensive in build but rather fast to query. UPDATE: I have finally used a prefix Trie as described in the paper "A New Method to Index and Query Sets", by Jorg Hoffmann and Jana Koehler.
