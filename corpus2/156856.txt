I am using cppcms to create a blog like application and I'm trying to write a permission system, although I'm confused as to what would be the most efficient and manageable method. At the moment, I have a table with permission id, user id, permission type (int) and permission value (an optional parameter, of sorts). For each separate permission, a row must be added. Which method would you recommend? If you want any clarification or extra information, feel free to ask.
