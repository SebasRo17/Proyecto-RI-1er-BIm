I've been working on a .NET personal project for a little while now and it's almost ready to go open source. I've decided (arbitrarily) to host it on codeplex. Codeplex offers TFS or mercurial. I'm wondering which I should pick. Consider:   * I've only ever used subversion.   * I'm using VS 2010 express as my IDE.   * Tools must be free (so the mercurial client if I go that route).   * From what I've been hearing, mercurial sounds interesting but I know _very_ little about it so if there's a learning curve, then I don't want to add too many more learning objectives to the project.   * I don't expect any contributors. So I guess the actual question is, is mercurial easy enough to use with codeplex and does it add anything that the TFS option doesn't?
