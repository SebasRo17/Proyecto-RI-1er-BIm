When modeling a swap contract a common operation is to sum up two cash flows producing a resulting cashflow with netted amounts in the highest granularity of the two initial cash flows. What is a practical way to do this?               c1 = Cashflow[Annuity[-765.3, 4, 1/12]]; (*-monthly payments_*)          c2 = Cashflow[Annuity[2357.124, 4, 1/4]]; (*_-quarterly payments_*)          c3 = ? (*_-result is the netted cashflow in monthly granularity_*)      ![A fragment of result modeled with Numbers, with two cash flows in different granularity and the resulting with netted amounts.](http://i.stack.imgur.com/04JhL.jpg)
