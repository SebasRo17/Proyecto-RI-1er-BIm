Let there be a list,               Sample={{{1, 2, 3}, {a, b, c}}, {{2, 3, 4}, {d, f, g}}}      I want to go to individual sublists and do some operation on it.I tried a few things like rule and replace.               sam /. {x_, y_} -> {x -> {a_, b_} -> {a + b}, y /. {w_, e_} -> w^e}      but I get               {{{1, 2, 3}, {a, b, c}} -> {a_, b_} -> {a + b}, {{2, 3, 4}, {d, f, g}}}      But I am not getting to individual lists. I want to use only rule or replace. **Edit** : To make my question more clear I want to specify that I am not interested in one particular list operation. My idea is to be able to traverse sublists using `Rule` or `Replace` and then work on it. My expected result is like               {{{1 + a, 2 + b, 3 + c}}, {2^d, 3^f, 4^g}}
