I am trying to upload files to Azure Blob Storage and after successful upload adding the filename to a list for my further operation. When i am doing synchronous it works fine but when i am doing async the error occured. Error : Collection was modified; enumeration operation may not execute.               foreach(var file in files)     {        // .....        await blockBlob.UploadFromStreamAsync(fs);        listOfMovedLabelFiles.Add(fileName);     }     if (listOfMovedLabelFiles.Count > 0) // error point     {         // my code for further operation     }      Is there any way to wait till all the async operations get completed.
