I have code like this (pseudocode)               foreach(Box box in boxes)     {         if(boxFilter.PassesFilter(box))         {           // do something useful         }         else         {           Log.Log(format("Box %s was rejected", box.BoxId))         }     }      But now I'm thinking I'd like the log message to have more information such as "Box 1 rejected because too tall" or 'Box 549 rejected: 25" height exceeds Max height of 24"'. What's the best idiom to get this information into the log? Do I have to create a `FilterResult` object that is returned from the `PassesFilter` method? Or I guess I could also throw an exception and catch it and log it? Or something else? I happen to be using C++. **Update** In addition to logging I might want to also present a message to the user in the UI.
