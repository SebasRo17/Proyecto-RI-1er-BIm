If I had a tree, would "flatten" intuitively imply > get a list of all items in the tree, traversing from left to right? If i have a linked list, would "flatten" intuitively imply > get a list of all items, starting with this one For example, a linked list would be made up of an exception that aggregates its inner exception. Would it be fair to name a method on exception "flattenInnerExceptions" with expectation that it would return a sequence of exceptions, outermost exception first, and inner-most exception -- last?
