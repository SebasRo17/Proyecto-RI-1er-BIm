I am generating a number of graphics using _Mathematica_ that contain text. Adding the text to the graphic has been a considerable challenge, but I have finally come up with the following:               testg = Graphics[{Inset[        Graphics[Polygon[{{0, 0}, {10, 0}, {10, 10}, {0, 10}}],           ImageSize -> {90, 90}], {Left, Center}, {Left, Center}],         Inset[Graphics[          Inset[Cell[            TextData[{StyleBox["Text One\nText Two\n",                FontFamily -> "Arial", FontSize -> 30,                TextAlignment -> Left, LineSpacing -> {1, 0}],               StyleBox["Text Three", FontFamily -> "Arial", FontSize -> 12,                TextAlignment -> Left, LineSpacing -> {1, 0}]}]]],           ImageSize -> {125, 90}, ImageMargins -> 0, ImagePadding -> None,           AspectRatio -> Full], {Right, Center}, {Right, Center}]},        ImageSize -> {220, 90}, AspectRatio -> Full]      You will, no doubt, observe that the final graphic is produced by insetting the actual graphic (for demonstration purposes, I've made it just a rectangle) and then a cell with the text. I have had to size the rectangle to fit the text, and I have manually sized the text though trial and error. The composed image size is that of the two separate graphics with a bit of padding. My question is, how can I resize this graphic on export? I would like to create much higher resolution images for use in a print environment.               Export["test.png", testg]      Setting the ImageSize on the export works to change the size of the PNG, but does not scale up the two Inset graphics. I need a way of doing this. As I will be producing many, many images, I would like to do this within _Mathematica_. Any help will be appreciated. Alternative: I am actually **very** new to _Mathematica_ , so a I would also be interested in better approach than mine.
