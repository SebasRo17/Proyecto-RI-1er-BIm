I am trying to implement `SparseArray`, using the function `With` to give the condition for different matrix elements. I would need a function `f`, that instead of doing what `Mod` does,               Mod[{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, 3, 1]      > {1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3} I would like to have:               f[{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, 3, 1]      > {1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2} So that,               f[1,3,1]      > 1 and               f[4,3,1]      > 2 Does such a function `f` exist?
