Or maybe I did not understand the meaning of Resolution. This is the code I used -               SystemInformation["Devices", "ScreenInformation"]      I get 120 as my system resolution, and Full Screen Area as 1366x768 (~14" diagonal screen). I checked with two of my colleagues who have mathematica installed. The one with a ~15.4" diagonal screen got Resolution as 96 & Full Screen Area as 1366x768. This made sense, sort of, a bigger screen is lesser dense pixel-wise for the same pixel screen area. But when I checked with another ~14" diagonal screen laptop, mathematica returned Resolution as 96 & Full Screen Area as 1366x768. This doesn't make sense, two physically equivalent screens with same pixel area but different resolutions. So I cross-checked in these two websites - http://pediddle.net/dpi-ruler.html and http://concentriclivers.com/screen_density.html Both my laptop and the other 14" laptop got similar dpi's of 112, and the 15" laptop returned a dpi value of about 100. I did the math and these numbers fit it just well. So is Mathematica wrong here? Or am I barking up the wrong tree for the dpi value? I am new here, so thanks for any help extended, in advance!
