First of all, I know that reinvent the wheel is, _usually_ , a bad idea, but I want to write a PHP framework **to learn OOP in PHP and to understand MVC** in my free time. Said that, I have to do two webs with few and simple database interactions, the basic funcionality of the webs is to show information. I want to use my own framework in those webs, but I don't know where or when to start. Should I start doing the framework first and then the webs? or should I start doing one web, then the framework and then the other web?
