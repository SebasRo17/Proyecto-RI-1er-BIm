Conceptually a "pointer" is just something that "points" to something else;Is this definition is sufficient to tell exactly what a pointer is in programing languages? Does it need to have any other features? Programmers who come from specific language may have pre-conceived ideas of what constitutes a 'pointer' based on how it is used in the language So let say if he is from **c/c++** language, he say's pointers supports pointer arithmetic.Is pointer arithmetic an essential feature of a pointer? **Go** has pointers and does not support pointer arithmetic. Is the ability to "dereference" the pointer essential to the concept of a pointer? So what is the precise definition of a pointer that I can give as an answer, irrespective of any specific programming language?
