> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  What should a developer know before building a public web site? I have been working in telecommunication companies for more than 3 years, and now I want to try to become a web developer. I use C++ for a long time, and it is my most familiar language, and the platform is Unix or Linux. Because of my programming skills, I tried to apply several positions like C/C++ software engineers which I think require this kind of knowledge. But I failed for all the positions. A majority of the positions I applied really need was C language skills other than C++. And all need strong knowledge about the data structure and algorithm which is a filed that I am not good at. After several trials, I realized that there was a problem. What I am good at is at something like C++, Object Orientated design, and the analysis ability, which is a little high level thing. But the positions I applied require C, algorithm which were a little low level. So is there some positions in web which are suitable for my programming skills? or How many things I need to learn to become a web developer based my programming skills? Thanks.
