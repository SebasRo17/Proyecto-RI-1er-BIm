Using `DistributionChart`, you can choose among several styles aka `ChartElementFunction`:               ChartElementData["DistributionChart"]          {"Density", "DensityQuantile", "FadingQuantile",      "GlassQuantile", "HistogramDensity", "LineDensity", "PointDensity",       "Quantile", "SmoothDensity"}      Is there a way to control their parameters? The documentation does not seem to say. * * * The problem is that the defaults are less than optimal for my data. Consider these: Using `SmoothDensity`: ![SmoothDensity](http://i.stack.imgur.com/VpyTN.png) Using `HistogramDensity`: ![HistogramDensity](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZdRmQ.png) Using `LineDensity`: ![<code>LineDensity</code>](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xPq13.png) Clearly, `SmoothDensity` grossly misrepresents the data (just compare with the `LineDensity` version); the violins should all look like the ones for 2 and 9. `HistogramDensity` does a better job but its resolution is horrible; there are 100 data points per size, about 70 of which fall into the upper class -- that should be plenty of points to draw more bars. I would like to tell `HistogramDensity` to use more/smaller bins, and/or `SmoothDensity` to smooth less. How is this possible?
