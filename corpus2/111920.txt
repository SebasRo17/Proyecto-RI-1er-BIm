Consider the formal definition: > f(n) = O(g(n)) Why is it not: > f(n) = O(f(n)) or > f(n) = O(c*f(n)) since for the Big O analysis, `f(n)=2n` and `g(n)=n` are identical? I am confused by the function `f(n)` using another function. * * * ### Update Why isn' t the definition as follows: > f(n) <= c*abs(g(n)) What does the formal `O(g(x))` add to the definition? It seems like it overcomplicates things.
