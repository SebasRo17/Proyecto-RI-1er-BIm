I have done a huge ton of reading up on Simplex Noise now, and after a lot of confusion and headaches I think I am able to form an idea of how Simplex Noise works now. Am I right, that simplex noise (2D) is just a grid build of Simplexes, in this case triangles, where at every corner of a triangle there is a value between 0 and 1. When you ask the algorithm for a point it'll convert the 2D coordinates to the simplex grid coordinates, interpolate the noise and then return the actual value?
