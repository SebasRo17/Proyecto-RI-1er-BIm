I have my ideas, but I always feel that I'm overly pessimistic. So I'd like to hear more opinions. How much time do you need to start coding using a new framework so that your code is production ready and not become a support nightmare later on for: Say large scale frameworks:               ATL/MFC/STL/WTL/.NET/COM/BOOST      And small scale frameworks/APIs:               MSXML/Silverlight/ADO/LIBXML/WIN32/OpenGL/DirectX/CUDA      What are your estimates for both types, [from;to] for both senior/junior developers. Any ideas on what can decrease the learning time say: `Book>API doc`, or `Tutorials>Book`
