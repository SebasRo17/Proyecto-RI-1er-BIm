I have a conceptual question about 'translating' between objects I have stored in Django (in Postgres) that I want to use on the front-end. So I have a user object in Python that holds basic things: an id, a username, a password. Let's say I want to output all of that information using Javascript on the client side. Can I just give JS a python object and it will make it into a JS object? I know JS is known for being 'fast and loose' with typing but that just seems absurd! I'm not looking for syntax, but just an overview of how this would work. Can I put Python objects in AJAX requests, then translate them client side, or is this going to be a basic break-down-things-on-server-side, ship them off, and recombine them on the client side type of thing?
