Learning Django MVC and the way I thought of it is: **Models** are the database tables represented in Django as Python classes.   **Views** are the HTML returned from function in views.py.   **Controllers** are the actual functions themselves in views.py invoked from a HTTP request. However I read on Wikipedia (at the time of writing): > ... a regular-expression-based URL dispatcher ("Controller"). I would have thought the mapping of URLs to functions as routing - not the controller. But perhaps I am wrong - I guess I got my ideas because is ASP MVC the functions that handle the requests are contained in classes called Contollers...
