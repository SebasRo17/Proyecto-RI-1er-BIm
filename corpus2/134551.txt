I'm going to write a class library for .NET which provide an implementation of arbitrary precision arithmetic for integer, rational and maybe complex numbers. What best known approaches should I become familiar with? I tried to start with Knuth's TAOCP Vol.2 (Seminumerical Algorithms, Chapter 4 â€“ Arithmetic) but it's too complicated. At least I couldn't get the ideas in a relatively short period of time.
