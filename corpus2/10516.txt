I'm trying to obtain the form of a sinc function that I know I'm supposed to get in _Mathematica_. I'm doing this because I intend to do a lot with Fourier transforms (FT) and I'd like to know I'm not missing constants or something of the like. For example, consider: $$ f(x) = \begin{cases} A && -\frac{a}{2} ≤ x ≤ \frac{a}{2}\\\ 0 && \text{otherwise}\\\ \end{cases}$$ Employing the following:               FourierTransform[UnitStep[a/2 + x] UnitStep[a/2 - x], x, k, FourierParameters -> {1, -1}]      It gives: `(2 Sin[(a k)/2] UnitStep[a])/k` Is this _Mathematica_ 's way of giving the sinc function? I guess I was expecting something more like `(2 Sin[(a k)/2])/(k a)`. I know there are different parameters that can be used, but none of them have given the form I was expecting. When I try to do the FT directly as an integral:               Integrate[A Exp[-I k x], {k, -a/2, a/2}]      It gives: `(2 A Sin[(a x)/2])/x` Are these the same? I was expecting something that would lead to $\rm{sinc}[k a/2]$. I have not found previous questions that can help, and the documentation in _Mathematica_ (version 8) also has not helped either.
