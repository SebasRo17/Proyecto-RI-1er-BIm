I am in a position where I have been asked to review some code that fixes a problem that I don't believe exists. The fixer, who is more senior than me, insists his fix is necessary but it appears to be no more than C++ sophistry to me. Part of our deployment process is a code review, and as the 2nd highest engineer in a small company I am expected to review changes. I believe that reviewers are just as responsible for code changes as the original coder, and I am unwilling to accept responsibility for this change. How would you go about rejecting this review?
