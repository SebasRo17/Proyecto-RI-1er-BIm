I'm having problems exporting a table of complex numbers. I have:               tablevalues=Table[M[a,b],{b,1,101},{a,-500+5*(b-1),500+5*(b-1),5}];     Export["trial.dat",tablevalues,"Table"];      But then when I try to import the data using:               Data=Import["trial.dat","Table"];      I find that the `Table` has changed (later commands in my code no longer work, despite the fact that they do work if I use `tablevalues` directly). Any help would be really appreciated, thanks! More info: the code for M is:               M[a_, b_] := l1[a, b] + l2[a, b] -l3[a, b];      where `l1`, `l2` and `l3` are calculated for different a and b (the full expressions are quite long).
