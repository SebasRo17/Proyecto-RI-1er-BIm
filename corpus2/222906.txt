I am an average coder in my eyes but a good developer, in the past year I've felt that my technical knowledge of our products design is being questioned by our senior developers/architects, is this normal? should I focus more on the technical nitty gritty and design? I've been working with the same team and much the same project for the past 7 yrs, in the last 4 I was appointed manager/scrummaster. I spend 30% of my time managing the project tasks and quality, the rest I spend bug fixing, I usually leave the design tasks to our architect. Should I focus more on the design of the product? it does feel like I would gain more respect if I had the architects knowledge, however I doubt if this is even achievable in the long run. Is this a general issue for developers with all architects? And should senior developers be outstanding coders?
