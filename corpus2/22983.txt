I've been developing for a while now and I'm a little bit bored of the tiny details of software development. I would like to be less technical and more focused on the bigger picture, like take more of a system wide approach from a business perspective. Therefore, I'm thinking I might become a business analysts. But so far, I can't seem to determine what a business analyst does that a developer can't do. I know they're supposed to know more about the business rules and how a user uses the system but as a developer, I feel you have to know that anyway. I mean, I've trained new BAs up when they've first started on how the system is used. I'm also good with people, and can write pretty well. So I'm happy to do that, but surely there's much more to the job right? It's just weird because BAs in my area seem to get paid a lot more than developers - what are the skill sets I'm missing as a developer that I need as a BA?
