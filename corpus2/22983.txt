I am trying to solve a PDE that needs to be scaled constantly (refer to this). @andre suggests I modify `NDSolve`StateData`. Now, the problem is, I'm not used to the object-oriented side of _Mathematica_ , and I cannot find any useful materials on _Mathematica_ 's "object". For example, to extract the intermediate values I can use `ndssdata@"SolutionVector"["Forward"]`. I don't even know if `ndssdata@"SolutionVector"["Forward"]` is a method or an variable. Assignment like `ndssdata@"SolutionVector"["Forward"]= 2 ndssdata@"SolutionVector"["Forward"]` does not work, i.e. `ndssdata@"SolutionVector"["Forward"]` is not changed after the assignment. Question in short: how to modify the actual data in `NDSolve`StateData`? Optional: Where can I find materials on complex _Mathematica_ objects like `NDSolve`StateData`?
