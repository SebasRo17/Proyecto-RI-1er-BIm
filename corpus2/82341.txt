I work at a large company, and we are stuck with a crappy home-baked bug tracking tool, which does too many things half-decently, but it search functionality is next-to-impossible to use (has about 80 fields that one has to / can fill out) and the search needs to be precise. We have many duplicate bugs filed that are never consolidated, plus pulling up all bugs filed against some product in some version just will not be easy AT ALL. Getting rid of the current system is a political and strategical impossibility. Hundreds of people are tied into it. What I am hoping to do it iterate over bugs 1 through however many (there is a way, I believe) and then save the resulting HTML pages named 'bug000001.html', 'bug000002.html', etc. After that I would want some sort of Google-Style full text indexing going. What we have is so bad, that doing this would be worthwhile. Bugs do not change that much over time, so I am not that worried about being out-of-sync with the original - it will not be great. So, my question is: suppose I have downloaded the html files in the same folder. What free and open source tool can I use then that would allow fuzzy search on the content? I realize that I can concoct a specific regex every time I search that would probably do the task, but I would like to make this even easier, where mis-spellings do not hurt. I realize that Google's full power of personalized, history-based search will probably not be accessible to me, but I will gladly settle for something close, that is free and easy to use. If you have suggestions for a good free and open source tool/Python library that I can use to automate simple browser actions, such as entering text into a textbox, clicking the button and then saving the content into an HTML file, then please list that as well, although that probably should be a separate question. **EDIT** I do not have access to the source code for PhP front end or back end; this is all locked away by socialists on another continent.
