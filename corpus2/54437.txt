I wish to have a few plots on the same graph: ListLogLogPlot, LogLogPlot and a ParametricPlot drawing lines perpendicular to the x-axis. The problem is however that ParametricPlot doesn't seem to have the LogLog equivalent, as the other Plot functions do, and Show does not combine non-LogLog plots with LogLog plots, even when they coincide, eg.:               Show[LogLogPlot[x^4, {x,10^(-10),10^10}], Plot[x^5, {x,10^(-10),10^10}]]      should theoretically show two straight lines, but shows only one. Is there a way to combine such graphics without resolving to using non-LogLog plots?
