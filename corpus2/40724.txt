To specify an array of length `L` in Mathematica, where each entry is `someElement`, I'm accustomed to writing:               exArray=Array[someElement &, L];      However, let's say that I want to (quickly) generate an array of length `L` where there are `n` copies of `elementOne` and `L- n` copies of `elementTwo`. Maybe `elementOne` is the string character `A` and `elementTwo` is the string character `B`. I'd like to be able to position the two elements in two different ways: (1) where the first `n` elements are all `elementOne` and the remaining elements are all `elementTwo`, and (2) where we have a uniform random sample from the set of all possible arrays where there are `n` copies of `elementOne` and `L - n` copies of `elementTwo`. Are there simple "one-liners" to do (1) + (2)?
