I am trying to create Plot3D with same color as we used to get in V9 but without success. I used `PlotTheme -> "Classic"` in V10 but the results looks like somehow not the same as V9. I have also copied the FullForm between V9 and V10 and again the plots are different. does anyone know the reason behind this?
