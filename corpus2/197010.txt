It seems to me that `instanceof` comes from the land of functional programming and is a watered down version of _pattern matching_ and that the OO altenative to it should be dynamic dispatching. In OO languages (think Ruby), is there any situation where `instanceof` is the only solution? I can't think of any myself, especially in Ruby where you can patch any class with any methods you like.
