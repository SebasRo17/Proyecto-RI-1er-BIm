I encountered a really strange problem with `BarLegend`. Say you have a user- defined color function:               cf[z_]:=RGBColor[RandomReal[z, 3]]      When you want to use it in `BarLegend` as below:               BarLegend[{cf, {1, 10}}]      Mathematica will generate a blank bar shown as below: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dy1pX.jpg) However, after I change the function head in `BarLegend` to a pure function:               BarLegend[{cf[#]&, {1, 10}}]      Mathematica can give desired result. I cannot figure out why Mathematica doesn't accept user-defined color function. Could anyone please give a clue?
