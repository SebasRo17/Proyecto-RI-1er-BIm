I'm a scientific person needing to document complex Matlab code to hand to a developer for him/her to understand and program in a different language. In the past, I've used MS Word (explaining each program step as a new row in a table), and then Excel, but didn't find either particularly well suited to displaying my Matlab code and entering comments in a clear and concise way to document it. I'm wondering if there's any better technique to communicate pseudo-code to a developer. Any existing software (free?) or other platform (e.g. TextWrangler) particularly suited to providing code and some method for explaining it? Hoping to learn from others' experiences doing the same thing. Thanks in advance. After reading some comments, let me try to explain more... I assume all developers know pseudo-code, but I don't assume many know Matlab code. Thus, if I write in pseudo-code, I can ignore the Matlab code (or provide it for reference, etc.). But my question is really simpler... is there any software or platform people have used in the past to clearly communicate code to a developer? Something that enables the person creating the document to easily describe the code? For example, you can embed code that the software color codes (one color for comments, another for reserved words (if, then, else, for, etc.), etc.), and along one side there's room for me to enter explanations and references, etc. I tried do this using MS products, but thought since there's an industry of people needing to do the same thing, maybe someone has developed a system to make this easier.
