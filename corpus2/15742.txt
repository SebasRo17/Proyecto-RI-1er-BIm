From my experience in the current working environment, one's professional development is definitely in the hands of the individual. As I see it there are several routes to the same objective based on cost, time and availability   1. External Offsite training Online   2. Training providers (itunes U,Pluralsight etc)    3. Books    4. Specialist /user groups    5. Specialist web sites (Channel9, stackoverflow,dnrtv,codeplex etc) What would you consider to be the best approach (blend) to continued learning and maintaining a professional standard of work?
