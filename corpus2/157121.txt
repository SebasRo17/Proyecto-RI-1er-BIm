For my next project, I'm looking to document my Object Oriented design in simple text before jumping the gun to code it up. I want to do this for two reasons.   1. I want to give proper thought to my design and possibly revise it several times.   2. I haven't exactly decided which language I want to implement my project in. I'm looking for a convention to outline my design in simple text, instead of a UML diagram. I like the convenience of text. I can version control it and easily put in a blog or wiki to share it. I am thinking something concise e.g. how you might code in Python. However, I want the representation to be language independent. I've looked around the internet but couldn't find anything. The closest would probably be how properties and methods are defined in the box representing a class in a UML Model. **Update:** I just wanted to clarify "in Text". My goal is to be able to outline the object model in a github wiki. I imagine it being kind of an open source design in addition to code. Thus, I can create a Wiki page per entity and identify the relationships using links and formatting etc. However, what I wanted suggestions on was how to outline the specification of an entity on its page.
