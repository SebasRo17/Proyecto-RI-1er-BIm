I've dig the database here and didn't found any answer for my question. What is a standard for a php programmer to know? I mean, literally, what group of language functions, mechanisms, variables should person know to consider oneself a (good) php programmer? (I know 'being good' is beyond language syntax, still I'm considering syntax of plain php only) To give an example what I mean:   * functions to control http sessions, cookies   * functions to control connection with databases   * functions to control file handling   * functions to control xml etc.. I omit phrases like 'security' or 'patterns' or 'framework' intentionally as it applies to every programming language. Hope I made myself clear, any input appreciated :) **EDIT 1:** > **Note:** > > Michael J.V. is right claiming that databases are independent from language, > so to put my question more precisely and emphasise differences: > > Practises or security, are some ideas to implement (there is no 'Pattern' > object with 'Decorator()' method, is there?) while using databases means > knowing a mysqli and a set of its methods. **EDIT 2:** It all came to me after some interview task: > Count seconds, days, months, years elapsed since date input till now. So I had opened the php docs to check date functions. After I had done tasks the interviewer told me he wasn't satisfied with my actions since datetime() is something everyone should know. That's why I'm asking all this. What everybody should know..
