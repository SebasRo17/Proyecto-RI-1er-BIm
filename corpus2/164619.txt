I am currently writing my Master's Thesis on maintainability of a web application. I found some methods like the "Maintainability Index" by Coleman et.al. or the "Software Maintainability Index" by Muthanna et.al. For both of them one needs to calculate the cyclomatic complexity. So my question is: Is it possible to measure the cyclomatic complexity of a web application? In my opinion there are three parts to a web application:   1. Server code (PHP, C#, Python, Perl, etc.)   2. Client code (JavaScript)   3. HTML (links and forms as operators, GET-parameters and form fields as operands!?) What do you think? Is there another point of view on the complexity of web application? Did I miss something?
