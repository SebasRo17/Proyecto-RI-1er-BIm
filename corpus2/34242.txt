I'm trying to get an algorithm that generates a picture like this ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vfrVr.png) So far I've tried a little something with the help of the knowledge center, getting a graphics grid of squares already. But what now? I'm completely in the dark on how to trim it in the circle-shape I want. (If there are better solutions out there, please forget what I have started with. My only goal is to get the end result where I can make a pattern like this with variable size in terms of diameter in squares, size of the squares themselves and spacing in between.)               size = 10;     scalesize = 1;     table1 = Table[Graphics[Rectangle[]], {size}, {size}];          GraphicsGrid[table1, Frame -> None, Spacings -> Scaled[scalesize]]
