I'm interviewing for a position at an internet startup. The position relates to doing data mining on their very large database of user information. As part of the (long-distance) interview procedure which involves examining a subset of their database, they requested that I submit the code I used for analysis. My main concern is that this code is "proprietary", for lack of a better word. I have no problems giving them all my code if I end up working for them, but considering that they could potentially take the code, not hire me, and use it on their larger database to generate revenue, I'm hesitant. Am I being just being paranoid? Is this a legitimate concern?
