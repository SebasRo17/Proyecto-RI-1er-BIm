I've spent the last year as a one-man team developing a rich-client application (35,000+ LoC, for what it's worth). It's currently stable and in production. However, I know that my skills were rusty at the beginning of the project, so without a doubt there are major issues in the code. At this point, most of the issues are in architecture, structure, and interactions -- the easy problems, even architecture/design problems, have already been weeded out. Unfortunately, I've spent so much time with this project that I'm having a hard time thinking outside of it -- approaching it from a new perspective to see the flaws deeply buried or inherent in the design. **How do I step outside my head and outside my code so I can get a fresh look and make it better?** Is this a smaller issue than I think it is, or is this a problem experienced by others as well?
