In a **`git`** environment, where we have modularized most projects, we're facing the _one project per repository_ or _multiple projects per repository_ design issue. Let's consider a modularized project:               myProject/        +-- gui        +-- core        +-- api        +-- implA        +-- implB      Today we're having _one project per repository_. It gives freedom to   * `release` individual components   * `tag` individual components But it's also cumbersome to **`branch`** components as often branching `api` requires equivalent branches in `core`, and perhaps other components. Given we want to `release` individual components can we still get the similar flexibility by utilizing a _multiple projects per repository_ design. What experiences are there and how/why did you address these issues?
