This might be a stupid question but I've never created a class library before The reason I don't want to be connecting to a database through the class library is error handling.. should I just leave the errors to throw back to whatever code is using the class library? should I handle it there? or should I just leave it completely and take the whole database object out of the library, creating it seperately/ copying and pasting every time I want to use it. This is a small project with only 12 classes, all under 200 lines and is only going to be used on in house company applications. I'm probably going to be the only one using it to develop with unless I leave and someone needs to make changes to the applications. It's c# if that makes even the slightest difference?
