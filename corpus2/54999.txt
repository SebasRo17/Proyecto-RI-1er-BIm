I work in an outsourcing company in Russia, and one of our clients is a financial company located in USA.   For the last six months I have been working on several projects for this particular company, and as I was being assigned a larger project, **I was invited to work onsite in USA in order to understand and learn the new system**. Things didn't work out as well as I hoped because the environment was messy after original developers, and I had to spent quite some time to understand the quirks. However we managed to do the release several days ago, and it looks like everything's going pretty smooth. From technical perspective, my client seems to be happy with me. My solutions seem to work, and I always try to add some spark of creativity to what I do. However I'm very disorganized in a certain sense, as I believe many of you fellas are. Let me note that my current job is my first job ever, and I was lucky enough to get a job with flexible schedule, meaning I can come in and out of the office whenever I want as long as I have 40 hours a week filled. Sometimes I want to hang out with friends in the evening, and days after that I like to have a good sleep in the morning—this is why flexible schedule (or lack of one) is ideal fit for me. [I just realized this paragraph looks too serious, I should've decorated it with some UNICORNS!] Of course, after coming to the USA, things changed. This is not some software company with special treatment for the nerdy ones. Here you have to get up at 7:30 AM to get to the office by 9 AM and then sit through till 5 PM. Personally, I _hate_ waking up in the morning, not to say my productivity begins to climb no sooner than at 5 o'clock, i.e. **I'm very slow until I have to go** , which is ironic. Sometimes I even stay for more than 8 hours just to finish my current stuff without interruptions. Anyway, I could deal with that. After all, **_they are paying for my trip, who am I to complain?** They need me to be in their working hours to be able to discuss stuff._ It makes perfect sense that fixed schedule doesn't make any sense for me. But it _does_ makes sense that it does make sense for my client. And _I_ am here _for client_ , therefore sense is transferred. Awww, you got it. I was asked several times to come exactly at 9 AM but out of laziness and arrogance I didn't take these requests seriously enough. This paid off in the end— **on my last day I woke up 10 minutes before final status meeting with business owner, having overslept previous day as well**. Of course this made several people mad, including my client, as I ignored his direct request to come in time for two days in the row, including my final day. Of course, I didn't do it deliberately but certainly I could've ensured that I have at least two alarms to wake me up, et cetera...I didn't do that. He also emailed my boss, calling my behavior **ridiculous and embarrassing for my company and saying “he's not happy with my professionalism at all”**. My boss told me that “the system must work both in and out” and suggested me to stay till late night this day working in a berserker mode, fixing as many issues as possible, and sending a status email to my client. So I did, but I didn't receive the response yet. These are my questions to the great `programmers` community: > Did you have situations where your **ignorance and personal non-technical > faults created problems for your company**? > > Were you able to **make up for your fault** and **stay in a good > relationship** with your client or boss? How? > > How would you act **if you were in my situation**? * * *
