I am the only developer in my company. I do programming (in ASP.NET 4.0, jQuery and SQL Server 2008) and maintain the database and web server (win 2008 r2). I enjoy the freedom of implementing what I like at the same time I feel I could be doing everything in a bad way. I don’t use any SDLC diagrams not any kind of methods like Agile etc. I handle multiple small projects. I use my free time in keeping up with latest technologies and learning and testing new stuff. I have been doing this for the past 7 years.   1. My concern is how difficult will it be for me to adjust when I switch my job to a company wherein more developers are involved in a project?   2. Since I don’t follow any design pattern would it play against me when I look for job or get adjusted with new job?   3. Any other pros/cons you can think of?
