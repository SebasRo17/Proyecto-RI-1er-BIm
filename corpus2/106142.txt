I am reading through _Javascript: The Good Parts_ , and struggled to get my head around the section on _prototypes_. After a little google, I came to the conclusion that it is to add properties to objects _after_ the objects declaration. Using this script gleamed from w3schools, I noticed that removing the line adding the prototype property had **no effect**. So what is the point? * * *               //Prototyping          function employee(name,jobtitle,born)     {     this.name=name;     this.jobtitle=jobtitle;     this.born=born;     }          var fred=new employee("Fred Flintstone","Caveman",1970);     employee.prototype.salary=null; //  <---  try removing this line     fred.salary=20000;      document.write(fred.salary);
