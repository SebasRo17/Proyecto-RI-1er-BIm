I have a legacy C code on my hands, and I am given the task to filter dead/unused symbols and paths from it. Over the time there were many insertions and deletions, causing lots of unused symbols. I have identified many dead variables which were only being written to once or twice, but were never being read from. Both blackbox/whitebox/regression testing proved that dead code removal did not affected any procedures. (We have a comprehensive test-suite). But this removal was done only on a small part of code. Now I am looking for some way to automate this work. We rely on GCC to do the work. P.S. I'm interested in removing stuff like:   1. variables which are being read just for the sake of reading from them.   2. variables which are spread across multiple source files and only being written to. For example:               file1.c:     int i;          file2.c:     extern int i;     ....     i=x;
