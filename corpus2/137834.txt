I've been reading some of the horror stories about VSS recently, and it seems like a poor choice for anyone to continue to use. This is sort of a two-part question:   * Are there any objectively good reasons to use VSS?   * If not, should it be a dealbreaker for employment? I only have personal experience with one company presently using VSS (in my pre-developer days, so I didn't use it), and the culture there was extremely reactionary and adverse to change. I don't want to project my experience with this company on other organizations if there are legitimate reasons for using VSS these days, but I can't think of any reason other than being stuck in a rut that a place would use VSS 7+ years after support was dropped when it seems that there are relatively painless migration options.
