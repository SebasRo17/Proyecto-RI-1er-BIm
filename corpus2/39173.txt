How could I obtain the region of payments, with the parameters a,b,c,d between 0 and 1 and the sum of all equals 1? After the comment/recommendation of belisarius... I edit the original question and.... ask you a question in the last line of code.               P = {{a, b}, {c, d}}          A = {{2, -1}, {0, 1}}         B = {{-1, 1}, {2, -1}}          A[[1]].P[[1]] + A[[2]].P[[2]]          f1[a_, b_, c_, d_] = A[[1]].P[[1]] + A[[2]].P[[2]]     f2[a_, b_, c_, d_] = B[[1]].P[[1]] + B[[2]].P[[2]]          ParametricPlot[{f1[a, b, c, d], f2[a, b, c, d]}, {  a, 0, 1}, {b, 0,        1}, {c, 0, 1}, {d, 0, 1} ]      In the last line, How Can I code for consider only a,b,c,d in [0,1] with a+b+c+d=1 ? ItÂ´s similar to obatin all the convex combinations of the points (a(i,j),b(i,j))
