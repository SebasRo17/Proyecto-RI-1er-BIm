In what ways would people recommend a programmer communicate the need for newer, more up to date libraries to system administrators. At our organization the programmers often do many system administration tasks such as system updates, installation of software, management of software, recovery of specific systems after failures, etc. Programmers are currently limited by the age of some of the systems available and would like newer OSes and subsequently libraries available to them. What is a good way to communicate these desires to the SAs who are, in the end, in charge of deciding what OSes to install. Edited to simplify the whole question. Thanks.
