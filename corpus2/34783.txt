I have a long list of {date,value}. I would like to use DateListPlot to plot only a subrange, from date1 to date2, with the range on the y-axis automatically chosen to be between the min and max value between those two dates (i.e. trivial automatic zooming). I am sure Mathematic will do it with a simple option choice, but I must be dumb and cannot find it. Can you help? Thanks. PS: here is simple code to show the issue using financial data:               spx = FinancialData["SP500", All];          DateListPlot[spx,       PlotRange -> {{{1987, 10, 1}, {1987, 11, 30}}, Automatic},       PlotLegends -> Placed[namesFrom83, {Left, Bottom}],       PlotLabel -> "1987"]
