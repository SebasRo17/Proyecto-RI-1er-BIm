I have the following numbers               l={38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 38, 37, 37, 37, 37, 37, 37,     37, 36, 36, 36, 36, 36, 36, 36, 36, 36, 36, 36, 36, 36, 36, 36, 36,     35, 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, 33, 33, 33, 33, 33, 32, 31, 29, 29, 29, 28,     28, 28, 28, 27, 26, 25, 23, 21, 21, 16, 15, 15, 15, 11, 10, 6, 5, 4,     4, 4, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,     0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}      which look like an error function. I'd like to automatically find a fit for these numbers. I tried two different approaches               Fit[l, {Erf[x], 1}, x]      and               FindFit[l, a Erf[b x - c] + d, {a, b, c, d}, x]      Both produce completely off results. As I have a lot of data lists, I'd very much appreciate to automatically find the fits for these data.
