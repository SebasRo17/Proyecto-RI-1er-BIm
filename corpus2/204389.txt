I have multiple functions and a lot of code inside `$(document).ready(function())`. I am using jasmine to test the functions inside the ready function as well as the code inside `ready()` but when the test cases inside describe are executed it is not able to access the code inside the `ready` function.               $(document).ready(function () {         function testMe(){             testVar = true;         }     });      Jasmine test suite               describe("test suite", function(){         beforeEach(function () {             testme = false         });         it("Test Alert Box Message For Change Modal", function() {             expect(testme).toEqual(true);         });     });      Kindly suggest what approach needs to be taken for the above approach.
