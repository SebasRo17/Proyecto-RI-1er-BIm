Someone once said we should prefix all our methods with the `/// <summary>` comment blocks (C#) and I am wondering if that is true or not. I started to use them and found they annoyed me quite a bit, so stopped using them except for libraries and static methods. They're bulky and I'm always forgetting to update them. Do you recommend using them? Why? **EDIT** : I normally use `//` comments all the time, it's just the `/// <summary>` blocks I was wondering about
