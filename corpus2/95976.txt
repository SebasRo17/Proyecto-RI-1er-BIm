My team is using clear-case as the version control. The project which I am working is not started 7-8 years back. During the entire life time of the project we had several releases bug-fixes service packs etc. The issues are tracked using the bug tracking system and most of the people who work on the bug-fixes follows a routine of enclosing the comment in START/END block with the date, author, bug-id etc. I feel this is quite irrelevant and making the code cluttered and uneasy to maintain and these are the things which must be part of check-in comments/labels etc, where we can keep additional life cycle information of the work product. What's the best practice to be followed? Some of the reviewers of the code insist to out the comments about the bug and fixes to ease out their life. In my understanding they must review the files by mapping it to a view and get the change log of the branch and review it. It would be helpful if I can get some best practices on submitting the updated code for review.
