I have a `MyObject` which has an x and y coordinate. as far as I can see, I can store it in three ways:               class MyObject:         def __init__(self, x, y):             self.x = x             self.y = y          class MyObject:         def __init__(self, x, y):             self.position = [x, y]          class MyObject:         def __init__(self, x, y):             self.position = Coord(x,y) #Coord class created elsewhere      Is there a best practise either way for this ? Where I'm thinking this is relevant, is when passing these coordinates into other methods: eg.               myObj = MyObject(0,0)     searchLocation(myObj.x, myObj.y)     searchLocation2(myObj.position)
