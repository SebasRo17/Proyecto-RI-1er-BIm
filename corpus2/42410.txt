When I evaluate the following expression, ` {a -> "value1", b -> "value22"} /. {Rule[x_, y_] -> Rule[x, y]} ` I get `{a -> "value1", b -> "value2"}`, as expected. But when I evaluate the same expression with a `ToString[]` wrapper around a named pattern, it is no longer recognized as a named pattern: ` {a -> "value1", b -> "value2"} /. {Rule[x_, y_] -> Rule[x, ToString[y]]} ` Result: `{a -> y, b -> y}`. Why is `y` not replaced with the corresponding right-hand side values in replacement rules? How can I fix this?
