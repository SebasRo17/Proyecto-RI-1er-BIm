My MathKernel.exe resides in the following path: C:\Program Files\Wolfram Research\MathKernel.exe. I built a webMathematica application named "WebMathematica" and placed my entire application folder under the "Web-Apps" folder of Apache Geronimo. It's working fine. My Mathkernel was initialized using "mspConfiguration.xml" in the following way.               <KernelPool>       <KernelPoolName>General</KernelPoolName>         <KernelExecutable>C:\Program Files\Wolfram Research\MathKernel.exe</KernelExecutable>         <URLPattern>/*</URLPattern>     </KernelPool>      After this, I copied this entire folder and pasted it in I:\Projects. I opened the command prompt (cmd) and converted my application into a ".war" file. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/iKYjj.jpg) Finally, I got a WebMathematica.war file. I then deployed this file in Apache Geronimo. I started my application server, and here I observed that Mathkernel wasn't initialized, so my application was not working as well. The problem was the kernel path, the one that I list in the "MSPCOnfiguration.xml" file. I believe that once a`.war` file has been created, we can't access outside paths. My question is how to fix this. I never use any `IDE`.
