With the movie "Source Code" just coming out today, I have had to explain the meaning of the phrase to non-techies. Then I was asked _why_ source code is called source code and couldn't really answer. I know some of my coworkers seem to prefer referring to source code as "program text", or "program files" instead. "Program Text" makes much more sense to me than "source code", but most people seem to use the phrase "source code". Does anyone know the origins and etymology of the phrase "source code"?
