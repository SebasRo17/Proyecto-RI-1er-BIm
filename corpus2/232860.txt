The engineering team I am on has a very laid back approach to work hours. People come in at 6am and at 11am, and work until things are done when necessary. Engineers will routinely work very late, on weekends, etc as pressing issues arise (and deadlines loom). Recently, the company has decided to implement a "core business hours" initiative, which is fundamentally incompatible with the Engineering Team's "get it done" approach. What would be a good way to expose the nature of the hard work the team does to the rest of the company, in such a way that: a) It does not come off as self congratulatory bragging b) It does not encourage the development of a no work-life balance culture
