What is the proper way to write a C MathLink function that returns nothing at all? The following works, but I'm not sure if all this work is actually necessary: The template file:               :Begin:     :Function:      fun     :Pattern:       fun[]     :Arguments:     {}     :ArgumentTypes: {}     :ReturnType:    Manual     :End:      The C code:               void fun() {         MLPutSymbol(stdlink, "Null");     }      In short, here I set the return type to `Manual` and explicitly returned `Null`. Is this all necessary or is there a shorter way?
