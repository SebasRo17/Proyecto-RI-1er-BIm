Coming from Maple I do not understand how the precision for numerical computations in Mathematica is specified. I understand that there are various options to commands such as `WorkingPrecision` and `PrecisionGoal`. But I would like to use the same precision (above machine precision) for a number of computations including matrix operations and the `FindRoot` command outside and inside of routines. Also I would like to specify the precision of the output.
