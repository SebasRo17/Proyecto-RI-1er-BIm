Where is unsigned char used in C ( please tell about some real-world examples )? Why would we need both char and unsigned char? Char ranges from -127 to 128 ( 8-bit integer ) Unsigned Char ranges from 0 to 255 ( 8-bit integer ) If the purpose is to store ASCII, why would we need both? Another question. Consider this:               char a = 127;     unsigned char b = 255;      When I print it using std::cout. It gives me different characters. Can you explain why? ( I'm using Microsoft vs11 compiler )
