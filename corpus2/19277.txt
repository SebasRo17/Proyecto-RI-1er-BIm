Not sure if this has been asked, but I have a fairly simple operation that I don't know the syntax for. Say I have an array with some values, and a function f that accepts an arbitrary number of arguments. The following:               array = {e,f};     f[a, b, c, d, array];      ...is functionally equivalent to:               f[a, b, c, d, {e, f}];      OK, will Sequence help? Nope, this does the same thing:               f[a, b, c, d, Sequence@array];      Essentially, I want to include e and f into the list of arguments, i.e. I want to know the syntax for telling Mathematica I want it to evaluate this:               f[a, b, c, d, e, f];      How do I go about doing this?
