I was trying to find the sum of divisors of numbers upto 106. The test cases are like of the order of 105. I have done some pre processing like               int divisors(int num)     {         int sum=0;         for(int i=1; i*i<=num; i++)             sum += (num%i)? 0 : ((i*i==num)? i : i+num/i);         return sum;     }      Is there any better method to do the same. Should I also make an array of prime numbers or something like that?
