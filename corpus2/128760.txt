As a .NET/web developer, my daily works mainly involve with Visual Studio, FireBug, SQL Server,..., and I'm quite fluent at them. The problem is, my Office (Microsoft Office in particular, and office software in general) skills are bad. I _can_ use them, of course, but at basic level. I can write documents, create presentations, but I can just type/edit/delete in Excel, but any _advanced_ features. My question is: is it tolerance for a programmer, like me, to be bad at office software?
