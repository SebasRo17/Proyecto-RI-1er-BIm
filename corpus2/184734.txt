I am creating a site where people can write on a niche topic. It is almost like a blog, however the area as I mentioned is a small niche with (hopefully) passionate users. I want a functionality where once someone posts his article. People with similar experience can be notified, so that they can read about. Now my question is - how to determine similar articles? I know that tagging is a way - just like here in stackexchange and I will be implementing it. But suppose people do not tag, or tag incorrectly, the whole user experience will be hard to indulge in. Does anyone have any pointers on how to match up articles other than the tagging method?
