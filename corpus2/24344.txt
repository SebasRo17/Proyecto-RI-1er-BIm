I am confused by output of `Histogram` and `HistogramList` for probability density (`"PDF"`) when bin widths are not equal. According to this and this pages and other sources, density histograms are computed by dividing counts by bar widths and **total** number of observations. But `Histogram` obviously uses another algorithm as one can see from the following example:               SeedRandom[1];     data = RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[0, 1], 15];     HistogramList[data, {{-2, 0, 1}}, "PDF"][[2]]     BinCounts[data, {{-2, 0, 1}}]/((Length[data] - 3) Differences[{-2, 0, 1}])      > {1/6, 2/3} > > {1/6, 2/3} The outputs are identical when bin counts are divided by total number of observations **minus 3** in this case. Why is it? What algorithm `Histogram` uses for determining this difference (in other cases I got other numbers)? **An addition** Rod has answered the original question but there is another issue: if one gives upper bin boundary equal to the upper datapoint value then this value will be excluded from the histogram. It does not contradict the documentation where stated that `{{b1,b2,...}}` will `use the bins [b1,b2),[b2,b3),...`. Here is an illustration:               HistogramList[data, {{-2, 0, Max[data] - 10^-13}},         "PDF"][[2]] - HistogramList[data, {{-2, 0, Max[data]}}, "PDF"][[2]]     HistogramList[data, {{-2, 0, Max[data] + 10^-13}}, "PDF"][[2]] -       HistogramList[data, {{-2, 0, Max[data]}}, "PDF"][[2]]      > {0, 2.99205*10^-14} > > {-(1/105), 0.0123342} One can see that subtraction of `10^-13` does not alter the result significantly as expected but addition of `10^-13` changes it considerably because now the point `Max[data]` is included in the histogram. One can check this directly:               HistogramList[data, {{-2, 0, Max[data]}}, "PDF"][[2]]     BinCounts[data, {{-2, 0, Max[data]}}]/        Differences[{-2, 0, Max[data]}]/(Length[data] - 1)          HistogramList[data, {{-2, 0, Max[data] + 10^-13}}, "PDF"][[2]]     BinCounts[data, {{-2, 0, Max[data] + 10^-13}}]/        Differences[{-2, 0, Max[data]}]/Length[data]      > {1/7, 0.462531} > > {1/7, 0.462531} > > {2/15, 0.474865} > > {2/15, 0.474865}
