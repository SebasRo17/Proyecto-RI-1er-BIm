When a bug is fixed, the dev set its status to "resolved" and the bug is reassigned back to the person that created it. In our case this is usually the product owner - we don't have dedicated testers. But what's a good process for controlling how/when the PO tests the software? Should he be given the latest build after each bug is resolved/checked-in? Or what about every morning? Or should he only receive a build at (or close to) the end of the iteration, to include all of that iteration's new functionality and bug fixes? We are using TFS by the way.
