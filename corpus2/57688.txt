I have encountered two situations where _Mathematica_ 10 is mishandling the outer pixels of plainly simple objects. I input this:               Rasterize[Graphics[{}, Background -> Black, ImageSize -> {19, 19}]]      It should basically create a 19x19 pixel black square, but instead I get this: ![Extra white image](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8r9P2.png) If you select the image you will see an extra white pixel row on the top. Indeed, this is because the `ImageDimensions[%]` gives `{19, 20}`. A similar problem occurs with some other pixel sizes. * * * A similar effect takes place in barlegends:               GraphicsRow[{BarLegend[{"DeepSeaColors", {0, 1}}], BarLegend[{"DeepSeaColors", {0, 1}},        LegendLayout -> "ReversedColumn"]}]      These are two bar legends going from 0 to 1, but the second one is reversed. The images look like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/i5ymQ.png) Here, the regular bar legend is okay, but the reversed one misses a thin grey line on one side. **Questions** : Is it a bug? Does is happen only on my machine (Ubuntu 14)? Is it fixable (especially for the Legends)?
