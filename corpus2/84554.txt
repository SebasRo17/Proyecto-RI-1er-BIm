I am primarily a web designer, and a very rookie web developer. Say I have a comprehensive web app I want developed through a freelancer on Odesk.com What is the best way to effectively communicate the entire project, goals and requirements? Wireframes, spec sheets? Any examples/templates on this would be greatly appreciated.
