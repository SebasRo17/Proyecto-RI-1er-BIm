We are starting a new project and implementing on our corporations's instantiation of an openstack cloud (see http://www.openstack.org/). The project is security tooling for our corporation. We currently run many hundreds of dedicated servers for security tools and are moving them to our corporations instantiation of openstack. Other projects in my company currently use erlang in several distributed server applications, and other Q/A point out erlang is used in several popular cloud services. I am trying to convince others to consider where it might be applicable on our project. What are erlang's strengths for cloud programming? Where are areas it is particularly appropriate to use erlang?
