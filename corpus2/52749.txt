To me, Visual Basic seems clumsy, ugly, error-prone, and difficult to read. I'll let others explain why. While VB.net has clearly been a huge leap forward for the language in terms of features, I still don't understand why anyone would choose to code in VB over, say, C#. However, I still see (what seems to be) the vast majority of commercial web apps from "MS shops" are built in VB. I could stand corrected on this, but VB still seems more popular than it deserves. Can anyone help answer any (or all) of these questions:   * Am I missing something with VB? Is it easier to learn, or "friendlier" than C#? Are there features I don't know about?   * Why is VB/VB.net so frequently used today, especially in web projects?
