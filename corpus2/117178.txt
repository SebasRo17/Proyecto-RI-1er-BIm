This is how my solution looks like right now. And it get's to the point where my Controls need reference to Model. It get's real tough to keep Infrastructure, Constants, Controls and Model separated. For download size and modularity MAIN and Modules (there is many) will stay separate. But those core libraries seem to be referenced by all modules and MAIN. I don't see a point in keeping them in separate projects. I'm sure all of you had this same issue. So, I wonder if I should keep trying and keep them separate/loosely coupled (hard to do now without circular references) or it is OK to merge them into one Infrastructure project? My Model has lot's of metadata and this metadate needed in controls and other places. Thats where it get's tight. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GvAus.jpg)
