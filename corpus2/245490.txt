Kindly tell that how to make a registration system that work with php and MySql . I tried the demo that is here but how it works with the online web hosting . I have registered the free hosting at here   I have also created the database at here but cannot know how to use php files and upload at and use the mysql database that I created here . I want online registration system that uses php and mysql with the free hosting that serves my purpose. The registration system creates the user and sends confirmation email to userâ€™s email address and after confirmation user can log inn to the web application and further work will be done here after registration. Kindly guide me in the above scenario or tell another free hosting service that fulfills my purpose.
