I try to minimize the following for a>0:               f[a_] := Gamma[3]*a^(-3)*(Integrate[Exp[-u]*(u - a)*1/u, {u, a, Infinity}])^(-1)      I put in               NMinimize[{f[x],x>0},x]      but then he gave me an error that the function might not be bounded at said:               NMinimize::cvdiv: Failed to converge to a solution. The function may be unbounded. >>     {-3.18118*10^14, {x -> 1.11822}}      Obivously, that is not true. What am I doing wrong? Cheers
