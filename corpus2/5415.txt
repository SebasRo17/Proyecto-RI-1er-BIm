Frequently, I have been finding myself overloaded with contracts. Most of the time, I find myself juggling with at least 2 projects, in addition to the numerous websites I have to upkeep and perform maintenance on. Unfortunately, many of my clients will expect updates constantly - are constantly adding more to the to-do list than any one programmer could keep up with, and freaking out because the deadline was already overdue when I started on a project. I constantly run into the fact most clients do not really understand the amount of work that can be involved behind the scenes, especially if it is non-visually-impacting. Does anyone know of good ways to handle these situations I might be overlooking?
