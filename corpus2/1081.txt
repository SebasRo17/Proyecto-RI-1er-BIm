(I'm navigated from stackoverflow.com where I asked almost the same question) I'm a beginner in `Mathematica`. Like shown in the image below, I'm trying to put hat and bar to some letters in a statement (I basically want to write vector notation) but only some letters can have them. What's wrong with how I do? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ehy3H.jpg) In the stackoverflow.com page I cited above, someone suggested functions `OverHat/OverBar`. These could do the similar work when I only want a letter in a line. But as I described, I want to write a `statement`, which consists of left-hand & right-hand sides, where those functions might not work as it seems. If you could provide online resource that covers these syntax, that would be more appreciable. Thank you.
