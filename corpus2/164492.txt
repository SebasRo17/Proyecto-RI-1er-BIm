I have only used Java Channels and BufferedOutputStream and the input counter part for reading and writing simple integers and some strings here and there to the file.   However I do not understand the use of all these classes when there is `java.util.Scanner` class that provides easy ways to read and write to the files.   Java veterans please tell me the use of Channels and Streams over Scanner.
