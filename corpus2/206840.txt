I was asked this question "How would you find weight of Aeroplane" in an interview and I am not sure why this question was one of the two question asked in the interview. I tried to answer it using all possible ways but could not give the correct answer.(found the correct answer after google search) How much such questions decide your selection in the interview? Here was my approach: 1\. If measurement of plane is given then i will calculate volume and multiply by density, will consider fuel weight plus other dead weight. 2\. Using water displacement method if i can put plane in water and somehow measure how much water is displaced. But found using google search that right approach was to put place on a ship and mark the level of water on the hull, then remove plane and then ship will go up. And start putting weight on the ship till marked hull reaches the water level.
