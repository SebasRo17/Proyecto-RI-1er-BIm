Have you had problems managing information and found ways to effectively manage information? When I say "manage" I'm talking about storing, grouping, tagging, prioritizing, searching, sharing, etc. When I say information I'm talking about website links, feeds, videos, emails, documents, your thoughts, tasks, appointments, etc. It's difficult to really give this question better context without writing a lengthy (and possibly boring) monologue but let me clarify a little. I'm not asking about information overload necessarily (that's been recently asked), or how to write software or databases for managing information (software already exists). And when I say "personal" I'm not talking about your love life; I'm talking about the ways that you personally manage information as it relates to your work. This question might be better suited to independent consultants or employees who have to juggle and manage a lot of tasks and information at their job. I'd like to hear about any tools or "methods" that you feel are effective or revolutionary when it comes managing information.
