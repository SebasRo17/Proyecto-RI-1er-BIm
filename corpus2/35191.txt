To find a possible closed form of a number, I can use the function               WolframAlpha["6.38905609893065", IncludePods -> "PossibleClosedForm"]      It returns a result in the following form: ![Possible closed forms](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DkQw8.png) The `InputForm` of this result displays quite a large expression containing pods and cells represented as `XMLElement`s. > Is there an easy way to extract the first suggested closed form as a normal > expression (in this case, `E^2 - 1`)?
