For one of my project ideas, I want to create a dice rolling app. It would allow people to setup somewhat complex combinations of dice roll cascades in a visual way. I have a pretty good idea on how I would program the logic for the dice, namely as if you're creating a math formula; Class:               Formula      Properties:               Left formula     Right formula     Function      Thus, adding `X = A + B` would consist of Formula `X`, with left `Formula A`, right `Formula B` and function `Add`. Formula A and B would consist of left `a` or `b`, right `null` and function `Constant`. This approach seems fine to me, but I like to try and find approaches others have come up with. However, because 'programming math' tends to lead to completely different questions (of the 'Do I need to learn math to program' or 'How do I program this formula' variety), I'm having difficulties finding other approaches.
