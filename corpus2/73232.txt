I had one (Linux only) and I lost it. I'd like another, either Windows or Linux will do. Please _don't_ turn this into a "such estimates are useless" discussion. I need ... something, anything ... to show that s/w development is not free. Even a wild guess is better than nothing. The last one I used said something like X lines of code - the average US programmer would take Y months to do that at a salary of $Z. Again, please don't tell me why I don't want it - because I do. Apologies for trying to fend off the noise before it even starts. Thanks in advance for any help.
