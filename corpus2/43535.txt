Is it possible to markup (i.e. highlight or underline) text in a deployed cdf file and then save it? I think I know the answer (no), but since it seems a basic necessity for a document format that aspires to be used for textbooks, I thought I would ask if anybody had succeeded in such a task. Other similar tasks might include margin notes. I have tried a little out myself and failed with the following code:                   highlight :=             SetOptions[NotebookSelection[EvaluationNotebook[]], Background -> Yellow];         highlightButton := Button["Highlight", highlight];         SetOptions[EvaluationNotebook[],           DockedCells -> Cell[BoxData[ToBoxes[highlightButton]], "DockedCell"]]      When this is executed in Mathematica, I get a nice Button in my `DockedCell` that allows me to highlight text, by first selecting the text and then hitting the button. However, this functionality disappears when I try to deploy as a CDF. Am I right that this is impossible? I am pretty sure that even if I managed to get the text highlighted, from CDF Player, there won't be any saving anyway, but at least it could be printed (perhaps to a pdf).
