I am making a game and have been following examples which use the MVC architecture pattern. I am now trying to get my head around how this would fit in with a 3-tier architecture. From what I have gathered so far:   * MVC and 3-tier are separate ideas and are compatible   * MVC has a triangular communication structure, whereas 3-tier is a stack   * MVC can be used within the 3-tier structure, with the MVC parts contained in the UI layer as in the diagram:  ![MVC in 3-tier](http://i.stack.imgur.com/VsBMG.jpg) My Model for the game contains all the classes describing the abstract game world - all the items, characters, their positions and velocities in the world, the score, etc. But now what would constitute the business tier below this? As this is all the things I would normally associate with the business layer. Should the diagram in this case perhaps show the View and Controller in the UI layer, with the Model contained in the Business layer below them?
