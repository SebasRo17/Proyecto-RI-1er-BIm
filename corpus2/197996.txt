I'm working on a venture similar to Code School: it features a code editor (currently, i'm using ACE Editor) and a real-time "Run" option. I have no idea how Code School works with this... i thought about creating/destroying VMs on Amazon for each student, but that would be very expensive. Or, does it run inside an application that delegates execution to many different machines? And what about security?
