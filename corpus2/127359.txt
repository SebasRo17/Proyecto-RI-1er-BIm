I'm a 16 year old high school student, with a passion for computer programming. I'm in grade 11, and I've been learning it as part of the school syllabus for about 8 months. I've gone beyond what's being taught at school, and witten a few (reasonably good) applications. The language that I program in is C++, on the windows platform. Eventually I'd like to major in CS at a good college and then work as a programmer. The specific questions that I have are:   * What is a good place for me to get my work noticed ?    * Are there any journals, or publications specifically for young programmers ?   * If not publications, then are there any good blogs, or is it just better to start your own ?   * Is there anything else, that would help me get noticed as a programmer ? I've tried to be as objective as possible. If all this was tl;dr: What's the best way to get noticed as a young programmer ? Edit: I am not looking to get hired straight out of high school The aim is not to impress the community as a professional programmer. This is with intent towards college applications where having your work seen and critiqued by other people will improve your application. I am not looking to earn money from what I've written (so far).
