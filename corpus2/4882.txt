First we define a function that returns the least odd prime factor.               lopf[n_] := FactorInteger[n][[2, 1]]      Then we craft a routine that performs the 3x+1 steps using only primes               t = {};     z = 4;     While[z < 501,      y = Prime[z++];      prev = y;      u = {};      x = y;      While[x >= y,       prev = x;       x = lopf[3 x + 1];       u = AppendTo[u, {DirectedEdge[prev, x]}];       t = AppendTo[t, u];       ]      ]     t = Union[Flatten[t]];      Then we graph it               Graph[t]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SoXZ2.png) How can we structure this graph in a more civilized manner? I would like to have the first 5 primes {7,11,17,13,5} placed vertically down the center of a .pdf page and the remaining primes clustered about them. Also, Is there a way to use a rollover to identify a prime represented by a dot? This would be handy within an interactive document.
