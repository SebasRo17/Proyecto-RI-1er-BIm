While I was programming in C++ some days ago, I made this mistake (that I have history of making it!). In one part of my code, I had 1/6 and I was expecting it be 0.16666666666 which is not the case. As you all know the result is 0 - C, C++, Java, Python, all behave the same. I post it on my Facebook page and now there is debate on if there is a programming language where `1/6` behaves the same as `1.0/6.0`.
