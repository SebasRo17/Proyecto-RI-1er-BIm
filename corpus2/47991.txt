In the Sun Java coding conventions document (here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconv-138413.html), it states: "80% of the lifetime cost of a piece of software goes to maintenance" Does anyone know where this statistic is sourced from? I don't doubt the assertion, but I can make up statistics without attribution as well and I'd like to know where this came from before I start using it as a basis for other statements.
