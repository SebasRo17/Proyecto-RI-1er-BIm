I am looking for some information on encryption. Here's what I'm trying to do:   * Get unique information from our customer (an ID or something)   * Generate and encrypt some data on our side (using the clients ID)   * Send this data to customer, and allow an application to decrypt (and decrypt only) this data using the ID sent before What methods should I be looking at? Kind regards To clarify:   * We encrypt some data using our private key and our clients public key   * The client decrypts this data using their public key   * The client must not be able to encrypt valid data using their public key
