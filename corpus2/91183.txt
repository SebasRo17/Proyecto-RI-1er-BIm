I have the impression that more and more applications with a user interface use HTML+CSS+JavaScript client-side instead of a native GUI framework. I wounder what are the most important driving forces for this? or in other words what are native GUI frameworks lacking to be competitive? e.g. is it easier to do some kind of things with HTML+CSS+JavaScript than with native GUI frameworks. If we suppose the application is a client-server application where the client has a graphical user interface. **What is the most important things that are easier to do in HTML+CSS+JavaScript than in the most popular native GUI frameworks?**
