I am attempting to `Append` a new value into my list `paramMonitor` whenever the value for `B` changes. I had the code working perfectly, but my computer crashed without saving the document. I am now having a lot of trouble (dynamically) appending these values to my list. My attempts:   * This updates `B` but does nothing to append the value {`B`, `e`, `some number`} to `paramMonitor`              Dynamic[B,               AppendTo[paramMonitor,                {B,e,Abs[model[B, e][#] & /@ test[[All, 1]] - test[[All, 2]]] // Total}]      and   * Removing the first argument 'B', this code fails to compile and simply aborts upon execution:              Dynamic[AppendTo[paramMonitor,               {B,e, Abs[model[B, e][#] & /@ test[[All, 1]] - etst[[All, 2]]] // Total}]      I believe this is a quick fix (since I had it working earlier), but I cannot seem to find the issue.
