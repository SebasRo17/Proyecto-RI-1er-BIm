What's the term for an error caused by executing a block of code before its relevant ajax response has come back? e.g., a timeline: **13:00:01** execute getDataViaAjax(); **13:00:02** execute doSomethingWithMyAjaxData(); **13:00:03** ajax data comes back, too late since I forgot to make the code wait for it... I have a feeling I may say "doh!" when someone tells me the answer, but I can't for the life of me think what type of error it might be called.
