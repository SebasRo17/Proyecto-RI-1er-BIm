I'm trying to generate a very simple AR(1) Process with _Mathematica_ using the `ARProcess[]` function. The process must have the following format: $Y_t = \alpha + \beta Y_{t−1} + ϵ_t$ However, after reading the _Mathematica_ help file and some posts about `ARProcess[]` at MMA.SE, I couldn't find a way to correctly generate the process. I seems that the `ARProcess[]` function cannot deal with the $\alpha$ term of the process. For instance, consider the process described below: $Y_t = 10 + .6Y_{t−1} + ϵ_t$ , where $ϵ_t$ is Normally distributed with mean $0$ and variance $4$ (i.e., $ϵ_t \sim N(0,2)$). If I use `ARProcess[{.6},4]` I get               Mean[ARProcess[{.6}, 4][t]]     Variance[ARProcess[{.6}, 4][t]]      > Out[1]= 0 > > Out[2]= 6.25 which are consistent with an AR(1) process of the form $Y_t = 0 + .6Y_{t−1} + ϵ_t$ I would like to be able to, though the `ARProcess[]` function, calculate the **mean** and the **variance** of the process $Y_t = 10 + .6Y_{t−1} + ϵ_t$ in order to get a **Mean** of $25$ and a **Variance** of $6.25$. Is there any way to achieve this in _Mathematica_?
