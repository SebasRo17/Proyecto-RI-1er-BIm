My development team is looking to expand into some new areas that we don't currently have direct skills for. We're trying to evaluate the available training courses, but there's not much depth of differences that you can plumb from a webpage or two and a brochure. So the root of my question is what should we be looking for while selecting a training course? I think the best approach at this point is to send an RFC (request for comment) to the firms we've identified and ask the following:   * syllabus of coursework   * amount of hand's-on-work versus lecture   * preparatory references they recommend   * instructor biographies   * rough estimates of number of students trained*   * amount of time in training*   * amount of time in training on _this_ subject*   * results of end-of-class student satisfaction surveys   * expected student background   * general class size   * how they tailor the course to the individual student's needs *No, these aren't great measures for the quality of a courses but I struggle to identify a more relevant metric. **The Real Question(s) -->**   _What else should we be asking about or investigating?_   _Is there a superior approach to evaluating training courses?_ This question is perhaps the closest to answering my question, but it didn't gain much traction. In addition, it seems oriented towards how to design the course instead of what to look for. This question is related, but the person asking the question didn't appear to want the training. That's definitely not our situation - we have a known skills gap and we're looking to close it. The links from this question didn't really have any content that met my needs. This question and this question are related to the training (iOS development) we're particularly interested in. The questions are slightly stale, which is part of why they are off topic for P.SE. One nugget that I liked from these two questions was to purchase and review books published by the training firm if they're available.
