Is there a simple way to vary the line thickness relative to the viewpoint so as to add a sense of perspective? Take for example the following:               Manipulate[      lines = Table[{RandomInteger[{-1, 1}] a, RandomInteger[{-1, 1}] a,          RandomInteger[{-1, 1}] a}, {2^a}];       Graphics3D[Line[lines], Boxed -> False], {a, 1, 12, 1}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4nS3T.png) which generates some lines projected in a 3-dimensional fashion with a clearly visible perspective i.e. the lines of similar length appears longer when closer to the viewer. Since the information regarding apparent distance to the viewpoint is known to the system, it should be possible to retrieve this and modify the thickness of lines accordingly. Is this possible in a simple manner? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rt6J9.png) The sketch above illustrates my point, although somewhat clumsy.
