In combinatorial mathematics, a $k$-ary De Bruijn sequence $B(k, n)$ of order $n$ is a cyclic sequence of a given alphabet $A$ with size $k$ for which every possible subsequence of length $n$ in $A$ appears as a sequence of consecutive characters exactly once. Each $B(k, n)$ has length $k^n$ and there are $\dfrac{(k!)^{k^{n-1}}}{k^n}$ distinct De Bruijn sequences. By using `DeBruijnGraph` and `FindEulerianCycle` should be possible to obtain all the distinct sequences. In the example below I should obtain 24 sequences ($k = 3$, $n = 2$). However, I get only three distinct sequences:               out=FindEulerianCycle[DeBruijnGraph[3, 1], 24];     (First /@ #) & /@ out      > {{1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3}, {2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 3}, {3, 1, 1, 2, 1, > 3, 2, 2, 3}} How can I obtain all the distinct De Bruijn sequences?
