When using `Correlation[]` function I sometimes get the strange warning:               CorrelationTest::nortst: "At least one of the p-values in {0.0527317}, resulting from a test for normality, is below 0.05`. The tests in \!\({\"PearsonCorrelation\"}\) require that the data is normally distributed."      But take a look that there's only one p-value and it is actually greater than $0.05$:               0.0527317 < 0.05     False      The code that causes this:               x = RandomReal[{-5, 5}, 100];     y = 2 x + 1 + RandomReal[{-0.1, 0.1}, 100];     X = Transpose[{x, y}];     ListPlot[X]     Correlation[X] // MatrixForm     CorrelationTest[X, 99995/100000, "PearsonCorrelation"]      Why this happens? (to reproduce the issue a few repetitions are usually required)
