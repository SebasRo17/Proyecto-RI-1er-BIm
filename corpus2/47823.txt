I have Legends that stretch over multi-lines and the only way I can get them left aligned is by adding white space to the end of the legend item. Does anyone know if there is a way to use TextAlignment with SwatchLegend?               gJ = Plot[Sin[x], {x, 1, 12},        PlotLegends -> {Placed[          SwatchLegend[{RGBColor[1, 0.5, 0], RGBColor[0., 0.329412, 0.],             RGBColor[0.619608, 0.25098, 1.],             RGBColor[0, 1, 1]}, {"it ends up centred", "but ",             "fox jumped over two lines that I want to \nalign to the left",             "A quick brown"},            LegendMarkers -> {Graphics[{EdgeForm[], Rectangle[]}],              Graphics[{EdgeForm[], Rectangle[]}],              Graphics[{EdgeForm[], Rectangle[]}],              Graphics[{EdgeForm[], Rectangle[]}],              Graphics[{EdgeForm[], Rectangle[]}]},            LegendLayout -> "ReversedColumn", LegendMarkerSize -> 16,            LabelStyle -> {FontFamily -> "Arial", 18},            Spacings -> {0.5, 0.25}], {0.4167, 0.7701}]}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/MFBdF.png)
