I'd like to combine several 3D graphics, but the interface, indicated by the arrow in the figure attached between them is alway present. How to eliminate it? Thanks in advance. Here is my example:                 Graphics3D[{           {EdgeForm[None], Opacity[0.1], Gray,             Cylinder[{{0, 0, 0}, {0, 2, 0}}, 0.5]},            {EdgeForm[None], CapForm["Butt"], Opacity[0.1], Gray,             Tube[{{0, 2, 0}, {0, 3, 0}}, {0.5, 0.2}]},                }, ViewPoint -> {0.8677796780444739`, 2.2396029175520074`,             2.383513625315694`},           ViewVertical -> {-2.366747875495254`, -0.028635050478789906`,             1.8415006920431496`}, Boxed -> False]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3ZoMo.jpg)
