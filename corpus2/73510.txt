In our company we have 3 teams working on different software. The level they are working on is very diverse from 8/16 bit microcontroller in C , via 32bit arm on C++ under winCE to PC software developed with C# and windev. The tools and procedures we all use are roughly the same, although some teams use VSS and others SVN for version control. At the moment there is not much formal communications between the teams. Improvements in the process are only accidental because you hear something from a member of the other team that you could use in your own development. We would very much love to improve this situation but don't know how. What did you do that did or didn't work in such situations?
