I have a rails app where my users can buddy up with other users. Since that relationship can have a status (approved/rejected/pending), I decided to go with a join model (`UserRelationship`) so now I have the attribute. To handle state for that join model, I have a controller (`UserRelationshipsController`) with actions/RESTful endpoints for changing the state of the relationship. Is this bad practice? If so, where should I handle state-changes for the relationship? In the User model?
