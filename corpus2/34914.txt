Say I have a directed graph inputted in the following format in _Mathematica_ :               g = {{1, "a", 2}, {2, "b", 1}}      I'd like to plot this graph using `GraphPlot` in _Mathematica_ , which is the following syntax:               GraphPlot[{{1 -> 2, "a"}, {2 -> 1, "b"}}, VertexLabeling -> True, DirectedEdges -> True,          VertexCoordinateRules -> Auto, VertexLabeling -> True]      How would I swap the middle elements and the last elements in any list like `g`, so that `g` would look closer to the argument of `GraphPlot`?               {{1 -> 2, "a"}, {2 -> 1, "b"}}       I have searched the _Mathematica_ documentation but was unable to find a good way of doing this.
