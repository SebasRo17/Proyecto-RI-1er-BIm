This is a toy example: Is there a way to rewrite               Reduce[{Norm@{c[1], c[2], c[3]} == 1,               0 <= c[1] &&                c[1] < c[2] < c[3]},             {c[1], c[2], c[3]}]      As something like               Reduce[{Norm@{c[1], c[2], c[3]} == 1,               0 <= c[1] &&                ForAll[{i,j}, Implies[i<j, c[i] < c[j]]]},            {c[1], c[2], c[3]}]      ?   (Which of course doesn't work)
