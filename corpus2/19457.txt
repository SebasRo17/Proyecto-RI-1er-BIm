Today I was looking at some blogs on Ruby and Python. A Python loyalist wrote a few lines of code with a loop to show how Python is faster than Ruby, with a similar code. I also found a blog of a Ruby disciple who says that it is wrong and he too submitted a code sample and benchmarking results. I am wondering whether background programs or background processes may sometime hinder the results and we may not get exact benchmarking scenario. Please correct me if I am wrong.
