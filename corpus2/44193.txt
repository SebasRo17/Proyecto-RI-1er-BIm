I was just thinking how `Tuples` was created so , I came up with this,               Flatten[Outer[List, {a, b}, {a, b}, {a, b}], 2] == Tuples[{a, b}, 3]      > True Now, I want to convert it to a function,               fun[x_List] := Block[{}, Flatten[Outer[List, x], Length[x] - 1]]      But the problem is the I need to put this `List` as a sequence but I am not finding a work around.
