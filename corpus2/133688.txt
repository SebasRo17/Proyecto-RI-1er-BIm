I understand that C++11's uniform initialization solves some syntactical ambiguity in the language, but in a lot of Bjarne Stroustrup's presentations (particularly those during the GoingNative 2012 talks), his examples primarily use this syntax now whenever he is constructing objects. Is it recommended now to use uniform initialization in _all_ cases? What should the general approach be for this new feature as far as coding style goes and general usage? What are some reasons to _not_ use it? Note that in my mind I'm thinking primarily of object construction as my use case, but if there are other scenarios to consider please let me know.
