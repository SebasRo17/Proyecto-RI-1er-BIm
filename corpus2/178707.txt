In my current project, I need to store a very long ASCII string to each instance of a given object. This string will receive an 2 appends per minute and will not be retrieved so frequently. The worst case scenario is a 5-10MB string. I'll have thousands of instances of my object and I'm worried that storing all those strings in the filesystem would not be optimal, but I can't think of a better solution. Can anyone suggest an alternative? Maybe a key-value store? In this case, which one? Any other thoughts?
