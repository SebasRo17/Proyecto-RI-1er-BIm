I know this question has been asked here before, and I also know that this website is for programming questions only, but please do make an exception, as none of the posts I've come across on this site, or others, have answered this question properly (there are too many ifs). I'm planning to develop a program which I intend to sell later. I'm trying to decide upon a language to code it with, and have narrowed down to C++ or Java. I've been through the GPL v2 and v3 licenses used for GNU's GCC and OpenJDK (yes, I can understand some amount of legal stuff, but clearly, not all of it). But there is one point upon which **everyone** is obscure (this should have been one of the first things answered, IMO): if I develop a program using C++/Java and compile it using GCC compiler or OpenJDK's compiler, can I sell it without having to place my program under GPL as well? As far as I can make out, I have full rights to assign any license to my program, but, there is a catch: it says in the license that I shouldn't link to any library that is under GPL. If so, I'll have to release my program under GPL. Now, I don't know what in C++/Java is considered a library, so if I use the normal stuff in C++ (iostream, list, map, etc. ) or the normal Java classes/interfaces available as part of the standard JDK 6 distribution (String, List, Map, etc.), does this constitute 'linking to the libraries'?
