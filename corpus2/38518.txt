I did some time consuming computation and obtained a lot of arrays and variables; however after restart the Mathematica Kernel, all these computational results disappeared. How can I save all these workspace variables into some file, and then re-use them by loading the file next time when I restart Mathematica? (In Matlab all the current workspace can be saved into an `*.mat` file by `save`, and re-used by `load`)
