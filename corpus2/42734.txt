Taking reference of Huffman code algorithm,                list={{{{{{}, {{x7, 4}, {1, {{f, 3}}}, {0, {{q, 1}}}}},         {{x8,9}, {1, {{b, 5}}}, {0, {{x7, 4}}}}},          {{x9,12}, {1, {{e, 6}}}, {0, {{a, 6}}}}},          {{x10,19}, {1, {{h, 10}}}, {0, {{x8, 9}}}}},          {{x11,31}, {1, {{x10, 19}}}, {0, {{x9, 12}}}}}      This is in midway of creating the `Huffman code` for any string. x* represents the new node made from two smallest nodes and 4 next to it represents the sum of the frequencies of the two child nodes under it. **Information on structure of list:** > > {{parent_node,fre1},{code,{{child_node1,freq2}}},{code,{{child_node2,freq3}}}} > > freq1 = freq2 + freq3               {{x7, 4}, {1, {{f, 3}}}, {0, {{q, 1}}}}       > x7 is parent of f and q > > 4 = 3 + 1 This unique node(x7) is added in list, sorted and operation repeated again. I am facing problem with creating a final output as Huffman codes for each character, for example, **h = 11, a = 00** walking from top to bottom. Final result could be `{{h,11},{a,00}}` and with other characters.
