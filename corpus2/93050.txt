I want to be able to send messages between computers on the internet network but with minimal functionality requirement are- 1)computers can join/leave the group (I expect the group size to be a maximum of 5-10) 2)any message generated by any computer will be sent to every other node (this is the main requirement and I have short messages which need to be sent in shortest possible time: suggest network layer protocol to be used here), message wont be resent or ack (except leave)..but I still want to maintain high reliability, can I maintain it without receiving acks? one problem would be to communicate on the internet I will need some sort of NAT support? how can this be managed without a stun server? Should I use a p2p library? as I think most of the features they offer wont be needed by me could anyone suggest some here? I'm working in C++.
