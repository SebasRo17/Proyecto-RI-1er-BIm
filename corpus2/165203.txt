I have an mbed microcontroller which has a small ARM Cortex M3 on it. Basically, my effective resources for the project are ~25 KB of RAM and ~400 KB of Flash. For I/O I'll have a PS/2 keyboard, a VGA framebuffer (with character output), and an SD card for saving/loading programs (up to a couple of MB maybe). I ask because I'm trying to figure out what programming language to implement on the thing. I'm looking for an interpreted language that's easy for me to implement and won't break the bank on my resources. I also intend for this to be at least possible to write on the device itself, though the editor can be interpreted (yay, bootstrapping). Anyway, I've looked at a few simple languages. Some nice candidates:   * Forth   * BASIC   * Scheme?  Has anyone done something like this or know of any languages that can fit this bill or have comments about my three candidates so far?
