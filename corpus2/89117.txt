in school we are taught how we can balance an AVL tree upon an insertion or deleting. How is this type of knowledge actually going to be useful in the real world? Can someone give an example on when this type of knowledge would actually be useful? From what I have seen, in the workplace such details hardly ever come up... I can see how detailed knowledge about algorithms and some data structures can be important but not such details as AVL tree rotations (and similar detailed concepts). thanks!
