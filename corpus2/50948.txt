I have               F[x, y] := (y/2)(2 Cos[2x] + 2 Cos[x] + 1)/5 + ((1 - y)/2)(2 Cos[x] + 1)/3.      I am looking for the maximum of the minimum of `F`. More precisely I am looking for $$\underset{0\leq y\leq 1}{Maximum} \left(\underset{x\in [0,2\pi]}{Minimum} F(x,y)\right).$$ I typed `Findminimum / FindMaximum` together into _Mathematica_ , but that did not work. I now feel that I need more advanced tools to make it work. The answer for my example is -1/9.
