I'd like to see some valid examples of needing to let a thread enter a locked, non-re entrant mutex, then destroying the mutex (which supposedly terminates the thread). I can't think of any good reason to do this. I can't remember precisely what we were arguing about earlier today, but my colleague insists such techniques are needed for "point-of-no-return" problems (again, forgive me, but I forgot the example he gave me).
