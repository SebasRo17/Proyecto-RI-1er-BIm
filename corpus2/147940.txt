My boss wants to introduce new guidelines for the computers in our company. This means that the software environments will be completely standardized with a predefined set of tools. The goal is that all machines are completely reproducable and exchangable. I'm wondering what the guidelines for developer's computers are in large companies, such as Google or Microsoft, especially companies which are certified according to some standard (e.g. ISO 9001). Do they allow developers to install software from the internet if they need it for some small task? (e.g. a code compare tool, CygWin, Windows Service Packs) or do they really want all needed tools in a fixed, predefined environment where all proposed changes must be discussed with a system administrator first?
