The following works:               devFactors =SQLExecute[SicsDBconnection, "SELECT * FROM " <>  devFactorTable];     devFactors[[1]]          colNames = {ALOB, Country, Months, LossFactor, EarnedFactor};     asRules = Rule @@@ Transpose[{colNames, Range[Length@colNames]}];     newList[col_] := devFactors[[All, col /. asRules]];     newList[LossFactor][[1]]      and produces:               {"Property Treaty PR", "Morristown", 12, 3.5736, 3.09256}     3.5736      I would like to pull those column names from SQL as the following:               colNames = SQLColumnNames[SicsDBconnection, SQLTable[devFactorTable]][[All, 2]];      But, when I do this, colNames now is a list of strings instead of a list of symbols and I have to reference my devFactors list like:               newList["LossFactor"][[1]]      I would like to be able to reference it using the symbol LossFactor instead of the string. I see that I can't replace the head of an atom, so I think that means that I can't turn those strings from SQL into symbols. Obviously this isn't a critical problem, but does anyone know how I can accomplish this, or if it's possible?
