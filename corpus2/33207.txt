One of the most crucial requirements for rich, interactive scientific graphics is being able to "annotate" individual graphic elements (e.g. the data points of a scatterplot, the individual curves in a plot of multiple curve fits to data, individual subregions of a density plot) with additional information. I'm using the term "annotate" very broadly here to stand for "associate additional information with". Minimally, one would like to be able to assign unique identifiers to each feature of interest, that can be used as keys in auxiliary data structures. (For example, one way to make a scatterplot interactive is to equip each data point in the scatterplot with a tooltip that will display additional information about that point when the user hovers the cursor over the point. Another way would be to give the user the ability to "light up" a subset of the data points based on some shared metadata value.) Can the Mathematica `Graphics` object accommodate such annotations within it? (NB: I don't doubt that it would be possible to implement this sort of capability "on top of" Mathematica. At the moment I am interested _only_ in whether such functionality is already built into Mathematica.) EDIT: added one more example of possible modes of interactivity.
