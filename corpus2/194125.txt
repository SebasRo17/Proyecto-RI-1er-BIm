When looking at the ECMAScript 4th Edition specification here it mentions that > ES3 is a simple, highly dynamic, object-based language that takes its major > ideas from the languages Self and Scheme. I'm not familiar with these two languages and cannot seem to find any mention of what exactly is similar to these languages in ECMAScript. Would someone be able to explain to me the features that ECMAScript has taken from these languages?
