I have developed a Windows application in c# in which multiple users can add some numbers and their name and can view the data entered. The problem that I have is that the sever is on my laptop and every time I log off or close my laptop, they are losing connection to the DB and can not add or view any more. It seems that the port is closed or something. Is there a way to keep the port and their connection established all the time even when I'm logging out?
