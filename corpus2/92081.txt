We are planing to introduce Help Desk and Support Desk in our project. Our current development team would be divided into two smaller teams: Support Desk and Development team. Support Desk would be responsible only for bug fixing. Development team would be responsible for making enhancements and new features development. What value do you see from such responsibilities and teams segregation? Can we find a differences between bug and new features in terms of development activities? Is there any real value of doing such things?
