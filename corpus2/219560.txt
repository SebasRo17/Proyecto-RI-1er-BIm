Let's say user A does something expensive (regarding CPU and/or memory), which takes a few seconds. Concurrently, user B needs a very small amount of computing time. In this case, will the computing for user A significantly slow down that of user B (even block maybe?), or are these situations handled in most systems? (I use ASP.NET MVC, but I wouldn't mind a more general answer either)
