I am new to Mathematica, but already find it a very nice tool. Right now I am trying to create an animation of numeric data, where each frame corresponds to a distinct text file with a table-like content. With one static frame (file) I can do the following:               file = "Desktop/d1.txt"     data = Import[file, "Table"]     ArrayPlot[data]      Now, with multiple frames (files) I have to somehow animate a list of 2D lists, e.g.:               files = { "Desktop/d1.txt", "Desktop/d2.txt", "Desktop/d3.txt" }     data = Map[Import[#] &, files]      ListAnimate is said to accept a list:               ListAnimate[data]      ,but it does not display the bitmap and shows a box with an advancing position bar and text representation of the data[[1]] . I would like to playback all the files' content as consecutive bitmaps. Should I somehow rearrange my 2D lists and/or may be ListAnimate is the wrong function for that task and I should use something else?
