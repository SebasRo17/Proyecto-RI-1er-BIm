As I've written about in other questions here, the project that I'm working on now has no software process. That means no documentation (including hard copy requirements or specification), no source control, no bug database, bugs are "fixed" (hopefully) and new code is added at the same time, and no formal testers - we would fail the Joel Test so bad, it's not even funny. Yesterday, my manager asked me to write a document about how to begin to fix these shortcomings. Note that I'm just an intern, here for 6 months. I'll be leaving around Thanksgiving in November to return to school. However, I think that I can perhaps get this project moving in the right direction, but I'm not sure where to even begin. I'm currently using CiteSeer and Wikipedia to attempt to find some papers and such that describe software processes and implementing them, but any advice, personal experiences, or links to blogs, papers, wiki articles, or anything else would be greatly appreciated.
