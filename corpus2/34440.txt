I want to test a difficult integral : Integral on all reals of some complicated function involving the Hermitian polynomials, exponentials, squares, factorials, and being general considering any Hermitian polynomials. I know the answer (it's ridiculously short compared with the statement) and just wanted to check. But why _Mathematica_ doesn't calculate my integral ? (I'm quite new on the system and don't understand what causes the trouble) :               Integrate[(HermiteH[n, x/a]*Exp[-x^2/(2 a^2)]/((n!)^(1/2) (Pi a^2)^(1/4)))^2*x^2,               {x, -Infinity, Infinity},                Assumptions :> {Element[n, Integers], Element[a, Reals], a > 0}]      And getting as a result: > >       Integrate[(x^2 exp[-(x^2/(2 a^2))]^2 HermiteH[n, x/a]^2)/(Sqrt[a^2] > Sqrt[Pi] n!), >                 {x, -∞, ∞}, >                 Assumptions :> {n ∈ Integers, a ∈ Reals, a > 0}] >   What do I have to change to get an answer?
