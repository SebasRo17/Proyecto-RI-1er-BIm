I have a simply expression that I can see that I can express as a product.               -3.041109351939086` y^8.498317296251567` -       19.00693344961927` y^8.648317296251566` +       0.19006933449619273` y^9.498317296251567` +       x^4.676655975278822` (3.0411093519390855` y^3.8216613209727446` +          19.00693344961927` y^3.9716613209727445` -          0.19006933449619273` y^4.821661320972744`)      **EDIT: (To explain what I mean by product)** The above expression is this: $x^{4.67666} \left(-0.190069 y^{4.82166}+19.0069 y^{3.97166}+3.04111 y^{3.82166}\right)+0.190069 y^{9.49832}-19.0069 y^{8.64832}-3.04111 y^{8.49832}$ Eyeballing it I see that the term $ \left(-0.190069 y^{1}+19.0069 y^{0.15}+3.04111 y^{0}\right)$ is a common one and the above expression one can be written as: $ \left(-0.190069 y^{1}+19.0069 y^{0.15}+3.04111 y^{0}\right) \left(x^{4.67666}y^{3.82166}-y^{8.49832}\right)$ This is one way to write things as a product. I can always take $y^{3.82166}$ out as well and write it as: $ \left(-0.190069 y^{1}+19.0069 y^{0.15}+3.04111 y^{0}\right) \left(x^{4.67666}-y^{4.67666}\right)y^{3.82166}$   1. Other than re-writing it by hand, is there a command that I can use to write this expression as a product of two or more other expressions?   2. Is there something I can do in general? Something that takes common factors out where the factors can be large expressions that I am not aware of upfront? The point is that I am trying to figure out the signs of various expressions, hence the need to write things as products. Also, I am anticipating that the imprecise nature of numerical solving means that expressions that may be factors might not show up that way in MMA since different numbers are truncated differently. Still.... I'd appreciate tips even if they are conditional on the numbers being integers.
