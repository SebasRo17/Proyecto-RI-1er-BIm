Given this text:               text1 = "  A  Vitamin D Deficiency (ICD-9-CM 268.9) (ICD-9-CM 268.9) 09/11/2015  01 ";      Yes, the ICD code values are duplicates- possibly but not certainly in all the records. What string expression will match only the code values - twice if duplicated? I've tried:               StringCases[text1, "(ICD-9-CM " ~~ code__ ~~ ")" .. :> code,       Overlaps -> False]          (* {"268.9) (ICD-9-CM 268.9"} *)          StringCases[text1, "(ICD-9-CM " ~~ code__ ~~ ")" .. :> code,   Overlaps -> True]          (* {"268.9) (ICD-9-CM 268.9", "268.9"} *)          StringCases[text1, "(ICD-9-CM " ~~ code__ ~~ ")" .. :> code,       Overlaps -> All]          (* {"268.9) (ICD-9-CM 268.9", "268.9", "268.9"} *)      Removing the `..` repeat pattern doesn't alter the outputs. What's the explanation for this behavior?
