I'm trying to learn PHP OOP "properly", and I was wondering, should the constructor grab all the information in the database and store it in the object? To use an example I'm trying to create using PHP OOP, an internet comic website (much like XKCD's), would have two classes:   * Catalogue (list and order of all the episodes)   * Episode (data relating to that particular episode) So, in this situation, should the `Catalogue` object get an array of all the episodeIDs (presumably this would be gotten in the constructor)? And if so, does that mean I have to update both the Object's array and the Database's array? And if so, what's the most common way of implementing this (presumably very common) action?
