How important are to-many relationships in iOS programming? Do you often hold a list of pointers to objects in an array in your codes? I don't think I fully understand the concept of to-many relationships, let alone how to implement them into code. From my current understanding, to-many relationships holds a list of pointers to one or more class objects and their corresponding properties and instance variables?
