I have some conditions at `t=0`, like `r1^2+r2^2=0.5` and `x^2+y^2=6` and I want to find the right initial values in the past like `t=-20`, which reproduces this conditions. For example I have this system here.               alpha = 0.5     beta = 1          sol = NDSolve[{          x'[t] == -x[t]*a[t] - 3*x[t] + alpha*y[t]^2 +        1/2*beta*(r1[t]^2 - r2[t]^2),     y'[t] == -y[t]*a[t] - alpha*x[t]*y[t],      r1'[t] == -r1[t]*a[t] - 3/2*r1[t] + beta*x[t]*r1[t],      r2'[t] == -r2[t]*a[t] - 3/2*r2[t] - beta*x[t]*r2[t],     z'[t] == -z[t]*a[t] - 2*z[t],     x[-20] == 0, y[-20] == 10^(-12), r1[-20] == 0.008,      r2[-20] == 0.008, z[-20] == 0.999},     {x, y, r1, r2, z},     {t, 0, -20}];     a[t_] = -1/2*(3 - 3*y[t]^2 + 3*x[t]^2 + z[t]^2)      In c++ I would build something with a `While` loop. But in _Mathematica_ I don't know and the documentation of _Mathematica_ doesn't help me.
