I have a large bzipped file that I want to read using OpenRead on a pipe with UTF8 encoding. Doing the following does not give me UTF-8 encoding. My `$CharacterEncoding` is set to `"UTF8"`.               f = OpenRead["!bunzip2 -c " <> filename]      `OpenRead` does not have a `CharacterEncoding` option like `Import` does. So the following works:               txt = Import["!bunzip2 -c " <> filename, "Text", CharacterEncoding -> "UTF8"];      But `Import` forces me to load all the data before operating on it which I don't want. **UPDATE1** : For now I'm reading in the string as bytes and then converting to UTF8 manually               FromCharacterCode[ToCharacterCode[s], "UTF8"]      I notice _Mathematica_ UI has problems printing certain Unicode characters as others stackoverflowers have noticed.
