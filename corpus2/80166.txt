Is apple phasing out support for objective-c++? Note the following:   * In the Objective-C language manual, there used to be a section on mixing objective-c and c++. That section is now missing.   * Links to articles on objective-c++ on the apple developer website seem to be broken, and are now redirected, e.g. this one, which I found on this stackoverflow question.   * Searching for c++ on the apple dev website brings very little in the way of current information. Should I be concerned about using c++ for iOS development?
