I have been a Python programmer for about 18 months, consisting of one internship and a few side projects, and I consider myself pretty comfortable in the language. However, there seems to be a lot of attention on Ruby in the programming field, but not a lot on Python anymore. So in learning Ruby, are there going to be Pythonic things that are just bad practices in Ruby? What should I watch out for, and what should I avoid?
