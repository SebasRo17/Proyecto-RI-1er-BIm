I am looking for a book with **graded** (i.e from low to high level of difficulty) collection of programming problems. The problems I am interested in are Algorithm/Data Structure problems, since this is the genre of problems asked in ACM ICPC, Topcoder, CodeJam, Facebook puzzles, and majority of interviews, I suppose. I do know of various collections on web but none of them are graded so it is daunting for a beginner to get started. I am looking for something that starts from the very beginning and goes up to Topcoder level, for instance.
