I have written a python program to test a new network routing algorithm, that uses a Content Centric Network Approach for handling requests (CCN), where the CCN router keeps 3 data structures:   * A PIT or Pending Interest Table, that holds requests for which a router has not yet received a response.    * A FIB or Forwarding Interest Base, which maps requests to the next router to which the request can be forwarded.    * A Content store to which the router can cache content from previous requests. The Simulator is simple: \- It follows the Event-Based design where 'Dummy Packets' are sent from server object to other server objects containing data of what content is being requested and the destination of where the content object is. **Specifically** , how could I design my simulator or tests to get a birds eye view of how my new algorithm matches up against standard IP routing? My hunch is that I will need to test speed, which I believe can be done by timing the round trip time for a request. But I don't know how I would test other aspects of this algorithm. I have little to no networking experience so any advice or direction is appreciated.
