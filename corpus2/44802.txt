I have a function that contains a `For` loop and sometimes takes several hours to run. It's important that I keep a high precision, and I insert `Print` statements throughout to check the status. Here is a simplified example:               f[x_] := Block[{$MinPrecision = 500},         For[i = 0, i < x, i++;             y = i/2;             Print[N[y, 10]]         ];     ];      Is there a way to ignore or suppress `$MinPrecision` when `Print` is used? I'd like to make the printed output easier to read.
