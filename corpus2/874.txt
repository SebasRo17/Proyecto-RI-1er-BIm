What can internally be happening here? Is the evaluator just messing with us and going non-standard because it's a `Bag`? Or am I just not seeing how something like this could be done in _Mathematica_?               AppendTo[$ContextPath, "Internal`"];          In[19]:= ClearAll[x, y];     {x, y} = {Bag[{1, 2, 3}], Bag[{4, 5}]};      Heads are               In[21]:= Head /@ {x, y}          Out[21]= {Bag, Bag}      But they are just a head, no depth. Depths               In[22]:= Depth /@ {x, y}          Out[22]= {1, 1}      However, they are different. I take their second elements, or I print them in `InputForm`               In[23]:= BagPart[#, 2] & /@ {x, y}     InputForm /@ {x, y}          Out[23]= {2, 5}          Out[24]= {InputForm[Internal`Bag[{1, 2, 3}]], InputForm[Internal`Bag[{4, 5}]]}
