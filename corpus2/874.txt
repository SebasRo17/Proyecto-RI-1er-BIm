In my current job it feels like we have a lot requirement changes. We are an "Agile" shop, so I get that we are supposed to adjust and what not, but sometime the change is large and nothing trivial. My question is, how do you effectively communicate the cost of the change? Because of being agile, if a change is big enough something will get dropped from the current sprint, but it usually just get added next time around. Since our model is SaaS, the end customer is effectively the business itself, and they know they will get the cut feature _n_ weeks later. I guess what I am trying to get at is the removal of a feature really isn't anything to use for communication as it was only delayed by _n_ weeks. What other ways do you have to get the business to understand what a change costs?
