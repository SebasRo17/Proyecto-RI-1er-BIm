> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Are certifications worth it? I'm curious what experience others have had, both from the perspective of an employer and an employee on Microsoft Certifications. I'm kind of sitting on the fence myself on this issue. I tend to have a cynical view of folks with massive amounts of letters following their name, and sometimes think that these certificates are so specialized that they prove a candidate knows "almost everything about almost nothing". Deeply specialized knowledge isn't always needed in the real world, especially if it means total ignorance of related subjects. Nobody needs to here "That's not my specialty - we need to hire another guy on the team" very often. On the other hand, everybody knows how easy it is to BS through an interview, and nobody wants the experience of hiring an employee and finding out two weeks later that they don't really have a good grasp on what you need them to do.
