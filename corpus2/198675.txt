It's fairly obvious that OOP is viewed as a sort of silver bullet of programming today. In any computer science course, the merits of OOP are heralded. I would like to know why people like OOP. To be honest, combining procedures, types, and data structures into a single conglomerate seems bad to me. I'd much rather view data as simply data. I like to be able to think that I will pass the right data through a function and get the right output, and not have to consider that the data is capable of operating on itself. Also, I want to know if there are any good examples of robust programs written specifically with or without OOP, that have their source code available.
