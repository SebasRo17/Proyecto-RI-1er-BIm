I'm proficient with HTML and CSS but I'm still pretty shaky when it comes to Javascript. That said, I've been able to build a site using the Internet Archive Book Reader, which relies on reader.js Here's a copy of one of my versions of reader.js https://gist.github.com/dylan-k/ed4efed2384e221d46cc It's a good site, but I find I have to repeat things a lot. Basically, I have one copy of reader.js for every page/book featured on the site. It seems there must be a better way. I re-use the script, making copies, just so that I can change lines `28`, `80`, `83`, `84`. Is there a way I could include just one copy of reader.js and then use a `<script>` tag to define these 4 lines for the individual pages?
