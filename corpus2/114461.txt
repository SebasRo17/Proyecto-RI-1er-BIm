This question was inspired by this closed one. Please only answer if you have experience of recruiting developers, and stick to broad issues, not Daily WTF style stories. Basically, what are the main issues that make it hard to find good developers - either making it hard to get people to apply in the first place, or leading to large numbers of applicants being rejected or refusing an offer. General technical ability, specific technical skills, interpersonal skills, salary demands vs. budget constraints, work too dull, whatever - what are the top development recruitment problems?
