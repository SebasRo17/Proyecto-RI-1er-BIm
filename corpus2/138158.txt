I just had a developer technical interview last night. As similar to so many technical interviews, it ask me to solve and implement an algorithms within a period of time (1 hour). But when interview begin, he start with introducing his life and to long 13 years career life for like 15 min or more (1/6 of my problem solving time gone). Then I notice I really having troubles understanding his English, thus every question or explanations he said, I have to repeatedly ask him to repeat and explain many times. Turns out he gave up explain one question and ask another one. At the end it turns out I couldn't have enough time to do the algorithms implementation even I got the concept to implement. I did tried to briefly explain how my concept and implementations should be, but at the same time I really concern is he really understand my explanation(English). I feel I am pretty much fail this interview, but I don't want to repeat this situation again. So what will be the best way to get him communicate properly with me, so it won't waste so much time to repeat the same explanation? And not letting him think I have no idea how to implement the algorithms? A side question, how can I cut his long introduction?
