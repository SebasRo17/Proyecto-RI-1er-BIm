Why did Microsoft choose to change the resources management system from .NET's RESX files? RESX had useful code generation, providing developers auto-completion for resources names and outputting IMHO very readable code. The new RESW format is as far as I know, the same bare XML files, but without any code generation, forcing developers to write more code, and depriving them of compile time error detection.
