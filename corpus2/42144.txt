The wonderful error bar log plots package `ErrorBarLogPlots` from `V6` no longer positions labels correctly (since `v9` or maybe `v8`) so I used the same function with `Prolog` to place a list of labels. Then in `v10 beta` `PlotRangePadding` no longer works either and I can't find a work around for that, so I tried to go back to basics and use the very elegant solution by Belisarius' et.al in: Plotting Error Bars on a Log Scale I was able to modify this to make asymmetric $Y$ error bars, then I tried to add $X$-errors and got tied up in knots with the `Joined` and `Filling` commands. **The aim** is to plot a set of $5$ lists of `xy` values, `{xy, xyP, xyM, xPy, xMy}` where `P` and `M` refer to the plus and minus error of the $x$ or $y$ value preceding it, with a `Filling` / `Joined` statement that joins the first point to the other 4 points. Ideally the plot symbols should also switch between vertical and horizontal bars for the $x$ and $y$ error points and something else for the $x, y$ point. (I asked Support about including an `errorlistlogplot` command in _Mathematica_ but I expect it won't make it into `v10`). The lines below generate and plot the `5` sets of points. Is there a straightforward combination of `Filling` / `Joined` statements to achieve this?
