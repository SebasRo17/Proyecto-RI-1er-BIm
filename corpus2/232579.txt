Only 1% of our clients use particular features or scenarios. Do you think we should spend as much time testing these features and scenarios as we spend on our central features and scenarios, or we should test mostly the "happy path" for these features? **UPDATE** Maybe I should have asked the question in a different way. Do you think a company needs to spend more time testing the central features of its products? For example I assume the Windows 8 team tested the the boot sequence more in depth than they tested the driver for a very uncommon graphics card. The cost of a bug in a boot sequence is huge since no one would be able to use the OS. But a bug in a driver of an obscure GPU will hurt only a small client base.
