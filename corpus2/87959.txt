Last day I have been interviewed and the interviewer asked me as given the outline of a project, how can we determine the number of resources to be needed for the same? I don't know to do so. Is there any standard way of doing so? or is it based on the experience? Or how? I am pretty new in this activity and my knowledge is zero at present .... so any clear explanation with some example(simple) will help me(and people like me) to understand this.
