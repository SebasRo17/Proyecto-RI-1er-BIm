also I guess that the topic was tackled in Combining Image3D and Graphics3D. My question is quite similar: How do I match the coordinate Systems of Graphics3D and Image3D? Here some code:               z = 1;     p = RandomInteger[100, {z, 3}];     r = RandomInteger[10, {z}];     spheres = MapThread[RotateLeft[DiskMatrix[#1, {100, 100, 100}], #2] &, {r, p}];     i = Image3D[Plus @@ spheres, Axes -> True, AxesLabel -> {"x", "y", "z"}]     obj = GraphicsComplex[p, Sphere[Range[z], r]];     gr = Graphics3D[obj,                     Axes -> True,                     AxesLabel -> {"x", "y", "z"},                     PlotRange -> {{0, 100}, {0, 100}, {0, 100}}]     Show[i, gr, Axes -> True]      Can anyone explain to me how to match the coordinate systems, that the spheres match? Thanks in advance!
