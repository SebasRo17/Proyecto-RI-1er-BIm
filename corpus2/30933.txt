I'm trying to model a rocket launch with _Mathematica_ but I've run into a little problem since I don't know how to turn the thrust off. I'm using Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation plus an added term for the rocket's thrust and trying to find its position as a function of time. Here is the code so far (it is at a very basic stage at the moment with constant mass and no drag added, plus the thrust never stops, which is my biggest concern right now):               (*Gravitational Constant*)     G = 6.672*10^-11     (*Mass of Earth and rocket*)     M = AstronomicalData["Earth", "Mass"]     m = 2800000     (*Rocket thrust*)     T = 34020000     (*Radius of Earth*)     r = AstronomicalData["Earth", "Radius"]     (*Numerical solution modelling the gravitation interation between the \     Earth and a launching rocket*)     (*NOTE: Rocket mass will change over time; also, add in drag*)     soln = NDSolve[{        x''[t] == -((G M x[t])/(x[t]^2 + y[t]^2 + z[t]^2)^(3/2)),        y''[t] == -((G M y[t])/(x[t]^2 + y[t]^2 + z[t]^2)^(3/2)) + 0.25 T/m,        z''[t] == -((G M z[t])/(x[t]^2 + y[t]^2 + z[t]^2)^(3/2)) + 0.75 T/m,        x[0] == 0, y[0] == 0, z[0] == r, x'[0] == 0, y'[0] == 0,         z'[0] == 0}, {x[t], y[t], z[t]}, {t, 0, 20000},        MaxSteps -> 10000000, Method -> "StiffnessSwitching"]          RocketPlot =       ParametricPlot3D[{x[t], y[t], z[t]} /. soln, {t, 0, 10000000}, AxesLabel -> {x, y, z}]      Does anyone know if conditional statements can be used inside `NDSolve` so that the thrust can be stopped at a certain position or time? Any help would be appreciated, cheers guys.
