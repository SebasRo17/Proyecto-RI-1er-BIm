If I type               Sum[f[x],{x,m,Infinity}]-Sum[f[x],{x,m+3,Infinity}]      I would like Mathematica to return something like               Sum[f[x],{x,m,m+2}]      or maybe               f[m]+f[m+1]+f[m+2]      But it doesn't seem to want to do this (maybe because it's worried that the difference makes no sense if the sums don't converge?). Is there a simple way to let Mathematica know I would like it to make this kind of simplification?
