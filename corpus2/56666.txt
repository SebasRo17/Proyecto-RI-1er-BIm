I have a dataset consisting of 2 different parameters (`x` and `y`), that are evaluated for 3 different values of parameter `p` and within a set for `p`, there are, say, two groups (`G1` and `G2`, eventually to `Gn`) with again three values for a parameter q. `G1`, `G2` need to be displayed with the same `ColorFunction`. How do I display this using `PairedBarChart`? I believe this is a nested list, but `PairedBarChart` only seems to take two (`x` and `y`) _m-by-n_ (max number of dimensions = 2) matrices? Appreciate your hints! UPDATE: SAMPLE DATA BELOW and extra level added in description above. Data should be interpreted as data left = x, dataright = y. In both, there is three groups p1, p2, p3 each consisting of two lists (G1 and G2), which in turn each consist of {q1,q2,q3}.               dataleft = {{{22.1801, 30.9241, 27.3873}, {30.0898, 42.7793, 38.6847}, {81.5488, 164.131, 97.6132}}, {{28.5354, 30.1192, 26.7762}, {26.7111,27.5938, 25.8865}, {72.1467,91.9632, 53.7431}}};     dataright (*here identical to left, just for the idea*) = {{{22.1801, 30.9241, 27.3873},{30.0898, 42.7793, 38.6847}, {81.5488,164.131, 97.6132}}, {{28.5354, 30.1192, 26.7762}, {26.7111, 27.5938, 25.8865}, {72.1467, 91.9632, 53.7431}}};
