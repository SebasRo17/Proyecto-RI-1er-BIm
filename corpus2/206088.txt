The titled basically states it. If I have a bigint column with primary key and autonumber, and a record is deleted, will SQL Server ever reuse that now available value? The underlying issue is that I have a multi-user environment, and if I retrieve a record from the database into memory, then another user makes changes (like deleting and/or re-adding), if I do updates or deletes based on that ID in memory, is there a chance that I could be editing a record that was added in the background that doesn't truly represent the record I should be editing? I realize I could use Guids, but I'd really like to know if BigInt/Autonumber is "safe" in this scenario. Thanks!
