Trying to convert some entities into value objects I am stuck in a case where what seems a value object must be unique within an aggregate. Suppose we have a **Movie** entity which makes the root of an aggregate. This **Movie** entity is related with some set of **AdvertisementEvent** objects with the role of displaying an advertisement at certain timestamp. The **AdvertisementEvent** contains a link to some **Banner** that must be displayed, the coordinates and some effect filters. Since **AdvertisementEvent** is just a _collection of configuration parameters_ I am not sure if I should care about its identity and treat it like just a large value object. However I do care that within a **Movie** there must be only one **AdvertisementEvent** at a certain timestamp, probably even _around_ the timestamps. I find hard to split my doubts in multiple independent questions, so there they go:   1. Does a _collection of configuration parameters_ sounds like a value object?   2. Am I mixing the concept of uniqueness of **AdvertisementEvent** within **Movie** and transactional integrity rule?   3. Does _any_ of the choices in point (2) implies that **AdvertisementEvent** must be a member of the aggregate made by **Movie**?   4. Is my **AdvertisementEvent** object an Entity, a Value Object or an Event Object? (I used the _Event_ suffix in the name to highlight my confusion)   5. Are large value objects like this a design smell? I guess that I am not dealing with an Event in the sense of DDD because it is not something that just _happens_. The real DDD event should be something more like _AdvertisementEventReached_
