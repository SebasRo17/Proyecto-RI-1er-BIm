I'm trying to solve this recurrence with two variables.               RSolve[g[d, n] == 1 + g[d - 1, n] + g[d - 1, n - 1] &&        g[d, 0] == g[0, n] == 0, g[d, n], {d, n}]      My boundary conditions are that `g[d, 0] == g[0, n] == 0` for all `d,n` . But when I plug this in, I get the same input back with no error message. Am I inputting the recurrence incorrectly? Or is _Mathematica_ simply unable to find a closed form?
