I am developing an Application its purpose to view uploaded files on the host server, and it has a credentials that will be entered on the Login Page to authenticate the user. When I post my application to the App Store, how suppose apple is going to test, or at least view my application, when Apple needs enter a valid credentials that I am not suppose to know? It's private to my client.
