In Wolfram's tutorial on Advanced Manipulate Functionality, a nice example of a continually evaluating `Manipulate` cell is presented:               Manipulate[       f[x_] := x^3;       Graphics[{Thickness[0.01], Line[{{0, 0}, {n, f[n]}}]},          PlotRange -> 1],       {n, -1, 1}]      If I wrap `Timing[]` around this example I get list of `0.` along with the continually evaluating `Manipulate` cell. Now can anybody make a clock that will show increasing time of evaluation of such a `Manipulate` cell? In case the `Manipulate` cell has finite execution time, the clock would show time elapsed for this execution. The motivation behind is to have measure of slow `Manipulate` cell execution.
