When I do the following simple animation (from the book _Mathematica Navigator_ , p. 316) the slider control changes the image smoothly, but when I play the animation it is jerky. Is there anything that can be done to make the animation smooth? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CNwa8.png) The code for the plot is as follows:               Manipulate[Plot[Cos[a x], {x, 0, 3 \[Pi]}], {a, 1, 10, 0.3}]      UPDATE: Changing the step value does not help; also, sometimes the animation stops completely, just gets stuck. Something appears to be seriously wrong with the animate function. _The main problem, the jerkiness, appears to be caused by Windows "User Account Control" (UAC) (see answer below). This "security" feature is present in Windows 7, 8 and Windows Vista. It can be avoided by either running Mathematica as Administrator or by turning off Windows UAC altogether._
