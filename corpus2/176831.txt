Is it possible to achieve Continuous Delivery using TFS e.g. Windows Service? There are > 1000 posts on how to use msdeploy with TFS for WEB projects. I am trying to understand why there are no resources such as blogs, articles, msdn or best practises for Continuous Delivery for Windows service using TFS. I am not sure tow to achieve the following without any working reference materials. This is so frustrating.   1.

Copy New code Base on Remote Server    4. Start Services
