I have been developing Windows applications in C++ for like 10 years now. And recently I've started digging into some Linux projects, and I can't stand how unproductive I am... I'm a fast learner, and I've been using Linux as a primary platform for some time now. And I do feel very comfortable with shell, OS principles and GUI. But when it comes to development, it feels like I'm back to school. As soon as I open some larger project, I'm stuck. Most of them are makefile based, so basically when I try to navigate them with QT or CodeBlocks, at best, I can use intellisense on a per-file basis. And most of the time variables leak from scope. Then there is a go-to-definition stuff, which seems nonexistent, try to join some larger project from sourceforge, and you're stuck for days, because navigating to definitions is so hard... `grep -r "this_def" . --include "*.cpp" --include "*.h"` seems so slow and clumsy. And then, the debugging, gdb does work, but no matter what I do, it seems like it's light years behind WinDbg or VisualStudio debugger. And these things are making me desperate, I want to write code, but it just goes so slow... I'm starting to think that Linux developers learn function definitions by heart and analyze code by eyes, but I can't believe it's so. Has anyone gone through this? Is there something that I'm missing that could make me more productive?
