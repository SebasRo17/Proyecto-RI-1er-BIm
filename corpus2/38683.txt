In MATLAB there is a nice implementation of the so called AMD (approximate minimum degree permutation) algorithm named amd (see Online MATLAB Documentation). There is an alternative algorithm called COLAMD (see Online MATLAB Documentation). This algorithm is especially interesting when one wants to model large resistor networks e.g. calculate path resistances or reduce a network of resistors (for the theory see, e.g., Efficient Methods for Large Resistor Networks). There the AMD step is a preconditioning step for a large matrix before a Cholesky decomposition (available in _Mathematica_ through _CholeskyDecomposition_ ) is done. The original fortran coded algorithms can be found on the webpage from the autors. Is anybody aware of an implementation of the AMD or the COLAMD algorithm in _Mathematica_?
