I'm pretty fresh out of college. So I don't have a lot of experience with job interviews. I'm interviewing for an entry level software developer job. I've already made it past the first phone screen and a coding challenge. Now I'm going in for a face to face technical interview. If I pass this then I probably get the job. The job description that I'm interviewing for now says I will be working mainly with C++, some C#, databases, and web development. It's a smaller comopany and my responsibilities will be a little of everything (design, documentation, coding, and QA). I bombed my last technical interview (with a different company) because I prepared by studying the crap out of all the technologies mentioned in the job description (c#, html, sql, ajax, javascript, etc) but the interview was all questions about hash maps vs binary trees, abstract classes vs interfaces, and recursion and absolutely nothing about the technologies mentioned in the job description. Which I would have done amazing on it if I prepared by going over everything I learned in college... but the last time I worked with most of the stuff he asked about was my sophomore year in college so i was very rusty. Anyway, I'm just looking for some advice on my situation. Should I focus on the computer science stuff that I learned in college like data structures, algorithms, recursion, etc. or should I focus on the technologies they mention in the job description? Any advice from someone with experience would be greatly appreciated.
