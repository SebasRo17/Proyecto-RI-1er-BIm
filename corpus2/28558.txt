Ok, so I'm exporting a video to MOV format that is coming from a manipulate function (I'm demonstrating CLT to a class that doesn't have calculus as a pre-req, if anyone is curious). Anyhow, I'm mostly happy with it, but ideally I'd like it to not generate the frames of the video linearly, but rather spend more frames on the front section and decrease as it approaches the max boundary. Is this possible? This is the current code:               manr = Manipulate[        Resample = Table[Mean[RandomChoice[SetAll, Length[SetAll]]], {Samples}];        Histogram[Resample, Axes -> {False, False}, ImageSize -> Large], {Samples, 100, 100000},         AutorunSequencing -> {Automatic, 30}];     Export["~/desktop/sam.mov", manr]
