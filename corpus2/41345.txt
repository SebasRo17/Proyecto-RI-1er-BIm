I am trying to solve partial differential equations of the type $y^{(1,0)}(t,x) = f(y^{(0,1)}(t,x), y(t,x_0))$ where $x_0$ is a fixed point. For example, when pluging this into Mathematica :               NDSolve[{D[y[t, x], t] == D[y[t, x], x] + y[t, 1], y[0, x] == Cos[x]}, y, {x, 0, 2}, {t, 0, 2}]      I get the error message               NDSolve::delpde: Delay partial differential equations are not currently supported by NDSolve. >>      The problem is cured by replacing `y[t, 1]` by `y[t, x] DiscreteDelta[x-1]` ; however I do not find this trick very elegant. Do you know of a better way to circumvent this problem?
