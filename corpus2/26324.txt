I have an $n\times n$ matrix `G` with elements `g[i,j]` that I construct with `Table[g[i, j], {i, 1, n}, {j, 1, n}]` I have tried without success to write a code without loops in Mathematica that rearranges these elements to a vector in a certain way. To illustrate the case $n=4$: $$ G=\begin{pmatrix} g[1,1]&g[1,2]&g[1,3]&g[1,4]\\g[2,1]&g[2,2]&g[2,3]&g[2,4]\\g[3,1]&g[3,2]&g[3,3] &g[3,4]\\g[4,1]&g[4,2]&g[4,3]&g[4,4]\end{pmatrix} \longrightarrow \begin{pmatrix} g[1,1]-g[2,2]\\g[2,2]-g[3,3]\\g[3,3]-g[4,4]\\g[1,2]-g[2,3]\\g[2,3]-g[3,4]\\g[2,1]-g[3,2]\\g[3,2]-g[4,3] \end{pmatrix} = \widetilde{G} $$ I.e, I'm trying to find a way to create a vector where every element is a subtraction between two diagonally consecutive elements in $G$, starting on the central diagonal, working its way to the right and then starting over under the central diagonal working its way to the left. For a fixed $n$ this could easily be done manually, but with my limitations in Mathematica I have not found a way to do this with arbitrary integers.
