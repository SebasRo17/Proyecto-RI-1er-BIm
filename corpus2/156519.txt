I'm very new to GIT/GitHub (as new as starting yesterday). I would like to know what is the best way to manage multiple people working on the same project with Github. Currently I'm managing one project with four developers.   1. How do I go about the workflow and making sure everything is in sync? (Note: All developers will have one universal account.)   2. Does each developer need to be on a different branch?   3. Will I be able to handle 2 people working on the same file? Please post a detailed answer, I'm not a shy reader. I need to understand this well.
