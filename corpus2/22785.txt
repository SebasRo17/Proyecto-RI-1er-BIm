I wonder if anybody can help, I need a hand with a simple simulation I am writing with Mathematica (I am using version 8). Basically it creates a list (called l) with numbers from 1 to n and a random number v in the same interval. Then it draws a random number s from l and checks if it is equal to v. If s is not equal to v, that number is dropped from l and another s is drawn and so on, the cycle stops when s=v. The number i is used to count the draws and the list k to show all the i's. Here is the code with n=5000 and 5 runs               n = 5000;     runs = 5;     (* initialization *)     k = ConstantArray[0, runs];     Table[      {v = RandomInteger[{1, n}];       s = 0;       i = 0;       l = Range[1, n];       While[s != v,         s = RandomChoice[l];        p = Flatten[Position[l, s]];        l = Drop[l, p];        i = i + 1;];       k[[j]] = i}      , {j, 1, runs}]     k      The problem is I would like to run thousands of simulations with n raging from 30000 to 50000, but this code is way too slow. Is there a way to speed it up?
