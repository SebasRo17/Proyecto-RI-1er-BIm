I am going through 2 ebooks on ASP.NET MVC and SignalR . **SignalR: Real-time Application Development** Released in 2013 **Introducing ASP.NET MVC 4 Fourth Edition** Released in 2012 As i have been going through these books and writing out the code I have been told by visual studio that some of the code is obsolete. With MVC the section was on security and signalR on the main map connection. As of this question Entity Framework has just released its 6th version and now everyone is starting on WEB API as opposed to WCF. This is all very intimidating to say the least. Besides having to learn all these technologies, we also have to keep up to date with new releases every few months. In a standard web app there is ASP.NET /MVC, EF, SQL, jQuery, jQuery Lib( knockoutjs etc), HTML5 + CSS3, WEB API, Deployment environment setup. And these technologies are changes so fast. Its very often i come across old code looking for answers and to realize there are conflicts with other libraries, serious security concerns or bad practice for maintainability and testing. My question is. How can i stay up to date with all of this?
