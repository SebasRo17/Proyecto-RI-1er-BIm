Consider the following:               list={{a,b,c},{c,d,e},{d,e,f},...{x_,y_,z_}};      I would like to apply `Union` on the elements of the list in the following way               Union[{a,b,c},{c,d,e},{d,e,f},...{x_,y_,z_}];      The problem `Union[list]` does not return the desired result when applied on `list`. Please consider the following example:               list={{10,2,3},{2,3,4},{2,3,50}};     Union[list]      The same problem occures with `Intersection`.               (* Out={{10,2,3},{2,3,4},{2,3,50}} *)      Instead of               Union[{10,2,3},{2,3,4},{2,3,50}]     (* Out={2,3,4,10,50} *)
