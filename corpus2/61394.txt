A while ago I stumbled upon the concept of using spreadsheets (I mean cells and formulas not Macro code) as a way to specify programming logic. The idea is:   * create a spreadsheet with a cleanly defined flow of calculations (which sometimes are better suited to the "dataflow" paradigm of spreadsheets instead of procedural or object oriented programming styles)    * define input cells   * define output cells   * compile the whole thing into a stand-alone executable class (or function, procedure, ...)   * use it in normal code within a broader software project   * use the spreadsheet as source code to be maintained over time The idea is to use this technique for problems the really fit into the model and that this would lead to naturally well-documented and easy maintainable code. I am interested in knowing whether you have experienced using the technique and what for. An example application that came to my mind are insurance tariff calculators, that are typically drafted, created and validated by actuaries on Excel sheets and only later coded (it's a painful process) in some hard-to-maintain programming logic.
