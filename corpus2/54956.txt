In many of the inbuilt mathematica function, variables appear aqua like in: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/flHO1.png) However, when creating your own function, variables no longer have that green coloring and are instead colored like an undefined variable ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/m1xqw.png) Is there any way to define functions so that variables used in arguments like in the manner above can get the aqua syntax coloring?
