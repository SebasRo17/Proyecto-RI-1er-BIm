Below I post some rudimentary code to show that there is something wrong using Goto and Label commands in compiled functions (or I believe there is something wrong). It seems that the command Label is not found. Does anybody know what's going on?               toy=Compile[{{x,_Real}},       Label["t"];       y=RandomReal[{-1.,1.}];       If[x*y<-0.,Print[y*x];Goto["t"],Print[y*x," ","done"]]     ];          toy[1.]     (*Goto::nolabel: "Label ("t") not found.*)
