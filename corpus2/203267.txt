I am confused to understand the structure of a 3 layer programm. Where is good place for exceptions, entity and etc.? If I use MVC, in my UI model, how to transfer entity class to model class and etc.? I have created a project that called Ramznegar. It is web project. In this a user can register and get a account. Then login and can create category, like gmail, yahoo, etc... In each category user can add any item and its password. This programm actually is password keeper. For developing this program I created four project with following structure:   1. RamznegarDAL: contains all DAO file    2. RamznegarBLL: contains logic of the program. like password decrypt and encrypt class   3. RamznegarUI : contains all `JSP` and `Servlet` class.    4. entity : contains 2 type of classes. `entity` (like Category, Item and User class) and `exceptions` (include all exception class that use in program like `DataSourceAccessException`)   `RamznegarDAL` use `entity` as library.   `RamznegarBLL` use `RamznegarDAL` and `entity` as library `RamznegarUI` use `RamznegarBLL` and `entity` as library. Now, please say me this structure is correct or if I have a problem with 3 layer concept.
