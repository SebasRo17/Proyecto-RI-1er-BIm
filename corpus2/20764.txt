In the last 3-5 months I was thinking about which web programming language I should use. PHP? Ruby? C#? Python? Perl? And you know what? Every time I keep changing my mind like crazy! I learn some things about each one of them and then move to another. Now I'm totally lost, totally lost guys. :) What I want form you is to help me to decide, not to decide for me, and give me some recommendations. It would be more than helpful if you can tell me a short story about yourself, how you got started, where you are now and what web programming technologies you are using.
