Here's a list of images:               images = Table[ExampleData[i], {i, ExampleData["TestImage"]}];      And according to the reference "Export exports a list of graphics, images, or arbitrary expressions, taking each element to be an animation frame." This is on the reference page for .avi. However,               Export["animation.avi", images]      causes this: > Export::errelem: "The Export element !(\"ImageList\") contains a malformed > data structure and could not be exported to !(\"AVI\") format." What's the problem? (Export["film.avi", ListAnimate[images]] works, but I want to know why the above doesn't work...)
