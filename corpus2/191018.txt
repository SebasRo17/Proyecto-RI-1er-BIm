From WCF standpoint, just wondering whether I can leverage anything after upgrade from `Silverlight 4` to `Silverlight 5`? I did some research regarding new features of `SL5` and cannot find anything about changes to `System.ServiceModel` and `System.ServiceModel.Web` namespaces, is it rigth that nothing were added or am I missing something? **My Questions:**   * Have there been any changes to WCF in Silverlight 5?   * If yes, has there been any changes to duplex polling on HTTP?
