I am running Mathematica 10 and I have a mathematica file, MBdebug.m, that contains the line                val = Import["! ./MBpart1ep0", "Table"];      MBpart1ep0 is an executable generated by a fortran program and has been tested to generate 3 numbers by running `./MBpart1ep0` on a Linux terminal (see below). These 3 numbers are used when the Mathematica notebook MBresolveDebug.nb is ran.               $ ./MBpart1ep0     0.4940656458412465-323   8.651144521298990       495.6336980600139      However, it seems like these values are not imported into the Mathematica Table or val. **How can I get these numbers imported into Mathematica?** You can see for yourself if you download and run these files. The README_debug.txt contains the simple 4 steps of instructions. * * * As a debugging step to make sure Import is working, I made a perl file, `get3numbers`, and tested on the Linux terminal:               $ ./get3numbers     11 22 33      Then I edited MBdebug.m to read `val = Import["! ./get3numbers", "Table"];` and ran MBresolveDebug. These 3 test numbers are set to val and Table.
