I have found no way to define the domain of `Irrational` numbers. I can easily define a test to see if a number is irrational by defining:               IrrationalQ[z_] := Element[z, Reals] && ! Element[z, Rationals]          IrrationalQ /@ Sqrt /@ Range[10]          > >     {False, True, True, False, True, True, True, True, False, True} >   My question is how can I define a domain that would work with `Element`, something like               Element[Sqrt[2], Irrationals]      I am aware that the documentation list possible domains as `Booleans, Complexes, Integers, Primes, Rationals, Reals`, but it is not clear to me if that list is exclusive or not.
