`SemanticImport` misinterprets rows with trailing blanks. Note the commas in the 2nd column: SemanticImport["https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0Ati- pfGwn22sdGt1T3E4S3NFYWxmQXY2ZUJ0MmhXd2c&output=csv", Delimiters -> ",", HeaderLines -> 1] ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cHGfq.png) `Import[...,Delimiters->","]//Dataset` doesn't recognize the header line identifiers as keys. (Note Google has deprecated csv web pub of gsheets)
