I realized that there are lots of advantages to driving C/C++/FORTRAN code directly from Mathematica as LibraryLink functions (instead of running them from the command line or a shell script, as I have usually done before). This will give access to a lot of functionality that is difficult or time consuming to implement in a low level language (example). There are disadvantages too, mainly because the running environment is typically a remote server, and not a local workstation (i.e. I don't get a notebook GUI). So, to get around some of the disadvantages, **Is the following feasible to implement (see below)?** Can we have a Mathematica master kernel running a remote kernel, running parallel calculations in subkernels, and do the following: While the calculation is running, connect to the master computer through MathLink from a laptop; check the state of the calculations, perhaps do some quick-to-compute preliminary analysis on the so far calculated results; make decisions about continuing the calculation or not; then disconnect. It should be possible to connect to and disconnect from the server as many times as necessary without aborting the calculations for good. Do you think that such a thing is (theoretically) possible to implement with the current version of Mathematica? Or perhaps the current features are not general enough to allow it? Before sitting down to study the documentation in detail and try to implement this, I was wondering if anyone is aware of any showstopper limitations (or if anyone has tried to implement it).
