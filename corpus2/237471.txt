I would like to bring our specifications to a better level of fine-grained definition of syntaxes, semantics and the like. I read my fair share of RFCs and just love the way they define things like "how an email adress looks like" or "what a correct URL is". But, I haven't yet found a definition of the syntax of those definitions. Like, e.g. how do you define optional parts? How do you define repetition? How to correctly define alternatives (`/` vs `|`) Is there an RFC that defines the syntax all those other RFCs use to define their actual domain-specific definitions that I could adapt to our specifications?
