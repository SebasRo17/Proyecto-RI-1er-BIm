During one of my studies into the intricacies of C#, I came across an interesting passage concerning explicit interface implementation. `While this syntax is quite helpful when you need to resolve name clashes, you can use explicit interface implementation simply to hide more "advanced" members from the object level.` The difference between allowing the use of `object.method()` or requiring the casting of `((Interface)object).method()` seems like mean-spirited obfuscation to my inexperienced eyes. The text noted that this will hide the method from Intellisense at the object level, but why would you _want_ to do that if it was not necessary to avoid name conflicts?
