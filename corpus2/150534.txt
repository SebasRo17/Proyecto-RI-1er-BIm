Im working on a Java Software and there is a need to use some extern libraries. I found two relevant libs. The one is on an AGPL and the other on the MIT License. Now Im asking my self, can I use these libs if:   * I would make a non-opensource-nonfree-software or   * I would make a non-opensource-free-software I dont really understand the whole license stuff, could somebody tell me which one of the libs for what kind of software would be better? Thank you
