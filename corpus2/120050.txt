I am taking a module called "Requirements Analysis & Design" in a local university. Common module, I'd say (on software development life cycle (SDLC) and UML). But there is a lot of things I wonder if they are actually (strictly) practiced in the industry. For example, will a domain class diagram, an not anything extra (from design class), be strictly the output from Analysis or Discovery phase? I'm sure many times you will think a bit about the technical implementation too? Else you might end up with a design class diagram later that is very different from the original domain class diagram? I also find it hard to remember what diagrams are from Initiation, Discovery, Design etc etc. Plus these phases vary from SDLC to SDLC, I believe? So I usually will create a diagram when I think will be useful. Is it the wrong way?
