When discovering stories for the first sprint, how do you know when to stop writing and move forward? I've asked a few people I know, and basically the response I've gotten is, it depends on the context the project exists in and how timeboxed the overall project is as well. Is there any standard way for knowing when to stop writing user stories, and if so, what is the basis for this, and how does it apply to future sprints?
