Is it possible to have ListPolarPlot start plotting at the vertical axis? By Default ListPolarPlot gives this result:               ListPolarPlot[Reverse[Range[20]], PolarAxes -> True,       PolarTicks -> {"Degrees", Automatic}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/hWJu6.png) But I want it to look like this (rotated with `Rotate[%,1/2pi]`: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/q0I0n.png) Just rotating the graphic probably is the easiest way, but adding ticks and legends is a crime... I am hoping for a way to simply set the starting angle. Specifying angles at each data point and adding 1/2pi does not solve my problem because the angles in the PolarAxes would be off.
