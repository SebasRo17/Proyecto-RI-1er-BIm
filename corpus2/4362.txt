I'd like to take a polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}_5[x]$ of the form $ax^2+bx+c$ and factor it into irreducible polynomials. For example: Input...               x^2+4      Output...               (x+1)(x-1)      Note that this factorization only makes sense in $\mathbb{Z}_5[x]$ I am also interested in identifying cases which are already irreducible. For example: Input...               x^2+2      Output...               Polynomial is irreducible.      * * * So, is there a way to limit Mathematica, especially functions like `Solve` to fields other than $\mathbb{C}$?
