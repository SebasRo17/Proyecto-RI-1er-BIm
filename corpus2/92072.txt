How much experience do you need in a language before you can put it on your resume? There is one language I'm in proficient in (Java) which I would definately put on the resume but say I took I couple of semester courses in college which involved extensive programming in C or selftaught myself C# but have written no meaningful projects in it, can I put those languages on the resume without having the employer laugh at it or percieve it as resume inflation?
