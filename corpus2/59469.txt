Say I create `$UserBaseDirectory/Autoload/MyPackage/init.m` containing:               BeginPackage["MyPackage`"];     Symbol1 = 1;     Begin["`MyContext`"];     Symbol2 = 2;     End[];     EndPackage[];      When I run Mathematica:   * `Symbol1` resolves to `MyPackage`Symbol1` and is colored black, indicating it has a value assigned.   * `MyContext`Symbol2` does not resolve, but `MyPackage`MyContext`Symbol2` does. However, there is no autocompletion and the symbol is colored blue (indicating no value assigned) even after evaluation. Is it possible to configure my package such that `MyContext`Symbol2` will resolve and have all the front-end niceties?
