**UPDATED** we are running a contest using a facebook application to connect with facebook and identify users. a user follows through the standard facebook procedure to allow the application and login. the user then can vote for any entry only once. the vote is saved to avoid the same user voting twice. since the contest has a cash prize we face the problem of vote exchange. vote- exchange is the process where one individual goes to a group-page-forum-etc and trades his voting to another contest, for people voting for his entry in our contest. in essence "buying" votes. they achieve higher number through fake profiles (another problem) so we are faced with:   1. how to detect this vote exchanging    2. how to detect fake facebook profiles   3. in general how to safeguard such a procedure (with or without facebook) right now we are looking for the blindingly obvious violations   1. Very similar emails(john1@ , john2@)   2. Sudden spike in votes (in terms of timing and vote count)
