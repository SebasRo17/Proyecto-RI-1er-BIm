I have been going through the SE for quite a while but could not find a relevant answer for my question.The question is I am planning to stat a hobby project in my spare time using .NET and MVC3.I have everything set up on my box. But the biggest problem is I don't know where to begin with Shall I create a documentation first?   Start creating a web template? I am really eager to start this but need some guidance . Let me know if there are any ideas.
