What do you think about SCM-based (subrepositories in mercurial, submodules in git) dependencies management? Is it definitely a good way of managing dependencies? Or definitely bad way? Should I prefer some build system (ant/phing/rake) over subrepositories? Some particular example for you to have a context: I have several web applications that share across reusable components, say jquery plugins.
