I am trying to write a program that shows images of a Java application's GUI automatically (ie, without someone building, running, and then taking screenshots of the interface). I know WindowBuilder is a GUI designer with a WYSIWYG editor but that isn't quite what I want. For example, if given the source code (or jar) of an application as input, which has 4 frames (windows), then my tool would output 4 images of the different frames. It only needs to work on primitive and simple interfaces. Any ideas on how to go about this? **EDIT:** I would like to build this into an Eclipse plug-in that provides information to the developer about the GUI. There are plenty of plug-ins for showing the call graph in various ways, it would be neat to show a graph of the frames.
