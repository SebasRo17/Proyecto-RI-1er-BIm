An executive at my workplace asked me and my group of developers the question: > How many lines of code can a C# developer produce per month? An old system was to be ported to C# and he would like this measure as part of the project planning. From some (apparently creditable) source he had the answer of "10 SLOC/ **month** " but he was not happy with that. The group agreed that this was nearly impossible to specify because it would depend on a long list of circumstances. But we could tell that the man would not leave (or be very disappointed in us) if we did not come up with an answer suiting him better. So he left with the many times better answer of "10 SLOC/ **day** " _Can this question be answered?_ (offhand or even with some analysis)
