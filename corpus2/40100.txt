I have an expression of the form:               expr=x+y+n+Sin[n]+n^2      I would like to replace each of the variables `n` with a different variable, like:               x+y+n1+Sin[n2]+n3^2      The order doesn't matter, but it matters that each `n` have a different name. I can find the positions of the `n`'s simply with:               pos=Position[expr,n]      and this returns a list of positions `{{1}, {2, 1}, {5, 1}}` as expected. I would then like to run through this list and make replacements in those positions. However, I don't want to have to do this by hand. Clearly I could do:               expr[[5,1]]=n3      but the real expression I have is many thousands of times larger. I have tried using:               Apply[Part, Join[{expr}, pos[[3]]]]=n2      which would allow be to do this in a loop, or functionally, but this doesn't alter the element of the expression as I would like. I have tried playing with `Hold` in various places but it doesn't seem to work. Anything simple that I am missing?
