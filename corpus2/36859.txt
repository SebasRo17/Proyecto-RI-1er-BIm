Apologies if this is a duplicate, but I couldn't find it. The expression               Integrate[x^2, Flatten[{{x},{1,2}}]]      evaluates properly, to $\frac{7}{3}$. However,               NIntegrate[x^2, Flatten[{{x},{1,2}}]]      returns               NIntegrate::vars: Integration range specification Flatten[{{x},{1,2}}] is not of the form {x, xmin, ..., xmax}. >>      An explicit `Evaluate` is required on the second parameter to make this work. So I assume that NIntegrate has a `HoldAll` on its second parameter. Did I have any way of knowing this before hand? That is, is this behavior documented? And, if it is (or even if it is not), why do the two functions behave differently?
