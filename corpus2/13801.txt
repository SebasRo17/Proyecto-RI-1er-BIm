It is easy to make 3D Plots with _Mathematica_ , e.g. use:                Plot3D[Sin[x+y^2],{x,-3,3},{y,-2,2}]      But I want to have nice plots in my thesis, so I decided to use pgfplots for $\LaTeX$ together with _Mathematica_. There you can use a picture (of _Mathematica_ ) and draw with $\LaTeX$ well readable axes etc. around the picture (see e.g. p.44 et seq. here). But to use both programs together, I need plots which are in a parallel and not perspective projection. As you can see from the pic, ![Picture with perspective projection](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BNGmv.png) _Mathematica_ gives me a perspective projection. Is there a way to get a parallel projection?
