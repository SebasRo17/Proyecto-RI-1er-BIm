Defining $V(r)$ as               v[r_, r0_, s_, ep_] := 4 ep (s^12/EuclideanDistance[r, r0]^12 -                                  s^6/EuclideanDistance[r, r0]^6);      I can plot the potential with               Plot3D[Sum[v[{x, y}, r0[[i]], sig[[i]], eps[[i]]], {i, 1, 84}],             {x, -0.5, 2}, {y, -3.5, -1},             PlotStyle -> Directive[Opacity[0.35], Blue],             AxesLabel -> {x, y}, PlotRange -> {-5, 1}     ]      obtaining the following output ![plot of sum of potentials](http://i.stack.imgur.com/aYHDa.png) or, using `PlotPoints -> 50` ![refined plot of sum of potentials](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rLRqh.png) where the minima/maxima can be seen really well. The thing is, I have a lot of these objects, with a lot more elements, and a lot of minima/maxima, in a way that is very expensive for my (old) computer to simply increase `PlotPoints` for smoother graphics, and I was wondering, due the fact that $V(r)$ rapidly decreases, **if there is a way to ask _MMA_ to increase resolution near the minima/maxima, and reduce it far from the data set** `r0`. Hope my question is clear _and interesting_. **--FINAL EDIT--** First of all, I want to thank you all for your comments and answers. If I could, I'd accept _all of them_ , since each one gave me the insight needed to solve my problem. For obvious reasons, Silvia's answer deserves maximum recognition, but readers should also check PlatoManiac and  Sjoerd C. de Vries responses, as they will provide a full picture. Now, to honour the work of all the people involved, I'll show you the beautiful application of the code they've worked out. Here is a caricaturization of the _S4S5 linker_ helix, believed to play a major role in the opening and closing of voltage gated potassium channels. ![S4S5 linker helix](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IiqxA.png) This helix generates all sort of van der Waals interactions, that can be modelled by the Lennard-Jones potential. For specific reasons, I need to see how this potential looks on a given plane, namely the _XY_ plane, and it is very important to capture all the maxima and minima of it, as it will provide a full picture of the dynamics in that plane. Thanks to Silvia's code, one can see: a view from below of the potential generated by the helix, ![View from below](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y9H3t.png) a sideways view, where the peaks are actually minima, ![Sideways veiw, the peaks are actually minima](http://i.stack.imgur.com/EJ5yn.png) and a view form above, ![View from above](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WSC5p.png) What you are seeing is the van der Waals interactions generated by the helix over that plane, and if you're wondering what does that sharp barrier around the helix is, it's the macroscopic consequence of Pauli's Exclusion Principle! **Thank you all for your help, you've put a big smile on my face!**
