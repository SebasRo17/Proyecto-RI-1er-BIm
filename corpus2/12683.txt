Pseudocode helps us understand tasks in a language-agnostic manner. Is it best practice or suggested approach to have pseudocode creation as part of the development lifecycle? For instance:   * Identify and split the coding tasks   * Write pseudocode   * Get it approved [by PL or TL]   * Start Coding based on Pseudocode Is this a suggested approach? Is it practiced in the industry?
