I interested about C++, C#, Java, Python, Ruby and Perl. All this languages are very popular and I believe that each one have something that make people to choose them. What is that special thing that each of this language have that makes people to choose them? I want the answer to be in this form e.g: C# have _this_ and _this_. C# is the best option if you want to do _this_. Note: I don't asking which language is the best, i just want to know the power of each of these languages.
