If I use Spring Data Neo4j to develop a software, and I want to publish it for commercial use with charging, does there exist any license issue? I survey many posts about the license issue of Neo4j and Spring Data Neo4j. It seems Neo4j has two versions, community and enterprise, respectively. The Community version is GPL-3.0, and the enterprise version is AGPL-3.0. Spring Data Neo4j is Apache License-2.0. The role of spring data neo4j in my software: 1.It is only part of my software to deal with storing relationship and searching data. 2.I will combine it with MongoDB or DB2.
