I need to calculate a limit of a sequence given by its recurrence relation. I tried the following:               Limit[DifferenceRoot[Function[{y, n}, {           - n (1 + n)^2 (5 + 2 n) y[n]            - (1 + n) (3 + n) (11 + 14 n + 4 n^2) y[1 + n]            + (-77 - 128 n - 69 n^2 - 12 n^3) y[2 + n]            + (29 + 84 n + 79 n^2 + 30 n^3 + 4 n^4) y[3 + n]            + (3 + n)^3 (3 + 2 n) y[4 + n] == 0,            y[1] == 0, y[2] == -1, y[3] == 1/8, y[4] == -215/216       }]][n], n -> Infinity]      but it returned unevaluated.
