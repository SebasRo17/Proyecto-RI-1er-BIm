Situation: For many years, ACME corp has outsourced `Task B` to me. Over the years I've learned the ins and outs of `Task A` (manual labor). Together `Task A` \+ `Task B` = finished ACME corp product. So now I discovered an opportunity to optimize their `Task A` process. But to develop a system to help ACME corp to work more efficiently, I need to put in a lot of programming work hours up front. Maybe 1-2 years to prototype, test and finally deploy, then I'll be ready to confront them with my solution. It'll take another 1 year to successfully have them switch from the old way of doing things to my new method. So in this situation, what is the proper to way to charge? Should I just suck in everything in the beginning? Or charge them for initial development? Ultimately they will be required to pay each time they use my SaaS to complete their `Task A`. Note that my SaaS is only useful for ACME corp, I don't see much use for my SaaS product to the mass market.
