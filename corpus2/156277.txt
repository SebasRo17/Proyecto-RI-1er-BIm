My company's head of software development just "resigned" (i.e. fired) and we are now looking into improving the development practices at our company. We want to implement unit testing in all software created from here on out. Feedback from the developers is this:   * We know testing is valuable   * But, you are always changing the specs so it'd be a waste of time   * And, your deadlines are so tight we don't have enough time to test anyway Feedback from the CEO is this:   * I would like our company to have automated testing, but I don't know how to make it happen   * We don't have time to write large specification documents How do developers get the specs now? Word of mouth or PowerPoint slide. Obviously, that's a big problem. My suggestion is this:   * Let's also give the developers a set of test data and unit tests   * That's the spec. It's up to management to be clear and quantitative about what it wants.   * The developers can put it whatever other functionality they feel is needed and it need not be covered by tests Well, if you've ever been in a company that was in this situation, how did you solve the problem? Does this approach seem reasonable?
