Not looking for any code snippets here, so here goes: Let's say 100,000 users on my web app have authorized my application to connect to facebook (with or without `offline_access`). I want to build a sort of "pull" mechanism, whereby when a user posts to their facebook wall, I can grab it from the Graph API and store it locally on my server. I would assume that this would require a call to the Graph API every _n_ minutes to pull their latest wall posts. Ideally, this would be done for Twitter as well. I know LinkedIn does this, but I am not sure of the exact details. Question 1: I'd need to make an individual Graph API call for each user, right? Question 2: If I suddenly bombard the Graph API with 100k Graph API calls, wouldn't I run head-first into the rate limiter? Question 2b: If not, what if I had a million users? Surely...
