I have tried to create some Notation declarations as follows               << Notation`     Notation[Subscript[x_, i_] \[DoubleLongLeftRightArrow] x[i]]     Notation[OverBar[x_] \[DoubleLongLeftRightArrow] mean[x]]      Mathematica9 throws the following errors for the declarations > Notation::noexbtag: The external representation Subscript[x_, y_] does not > have an embedded TemplateBox with tag NotationTemplateTag. The Notation > statement Notation[Subscript[x_, y_][DoubleLongLeftRightArrow]x[y]] may not > have been entered using the palette, or the embedded TemplateBox may have > been deleted. The embedded TemplateBox ensures correct parsing and retention > of proper styling and grouping information. >> and > Notation::noexbtag: The external representation Overscript[x_, _] does not > have an embedded TemplateBox with tag NotationTemplateTag. The Notation > statement Notation[Overscript[x_ , _][DoubleLongLeftRightArrow]mean[x]] may > not have been entered using the palette, or the embedded TemplateBox may > have been deleted. The embedded TemplateBox ensures correct parsing and > retention of proper styling and grouping information. >> respectively. It is not really clear to me what is going on. I read the documentation for `TemplateBox` and looked up `NotationTemplateTag` which seems to have been replaced by `ParsedBoxWrapper`. After following some related function I thought the following might be what is required:               Notation[ToBoxes[Subscript[x_, y_]]\[DoubleLongLeftRightArrow] x[y]]     Notation[ToBoxes[OverBar[x_]] \[DoubleLongLeftRightArrow] mean[x]]      or perhaps               Notation[MakeBoxes[Subscript[x_, y_]]\[DoubleLongLeftRightArrow] x[y]]     Notation[MakeBoxes[OverBar[x_]] \[DoubleLongLeftRightArrow] mean[x]]      but both of those throw errors as well. So what is the right way to declare these notations? I am aware that setting up subscripts as a notation for function application is not something you would want to do in practice, but I am just experimenting. Also do I actually need to import the Notation package or `Notation` buit-in with Mathematica9?
