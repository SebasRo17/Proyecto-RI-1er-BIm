I've got a bunch of readings at various dates and times. I'd like to be able to interpolate and then integrate over, say days. I can do this by converting my date/time to `AbosluteTime` and get the interpolating function that way. Then by integrating and plugging in seconds as my limits of integration I get what I want. Also, since seconds in really finer than I need, I convert all of the `AbsoluteTimes` to the number of hours since the first reading. I was wondering if there might be a way to do this directly using dates. For what it's worth, my readings last for about 2 months and the values are between about 90 and 300. **SAMPLE DATA**                x[[1 ;; 5]]      > {{{2014, 8, 4, 10, 36, 0.}, 257.},{{2014, 8, 4, 16, 28, 0.}, 385.}, > > {{2014, 8, 4, 22, 53, 0.}, 176.}, {{2014, 8, 5, 6, 52, 0.}, 148.}, {{2014, > 8, 5, 11, 19, 0.}, 192.}}
