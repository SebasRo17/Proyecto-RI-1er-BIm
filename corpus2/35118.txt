Is there any way to change the general settings in Mathematica so that when I type e.g.               0.34*60000000      I get the output               20400000.      as opposed to the (for me not useful) representation               2.04*10^7      ? i.e. I want the raw number, not the formatted/adjusted form. And I do not want to use operators like SetPrecision. Ideally, I just want to change the settings so that whenever I type in a number I get the full answer. Is this possible? Perhaps using some command like SetOptions[$FrontEnd, ... ?
