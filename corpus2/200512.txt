I have an MVC 4 based web app. Where I provide 2 login types, 1. Employee and 2. Customer. With Customer login, I present a dashboard and other stuff, about his orders, etc. With Employee login, I allow the employee to search for his customers and provide the ability to carry out certain customer specific tasks. It is possible that, an employee after login can seach for a number of customers and fetch each of their details in multiple browser tab(s). I am having difficulty in maintaining state for each tab, if I put the unique identifier of the customer in session, as the next subsequent request will overwrite the session! To solve this, I have relied on a (dirty) viewbag based solution, where I set the customer number in viewbag in every view. Is there an elegant solution to solve this? a known design pattern?
