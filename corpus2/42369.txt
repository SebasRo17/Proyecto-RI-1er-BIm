Consider the following linear programming problem:               LinearProgramming[-{10, -57, -9, -24}, -( {          {0.5, -5.5, 2.5, 9},          {0.5, -1.5, -.5, 1},          {1, 0, 0, 0}         } ), -{0, 0, 1}]      (* {0., 0., 0., 0.} *)      Why is this answer being returned? Taking $\textbf{x}=\begin{pmatrix}1&0&1&0\end{pmatrix}^T$ satisfies $\textbf{x}\ge 0\land A\textbf{x}\ge \textbf{b}$, but the value of the objective function for this solution is $-1$, which is clearly smaller than $0$, the suggested "optimal" solution by _Mathematica_. I would expect _Mathematica_ to be able to solve such a small LP problem, even if it is degenerate. Am I doing something wrong here?
