I want to link several tables to a **many-to-many** (m2m) table. One table would be called **location** and this table would always be on one side of the m2m table. But I will have a list of several tables for example:   * Cards   * Photographs   * Illustrations   * Vectors Would using GUID's between these tables to link it to a single column in another table be considered 'Good Practice'? Will Mysql let me to have it automatically cascade updates and delete? If so, would multiple cascades lead to an issues? ![Diagram example of proposed structure](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BR6LX.jpg) ## UPDATE I've read that GUID (a hex number) Generally takes up more space in a database and slows queries down. However I could still generate 'unique' ids by just having the table initial's as part of the id so that the table card's id would be c0001, and then Illustrations be I001. Regardless of this change, the questions still stands.
