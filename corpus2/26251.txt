I need some help with this: I have imported data from an Excel file and I need to make a contour plot of it. The data are in table-like form. Here is a sample of the first few 'rows':               {{{"",  0.4,      0.5,      0.6,     0.7,     0.8,     0.9,     1.},        {0.3, 0.00122,  0.00182,  0.00247, 0.00311, 0.00382, 0.00453, 0.00524},        {0.4, 0.000949, 0.00149,  0.0021,  0.00272, 0.00337, 0.00406, 0.00477},        {0.5, 0.000714, 0.00123,  0.00176, 0.00233, 0.00295, 0.00361, 0.00425},        {0.6, 0.000519, 0.000982, 0.00147, 0.002,   0.00257, 0.00317, 0.00382},      ...}}      In the first row I have values for one metric in each cell, let’s say from 0.2, 0.3,…,1. In the first column I have values for the second metric, with values 0.3,0.4,….1. The upper corner is blank, if we consider it as table. I need triplets of numbers created like this: I take a value from the first/main row, a value from the first/main column, and the value at their intersection. So the first triplet would be `{0.4, 0.3, 0.00122}`... If I insert the data manually, I get exactly what I want with `ListContourPlot[{x1,y1,f1},{x2,y2,f2},...]`. But it takes a lot of time and seems rather nonsense! At a second level, I would like to transpose the axes and make a second contour plot. So the first triplet would now be `{0.3, 0.4, 0.00122}` etc. Since I’m new to _Mathematica_ and with no knowledge of programming I am not sure how to get what I want. Some attempts I made were in vain.
