I want to release all my future FOSS projects under a "public domain" license such as CC0. This is in order to avoid the requirement for attribution present in most FOSS licenses, mainly when the code is compiled into a binary, but also when somebody decides to copy a small portion of my code into their own open source project. So suppose somebody copies a method from my code into their own, which they are planning to release under an MIT license. In order to release the code under MIT, they must claim copyright of the code; but can they claim copyright of the whole if a portion of the code was not their creation? Is that what it means to claim copyright of a derived work? It may seem strange that somebody could take a piece of public domain code, modify it, and apply a new license to the modified version that imposes further restrictions on its usage, such as the attribution requirement of MIT. But since their additional restrictions would apply only to the modified version and not the original version, this seems legitimate. My main concern is maximizing the ways in which people can utilize my code, without worrying about licensing requirements, and also to avoid a viral effect where any derivative works have to be themselves licensed under CC0.
