I have a domain expert to work with, but he would throws a lot of details to me verbally. The business logics are complex, business rules change often, the business process is long and multi-ending / intermediate wait-state. There are a lot of cases to deal with (because there are many states for the account, product and subscription). What's the best way to deal with it? BPMN diagram isn't even low level enough to explain. Written documentations are time consuming to write and read. UML state diagram can become crazily complex very soon. Any advice would be appreciated.
