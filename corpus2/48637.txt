I need to create a `Do` loop that distributes letters in a list of lists. I also need to be able to cycle back through to the beginning of the list. For example, I need to change               list={{a},{a},{a},{a},{a},{a},{a},{a}}       to > >     {{a,b},{a},{a,b},{a},{a,b},{a},{a,b},{a}}.   >   But, I need to add the `b` to `list[[5]]`, then `list[[7]]`, then `list[[1]]`, then `list[[3]]`. Is there any way to use a do function to do that or should I find another method?
