I am senior developer/architect who knows the business domain really well. My new manager wants me to manage a team (yet to recruit of around 5 people) and in the past I have worked in an agile environment but as a developer. So I was involved in the writing user stories, working with stake holders, estimating via story points and all the development work involved in getting to the end of a sprint/project. I would like to carry on working as a developer and spend most of my time in the depth of writing code but my manager believes only 10% of my time will involved in the management side (i.e. creating product logs, agile estimation etc). He has never worked on an agile project. I am still reading up on all that involved in managing an agile project so it is hard for me to say how much of my time will be involved. My question is how much of my time will be spent on working on the side of managing an agile project? This is something I would like to do but I am not sure if I want to do this if I spend all my time on the management side.
