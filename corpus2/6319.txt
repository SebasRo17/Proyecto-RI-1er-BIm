Assume that we have a prior distribution for the probability of success as follows.               p = BetaDistribution[6, 14]      which we can graph as this               Plot[Evaluate[PDF[p, k]], {k, 0, 1}]      I would like to use Mathematica to calculate the _posterior_ distribution given that we take a sample and we get 420 successes out of a sample size of 1830. what would be to calculate it and graph it? Regards.
