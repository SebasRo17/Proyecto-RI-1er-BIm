I want to generate a network of random cells like the following picture: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xYo3t.jpg) The general idea is to generate some random points (x,y) as coordinate of a vertex and then randomly choose some of these points to connect them to achieve (almost) a random cellular network since there are two constraints:   1. The length of edges is constant.   2. Degree of each vertex is 3. Thanks, _Update_ I have been thinking about this problem for a while. Here's the conclusion: By starting from a perfect honeycomb, we perform a series of random "neighbor switching" process: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6kOLg.png) By performing successive neighbor switching, we are able to build cells with different size.
