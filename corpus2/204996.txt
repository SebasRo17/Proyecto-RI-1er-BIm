I have a behaviour that I'd like to use in different classes. Those classes are unrelated to each other (no inheritance). I'm using AS3, where multiple inheritance is not possible. I could use an interface but then I'd have to rewrite the same implementation every time, which is basically what I'm doing now (but without the interface). As en example I have many situations where I have an icon and a text label. In buttons, signs, etc. I'd like to centralise the alignment behaviour between the icon and the label. What is the best OOP pattern for that?
