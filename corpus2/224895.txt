In my database I have a table that looks like this Master(ID, Name, Attr1...). Every ID will have at least 1 entry in additional tables that have additional attributes. Those tables specialize the master table. Spec1(MasterID, Attr2,...) Spec2(MasterID, Attr3,...) ... So, not sure how to map this to object oriented design. If every ID could have just one specialization then it would be easy, master would be abstract class and specializations would be concrete inherited classes but in this scenario, single ID can have all specializations and they could be added or removed during his lifetime in the database. Each specialization has unique business rules ofc.
