I am trying to use `ColorFunction` for 2 functions on the same plot. I only want the cubic equation to change colour.               Plot[{-x^3 + 3.5*x + 0.5, y = 2.9*Tanh[5 x] + 0.3}, {x, -2.5, 2.5},            PlotRange -> {-3, 3.5}, Axes -> False, Frame -> True, FrameTicks -> None,            PlotStyle -> {{Darker[Green], Thick}, {Blue, Thick}},            ColorFunction -> Function[{x, y}, If[x > 1, Red, Black]],            ColorFunctionScaling -> False, PlotStyle -> Thick]      This is what the code above produces: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1Q6T6.jpg) This is ideally how i would like it to be displayed. Is this possible in _Mathematica_ without using the drawing tool? ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vNC8Y.jpg)
