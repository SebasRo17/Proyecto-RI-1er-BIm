I currently have a planning tool using SQL tables that are sort of setup like this:   * Date table (Contains dates & indicates if that day is a weekend / holiday etc)   * Employee (Simple data)   * Project (Simple data)   * Assignments (Associates the three tables, key date + employee id + project id) I have one SQL query that, for a specific month/year, a joined list of employees + dates + assignment, e.g. 01/01/2014 employee_1 project_1. In case of no assignments, it returned the date anyway, as this makes it the most manageable on the front-end. I was toying around with node.js & mongodb for the first time today, and was wondering if my setup is something that could translate well to NoSQL. I really like the idea of using the JSON notation all the way, but I figure that this might be one of those cases where I'm better off with a RDBMS?
