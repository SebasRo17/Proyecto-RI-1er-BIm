Building on this question, what is the most efficient counting function for **_distinct_** prime factors? It would obviously be more efficient if `Prime` and `PrimePi` were used instead of `PrimeNu`, as _ybeltukov_ and _Coolwater_ used in their brilliant solutions to the `PrimeOmega` counting function question. I was wondering whether there was any way to do something similar in this instance? The best I have so far is a (very) minor modification of _ubpdqn's_ reply to my previous question:               cnt[k_, n_] := Last@Reap[Sow[1, PrimeNu@#] & /@ Range[n], k, Total@#2 &]
