For an assignment, I have to find out which of the Gang of Four design pattern the classes `java.io.Reader` and its subclasses `java.io.PushbackReader`, `java.io.BufferedReader` and `java.io.FilterReader` were built with. According to this post, the design pattern would be the Decorator Pattern. This only makes sense to me if `PushbackReader`, `BufferedReader` and `FilterReader` can be decorated to be used at the same time, creating effectively a `BufferedPushbackFilterReader`. Is that the idea?
