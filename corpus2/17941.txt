I have been trying to find the value for the parameter `kestim` that yields the best fit of a model to some data points. `datac` has **25 data points** , but I illustrate with just a few. I tried to do the fitting after using `ParametricNDSolveValue`:               datac={{0,73},{300,605},{600,1244},{900,1874},{1200,2000},{1500,2900},{1800,3300}};          pfun = ParametricNDSolveValue[{       [MODEL]       } /. parameters,       {G,T,H,Y,U},       {t, 0, 7200}, {kestim}]               (*because variable Y is the one I am interested, I specify it in the next command*)     f[x_]:=pfun[x][[4]]               (*I evaluate `f[1.1][600]` I get the correct value of variable `Y`. I then fit it to the data.*)     fit = NonlinearModelFit[datac, f[kestim][t], {kestim}, {t}]      Yet, I get the error `Part::partw: "Part 4 of \!\(\*TagBox[RowBox[{\"ParametricFunction\" [etc etc] does not exist.>>` and the output `FittedModel[InterpolatingFunction[{{0.,7200.}},<>][t]]`. From the latter I am able to extract the value of `kestim`, although the value obtained for this parameter is not significant. I know I am not providing enough information, but I really cannot show my model here. Yet, do you think you could help me find what I am doing wrong? Thank you so much! **Edit** : What was going wrong was probably the `ReplaceAll` inside `pfun`. Now it is working. I provide a draft version of the model below:               pfun = ParametricNDSolveValue[{       G'[t] == 50 - 6*^3 T[t] G[t], G[0] == 0,       T'[t] == 73 H[t] - 11 T[t], T[0] == 25000,       H'[t] == ke (1 - T[t] - H[t]) - 73 H[t], H[0] == 0       },       {G,T,H},       {t, 0, 7200}, {ke}];               (*as per suggestion of @ruebenko*)     f[ke_?NumericQ] := pfun[ke][[3]]          f[1.1][600]     (*Out=0.0135135*)
