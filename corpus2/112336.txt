I work for a small company where I maintain a number of project all at once. I would like to create a blog and note software changes/update so that I can keep track of things. Plus it will also serve as help tool for other if they need help. I would like to install something locally on my machine or network, either ASP or PHP is fine. **Which software would you recommend? Is it good idea, bad idea? Has anyone done it? I have worked with wordpress and I like it but I am afraid it is not best for code snippets.** Any thoughts I do use source control. I am not an expert on it though. I use three different development environment. 1. Visual Studio 2. Eclipse 3. SQL Server Management Studio
