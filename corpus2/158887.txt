I'm interacting with Git through GitHub for Windows, which is funny since I'll never push my repository to GitHub. I'm working on it alone and it's intended to be used only by me. I noticed that my commits are listed under "unsynced commits" and under "history" it says "no commits". Which brings me to the question, what will I achieve by pushing except my commits listed under "history"?
