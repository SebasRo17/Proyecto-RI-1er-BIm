So I thought I had a perfect use-case for a CLR SQL Procedure. I've search the Net for perhaps a similar example where data is retrieved, records added and updated. I have not looked at a SQL CLR procedure for awhile, but since it was released in 2005 (some 6 years ago!) I would have hoped there were plenty of examples! I'm considering it because I have to look at some data, run it through a bunch of procedural logic, update, and then get it back to the client. My thinking here is to get as close to the DB metal as possible, and use that hardware to make it happen quickly. Is anybody using SQL CLR? If you have, what has been your experience with it? p.s. originally posted on stackoverflow and moved here based on a comment.
