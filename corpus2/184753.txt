I would like to know more about the general concepts behind dividing data of a database into different servers. For example, suppose I have a SQL Server database which has a massive table. Assume one single server cannot handle the amount of data in this table. I would like to break that table down and split its contents among different servers with an identical database (replicated). Now, suppose I have a single SQL (ADO) connection to any one of these servers, and choose to select records from this particular table. Since the data is in separate databases on separate servers, I need to gather the records from all the various servers and combine them into one. I'm sure there's standard ways of accommodating for this, and I'm willing to go another route than a direct SQL Server connection (I plan to wrap it in my own HTTP Server API anyway) but I'm still going to use SQL Server as the actual engine. What is the most standard practice and where can I learn more about it?
