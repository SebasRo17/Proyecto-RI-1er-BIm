I am trying to integrate a spectrum I obtained from a fourier transform infrared spectroscopy experiment, in order to determine the global warming potential of green house gases. In order to do this, I would like to integrate the spectrum that I have in chunks of 10 wave numbers (x axis is wave numbers). IE, I would like to generate a list that has the integral from 525 - 535 in the first slot, 535-545 in the next slot Here is a link to my data: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5gGZ4-SD7-ZZDRoNE5XMzFnYnM/edit?usp=sharing               data = Import["/home/marco/Documents/Mathematica/GlobalWarming/nitrogenforMathematicaTest.csv"]     spectraInterp = Interpolation[data, InterpolationOrder->3] (* Here we  create an interpolation function to represent our data *)               ListPlot[data]     Plot[spectraInterp[x], {x,525,1400}, PlotRange->{{525, 1400}, {0, 0.3}}]     NIntegrate[spectraInterp[x], {x,600,1400}]
