I was at work last week and one of our "lead developers" (who said he has programmed C++ before, but I don't believe him) was talking about C++ and how our team of developers who only know PHP would not have a hard time at all learning C++. My first reaction was pure shock and then I laughed at his comment. He gave me a bad look and i asked if he was serious. Me personally I program a lot of C and C++ for mostly school projects and coding competitions. I don't think it's at all like PHP. I asked him why they were the same and he could not give me an answer (he doesn't know C++ at all I was thinking). Then I said "OK, yeah they both use curly braces and have conditional statements. But C++ you have to worry about memory management and all the easy to use built in functions in PHP, for example the array functions, are non-existent in C++. You actually have to know the algorithms behind them.". There are some great C++ libraries (STL, Boost) that will make your life easier but C++ is like PHP, come on! If you already know one language it will make it a little easier to learn another because you will already be good at boolean login (if this then that) or looping but there is just so much more to C++ than PHP. Like you have to compile the language and actually have to define what type of variable you are using and returning from functions. What do you think? EDIT: Actually what he said was "C++ is not much different than PHP"
