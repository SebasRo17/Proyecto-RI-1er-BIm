I want to make my application faster. I tried to replace an `If` condition with operators. The `If` condition is               list = Range[4000];     Table[If[list[[i]] == 4000, Print[1], Print[2]],      {i, 4000}]; // AbsoluteTiming      Output is > {7.739443, Null} Using operators:               Table[(list[[i]] == 4000 && (Print[1]; True) || Print[2]), {i,      4000}]; // AbsoluteTiming      Output is > {3.194183, Null} Both give the same output but the execution time using operators is faster than `If` condition. Can you tell me which one is useful that does not have future problems as well?
