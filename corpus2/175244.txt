I have just started learning Android App Development a few days ago, with prior knowledge of C/C++, HTML and CSS. This is the situation I am facing Repeatedly: I am learning from a Video Tutorial Series, after each video, or each few videos, I say myself: Let's use what I have just learnt in the simple (and also "meaningless") app that I have made so far by watching the tutorials. I start implementing it, but then after a few minutes, I realize that I cannot do it because I do not know a few other syntax related to the particular thing, (or) I do not know whether these things can be combined with these other things by the use of . (dot). Whatever I try, I get either an error in eclipse or "Sorry...the app com.example.simple has stopped unexpectedly...." when the app runs. Then I search StackOverflow, Google and learn that what I want to implement requires learning about a few more classes, syntax and creating a few more java classes. I am not able to experiment on my own. Is it normal? Is it the HARD-WAY in which one is supposed to learn? Should I first learn Java and then come back to Android - would that be helpful?
