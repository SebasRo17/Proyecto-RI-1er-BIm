What is your methodology when you need to determine the cost of UI design if you know the cost (work hours) of programming in some project? Let's say, programming of logic in some project cost X dollars. Is there some general percentage (like 30% of programming costs) which can help determine the cost of design? The area of interest is mobile phones development (mainly business tools and 2D games, not 3D at all). There is less design work here comparing to a web design or a PC game design.
