I passed first two technical interviews at a global e-commerce company for the position of senior software engineer. I was told that there are two more interviews, one with a senior development executive and another with a person from human resources (HR).   1. What kind of questions I should expect during the interview with the senior development executive? Is is technical, high level architecture related, etc.?   2. During HR interviews, is it ok to ask about the work-life balance and actual working hours?
