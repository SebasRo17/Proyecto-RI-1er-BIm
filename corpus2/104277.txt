This question is not a duplicate - I'm not asking about the best books. Rather, I'm asking for the best order in which to study. I'm new to programming but I finished a very, very simple book (Beginning C# 3.0: An Introduction to Object Oriented Programming) and wrote some simple programs. These are the books I plan to read from here: Pro C# 2010 and the .NET 4 Platform C# 4.0 in a Nutshell: The Definitive Reference CLR via C# C# in Depth, Second Edition What would be the best order in which to study them?
