A follow-up of Languages on a resume: Is it better to put "C/C++" or "C, C++"? Would you list `C++/CLI` on your resume? How? How would a resume reviewer initially react to it if `C++/CLI` is new to the reviewer? Will the reviewer feel that the candidate is not precise enough, just like resumes which list `C/C++` instead of `C, C++`? Will a resume parser splits them into two parts `C++`, `CLI` by using the slash as separator? Is it even a language? (Or, a _"glue language"_ )
