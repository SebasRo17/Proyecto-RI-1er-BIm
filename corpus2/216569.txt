I am involved with an international research project which involves many different universities, national labs, and companies. The project is developed by national grants and in-kind support. One task in the project is to develop code to streamline workflow in our domain (energy simulation) by scripting common pre- and post-processing tasks for different tools. We want this code to be freely distributable to the simulation community. How can we ensure that this effort is digestible by the legal departments of these different parties such that the people involved can freely code?
