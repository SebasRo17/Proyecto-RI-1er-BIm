I'm having hard times transforming a math formula to code. I can solve it on the paper easily, but it's hard for me to bring it into code form. Is it generally possible to bring a math formula _directly_ into a program, or, if not, how can it be transferred? Taking, for example, the Pythagorean Theorem: `a² + b² = c²`. Having `a` and `b` defined in the code, it is straight forward to apply this formula.               c = sqrt(pow(a, 2) + pow(b, 2))      Currently, I'm having hard times bringing the line-line intersection, that I've solved on paper, into my program. Assuming a line being defined as `L: O + a * D`, one can find the intersection of two lines by setting them as equal.               L1: O1 + a * D1     L2: O2 + b * D2          => O1 + a * D1 = O2 + b * D2      Using pen an paper, I would have already defined values and can solve the equation by splitting the equation into three sub-equations and applying simple substituion (I hope you can read my hand writing): ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/APIIP.jpg) ## My actual problem ... is that substitution can not be applied algorithmically, or I don't know how to do. The equation `L1 = L2` must be transformed to a generalized formula that can be directly translated into code (like `a² + b² = c²`), but I don't know how. I was hoping for a step-by-step explanation (either as answer or linked) on how to come to the formula/algorithm I am searching for. I know there are quite many websites that describe the intersection of two lines, but I would like to understand how to find the algorithm **from a mathematical starting point**.
