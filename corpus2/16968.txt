I'm having difficulty understanding the `Transpose` function. I know what the transpose of a matrix is, not a problem, and I see that applying the `Transpose` function to a 3Ã—3 matrix does what is expected. What I am having difficulty with is the definition, which says: > `Transpose[list]`, "transpose the top two levels of list" Consider:               A = {{a, b}, {c, d}}     Transpose[A]      What does it mean when the definition says "transpose the top two levels of the list?" I've read about levels in lists, experimented with `TreeForm`, but something like this is giving me a lot of trouble.               A = {{{a, b}, {c, d}}, {{e, f}, {g, h}}, {{i, j}, {k, l}}}     Transpose[A, {3, 1, 2}]      Can someone help me (gently) understand the definition: > `Transpose[list,{n1,n2,...}]`, "put the $k^{th}$ level in list at level > $n_k$" ?
