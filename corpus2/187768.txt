I'm wondering, what are the white box testers using to create test cases? The actual code? Some kind of diagrams? I mean, if I am given a task to create test cases for complete branch coverage, is it possible they give me a code? Because I saw something like that:               Reader r=null;     if(condition)     {       r=new Reader();     }     r.toString();      There is an obvious bug as the last statement should be in the body of the If statement. It will be easily exposed by false-decision test case of the condition. But is it not more like unit tests? What is then the white box testers goal of testing? Wikipedia article on white-box testing states: > The tester chooses inputs to exercise paths through the code and determine > the appropriate outputs. I understand this as you choose inputs to reach the coverage and reveal possible bugs. But isn't it simple unit testing done by developers?
