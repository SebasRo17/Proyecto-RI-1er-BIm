I'm having trouble structuring my comments at the moment. I have major sections of the code that, when scrolling through the document, I want to be able to see those stand out. Examples: > This is a normal comment: > >> int money = 100; //start out with 100 money - > This is a comment to emphasize a certain part of the code: > >> / ** _*_ ** _*_ **** Set up all the money **_*_ ** _*_ ****/ But I don't like that this isn't very clean. Is there a standard way of setting up this type of a comment?
