I'm creating an MVC application in VS2012 and I reverse-engineered the models from existing Oracle tables. The tables are part of a MASSIVE database. Besides the main tables that I need to insert, update and delete from I also (on a whim) selected a few tables and views that my application only needs to read from. Now I am doubting my decision and considering deleting the less- important models. It is definitely neater to query using linq-to-entities instead of creating an oracle connection, creating an adapter, filling a dataset and reading what I need, but which is faster?
