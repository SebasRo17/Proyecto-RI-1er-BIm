I realise that               Position[{2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64}, 4]      will return               {{2}}      I would like to do something like this:               Position[{2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64}, {4, 32, 64}]      and get               {{2}, {5}, {6}}      I have searched, but can't ind anything - I am clearly missing something obvious :/
