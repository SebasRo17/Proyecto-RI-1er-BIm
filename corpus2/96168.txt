I feel as if a return statement should only return one value. When it returns multiple, things get confusing. I know since the return type in Java has to be declared, this is difficult to do, but in languages like Python it is a snap. Are multiple return values a sign of bad design or coding style? Python example                    def get_name():        # you code        return first_name, last_name
