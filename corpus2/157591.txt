I'm in the process of coding a game and almost done with the game mechanics to the point where it's pretty playable. I later discovered an open source version of the kind of game I'm making with the same mechanics, whereas I coded mine from scratch. However, in the interest of optimizing later on, I may want to adapt a small part of the open source project's code. The project is under the GNU GPL 2, and it's coded in a different language for a different framework (Android/Java versus mine on C#/XNA). What are my options as to copying functions / routines from a GPL open source project, if I would have to port the code anyways, for the language I'm using? These are not patented algorithms I'm talking about, just code I found that could possibly make my program more efficient or stamp out a bug.
