I'm job hunting so I decided to sharpen a bit of my skills. I've been working on implementing solutions to some of the "Project Euler" problems, but I would like to work on stuff which is not specific to programming. Does anyone have good resources with tests that be used to test logical reasoning skills, creativity and those kinds of things? I know some people question their value as a predictor of developer hability, but there are some HR departments which use those kinds of tests, so I wana get some preparation done. Thanks.
