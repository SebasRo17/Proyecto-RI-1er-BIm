Hello some programmers might know about the lean philosophy, building a minimal viable product Lean Startup MVP. I ask myself (when building Webapps): > "Should I put effort into writing good reusable code, testing etc." or > "Write quick and dirty code. It just works. The customer does not care what > kind of programming pattern you used etc. He/she just wants to use it." So reading the article about a MVP is a bit paradox to me. On the one hand it says: > "version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount > of validated learning about customers" on the other: > ...begin the learning process as quickly as possible So which actually has a higher priority? To me this is a trade-off between time and quality. Correct me if I did not understand it. Thanks.
