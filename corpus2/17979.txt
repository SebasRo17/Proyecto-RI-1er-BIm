While playing around with `$Pre` and `$Post` I created this very annoying piece of code:               $Post = If[# =!=       Null, (Print@"Are you sure you want to know the result?";       Print@Row@{Button["Yes", Print@#], Button["No", Null]}), Null] &;      I have not yet found a use for it (other than possibly playing pranks on Mma newbies) but it led me to the following question: How can one delete a certain cell that was created by `Print` (i.e. without selecting the cell manually)? And furthermore, how can one create a button that deletes itself upon being clicked (still evaluating the action)? Ultimately I want the button to delete both itself and the `"Are you sure..."` cell. I found out in the documentation that `PrintTemporary` objects can be deleted using `NotebookDelete`. Is there a similar way for `Print` cells? I think something similar to what I want could be done using `ChoiceDialog` and the like, but I'm really interested in deleting the `Print` cells.
