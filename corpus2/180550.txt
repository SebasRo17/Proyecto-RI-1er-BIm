Well it looks like I may be forced to build a new system in webforms after having worked exclusively in MVC for the last 3 years. Initially I didnt think this was going to be a problem except the application calls for a very large amount of ajax and rich client-side interaction, (think GMail or Facebook). Back when I was doing heavy WebForms development we were only doing small amounts of ajax. I remember AJAX update panels being an absolute nightmare. I remember I ended up using mostly straight html and using JQuery to hit ASHX handlers. Basically I know good clean ways of doing almost everything with MVC.Net but having to use WebControls and having seperate webpages everywhere seems like a night mare to me. **Does anyone know any good resources for going from MVC.Net to WebForms?** Seems like a completely idiotic thing to do in my opinion but I planning for the worst.
