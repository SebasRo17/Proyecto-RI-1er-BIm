So this may come down to me not being a very competent programmer but I am struggling with passing list from Mathematica via MathLink that aren't of integers. The final code I am hoping to get out of this will pass a list of values to a C++ function I have written and return a different list of values. I decided to learn slowly using the examples given in the Wolfram documentation center. I was able to write a simple function that received a list of integers...did some math on it...and returned a different list of integers. This worked great. If I tried to do this with a list of real values I kept getting a linker error. To simply things I removed the returning of a list of values and just decided to use the list as input and return a value. This resulted in the same linker error. I used the addtwo code from the MathLink examples supplied by Wolfram. The relevant portion of the code is:               #include "mathlink.h"     extern int sumlist(int *a, long alen);          int tot = 0;          int sumlist(int *a, long alen)     {                for(int i = 0;i<alen;i++)             {                 tot = a[i] + tot;                    }                return tot;      }      with a template file (*.tm)               :Begin:     :Function:       sumlist     :Pattern:        SumList[a_List]     :Arguments:      {a}     :ArgumentTypes:  {IntegerList}     :ReturnType:     Integer     :End:      This code works great and gives me my desired result. Now if instead I wish to pass a list of Real numbers as in the following.               #include "mathlink.h"     extern double sumlist(double *a, long alen);          double tot = 0.0;          double sumlist(double *a, long alen)     {                for(int i = 0;i<alen;i++)             {                 tot = a[i] + tot;                    }                return tot;      }      with a template file               :Begin:     :Function:       sumlist     :Pattern:        SumList[a_List]     :Arguments:      {a}     :ArgumentTypes:  {Real32List}     :ReturnType:     Real32     :End:      I am following the directions for the Command Line compiling for Microsoft visual studio from this page. I am using Microsoft visual studio 2013(which may be the problem as it technically isn't supported yet) Everything is fine until I run:               Link sumlist.obj sumlisttm.obj ml32i3m.lib /OUT:sumlist.exe      Which results in the follow error               sumlisttm.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol "float __cdecl     sumlist(float *,int)" (?sumlist@@YAMPAMH@Z) referenced in function "int __cdecl     _tr0(struct MLink *)"(?_tr0@@YAHPAUMLink@@@Z)     sumlist.exe : fatal error LNK1120: 1 unresolved externals      I have done some testing and determined that I get this error just by trying to pass the list of real values rather than integers regardless of what the function actually does. I have looked for examples of Mathematica/MathLink code and most of them only deal with lists of integers.
