I have a small problem that I cannot solve. I have two tables, one with three elements:               a = {0, L/c, 2L/c};      and the other with 9 elements, all 0:               b = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};      I would like to put the elements from table a into table b, giving so that I get the following table:               {0, L/c, 2L/c, 0, L/c, 2L/c, 0, L/c, 2L/c}      Can someone please give me some advice?
