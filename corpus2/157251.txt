I found a question (code cowboy on the team), but it was more related to "Ninja Coder" then the problem that I have. I have a team member who is a pure living example of " **Cowboy Coder** ". I do understand that one can't change people, but is a way to make him stop behaving like a "Cowboy Coder"? He refuses to listen to the team, and he recently stopped code reviews, unit testing, sharing the implementation details, etc. Yes, he "codes" fast, but his code is just a bug generator. Other team members and I are in a "bug fixing phase" and 80% of bugs comes from his code. I don't want to fix his bugs. And management is blind, or doesn't want to see this, or maybe they like his "speed". Is there any way that I (as his younger colleague by age, not his boss) can do something about it? **How can I disarm this cowboy coder?** I feel like I'm the last one who really cares about the project at all.
