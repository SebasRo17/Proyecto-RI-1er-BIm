I've recently struggling with Buttons. So I understand Buttons have the form `Button["text",action]`. Now I want the `action` to be some sort to function defined to show a progress bar, so I can achieve the effect of showing a progress bar after pressing the button, **inside** a 'Panel' of `DynamicModule` for example. (One answer pointed below can display the progress bar but it is displayed after `DynamicModule`, making it invisible if the content of `DynamicModule` is a full page) Here is the simple code I have:               DynamicModule[{i = 0},        Button["Show Bar", i++; SomeFunction[]]]      and the definition of some function:               SomeFunction[] := Monitor[Table[1; Pause[0.1], {j, 1, 10}],        ProgressIndicator[j, {0, 11}]]      If I run `SomeFunction[]` by itself, the progress bar shows nicely. If I click the button, though, I didn't see any thing. Any idea why? (Because I didn't specify how to display the output of the function?). Thanks.
