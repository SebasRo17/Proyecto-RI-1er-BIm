I have a list of data with dimensions $(2000,4)$. I plotted it using `ListPointPlot3D`, setting the fourth dimension as the color. As follows:               ListPointPlot3D[List /@ data[[All, {1, 2, 3}]],        PlotStyle -> ({PointSize[Large],             Blend[{{0, Darker[Green]}, {5, Yellow}, {10, Red}}, #1]} & /@           Flatten[data[[All, {4}]]]), RotationAction -> "Clip"]      I want to show the colorbar, I tried the function `ShowLegend`, but it didn't work. Any ideas?
