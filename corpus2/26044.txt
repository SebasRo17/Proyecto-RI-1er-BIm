**WARNING** : better don't try this when you have any relevant notebooks open, the generated palette will edit your currently selected notebook in ways which are not easily noticed or undone! `AutoAction` will repeatedly take effect when cursor over the button of pallete.               Cell[BoxData[\(\(CreatePalette[\({\(Button[\("Create Inline Cell", \(\(FrontEndExecute[\(FrontEndToken["CreateInlineCell"]\)]\)[\(NotebookRead[\(InputNotebook[]\)]\)]\), \(AutoAction -> True\)\)]\)}\)]\) ;\)], "Input"]      Here is one pallete to create inline cells, I wish it would perform only once when the selected content is the same. How to make `AutoAction` Take effect only for different selected contents Welcome to add an button to revert the value, ie convert new generated inline cell back to the prevous state(maybe plaintext). What is the same content: In one Text Cell, content is `who are you`. when selected content is `who`, just convert `who` into one inline cell, if second time, i select `who are` they are not the same contents.
