I'm just getting started with Git. I'll be doing PHP development and was wondering if I should initialize my repo within my server root folder, or any directory on my hard drive and publish my changes to the server root. Does it really matter, any pros/cons? For now, this is just to keep track of personal projects I'm doing for fun, but any feedback on best practice, personal preference/experience, do's and don'ts will be greatly appreciated.
