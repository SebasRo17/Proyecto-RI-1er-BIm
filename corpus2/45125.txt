Despite the integration of graphs and networks, multigraphs are not supported in Mathematica 8+. In Mathematica 9+, `GraphPlot` misbehaves for multigraphs having labelled parallel edges:               GraphPlot[{{1 -> 2, "a"}, {1 -> 2, "b"}, {2 -> 1, "c"}}]     GraphPlot[{{1 -> 2, "a"}, {1 -> 2, "b"}, {2 -> 1, "c"}}, DirectedEdges -> True]      ![GraphPlot multidigraph misbehavior](http://i.stack.imgur.com/x5DkF.png) ![GraphPlot multigraph misbehavior](http://i.stack.imgur.com/34Xum.png) `EdgeRenderingFunction` is passed the nonsense labels, so using it is out of the question. Due to this bug, it appears there is no easy way for Mathematica 9+ to render a multigraph with labels. Are there any workarounds, or should I look somewhere other than Mathematica?
