I hope this question is not going to be off-topic; in case you think there'd be a better place to ask it, please let me know. Anyway, I'm currently doing my PhD working in bioinformatics. I would, however, like to turn away from academia eventually and instead go into teaching programming or, preferably, programming languages (e.g. Perl, which feels like my "mother tongue"...) - not as a school teacher, but with a company (in Germany or Scandinavia). It'll take me another one to one and a half years to complete my PhD, so I would like to know how I could/should use that time to raise my chances of getting into the profession I'd be interested in. Are there any Perl certificates I should aim to obtain, for example? In case there's anything that comes to mind when reading this, please let me know. Thanks a lot in advance!
