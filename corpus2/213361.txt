I have records that have dates against them and an occurring field that contains `none`,`yearly` and `monthly`               id    status    note   date        last_updated   occurring     1     open      ---    01/01/2011  01/02/2010     yearly     2     open      ---    05/05/2011  03/05/2011     monthly     3     open      ---    06/06/2011  05/06/2011     none      Now I need to be able to check if a record is due (the date set has passed) which works perfect if `occurring` is set to none but I'm unsure of how to approach it when it's set to yearly or monthly (IE: This day in the year/month has passed) So with the above records, if I had a method on the record called `due?` providing the status is 'open' it needs to return `true` every year when it's passed that date if it's not been updated within the year yet. I apologise if this is confusing but it's melting my brain just trying to think of it, let alone put it into words.
