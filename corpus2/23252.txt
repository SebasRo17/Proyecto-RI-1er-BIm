I'm trying to optimize the teXForm output of a table because the standard output ist not satisfying:               badLatex = TeXForm[TableForm[{     {"nm", "E1", "E2"},     {500.`, -0.001`, -0.001`},     {499.`, -0.001`, 0.`},     {498.`, 0.`, -0.001`}}]]      I get this output               \begin{array}{ccc}          \text{nm} & \text{E} & \text{E} \\          500. & -0.001 & -0.001 \\          499. & -0.001 & 0. \\          498. & 0. & -0.001 \\         \end{array}      No I want to replace the decimal points with commas, change the environment and eliminate the "\text" command. The last doesn't work for me.               goodLatex = StringReplace[ToString[badLatex],         {"array" -> "tabular","." -> "," ,  "\text" -> ""}]      I get the following result:                   \begin{tabular}{ccc}              \text{nm} & \text{E1} & \text{E2} \\              500, & -0,001 & -0,001 \\              499, & -0,001 & 0, \\              498, & 0, & -0,001 \\         \end{tabular}      As you can see, the expression "\text" is still there. Why is "\" not replaced by StringReplace? Do you have a better idea how to convert tables to proper LaTex code? Thanks in advance for your help! Michael
