EDIT: This is about where the users will have their files, and TEST their changes - a development server so they can edit, save and then refresh a page to see whats changed. I am currently looking over our systems we have in place, here we have 2 internal developers, and 2 designers. All 4 used the same server for development work with their own enviroments and databases and code all housed in an external SVN repo, this works pretty sweet however we are looking at opening up this server for external staff. We have 2 external designers who we'd like to be able to edit files/insert designs etc etc. One runs a mac, other windows - ideally we'd like to open up access to our development server but one of these users it outside the country so access would be slow for anything other than something which runs in terminal however they use graphical IDEs. Do anyone have any experience/how their companies handle doing this? Not really keen on FTP to upload, check, edit, upload, check etc
