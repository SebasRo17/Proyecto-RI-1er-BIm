How useful are compile time functions? Personally I haven't worked in any language that supports them but they seem nifty in some cases. For those who don't what I mean, a compile-time function is evaluated at compilation rather than at runtime, so if you have for instance in your code               int i =   Pow(4,34);      you could instead do something like this               int i =   Pow<compilation>(4,34);      and the actual runtime code would be                int i =   295147905179352825856;      Naturally there are some restrictions on what functions could be run at compile time, they pretty much have to be pure/static but I can also see some instances where it could be used to fetch data into something from a file or database (even though in most cases those things shouldn't be compiled into the code) What do you think, is a feature like that actually useful or just "cool"? :)
