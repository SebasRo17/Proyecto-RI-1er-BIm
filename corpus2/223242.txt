I am working on an application that expected to the user logs in when the application is started (as for example it is in Skype: the user open the application and appear to him a login mask when he insert the username and password to start work with the application) Now I am preparing some use case diagram and I am collecting the application requirements (I have to write some documentation) Can I consider it as a user requirement? Or what is it?
