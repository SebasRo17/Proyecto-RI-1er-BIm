There are some days where I feel like I get a lot done. I've finished deploying my most recent project and cleared everything from my TODO list, and still have some time left in my day. I DO have a couple of larger projects I could dive into, but its so hard to when I feel like I've accomplished quite a bit in one morning and know I'll be leaving for the day in a few hours. Its even worse when it's a Friday (like today) In this sort of situation I tend to slack off a bit. Browse SO and answer questions to learn, work on some custom libraries for myself, surf the web for cool and interesting things to learn.... I try to keep it limited to work- related things but I find it really hard to stay focused. My question is, how do I get back on track? Or should I even bother? Is it acceptable to spend the rest of the day learning, or should I just sigh and start wading into another project even knowing that I won't have time to get much done and that I'll have forgotten most of it by Monday?
