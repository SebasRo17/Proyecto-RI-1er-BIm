I'm working on a project that includes a lot of creating/manipulating and reading JSONObjects and arrays but not in a systematic way. So there is JSON code everywhere.   It is ok for me except that every time I work on a JSONObject I got to handle JSONException.   So I created a class that extends JSONObject and Override the put/get methods in it and handled JSONExceptions inside this class.   It made my code way much clearer and I believe it is more than enough for my case. What do you think?
