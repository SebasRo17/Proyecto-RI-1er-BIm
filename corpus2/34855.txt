I need to generate a 3D plot of a function, say $z = \sin(x)\cos(y)$, with contour lines drawn at specified intervals. I also want to label each contour line with its $z$-value. I have discovered how to superimpose the contour lines on the 3D graph thanks to this post: Adding contour lines to a 3D plot?. However, I still cannot figure out how to label these contour lines with their $z$-values. How can this be done?
