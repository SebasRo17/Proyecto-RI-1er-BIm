I'm planning on making a website that will have mainly articles and videos. I'm going to post the videos on YouTube and use the YouTube API on my site. What I am wondering, is if I can make a page like this without using any server-side technology, or if I would need server-side programming(PHP, MySQL, etc...) would it be very much? I'm new to web development and as a first webpage, I was hoping to do the whole thing with Client-side technologies(HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Is this feasible?
