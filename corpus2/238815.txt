I am Elvis, trying very hard to learn to be Einstein. I work for Mort. What the hell is this crazy idiot talking about!?!? (You only need to read the first few paragraphs) If you don't feel like reading that link, basically, I am a professional programmer, and my boss is (this is scarily accurate): > the professional line-of-business programmer who lacks a degree in computer > science but has a great deal of familiarity with Office and VBA, and who > typically writes productivity applications shared amongst his coworkers All that said, a large portion of my job is taking his cobbled together code and making it production ready. However, the very poor style and cargo-cultism makes this difficult. This is compounded by the fact that he is unwilling to read programming books or allow me to help him refactor his code. Are there some other strategies for helping someone who is not a professional programmer, never will be a professional programmer write code going forward that is more legible and usable for me to use and interpret?
