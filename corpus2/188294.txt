I've often come across the situation when the same mistake is made in many places in an application. For example, in a web application when the user creates an item and clicks the `Add` button to save it. If they click the button several times, multiple items are added instead of one because UI wasn't blocked and backend check wasn't performed properly. How to create bug tickets in such cases? Here are the solutions I could think of:   * create one single bug ticket and list where the situation occurs   * for every case found create a separate ticket   * when finding the bug tell the development to pay attention, wait till they are finished and test again
