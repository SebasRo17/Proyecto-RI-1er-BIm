I encountered the following text in an article on the ModelViewPresenter pattern and my brain blue-screened: > Passive View usually provides a **larger testing surface** than Supervising > Controller because all the view update logic is placed in the presenter. I haven't come across this particular jargon before and I'm rather puzzled about what exactly constitutes the "testing surface" of a design pattern. Would someone please enlighten me regarding what the term means and also what it means for one design pattern to have a larger (or smaller) "testing surface" than another?
