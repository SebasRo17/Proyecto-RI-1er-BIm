I need a very simple explanation because I'm not a professional programmer. I found the terminology "abstraction layer" reading the documentation of mysqli extension where is described the difference among mysql, mysqli and PDO extensions in PHP. The article is this, that's where I met "abstraction layer" for the first time (referred to PDO). Now, trying to elaborate my question, we could speak of PDO abstraction layer against mysqli extension in php. So, for example, why mysqli is not defined as abstraction layer? How an abstraction layer acts? (like PDO in php) I would like to understand in a general way what is an"abstraction layer", I will not do particular questions about php or mysqli and PDO extensions. So, what is an abstraction layer? And what is its difference from a common application's extension?
