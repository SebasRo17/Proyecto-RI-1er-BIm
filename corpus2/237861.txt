Even if I don't like enforcing people to do things (and I believe that it may decline the productivity and cause anger), I really want to enforce good coding style. Is there a way to set up something like an integration server that measures the quality of code (for example it runs `resharper` or some other static checker) and reject the code if the score is below a certain number? Also, do you think this is a good approach?
