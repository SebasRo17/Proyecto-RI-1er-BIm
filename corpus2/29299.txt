Does there exist a technique to construct a `Cell` that allows you to both auto update a Dynamic variable and allows you select the code while the variable is being updated? For example ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PTJFK.png) Generated from the following code               a = 0;     task = CreateScheduledTask[        a = a + 1        , 1];     StartScheduledTask[task];     Print@Button["RemoveScheduleTask", RemoveScheduledTask[task]];     InputField[Dynamic[a], Number]     Dynamic[a]      Now if I select 100 in the `InputField` my selection gets unhighlighted as soon as the variable gets updated, meaning I don't get enough time to edit the variable. Now if I select the 100 in the second `Cell` and attempt to change the value nothing changes because of the nature of how Mathematica works. The data I am working with is multiline so I would prefer if there was some way to modify the `Cell` output so that I could update the variable while the scheduled task runs in the background. The above is a simplified issue of the issue, but illustrates the functionality quiet clearly. **Question: How do I update a varaible's value if is constantly being updated?**
