A previous discussion of this issue (Is there a bug in Pick?) accepted that matching at level 0 is not a bug in `Pick`. Was that correct? I am not yet persuaded. Here is the documentation (http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Pick.html): "`Pick[list,sel,patt]` picks out those elements of `list` for which the corresponding element of `sel` matches `patt`." This clearly speaks of _corresponding_ elements. It seems to me that either there is a documentation bug or there is an implementation bug. Why am I wrong? Furthermore, the documentation gives the obvious statement of intent, so I suspect an implementation bug. Here is (yet) another example that illustrates how bizarrely unexpected is the current behavior:               x = Range[20]     Pick[x, x/2, _Integer]  (* works as expected *)     Pick[x, x/2, Except[_Integer]]  (* does not work as expected *)      I find it almost impossible to believe that `Pick` was intended to cause this simple use of `Except` to fail by matching the entire list `x/2` rather than, as the documentation states, checking for a match in the _corresponding element_. Note that I am not asking how to get the intended match; I realize that `Except[_Integer|_List]` will accomplish that in this case. Also, I am using Mma 9.
