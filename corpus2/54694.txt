In Mma 9 using `CompilationOptions -> {"InlineExternalDefinitions" -> True}` inside of `Compile` inlined the values of the previously defined parameters used in the function to be compiled. For example:               nPara = 3;     cf = Compile[{{x, _Real, 1}},       Sum[x[[i]], {i, nPara}],        CompilationOptions -> {"InlineExternalDefinitions" -> True}       ]      resultes in: ![Output Mma9](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1PGeZ.png) and works flawless as expected. But in Mma 10 the output is: ![Output Mma10](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8v6gR.png) And, as now the value of nPara is not known to the compiled function, the comiled function doesn't work anymore. For such a simple function one can apply `Whith` as a workaround:               With[{nPara = nPara},      Compile[{{x, _Real, 1}},       Sum[x[[i]], {i, nPara}],        CompilationOptions -> {"InlineExternalDefinitions" -> True}       ]      ]      However, in bigger notebooks and with more complex functions this undocumented code break (or is a bug or a fix) causes bigger issues. Does anyone know a more convenient or automated workaround to fix this problem?
