How does one manipulate the slot numbers in a pure function? Some trick with `Evaluate` or `Hold`? I'm aiming for something along the lines of:               (Slot /@ Range[19, 164, 29])& @@ {...}      **EDIT** It turns out my actual problem is: why does               Evaluate[{Slot /@ Range[19, 164, 29]}] & @@ Range[164]      yield `{{19, 48, 77, 106, 135, 164}}` but               {Evaluate[Slot /@ Range[19, 164, 29]]} & @@ Range[164]      yields `{{#19, #48, #77, #106, #135, #164}}`?
