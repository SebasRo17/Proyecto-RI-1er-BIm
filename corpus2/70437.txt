I consider myself to be a novice programmer -- a noob is you like. As such I'm still not sure how to get started on a project where I will be doing stuff that I've never done before. For instance, I would like to write a program that can download videos from YouTube and convert them to a format specified by the user. I've never done anything like this before and I really have no idea where to start. Rather, I have no idea what I should search for. If I search for "YouTube Downloader" then I get hit with a bunch of useless links to existing YouTube Downloader sites, most of which don't work. What I want to know is how to get started on a project that I know nothing about. How do I find out what is required for this project? How do I find out what languages are best suited for this? How can I find out if there are any APIs that would be particularly useful? Also, what other questions should I be asking myself when preparing to take on a new project?
