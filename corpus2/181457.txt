**ROM - Read Only Memory**   Does this term mean _the memory which **should only be read** and not written to_ , **or** _the memory which **can only be read_** ?   "ROM in PC's and laptops are usually seperate chips in the motherboard where BIOS is present (Please correct me if I am wrong) . Can they be overwritten (I guess we can) ?   When we consider an android phone , it gets really confusing . What is the difference between ROM and "internal memory" in an Android phone ? It seems the same .
