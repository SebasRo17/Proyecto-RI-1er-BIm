I am the Director of a small startup organisation. We currently have two programmers (one experienced, one less experienced) who are building a web application platform. One of the greatest challenges so far is the planning process. The programmers usually are in charge of planning their own work, but we keep exceeding their self-imposed deadlines. For instance, a task that they estimate will take 2 days, ends up taking 8 days. For me it is hard to support them in planning, as I lack the technical know- how to precisely estimate how long a certain task will last. Do you have any idea:   1. What is the reason for this, is this common for programmers?   2. What I can do to support them in planning? Are there any methods or tools that are useful to programmers in small teams?
