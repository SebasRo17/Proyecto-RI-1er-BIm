Can I get interpolated values from this B-spline, (shown in red)?               points = {{-2, 2}, {2, 2}, {6, 6}, {10, 7}, {14, 11},        {18, 2}, {22, 1}, {26, 2}, {30, 1}, {34, 1}};          fn1 = Interpolation[points, Method -> "Spline"];     fn2 = Interpolation[points];          Show[ListPlot[points],      Graphics[{Red, BSplineCurve[points]}],      Plot[fn1[x], {x, -2, 36}],      Plot[fn2[x], {x, -2, 36}],      AxesOrigin -> {-2, 0}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/kpMjw.png)
