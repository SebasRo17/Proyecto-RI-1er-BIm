What is a good strategy to label software requirements in an SRS? Typically outline numbering is employed on headers - but these will renumber if a new heading is inserted in the document. To me it seems like a good idea to aim for a more stable designation for each software requirement. This should make it easier to reference a particular requirement even in the face of an updated SRS. What are your experiences on this?
