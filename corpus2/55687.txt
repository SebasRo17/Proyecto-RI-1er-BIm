What command should I use if I want to convert a string to the contents of a variable with the same name as the contents of that string withing a function. ToExpression[] doesn't seem to do it.               func[var_String]:=Module[{var1,var2},var1="some words";var2="other words";ToExpression[var]]          func["var1"]     var1      I want the outcome in this example to be "some words".
