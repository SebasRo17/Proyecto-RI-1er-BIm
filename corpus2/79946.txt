Often I hear the sentiment ... "Why worry about performance, write slow code, get your product to market ... don't worry about performance. You can sort that out later" The culmination of this sentiment is: "... premature optimization is the root of all evil ... #winning" I was wondering, does anybody have a **good** retort to this one liner. Ideally an equally strong **one liner** that encompasses the reverse of this sentiment?
