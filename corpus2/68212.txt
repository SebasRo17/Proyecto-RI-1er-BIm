I use events all the time, I cheat and use autocomplete in Visual Studio. Object.closing += [tab] button. Put something in the autogenerated function. Some people like to emphasize the "routed" nature of it, and that leads me to believe I'm missing something. Is there more to it? What am I supposed to know about routed events?
