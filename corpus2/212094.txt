From some open source projects, I gathered the following coding style               void someFunction(bool forget);          void ourFunction() {       someFunction(false /* forget */);     }          I always have doubt about what `false` means here. Does it mean "forget", or does the "forget" refer to its corresponding parameter (like in the case above), and "false" is meant to negate it? What style is used most often and what is the best way (or some of the better ways) to avoid the ambiguity?
