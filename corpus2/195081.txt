There is a new hype with the long awaited lambda expressions in Java 8; every 3 day another article appears with them about how cool they are. As far as I have understood they a lambda expression is nothing more than an anonymous inner class with a single method (at least at the byte-code level). Besides this it comes with another nice feature - type inference but I believe the equivalent of this can be achieved with generics on some level (of course not in such a neat way as with lambda expressions). Knowing this, are lambda expressions going to bring something more than just a syntactic sugaring in Java? Can I create more powerful and flexible classes or other object-oriented constructs with lambda expressions that aren't possible to be built with current language features?
