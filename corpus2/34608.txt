I entered the following into _Mathematica_ :               p[x_] := 4 x     q[x_] := 4 Sqrt[x] - 3     f[x_] := E^-Sqrt[x]     DSolve[y''[x] + p[x] y'[x] + q[x] y[x] == f[x], y[x], x]      > >      DSolve[ >         (-3 + 4 Sqrt[x]) y[x] + 4 x Derivative[1][y][x] + >           (y^\[Prime]\[Prime])[x] == E^-Sqrt[x], >         y[x], x] >   Why is Mathematica refusing to evaluate my DSolve expression?
