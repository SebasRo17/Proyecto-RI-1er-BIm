Because I find myself relocating frequently within a long notebook divided into sections, subsections, & subsubsections, I would like to display the identifying information for the section, etc. that I'm in at any point in time. I have in mind something similar to a readily visible header or footer that one might display within a word processing document or textbook. For example, if I am working somewhere within a section titled "4.2) Geometry of Matrix Transformations of the Plane", I would like that section identifier displayed conveniently and updated when my further relocating within the notebook takes me into a different section. My aim is not to compose a textbook/article/etc.; it's the far more humble purpose of helping myself as I work my way through an assigned textbook, making notes, computations, plots, and so forth and jumping this way and that throughout the notebook as the semester progresses. Suggestions for someone who is not a programmer? Thx!
