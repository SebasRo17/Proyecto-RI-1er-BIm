I'm good with understanding technology and implementing it. At least that is what I feel. But it seems that when I come across experienced programmers they point out that my logic is weak. I feel that I would need some time with real programming to improve it. But nobody is ready to give that time to me. I'm just about starting my carer and it often feels disheartening to hear this. I want know how can I improve my logic and also does this sort of thing happens to others too?
