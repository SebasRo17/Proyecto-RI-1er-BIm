Once again a big thank you for the great help in my earlier post: Plotting function with Dynamic parameter. It totally worked out. I now have a new coding problem               Manipulate[       Plot[Norm @ p2*t + Norm @ p1, {t, 0, 1}, PlotRange -> {0, 5}],        {{p1, {0, 0}}, Locator},        {{p2, {0, 0}}, Locator}]      Given this `Manipulate` object, how would it be possible to add a new locator that has its movement constrained to a given parametric curve? I've tried the code given on the user manual of `Locator` and of `LocatorPane`, but without success.
