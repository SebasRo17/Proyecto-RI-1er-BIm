Years ago I developed a website in Flash for one of my clients. I was in charge of code/animation and also maintaining Hosting and Domain. I also have a basic contract with my client and in the contract it does not mention who is the owner for the code. My Client (ex client) decided suddenly to work with a different company, so they moved the website without asking my permission and left me with unpaid bills for hosting and domain registration. Now the website is running on the same name but with a different extension, the website is managed by my competitor. The other company probably used some SWF Decompiler and uploaded the entire website on the new domain. My question:   * Even if in our contract it is not mentioned who the owner of the code/website, I would like to know if I have some right on the code/website I developed?   * Do you now any international regulation on this matter (I'm in Europe)? If you like please share your opinion or similar story on this, I would appreciate it.
