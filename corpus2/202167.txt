There seems to be an aversion to writing even the most basic documentation. Our project READMEs are relatively bare. There aren't even updated lists of dependencies in the docs. Is there something I'm unaware of in the industry that makes programmers dislike writing documentation? I can type out paragraphs of docs if needed, so why are others so averse to it? More importantly, how do I convince them that writing docs will save us time and frustration in the future?
