When creating a website, when should you load partial view and when should you do a complete page refresh? I was looking at github's site and noticed that pretty much the only place they do partial loading is in a project's folder area. I could see a couple places where they could have but didn't(tab navigation: feed, your actions, ...). But, Google plus does partial loads for search, and clicking on any of the header navigation buttons (pictures, games, circles, ...). Why would you not do partial loading if the main container stays the same and the content is the only thing that is changing?
