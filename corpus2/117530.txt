I am very new to Visual Studio and C# and am wondering how best to create a repository of sorts for utility methods. For instance, we need a method that returns the current fiscal year and other company specific values. Would it be best to create utility class file that is imported into every project? Or, create a new project with the these methods and add it to the current solution? In python, for instance, I created an egg that has all the utility methods that I then install into the site-packages.
