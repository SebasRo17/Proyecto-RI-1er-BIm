Recently an item has been added to the Product Backlog by product owner which says "When I go to login page from x page, I see an error. I want that error to be removed". It seems to me that this is not a use case, and shouldn't be a PBI (Product Backlog Item). However, when I discussed it, scrum master told me that user stories are not PBIs and, a PBI could be a bug report, a task, a user story, anything, and literally any item that should be addressed first. I'm not sure about this. Also I can't find a good definition of PBI on the web. So, my question is, what sort of **things** can get into the Product Backlog as items? Does a product backlog item maps to a user story? Are they the same?
