Presume I have a spectrum as a function of wavelength (an example being the blackbody spectrum): ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wG9zg.jpg) I want to convert that to a single RGB color to display on-screen, i.e. the "color" of that object as it would appear to the eye. From Googling I can see that there are ways to do this with a matrix transformation for a single wavelength, but I was hoping someone already had a solution coded up in Mathematica for an arbitrary input spectrum.
