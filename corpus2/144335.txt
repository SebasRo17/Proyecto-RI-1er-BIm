I'm working on the backend of a java web application. We have a document repository (Fedora Commons specifically) where we house xml files. I want to abstract the API of the repository internally so that we aren't tightly coupled to one product. I'd also like to give the flexibility of connecting to to a repository via Java RMI or REST APIs. I was hoping to get advice or resources on how to implement something like this. My thought it that I'd have some abstract repository class that had methods like getRecord, updateRecord, and deleteRecord. In the constructor I would pass the URI for the repository and the API method and port. This would allow some flexibility in the future so that if the REST api became more practical, but allow the flexibility or using RMI which could (should?) have better performance. Am I over thinking this or am I on the right path?
