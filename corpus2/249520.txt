I'm writing a PDE solver, and I have a bug that only shows up in very large test cases. That is, with small grids the program gives correct answers, but there's a large amount of unaccounted-for error (I've accounted for roundoff, discretization, and other standard types of error that unavoidably occur) that creeps in when my test cases get into the days-to-finish range. I can't run this in a debugger, that would take weeks. And printing out intermediate results is not particularly useful given that I can't manually inspect the output to see what's wrong. **How can I find and fix this "emergent" bug?**
