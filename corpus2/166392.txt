For example, it's very straightforward to have an index.php controller be a procedural script like so:               <?php          //include classes and functions          //get some data from the database     //and/or process a form submission          //render HTML using your template system          ?>      Then I can just navigate to http://example.com/index.php and the above procedural script is essentially acting as a simple controller. Here the controller mechanism is a basic procedural script. How then do you make controllers classes instead of procedural scripts? Must the controller class always be tied to the routing mechanism?
