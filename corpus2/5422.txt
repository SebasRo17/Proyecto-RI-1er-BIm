If I evaluate `{1, 2, 3, 4}/{5, 6, 0, 8}`, obviously I get one warning:               Power::infy: Infinite expression 1/0 encountered. >>      and one entry of `ComplexInfinity` in the third position of the result. I'd like to eliminate the warnings and get the output with instances of `ComplexInfinity` deleted. So far,               DeleteCases[Quiet[{1, 2, 3, 4}/{5, 6, 0, 8}], ComplexInfinity]      is the best way I have to do this. But I'd rather not suppress all messages with `Quiet`, in case I'm operating on something more complicated than this example. Rather than cleaning up the mess it causes, is there a clean way to prevent the divide-by-zero operation from happening in the first place?
