I'm trying to learn low-level notebook programming and I have a question. Is there faster way to select the longest cell in a notebook than this:               NB = CreateDocument[           ExpressionCell[#, "Input"] & /@ {"cell 1", Column@{"cell", "2"}, "cell 3"}]     pos = Position[#, Max @@ #][[ 1, 1]] &@                   ReplaceAll[CellSize, (# // AbsoluteOptions) & /@ Cells[NB]][[ All, 2]]          SelectionMove[Cells[NB][[ pos]], All, Cell]
