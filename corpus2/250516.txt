I'm writing a JavaScript graphing library using canvas which I am licensing under MIT, and I'm using jQuery, as well as a couple of other open sourced libraries, all under MIT. I'm also using bower to manage my front-end dependencies. How should I best handle these dependencies without violating the license? Preferably, the user would not have to include multiple scripts, just one `<script src = "graph.js></script>`, and it would include all of the plugins. Should I just ask the user to include jQuery and the other libraries in its own script tag, or should I concat all of the scripts together into one big file, headers included?
