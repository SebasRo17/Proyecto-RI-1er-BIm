I just found out the other day that the previous web company where I worked for 8 years will pretty much be shut down except for occasional updates and support of existing applications. I was thinking back to my days over there and I came to the realization that I was really the only programmer there who could build stuff from scratch. It got me wondering just how valuable that skill set is and I'd like to hear your input. When I say build stuff from scratch I mean you start with an empty website and take the ideas and concepts a customer has in his head and turn it into a working functional application. How valuable is that skillset? Is this something that all programmers can do or do I just take it for granted that all programmers can build stuff from scratch?
