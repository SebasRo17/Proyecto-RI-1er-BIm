I have a set of data points in two columns in a spreadsheet (OpenOffice Calc): ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IPNz9.png) I would like to get these into _Mathematica_ in this format:               data = {{1, 3.3}, {2, 5.6}, {3, 7.1}, {4, 11.4}, {5, 14.8}, {6, 18.3}}      I have Googled for this, but what I find is about importing the entire document, which seems like overkill. Is there a way to kind of cut and paste those two columns into _Mathematica_?
