The software engineering team of which I am part of is approximately 7 strong located in adjacent cubicles. 3 of us work on the same project but the rest are working on their own on different projects. In some cases one guy will be on his own on a project for nearly 1-2 yrs. There is no overlap in the projects that are being done as well. Currently I am one of those 3 guys working in the same project. So I have people to talk and discuss the problems and also to do some peer programming and reviewing. But everybody in the team have also been on a project just by themselves for about 2 yrs. It gives a very aloof feeling as you get further along the project. I was wondering if any of you guys were part of such a team and what did you guys do to have a healthy team spirit. Any thoughts/ideas are welcome. Thanks for your time. Cheers.
