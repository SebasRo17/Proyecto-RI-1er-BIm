I hope all programmers have gone through the stage at I am. I'm an iPhone and mobile apps developer and currently working in a company which is 1 of the best in my city. Now I am at a stage where I've two options. The first is with a big company like IBM or the second is with my own small company in which one of my friends and I will be starting. You might be wondering why am I asking this question instead of trying my own company but I know that once getting myself into a business going back to a job after closing a business would be a painful condition for me. What's your preference? What advice can you suggest?
