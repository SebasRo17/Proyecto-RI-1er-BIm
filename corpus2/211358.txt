I have been asked to automate the operation of a Windows (WinForms) application, performing some fairly complicated statistical analysis along the way. My first thought was the usual suspects: .NET, C# and White or AutoItX. Then it occured to me that I could try an alternative stack: SBCL, CFFI, and AutoItX. That way, I could write in a language I like (Common Lisp), using my native Linux development tools via SLIME and Swank. Hence my question: is there some reason I _shouldn't_ try this? I'm a Common Lisp newbie, and have essentially zero experience in CL FFI or SBCL on Windows. The learning curve isn't a problem, though. I'm worried that someone may have tried something like this in the past and discovered insurmountable issues. My list of concerns includes:   * stability / completeness of CFFI on SBCL on Windows   * getting SLIME on Linux talking to SBCL running on a Windows box Any experience, advice or warnings on any aspect of my proposed stack would be greatly appreciated.
