I am plotting a graph which has about 196 nodes.               GraphPlot[{1 -> 24, 2 -> 24, 20 -> 364, 20 -> 779, 21 -> 130, ...                    378 -> 386, 492 -> 841, 779 -> 783, 839 -> 841},           DirectedEdges -> False, VertexLabeling -> True,           Method -> "SpringElectricalEmbedding",           PackingMethod -> "ClosestPackingCenter"]      However when the output is produced it looks like below where many of the nodes are overlapping. How to tell Mathematica to produce a large picture so that no nodes overlap. True this might not be practical for very large graphs, but for 196 nodes, I would like no node to overlap another. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ehQwc.jpg)
