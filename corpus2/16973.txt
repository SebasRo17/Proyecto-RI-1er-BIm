Is it possible to dynamically link the content of two cells? For example, can I set up a Notebook with two text cells that display the same value, and if the user types in one the other updates, etc.? I am familiar with Mathematica's dynamic functionality and at least the key concepts of the FrontEnd, and it seems like I should be able to assign a dynamic symbol to certain parts of a cell and just use that in an expression elsewhere, but I can't figure out how to programmatically access a cell's current content. The best I have been able to do is get a CellObject using `Cells[]`, e.g. where the first cell is a text cell containing "This is a test!", `Cells[][[1]]` gives               Cell[BoxData[     TemplateBox[{6849,"6849","\"Text\""},     "CellObject"]], "Output",     CellChangeTimes->{{3.5653627710636687`*^9, 3.5653627797706504`*^9}, {     3.5653628101959224`*^9, 3.5653628192779245`*^9}, 3.5653630492614017`*^9}]      but this doesn't include the cell's content.
