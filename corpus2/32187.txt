I am trying to get the ImageDeconvolve function to work with `Image3D` objects. In the documentation of `ImageDeconvolve` it says: > ImageDeconvolve works with Image3D objects. But I can't get the function to work. I tried the following:               kernel = GaussianMatrix[{{7, 7, 7}, 2}];     Image3D@kernel // ImageAdjust      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YDMli.png)               img3d = Import["ExampleData/CTengine.tiff", "Image3D"]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bkmCa.png)               ImageDeconvolve[img3d, GaussianMatrix[{{1, 1, 1}, 1}],       Method -> {"RichardsonLucy", "Preconditioned" -> True},       MaxIterations -> 16]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/p0MTT.png) Deconvolution seems to be applied only to the first plane. Is `ImageDeconvolve` just not working for `Image3D` or am I doing something wrong here? I also tried different algorithms, kernels and other options without success.
