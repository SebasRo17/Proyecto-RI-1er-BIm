I am a computer science student and learning Java now a days. I want to be a good developer/programmer. I like reading books. I search on the internet for the related topics and study them. I refer to StackOverflow and other good programming websites daily but I code rarely. Is this a bad sign? If yes then what should I do to overcome this problem?
