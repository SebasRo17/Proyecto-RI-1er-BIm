A company with a solid open source project competing against a traditional closed-source product seems impossible to beat. I read this article wherein the author lays out this scenario: > Suppose one could divide a software market—say network management—between > two products. One did everything possible and cost $1 million, and the other > only did 10% as much, but was free and open. > > The price tag of the commercial solution would automatically filter out a > large number of users, and those people would have to turn to open source. > But some users would be satisfied with the 10% functionality and choose it > outright. > > For example, I have an original Macintosh computer on my desk. It runs a > word processor called MacWrite. It does everything, with the exception of > spell check, that I need a word processor to do. I can format paragraphs, > choose fonts, make text bold or italic, and even paste in pictures and > graphs. All in a "what you see is what you get" user interface. > > It takes up 76K of disk space. That's "K" as in "kilobyte." > > Compare that to Microsoft Word.

It seems very plausible. If you were the closed-source company, how would you compete??
