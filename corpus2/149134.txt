I have this requirement:               The application must allow the Administrator to edit, create and delete Users.      Now, I have heard that each action must go in a functional requirement, and my question is: What of the following statements would be the more appropriate(if any): 1:               The application must allow the Administrator to edit, create and delete Users.      2:               The application must allow the Administrator to edit Users.     The application must allow the Administrator to create Users.     The application must allow the Administrator to delete Users.
