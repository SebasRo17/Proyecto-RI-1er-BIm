Has anyone of you guys integrated or is thinking about integrating either admob, MS pubCenter, adwhirl or any other advertising provider into your apps? Please share your experience...   1. Who pays best?   2. Any regulations?    3. Any problems with getting the app approved by Microsoft Market?   4. If you chose Admob: Which plugin do you suggest? This or that or another one?   5. Any experiences in Europe or Germany? (MS pubCenter is US only so far) **Edit:** I think we discussed enough about acceptance of mobile advertisement. **Let's focus now on the questions I asked.** **Edit 2:** Hmm, maybe Stackoverlfow is a better place to discuss question 2-5. Could somebody migrate this one?
