I'm designing a multiplayer game server where the players are in rooms. Right now I have classes to take care of the client, networking, etc. I'm struggling however to find a design for this Room class. For example, when I want to change a client's room, should I call `client.changeRoom(newRoom)` or `newRoom.addClient(client)`? What about when leaving a room, should a client detach itself from the room or the room detach the client? I'm very confuse here, I just don't want to end up with a design I will regret in the future.
