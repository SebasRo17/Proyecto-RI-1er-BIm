How should I comment a method? What are the best practices on commenting code? Example:               /* Checks if a color is allowed in a given point     * of the bitmapdata of the current floor     * @param value - color to be checked     * @return boolean - if color is allowed returns true, else, return false     */          private function isAllowed(value:uint):Boolean {             //code...          }      Is that the best way to comment a method? I´ve heard there´s the use of the tag @see. What should be on this tag? I wonder if it could be something that has a relation to the method, is that right? Thanks.
