When I'm using Symbolize function, there are some details that I'm not sure. For example:               << Notation`     Symbolize[Subscript[q, 1],Subscript[q, 2]];(*I want to declare two symbols with subscript*)        1. Can I type the name "Symbolize[...]" instead of using the Notation Paletteï¼ŸIt seems there is a little distinction, Notation Palette has a colored region: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pX5Yj.jpg)   2. Does "Symbolize" support multiple inputs, such as the above example? What if i want to declare as many as 100 variables with subscript? I want to do differentiation on q1.               Subscript[q, 1] /:D[Subscript[q, 1], t, NonConstants -> {Subscript[q, 1]}] :=      Subscript[dq, 1];     D[Subscript[q, 1]^2, t]      I expect to get 2*q1*dq1, but Mathematica gives 0. Why is that?
