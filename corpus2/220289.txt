Does using frameworks like AngularJS/Backbone JS/Bootstrap/Foundation etc. automatically make the web application mobile device compatible? Is there a framework/design approach to make applications (new or existing) mobile compatible? To put it simply; is there a framework/guideline/library which I can use in my JEE web application UI layer making it automatically compatible both on computer browsers and mobile devices (iOS phone, iPad, Android phones and the whole array of it).
