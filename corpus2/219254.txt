We have a requirement to be able to match people with locations based on availability and certain conditions. Let's say I have a group of people each with 3 types of things they may need to park. A car, a truck and a boat. Each person also indicates their preferred parking location (choices 1, 2 and 3). I also have a list of parking locations which can handle a certain number of each of those things. The goal is to match everyone up so that we maximum usage. The main requirement is that each individual person has to be able to park everything in the same location OR they don't get to park at all. Example:   Starting with the parking locations I have:               Lot    Cars    Trucks    Boats     A       2       0         2     B       2       1         3     C       0       5         0      For people I have:               Person    Cars    Trucks    Boats    Choice 1  Choice 2  Choice 3     Tom        2       1         0         A         B         C     Betty      1       0         1         B         C         A     Sam        0       2         0         C         A         B     Pat        3       2         1         A         C         B      My initial thought is to simply sort the people by the number of items they have (largest to smallest). Then attempt to place each one based on choice. IE: I'd try to place Pat first (most items), but couldn't because no lot meets the requirements. Then I'd try Tom, who would go into Lot B. Etc. Do you know of any issues with that approach? Bonus points: is there a name for this type of problem?
