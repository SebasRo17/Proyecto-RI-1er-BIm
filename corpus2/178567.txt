I'm a developer with a CS degree and have work experience doing development in a number of languages for almost 3 years. Today I had an interview, overall it went quite well, I prepared for most of the questions and felt ready for anything. At the end of the interview, they gave me ONE programming question...a problem like FizzBuzz (without the print the number part). I believe I made too many mistakes and thus have "failed" it. Is all hope lost for me? Here is my code:                 void FizzBuzz()       {         for(int i = 0; i <= 100; i++)         {           bool isThree = i % 3;           bool isFive = i % 5;               if (isThree)          {              print "Fizz\n";          }          else if(isFive)          {              print "Buzz\n";          }          else          {              print "FizzBuzz\n";          }       }      }      As you can see I messed up the bools which should have the syntax i % 3 == 0; If I'm remembering the question right I also put an else instead of an elseif with isThree && isFive. I was quite stressed, but that's no excuse for missing a simple problem. So the question is, how important is being able to produce working code on the spot relative to other factors, such as experience and personality? For instance, would the above code be a deal breaker?
