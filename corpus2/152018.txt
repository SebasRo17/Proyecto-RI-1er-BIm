I have the requirement to implement some kind of dual inspection or four-eyes principle _as a feature of my software_ , meaning that every change of an object done by user A has to be checked by user B. A trivial example would be a publishing system where an author writes an article and another has to proofread it before it is published. I am a little bit surprised that you find nearly nothing about it on the net. No patterns, no libraries (besides cibet), no workflow solutions etc. **Is this requirement really so uncommon? Or am I searching for the wrong terms?** I am not looking for a specific solution. More for a pattern or best practice approach. **Update:** the above example is really trivial. Let's add some more complexity to it. The article has been published, but it now needs an update. Putting the article offline for the update is not an option, but the update has to be proof read, too.
