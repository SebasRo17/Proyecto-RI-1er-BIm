I mainly like to use NetBeans as my IDE for Java,which i really enjoy using. Currently just learning Java and was advised this would be a great program, which it is. I would just like to ask the experienced guys here what software you mainly use for Java / Python etc. As said, I am just in the process of getting my degree in SE so never been exposed to the business world of software and what is mostly used.
