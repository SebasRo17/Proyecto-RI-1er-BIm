InverseFunction[ConditionalExpression[#, 0 <= # <= 1] &]     InverseFunction[ConditionalExpression[#, -1 <= # <= 1] &]      The first line produces what I would expect:               ConditionalExpression[#1, 0 <= #1 <= 1] &      But when I make the lower limit in `ConditionalExpression` negative, the inequalities become strict:               ConditionalExpression[#1, -1 < #1 < 1] &      Why is this happening?
