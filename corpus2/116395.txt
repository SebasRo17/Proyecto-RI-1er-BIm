I found myself struggling to see what is this principle about and why is it so important for language design. Basically, it states, that for every expression `expr` in language should be exactly the same as this construct:               (function () { return expr; })()      Also, I have heard that Ruby obeys this principle, while Python doesn't. I don't understand why this is true, or if it is true at all.
