I'm trying to load some data into Mathematica from some files generated by fortran. But ReadList seems can't get the number correct. Here is a simplified version of the problem:               ReadList[StringToStream@" 0.000000000000000000E+00        0.490953850725349982E-10        0.135898165173686872E-09        0.264968686580858939E-09", Number]     (*{0.,4.9095385072534998*10^12709,1.3589816517368687*10^12708,2.6496868658085894*10^12708}*)      In the documentation, it promised that: > ReadList can handle numbers that are given in Fortran-like "E" notation. > Thus, for example, ReadList will read 2.5E+5 as 2.5*10^5. Note that ReadList > can handle numbers with any number of digits of precision. Why ReadList can't read this correctly? Is this a bug? `Import` can get the numbers correct               Import[Export["/work/mwu3/temp/1234.dat", " 0.000000000000000000E+00        0.490953850725349982E-10        0.135898165173686872E-09        0.264968686580858939E-09"], "List"]     (*{0.,4.9095385072534998*10^-11,1.3589816517368687*10^-10,2.6496868658085894*10^-10}*)      but I have very large data files, `Import` would take forever. Is there a way to solve it?
