Technical document authoring systems are structured ways to create, manage, and update documentation for various mediums such as print, pdf, web, etc. Take a look at this technical document ported to a mobile device/tablet: ![technicaldocument_on_tablet](http://www.safetyawakenings.com/wp- content/uploads/2013/12/nfpa-101.jpg) As you can see there is a structured format for the chapters and subsections in each chapter.   Chapter 1   1.1 First Section of Chapter 1   1.1.1 First Subsection of 1.1   1.1.2 Second Subsection of 1.1   1.2 Second Section of Chapter 1   1.2.1 First Subsection of 1.2   In this way, if the author were to add a new Section in the middle of a Chapter, all other numbers would need to be updated as it would disrupt the order. For example, in the image above, imagine I inserted a new Section, called "General 2", under the "7.1 General" section.      Then "7.2 Means of Egress Components" would need to become 7.3 instead of 7.2, and so on. I am hoping there is a straightforward way mathematica can auto-update section numbers in a technical document, as in the above scenario, so that it is a viable solution for technical authoring.
