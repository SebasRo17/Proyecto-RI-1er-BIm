Is it possible to save a function which was created via `Interpolation` of some data in such a way that I can use this function in a new _Mathematica_ session without repeated interpolation of the data? For example, I have some data which I interpolate in the following way:               exampleData={{1,1},{2,3},{3,4},{4,7},{5,5},{6,4},{7,2}};     interPolFunc[x_]:=Interpolation[exampleData,x]      Now one of the following would be nice:   * a way to save the interpolated function so that it can be used the next time when I work with _Mathematica_ (but I do not want to interpolate the data again, so that I can delete them).   * the data and `Interpolation` command are saved in a separated notebook which is executed when I want to use my `interPolFunc` in another notebook. Unfortunately I did not find any solution for that. But I hope that some of you have several suggestions!
