Following code worked on Mathematica 8, but in Mathematica 9 it can't be compiled, it return this message > CompiledFunction::cflist: Nontensor object generated; proceeding with > uncompiled evaluation. >> How can I fix this?               Clear[cf1];     cf1 = Compile[{},        Module[{s = 0.0},         Do[           If[s > 15, Print@i; Break[]];           s = s + 1.0/i;           , {i, 10^7}];         ], CompilationTarget -> "C"];          cf1[]
