I'm fixing bugs for a software company as a contractor on a per hour basis (first time for me). Today, in 6 hours I fixed two issues which had been planned at 32 and 40 hours each. The days before (I've been working here a week or so) the pattern was the same. I didn't plan time to fix those issues, and I didn't know what the issues were before signing the contract. I found a JIRA with all planned hours: some of those issues have been waiting to be worked on for years. I signed a contract for two months, but I'm afraid I'm going to run out of work much sooner.
