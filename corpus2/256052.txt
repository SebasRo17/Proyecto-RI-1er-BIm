I decided I wanted to learn to program so that I could one day make videogames of my own, so I set out to learn c++. I used a website called learncpp.com. First half of the lessons, I have a lot of fun, and I understand it mostly. About halfway through the lessons, I get incredibly bored. I plow through the lessons thinking that it will sink in eventually. Soon enough I realize that I have no idea what these lessons are talking about. Don't get me wrong, I love puzzles and logic and such, but I'm just not getting it. I feel like there was no way to actually work with the things I learned. There were no exercises. I didn't learn to code, I learned what code looked like. I've found that I learn best when I do it myself, and things aren't put on a platter for me. What is a practical way for me to learn code?
