I have a list of numbers and a matching list of labels. I want to plot a column of colored squares, with the color of each square matching (in some color scale) the value of the corresponding number. Moreover, each square should have its corresponding label printed on the side (left or right). I also want to plot a row instead of a column. In this case, the labels should be printed above or below the row, and the text should be 90ยบ degrees rotated. How can I do this?
