I feel slightly foolish for asking this because I am so close, but I'm having trouble, so I will anyway. I asked this question two days ago regarding finding the lengths of contours. Now, I'd like to find the areas between them. I have read and played around with the information here, here and here, but am having difficulties. ![The contour plot looks something like this...what are the areas?!](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TdjKk.jpg) Having extracted the individual contours of `f[x,y]` via the method given by chris, I would like to find the areas bounded by the contours and the plot region. Is there a simple way to do this? For reference, I am using the contour plot of the following function:               q[r_] := Piecewise[{{25/(0.1*1), r < 0.1}, {25/r, r >= 0.1}}]     phi[r_, t_] := (Pi/2) + q[r]*t     v[r_, t_] := q[r]*r*Cos[phi[r, t]]     s[x_] := Piecewise[{{x = -1, x < 0}, {x = 1, x >= 0}}]          f[x_,y_] := s[x]*v[Sqrt[x^2 + y^2],ArcTan[y/x]/q[Sqrt[x^2 + y^2]]]          ContourPlot[f[x, y], {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1}, RegionFunction -> Function[{x, y}, x^2 + y^2 <= 1],      PlotPoints -> 100, Contours -> Range[-25, 25, 1]]
