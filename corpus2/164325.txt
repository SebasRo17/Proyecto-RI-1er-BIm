I am a software developer having an experience of 3 yrs. I want to play with latest technologies always. But this is not practical. Because say, I developed a web application in .Net 3.5, now its 30% done. After the release of .Net 4.0, my mind is always goes with .Net 4.0. I think like this, lot of features are in new version, so why shouln't I implement those versions in my application. When I worked with IT companies, most of them code with very old versions, some body use VB.NET, C, even Classic ASP. So what might be the points should I consider if I revamp an application?
