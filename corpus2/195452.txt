I have been thinking about it and wanted some feedback, recently I thought about doing it like this:               function foo(){        if ( !foo.prototype.statics ){            foo.prototype.statics = {               // declare static functions/vars here            }        }        if ( !(this instanceof foo) ){             return foo.prototype.statics;        }             var statics = foo.prototype.statics; // shortcut        // if it reaches here then it's an instance (new foo())     }          foo().callStaticMethod();     (new Foo()).callInstanceMethod();      Is this a good way to do it or do you think of any reason why this can be an anti-patern?
