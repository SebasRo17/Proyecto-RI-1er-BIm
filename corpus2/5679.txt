I am facing the following problem.               f[x_,y_] = a[x] u[y] + b[x] v[y]      Now I can ask Mathematica to calculate               g[x_] = Integrate[ Expand[f[x,y]^2],y]      which it correctly shows. In the expansion we have an expression like               Integrate[ a[x]^2 u[y]^2 + 2 a[x] b[x] u[v] v[y] + b[x]^2 v[y]^2 , y]      Now in the output I want to replace               Integrate[u[y]^2,y]       by `I11` etc. Using `/.` did not do the job. Can anyone please enlighten me?
