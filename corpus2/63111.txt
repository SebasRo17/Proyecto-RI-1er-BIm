What open source projects would you recommend for people to study to learn how the pros write Scala? Some of the attributes that I'm looking for - though they don't all have to be present in every exemplary project:   * Idiomatic use of the language and libraries   * Functional programming techniques   * Concurrency (using Actors or other methods)   * Large scale system with many modules   * Readability   * Java interop   * etc.
