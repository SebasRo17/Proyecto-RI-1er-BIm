Looking at various pictures/office tours of software companies (Facebook for instance), I see a lot of the same hardware in terms of monitors (Dell monitors). I was wondering when companies hire new programmers, is the programmer given a choice between say a large monitor + laptop, a desktop + 24"(2?) monitor, or some other combination? PS. If you know for sure, it would be helpful to list the options at various companies.. e.g. Microsoft, Apple, Google; unless the information is confidential.
