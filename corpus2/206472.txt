I am new to GitHub and new to the open source world (coming from .NET). I have a media wiki site and want to install a Google analytics extension: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Google_Analytics_Integration The extension's documentation says to download the code from GitHub. In the GitHub repo, there are some "reviews" that say master and some that that say branches. I assume that I want a master and not a branch. But how do I pick which master to download? Also, the documentation says that some of the commits will be tagged but this does not seem to be the case. Without tags/documentation is there any easy way to know what commits are stable and what commits are not? I'd love some general wisdom about how to approach a repo for a project like this.
