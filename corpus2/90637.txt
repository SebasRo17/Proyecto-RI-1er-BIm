Both these syntaxes are correct and equivalent: With brackets:               foreach ($listOfThings as $thing) {       echo $thing;     }      Without brackets:               foreach ($listOfThings as $thing):       echo $thing;     endforeach;      Two questions come up in mind:   * Is there any real difference between them or are they totally identical (performence, for example)?   * Is it better always to use the same one or to use both, depending of some context (for example: to recognize easely the code concerning the framework). I suspect all that to be a matter of taste and company standards, but I'm not sure of that.
