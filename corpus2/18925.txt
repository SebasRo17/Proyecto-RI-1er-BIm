I've been playing with `WeightedData` and wanted a financial engineering example, a colleague suggested working with the fractional return (`FinancialData["Name","FractionalChange"`) of a weighted portfolio. Things were going well until I tried to build a `Manipulate`:               Manipulate[     Grid[     {{Style[DateString[fractionalChanges[[1, day, 1]], {"DayName", " ", "Day", " ",         "MonthName", " ", "Year"}], "Text"], SpanFromLeft},     {Style["Unweighted Mean Fractional Change:", "Text"],      Style[ToString@Mean[fractionalChanges[[All, day, 2]]], "Text"]},     {Style["Weighted Mean Fractional Change:", "Text"],      Style[ToString@Mean[allWeightedFChanges[[day]]], "Text"]},     {Pane[      Plot[{PDF[HistogramDistribution[allWeightedFChanges[[day]], 10],          x], PDF[HistogramDistribution[          allWeightedFChanges[[day]]["InputData"], 10], x]}, {x, -0.03,         0.03}, Filling -> Axis, PlotStyle -> {Red, Blue},       PlotLegends -> {"Weighted Fractional \nChange Distribution",          "Unweighted Fractional \nChange Distribution"},        AxesLabel -> {"Fractional Change", " "}], {700, 280},       ImageSizeAction -> "ResizeToFit", Alignment -> {Center, Center}],      SpanFromLeft}}, Frame -> All], {day, 1, 253, 1},     Initialization :> (thirtyRandomStocks =      RandomChoice[FinancialData["FTSE100", "Members"], 30];     fractionalChanges =      Chop@Map[FinancialData[#, "FractionalChange", DatePlus[-360]] &,        thirtyRandomStocks];     stockWeights = RandomInteger[{100, 10000}, 30];     allFChange = fractionalChanges[[All, All, 2]];     allWeightedFChanges =      Table[WeightedData[allFChange[[All, i]], stockWeights], {i, 1,        Min[Table[         Length[allFChange[[i, All]]], {i, 1,           Length[allFChange]}]]}];)]      I get an "Initialization Time Out" error and can't figure out how to give the `Manipulate` more time to initialise. Therefore, I have two questions:   * How can I give Mathematica more time to initialise, or else ensure the `Manipulate` gets the necessary data for the calculations?   * Note: This `Manipulate` will always be used within notebooks, so Free CDF limitations aren't important for me at this point.   * Are there any suggestions you'd be willing to share to improve the code in general? I'm aware that if you look closely I'm not working with the data correctly; `allWeightedFChanges` doesn't really do what it should do.
