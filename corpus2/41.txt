Oftentimes you find yourself looking for polynomials in multiple variables. Consider the following expression:               a(x - y)^3 +  b(x - y) + c(x - y) + d      as you can see this is clearly a Polynomial in `x-y`. Is there an equivalent of Collect, that works on more complicated expressions than just a single variable? I would like to have something similar to               Collect[%,x-y] = a(x - y)^3 + (b+c)(x - y) + d      however. Collect can not work on `x-y`. Of course you could solve this first example by substituting `x-y -> z` then Collect the `z` and afterwards substitute backwards like so:               a(x - y)^3 +  b(x - y) + c(x - y) + d /. x-y->z      gives               a^3 + b z + c z + d      then               Collect[ a z^3 + b z + c z + d ]      gives               a z^3 + (b+c)z + d      now undo the substitution by running `% /. z -> x - y`. This gives the desired result:               a z^3 + (b+c) z + d      So this is good. For obvious polynomials, we can solve this. But what about real world examples? Would you have guessed that               d + b x + c x + a x^3 - b y - c y - 3 a x^2 y + 3 a x y^2 - a y^3      is exactly the same polynomial? How would you Collect `x-y` here, as you cannot do the substitution?
