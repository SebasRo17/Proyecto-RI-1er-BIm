I've been trying for years to come up with a good way to organize the massive amounts of notes and material I generate when designing, coding, and testing software. My desk is usually overflowing with tons of sheets of paper with notes scrawled all over them. I've usually got at least the following items spread out all over these sheets of paper:   1. To-Do lists   2. Required features   3. Bug Descriptions   4. Program flowcharts   5. All sorts of design documents and diagrams, ranging from function design to overall program architecture   6. Use cases   7. List of test cases to design   8. Design questions that need to be answered in certain parts of the program I'm pretty good at coding, but haven't learned how to manage my projects yet, since I'm still a student in school. I want to learn these skills, however, because I know I'll need them in future jobs that require greater organization skills. What techniques, programs, methodologies, etc. can I use to become better organized when designing software? If you suggest any programs, I would prefer free software, since I'm a poor college student. :) Thanks in advance!
