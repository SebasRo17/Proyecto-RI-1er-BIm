> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Why is ContourPlot not displaying this curve?   >  Why do I have to put Evaluate[] here I'm trying to plot certain contours of a function $f:\mathbb R^2\to\mathbb R$. What I tried is the following:               ContourPlot[Table[f[x, y] == a, {a, 0, 1, 0.1}], {x, -3, 3}, {y, -3, 3}]      For some reason this doesn't work. If I first evaluate `Table[f[x, y] == a, {a, 0, 1, 0.1}]` and then plug the result into `ContourPlot`, however, it does work. I've noticed that `Table[f[x, y] == a, {a, 0, 1, 0.1}]` is evaluated to `{False, False, ..., False}` somewhere in the process if evaluated inside `ContourPlot`. (Which is not the same result as when evaluated separately.) > Why does this happen? What can I do to make it work? Thanks.
