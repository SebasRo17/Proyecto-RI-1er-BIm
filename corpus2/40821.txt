Today,I use the Lagarange method to deduce the robot 's dynamic equation .I use the mma to help me calculate. I want to use $$x_B,y_B, v_{Bx}, v_{By}, v_B ^2$$ to represent the point B 's displacement ,velocity and square of velocity ,respectively . However ,the mma give the warning information " Set::Tag Plus in the â€¦is Protected" My code               Subscript[x,B][t]=l1 Sin[theta 1[t]]+l2 Sin[theta 1[t]+ theta 2[t] ]      But when I subscribe Subscript[x,B][t] to xB[t],it goes well. So my question is how to wtite variable like the form that we calculate by hand.
