I consider myself an agile developer, I have set up CI in the last three teams I have worked with, and in my previous role worked in a style which revolved around writing failing tests before fixing bugs, extremely short feedback cycles (typically starting UAT of new features within a couple of days), and a very short release cycle. Now I find myself the only person to write a C# unit test in the last 6 months, battling inertia to improve code quality, and supporting a system in which new features are just released with the intention of fixing them later. What tricks can I employ to try and stabilise things? I have tried setting up CI, automated UAT deployment from a separate branch in source control, and publicising local free talks on software development, but with little success.
