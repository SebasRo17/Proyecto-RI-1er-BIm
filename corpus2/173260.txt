Looks like Microsoft is offering a special offer of 95% of the yearly subscription for the Phone Dev Centre (I didn't say anything about desperate). What I was wondering is do you need a seperate account to publish to the Windows Phone app centre and the Windows App Centre? Also I heard some horror stories about the time it takes to get application published on the Windows phone marketplace, does anyone have any experience with this?
