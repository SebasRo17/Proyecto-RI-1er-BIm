It seems like Mathematica immediately evaluates the expression `Sqrt@I` to `(-1)^(1/4)`. I'm trying to use `Simplify` with my own `ComplexityFunction f` in such a way, that `Simplify[Sqrt@I]` returns `Sqrt@I`, which (in my opinion) is the simpler expression. Hence, I've defined the following `f`:               Attributes[f]=HoldAll;     f[expr_]:=StringLength@ToString@HoldForm@expr      Testing it yields the expected results:               f[Sqrt@I]     f[(-1)^(1/4)]      > 7 > > 12 Now, when I call `Simplify[Sqrt@I, ComplexityFunction->f]` it still returns `(-1)^(1/4)`. I believe this is due to the fact that after the simplification (which should return `Sqrt@I`), the expression is in turn evaluated to `(-1)^(1/4)`. Can I define `f` in such a way that this last evaluation is not performed? Can I use `HoldForm` to achieve this?
