Today I was reading a job circular that came into our internal yahoo group. It stated **Android developer needed with 4-5 years of experience**. I am not a developer with that amount of experience. I have started to learn android recently. The point here that caught my eyes is _4-5 years_. I thought android is very new. No one should have 4 years experience. So I google to find the history of android. And found this on ctoedge.com, > The Android SDK was first issued as an “early look” release in November > 2007. In September 2008, T-Mobile announced the availability of T-Mobile G1, > the first smartphone based on the Android platform. A few days after that, > Google announced the availability of Android SDK Release Candidate 1.0. In > October 2008, Google made the source code of the Android platform available > under Apache’s open source license. Now could you tell me what type of programmers would have 4-5 years of experience in this March, 2012? Do they really exists? To me its something like _Experienced Java programmer needed with 18-20 years of experience_
