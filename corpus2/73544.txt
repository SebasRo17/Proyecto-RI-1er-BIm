I am trying build a social media site, but I need a hands on senior engineer/architect to guide and assist me in the server-side development since I am a rookie. Technology (which I am familliar with) to be used includes Java, JAX-RS, Spring and Hibernate. Unfortunately, I dont know what other technology skills an engineer/architect should have besides those mentioned above? The SNS I am trying to build is like Facebook which can guide you in terms of features and functionalities.
