I'm running Mathematica version 9. I am using `ListPlot` to plot two sets of data. For each data set, I am using different `PlotMarkers`: for the first data set, I use red disks, while for the second data set, I use red rectangles. To do this, I define `Graphics` objects `redDisk` and `redRectangle` as shown below. (I have found that it is necessary to define nonzero `ImagePadding` to prevent the edges of the `Graphics` from being cut off.) Next, I want to display a plot legend describing the two different `PlotMarkers`. To do this, I want to use the `PlotLegends` option that is newly implemented in Mathematica version 9. I define a `PointLegend` called `legend`. Within `PointLegend`, I use pass in the objects `redDisk` and `redRectangle` to the `LegendMarkers` option. Then I give `legend` to the `PlotLegends` option of `ListPlot` and use the `Placed` function to position the legend in the plot. The code to do all of this is the following:               (* Define PlotMarkers *)     pm = 8; (* size of PlotMarkers *)     redDisk =        Graphics[{Red, Disk[]}, ImageSize -> (pm + 2),         ImagePadding -> {{1, 1}, {1, 1}}];     redRectangle =        Graphics[{Red, Rectangle[]}, ImageSize -> (pm + 1),         ImagePadding -> {{1, 1}, {1, 1}}];          (* Define a PointLegend using the PlotMarkers defined above *)     legend = PointLegend[{Red, Red}, {"red disk", "red rectangle"},         LabelStyle -> {18, FontFamily -> "Arial"},         LegendFunction -> "Frame",         LegendMarkers -> {redDisk, redRectangle}];          (* Create some data to plot *)     myRange = Range[0, 2 Pi, 0.175];     diskData = Transpose[{myRange, Sin[myRange]}];     rectangleData = Transpose[{myRange, Cos[myRange]}];          (* Plot the data *)     myPlot = ListPlot[       {diskData, rectangleData}, PlotRange -> All, Frame -> True,        FrameLabel -> {"x", "y"}, BaseStyle -> {18, FontFamily -> "Arial"},        PlotStyle -> Red, PlotMarkers -> {redDisk, redRectangle},        ImageSize -> 500,       PlotLegends -> Placed[legend, Scaled[{0.65, 0.85}]]       ]      which gives this output: ![SmallGraphic](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TKwhO.png) _**However,_** when I zoom in on this graphical output, I see that the markers inside the `PointLegend` do not appear exactly the same as the `PlotMarkers` of `ListPlot`. **_Specifically,_** the markers inside the `PointLegend` appear to have a strange gray edge or border: ![ZoomGraphic](http://i.stack.imgur.com/MTw69.png) where I used the Mathematica front end's magnification feature to zoom in on the `myPlot` graphical output. The strange gray edges/borders persist even when I export `myPlot` to, for example, a pdf file:               (* Export the data as a pdf file *)     Export["example.pdf", myPlot]      When I open `example.pdf` in a pdf viewer and zoom in, I see the following. The strange gray edges/borders are still apparent in the `LegendMarkers` within the legend: ![PDFGraphic](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9r0Fm.png) **So, my question is, how can I remove the gray edges/borders of the`LegendMarkers` so that the `LegendMarkers` and `PlotMarkers` look the same?** Thanks for your time.
