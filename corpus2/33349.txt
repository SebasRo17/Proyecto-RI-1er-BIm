I'm looking to show students a lesson on sensory perception, more specifically on masking. I know a little _Mathematica_ but sound processing has evaded me.   1. I would like to create a white noise and play it, show characteristics etc              noise = RandomReal[1,{5000}];     ListPlay[noise];     Spectrogram[noise];     Histogram[noise];        2. Bandpass the white noise to produce different bandwidth sounds. This didn't work. Bandpassing the noise produces an amplitude constrained sound, but I was looking to constrain the sound to a specific frequency spectrum. How is this possible?   3. Also looking to play two sounds at the same time. `Sound[{sound1,sound2}]` plays sounds in sequence. How can I get them to overlap? The idea would be to show how one sound can mask other sounds.
