Is there any scientific evidence that the human brain can read and understand fully written variable names better/faster than abbreviated ones? Like               PersistenceManager persistenceManager;      in contrast to               PersistenceManager pm;      I have the impression that I get a better grasp of code that does not use abbreviations, even if the abbreviations would have been commonly used throughout the codebase. Can this individual feeling be backed up by any studies?
