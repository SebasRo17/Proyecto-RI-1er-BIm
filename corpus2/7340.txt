I want to read a good book about operating systems. More specifically, I want to read about how common problems - such as managing virtual memory, handling traps, doing context switches, managing processes and threads, etc. - are usually solved. To wit, I'm not looking for a book about how to program _towards_ an operating system; I'm looking for a book about how to _write_ an operating system. I hope this makes the question clear. Please only write **one book per answer** , for voting purposes.
