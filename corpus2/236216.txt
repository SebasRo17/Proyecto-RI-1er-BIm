Is it possible to convert a list of object directly to byte[] (and vice versa) to gain performance (by avoiding serialization/de-serialization)? What I have in mind is that a list is somewhere in memory(heap). If I could read the bytes in heap for my list I could just assign it a variable (of byte[]) in my program. Is it possible? and if yes, how would I get back the original list from byte[] without de-serializing using BinaryFormatter?
