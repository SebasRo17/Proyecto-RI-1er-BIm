I noticed that in Mathematica's Function Navigator `With` is listed as being part of the "Dynamic Interactivity Language". ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ujo0Y.png) It is not the first (or even the fourth, as it seems to be in this case) function that would come to my mind when discussing dynamic interactivity. While I'm well aware of `With`'s main purpose (which to me is injecting evaluated expressions in other, possibly held, expressions) I can't really come up with many examples of its use in a dynamic context. One thing may be the example given on the `Button` doc page:               Table[With[{i = i}, Button[i, Print[i!]]], {i, 10}]      `With` is necessary here because `Button` has attribute `HoldRest` and without it the action of the button would be to print the unevaluated text "i!". Is this sufficient to make `With` be part of the "Dynamic Interactivity Language" or are there better examples of its use that justify its listing in the Function Navigator? Examples which really need `With` and can't be done without?
