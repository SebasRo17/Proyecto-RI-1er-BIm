I have applied and have been approached for different roles in web development recently. The one thing that keeps coming up is that I am more suited to front end development than back end development. This makes sense given my background starting out as a designer. The problem is that while I have worked on a large app using ExtJS, I found designing and developing in ExtJS really frustrating. Oddly enough, it was working on this project that landed me in web development because my coding skills were recognized by some senior developers. I highlight that in my CV but I wonder if this might be a mistake. I also use JavaScript quite a bit outside of web development. Specifically in Photoscript and InDesign to create batch operations. It's often assumed that I have expert knowledge in JavaScript, whereas I'm only just getting to grips with the OOP style of JavaScript. I use a lot of procedural code or I just use libraries like jQuery and Google Maps. I have created some experimental apps in Node and Knockout which I fortunately have enjoyed although Node is back end. I used to avoid JavaScript and jQuery in certain web projects since I was focusing on SEO and would only use Javascript if I really needed it. During the interviews, I'm asked questions about JavaScript and front-end development. But I really wanted to talk about PHP and the server side development, so I guess my background shows. How do I address this when I am either contacted for a role or I applying directly without selling my short?
