**QUESTION:** How should you handle compound words when programming? Are there any good lists available online for developers of generally accepted technology-related compound words? I can see how this is highly ambiguous, so should I just use common-sense? **EXAMPLE:** I would be inclined to do this: _filename_ **NOT** _FileName_ **or** _login_ **NOT** _LogIn_ However, the microsoft documentation indicates that _filename_ is not compound. So I wonder, is there a more definitive source? See also, this english.stackexchange discussion  on _filename_. Under the section "Capitalization Rules for Compound Words and Common Terms" located here: Microsoft .NET Capitalization Conventions only offers a limited introduction into the topic, and leaves it up to the developer to use their intuition with the rest.
