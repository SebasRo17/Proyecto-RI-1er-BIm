I need a small clarification about streamInsight, I know by doc's that StreamInsight can handle multiple concurrent Events. But will the event producer be a separate function, for ex: I need to watch a folder for new Files becoz all my sensors il write readings every day in a new file in particular drive. **Method 1: FileSystemWatcher:** These is the traditional approach where we write a service using FileSystemWatcher to watch a folder for new files,etc.. Upon receiving event from FileSystemWatcher il perform some operations on these files. **How to do these using streamInsight???** I came know that using IObservable i can push events to StreamInsight. But is there anything to watch folder is sreamInsight like FileSystemWatcher. OR In order to raise events to streamInsight do we need to use FileSystemWacther? Any suggestion regarding these is highly appreciated. Thank in Advance
