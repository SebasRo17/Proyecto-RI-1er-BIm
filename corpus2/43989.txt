I am having a hard time trying to import some text data for later use in `DateListPlot`. My first field in my data is a date of the format "yyyymmdd". I tried to use both `ReadList` and `Import`, but I cannot get `DateListPlot` to understand that my date is truly a date.               data =       Import["/path/to/data.txt", "Table", "DateStringFormat" -> {"Year", "Month", "Day"}] //Short      > >     {{20131217, 123123.}, <<50>>, {20140313, 321321.}} >                 DateListPlot[data, Filling -> Axis]      > DateListPlot::ntdt: The first argument to DateListPlot should be a list of > pairs of dates and real values, a list of real values, or a list of several > such lists. >> With `ReadList` I tried to see if I could use `StringSplit`, but that didn't seem to work either. Any pointers would be most appreciated. Edit: I added some more data.               data = Import[     "/path/to/file.txt",      "Table", "DateStringFormat" -> {"Year", "Month", "Day"}] //TableForm          {      {20131217, 114812.},      {20131220, 114192.},      {20131221, 114192.},      {20131223, 114192.},      {20131224, 114504.},      {20131226, 115408.},      {20131227, 115165.}     }
