In _Mathematica_ in wavelet package with the following codes               Phi[x_, j_, k_] := 2^(j/2) WaveletPhi[DaubechiesWavelet[3], 2^(j) x - k]       _Mathematica_ computes `Phi` for various values of $x,j,k$. How does _Mathematica_ do this computation? My guess is cascade algorithm. If it is cascade algorithm, again how _Mathematica_ does this computation because until now i have seen cascade algorithm just for $j=0$ and $k=0$. If _Mathematica_ does not use cascade algorithm what is the algorithm?
