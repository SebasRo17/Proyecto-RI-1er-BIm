I am a hobbyist programmer, bit of a stickler for terminology, currently learning C and recently came across the concept of _Memory Leak_. Now, I do understand what it means. Dynamic memory allocated to a program is not returned by the program. But where does the term ' _leak_ ' come from? Is it coming from the fact that other programs cannot access the dynamic memory, since one is already hogging it, and thus total memory available from the OS to the heap is reduced and therefore " _leaked_ " to the one hogging it? Basically, are we see the memory leak from the OS's perspective? And therefore saying that it is leaked to the program?
