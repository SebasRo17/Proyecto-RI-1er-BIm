I don't know why, but I always feel like I am "cheating" when I use reflection - maybe it is because of the performance hit I know I am taking. Part of me says, if it is part of the language you are using and it can accomplish what you are trying to do, then why not use it. The other part of me says, there has to be a way I can do this without using reflection. I guess maybe it depends on the situation. What are the potential issues I need to look out for when using reflection and how concerned should I be about them? How much effort is it worth spending to try to find a more conventional solution?
