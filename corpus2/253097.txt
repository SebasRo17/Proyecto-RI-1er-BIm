For those of you who don't know, WCF allows you to attach interceptors to methods in the service contract. The interceptor is capable of performing custom logic before and after a method call, and is (as far as I know) used mainly for validating parameters and doing custom authorization schemes. But what's the point of using them if you can just write a helper method to do the same thing?
