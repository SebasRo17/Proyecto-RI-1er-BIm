Been poking around the web because I was curious as to why they called it that but haven't found anything yet. Anyone know? _(I checked the FAQ and it wasn't clear if questions on history/origins were OK to put here or not, but I figured it wouldn't be good on StackOverflow, feel free to start closing it if it is out of scope and I will delete.)_
