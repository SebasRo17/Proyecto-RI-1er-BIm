I have two variables, $ u \in \{0,40\}$ and $\gamma \in \{0,1\}$. I take $10$ values of $u$ and $5$ values of $\gamma$ and using their combinations as a pair of input parameters, I perform some mathematical operations a total of $10*5 =50$ times. Now, say for $u=40$ and $\gamma=0.5$, I performed my mathematical operations and generated a $120 \text{x}9$ matrix of data. I would like to be able to call this Matrix, $\mathrm{DataU40G5}$ so I can keep track of where the data came from. Now               "Data" <> "U" <> ToString[Evaluate[u]] <> "G" <> ToString[Evaluate[gamma]]      creates a string that looks like $\mathrm{DataU40G5}$ but I am unable to use it as a variable name and feed data into it. How would I go about this? Also, as I write this, I'm thinking that instead of doing all this, I can simply add the variables $u$ and $\gamma$ as columns to my records and have just one $(120*50)\text{x}(9+2)$ dimensional Matrix as my dataset. Is this a better Idea? Even if it is, please answer the first question just so I can learn how to do that.
