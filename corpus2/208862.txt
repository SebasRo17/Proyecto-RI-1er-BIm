Where I work, using Properties are discouraged. We have code generation tools to "speed things up". All object data ends up being Public fields. If you request properties anyway, you get something like this:               Public sFoo as String          Public Property Foo as String       Get         Return sFoo       End Get       Set(ByVal value as String)         sFoo = value       End Set     End Property      I can't think of a reasonable argument to do this. Are there any good reasons to use both a Public Property with a Public Field?
