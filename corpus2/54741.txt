The following command executed on a Raspberry Pi equipped with a RaspiCam behaves differently depending on whether the command is run from the terminal (via `wolfram`) or a notebook (via `mathematica`):               <<"!raspistill -t 5 -k -o image.jpg"      In the terminal, the function behaves as expected: a preview window appears and raspistill maintains control until the user presses Enter twice. In the notebook interface, however, raspistill behaves _as if_ it is receiving keypresses and eventually exits. It is possible to work around this issue to execute a terminal which calls raspistill, e.g.:               <<"!lxterminal -e \"raspistill -t 5 -k -o image.jpg\""      Does anyone know why the behavior of executing external commands would differ between the two flavors (?) of Mathematica, or how I might go about debugging this issue further?
