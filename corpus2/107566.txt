I'm an 'okay' Javascript developer working on browser javascript and node.js. However because I'm self taught, starting from copying and pasting jquery, there are a lot of holes in my programming/CS education. I don't really have the time to devote myself to fully learning all the CS concepts that might be taught in a real college program, and learning C or Scala or whatnot, I'm just too addicted to hacking and making things that work. On some level studying CS seems to be 'premature scaling' in Hacker News parlance. But every so often I get struck by the thought that maybe there is something that I should really really learn to take my skills and productivity to the next level. Is there a book, a list of concepts or things that I can study and learn in my 'down time' that would see reasonable returns on my productivity and ability in 1 - 2 months? Thanks! And yes, the only language I _know_ and use is Javascript, though I have tinkered with Python (High School), Ruby (RoR), PHP (Drupal), and Assembly (Making Diablo 2 Mods) in the past. Please note that a book like O'Reilly's JavaScript Web Applications is too easy for me and not really what I'm talking about.
