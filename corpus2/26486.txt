After describing the _Hermite Normal Form_ (HNF), MathWorld explains: > The Hermite normal form for integer matrices is implemented in _Mathematica_ > as `HermiteDecomposition[A]`, which however uses the "rows" convention (thus > making $\mathbf H$ upper triangular) and replaces (the condition > $h_{i\,j}\leq 0$ and $|h_{i\,j}| < h_{i\,i}$ for $j < i$) with balanced > remainders $\pmod {h_{ii}}$. Is there a way, using _Mathematica_ and without much coding, to compute HNF in "columns" convention?
