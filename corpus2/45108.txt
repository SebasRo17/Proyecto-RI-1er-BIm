I have a `Manipulate` function with two variables. I would like one of them to begin autorunning immediately once the function is evaluated, but the other to remain static until moved. Does `Manipulate` have an equivalent to `Animate`'s `AnimationRunning->True`, which would enable me to allow one of the variables to start being animated without having to convert the entire function into an `Animate`, which would affect the way the panel is displayed, as well as making both variables begin playing at once?
