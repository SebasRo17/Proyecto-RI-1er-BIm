When I graduated, I thought getting into a web development job meant I get to work in a group of at least a handful of developers, and seniors can teach this young Padawan their tricks of the trade. In my experience, when I get hired as a junior web developer I'm usually have really limited contact and collaboration with one or two other developers (because we seldom work on the same projects), or sometimes I'm the only one that knows how to code. I've grown to hate these "lone wolf" positions and would rather work in a highly collaborative environment full of other programming geeks. Most of these places tend to outsource technical work, and I prefer face-to-face communication with peers in my dept. I like the small-company culture but at the same time, there's such a thing as too small, to the point where there's little actual technical work done in- house so I can't get any expert advice. Because my experience is anecdotal, I don't think I am getting the big picture as to the sizes and structures of web dev companies. So my related questions... Is my lack of experience with large in-house teams due to the fact that I mostly get hired by consulting firms that do client work? Do companies that create their own products have a vastly different structure? What should I look for in a company if I want to get into a larger, in-house development team?
