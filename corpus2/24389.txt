I need to convert tons of date strings into absolute times. This generates an example data set of 10,000 strings:               dateStrings=DateString[#,{"Year","-","Month","-","Day"," ","Hour",":","Minute",":","Second"}]&/@                   Range[3576302100-10000,3576302100];      I think the simplest way is               AbsoluteTime /@ dateStrings      and this gives exactly the result I want. But on lists of hundreds of thousands of dates, it is quite slow. On the example data set, it takes about 5 s. I can speed it up it a bit by telling `AbsoluteTime` what date format to expect:               AbsoluteTime[{#, {"Year", "-", "Month", "-", "Day", " ",                        "Hour", ":", "Minute", ":", "Second"}}     ] & /@ dateStrings;      And this takes about 3.8 s. How can the performance be improved further?
