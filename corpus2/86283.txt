Is it better to assemble permanent teams of developers within the company that always work together, from project to project, or is it better to have dynamic teams that assemble for a project, and then dissasemble afterwards? My inclination is to treat the entire company as a "platoon" and to assemble "fireteams" for individual projects, choosing from the "platoon" those developers best suited for the project.
