In my work, my friends always tell me, you know so much about computer science, electronics engineering,..etc. But I have difficulty in applying them and my code is crap. How to solve that problem? Will I be better or programming isn't my career? For example, yes I know OCTree that is used for space partitioning in games and it is used for optimization, did I implement it? No, but I know about it in principle.. Do I know algorithms like Sorting, Searching,..etc? Yes, and I know them pretty well, but didn't implement them.. When I get a task, I struggle in applying the things that I know...
