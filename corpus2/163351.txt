I am teaching myself C# and Im using a book that references Visual Studio 2008. However, I am using VS 2010. The book wants me to look at the object browser by choosing View, Other Windows, Object Browser from the menu. However, the object browser is not there. I moused over the icons on the menu and nothing stood out. So, where is it? Also, am I going to run into more problems like this? Is it worth getting an updated book?
