I'm trying to figure it out some nice workflow for our company, and we have so far the main repository on the github's organization account and we all, the members of the team working on the branches of that repo. Could you please mention some advantages on forking the repo or some use, by the members of the organization? I was thinking, that for example, I could make a fork and perform a upgrade of the libraries, but someone pointed that, "what is the differences on doing it simply in another branch,without forking? Thank you in advance, for your time.
