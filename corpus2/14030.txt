I have a big array of data that I imported from a lot of XML files. To get the data, among other manipulations, I use this function:               Cases[xml,XMLElement[nodeName,_,a_]-> a,\[Infinity]]      When I get my final array, I have a lot of number fields that are as `String` and that I need to convert into `Number`. To do that I created this function:               clean[data_]:=Map[If[NumberQ@ToExpression[#],ToExpression[#],#]&,data,{-1}]       The problem is that I have strings with "??" characters, so if o use `clean` on it as for example:               clean[{"asd??asd", "123.3"}]      Mathematica try to interpret the first element as context ones. And I get:               Global`asd      How to avoid it? How can I improve my `clean` function, or the way I load de XML?
