I am building a PHP application for a client and I'm seriously considering WordPress or a simple framework that will allow me to quickly build out features like forums, etc. However, the client is adamant about having "full access" to the database and the ability to "mine the data." Unfortunately, I'm almost certain they will be disappointed when they realize they won't be able to easily glean meaningful insight by looking at serialized fields in wp_usermeta, etc. One thought I had was to replicate a variation on the live database where I flatten out all of those ambiguous and/or serialized fields into something that is then parsable by a mere mortal using a tool as simple as phpMyAdmin. Unfortunately, the client is not going to settle for a simple backend dashboard where I create the custom reports for them even though I know that would be the easiest and most sane approach.
