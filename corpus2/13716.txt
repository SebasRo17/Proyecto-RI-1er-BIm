Using a $p_n $x $p_n$ matrix, how can we solve the N-Rooks problem to find a prime in every row and column?               Table[MatrixForm[Table[If[PrimeQ[n], "P", "."], {m, 0, Prime[o]^2 - Prime[o],      Prime[o]}, {n, m + 1, m + Prime[o]}]], {o, 1, 8}]        Here is the $11 $x$11$ matrix with the possible prime positions for the queens: ![N-RooksPrimeVariation](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OYfi0.jpg) Note: single primes are always in the $p$-th column. This is one possible solution (done by hand): ![N-RooksPrimeSolution](http://i.stack.imgur.com/V7Ojp.jpg) **Edit** Changed the title and link as Paxinum suggested.   OEIS A215637 has these counts of multiple solutions through $10th$ prime:   $$ 1, 1, 1, 2, 7, 72, 2144, 2641, 1345721, 2191254096$$
