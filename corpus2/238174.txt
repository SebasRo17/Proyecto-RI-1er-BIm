For reference, I am a JavaScript developer learning C++. The browser is a pretty powerful debugger, and I can easily place a breakpoint in my code, hover over a variable or expression and get the value of that expression. Is this even possible in C++ or am I in a different world entirely? I'm starting to write a bit of C++ code for an online course, and debugging with Code::Blocks gives me very opaque information. For example, I see stuff like this: `0x8049bc3 push ebp` in the 'watches' window. Even if I write something like `int foo = 3;`, I have found no way of telling that `foo` is 3 while I'm stepping through my code. Am I missing something?
