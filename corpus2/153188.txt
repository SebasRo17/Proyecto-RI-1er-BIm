I'm reading _Code Complete_ with the intention of learning how to better structure my code, but I'm also learning a lot about how many aspects of programming something there are that aren't just writing the code. The book talks a lot about problem definition, determining the requirements, defining the structure, designing the code, etc. What tools are used for these non-writing steps of programming? Is there software that will help me design and plan out what I'm going to write before I do?
