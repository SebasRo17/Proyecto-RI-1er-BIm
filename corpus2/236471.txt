I'm a new app developer and after like 20 downloads of my app (free and ad- free) I already got two feature requests, and I'm not going to implement either. Should I respond to these feature requests and if so, how? I'd prefer not responding at all because I'd rather spend the time to work on my app, but being a new developer, a couple of poor ratings in the app store could hurt my app.
