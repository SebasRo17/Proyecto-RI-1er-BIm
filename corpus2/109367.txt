Has Microsoft made any indication of WinRT's current or future relationship with server development (such as ASP.NET)? While it's been made clear that WinRT is the intended future of Windows UI programming, it also includes a substantial library of common features like networking and data processing (like JSON). If these libraries are to the the future of Windows development, it seems to me like it's only natural that they will eventually move into the world of server development (WinRT is already supported by "Server 8"). (I realise that ASP.NET isn't going anywhere and that MVC, for example, could potentially be completely gutted without affecting the programming model. I'm just curious)
