Im trying to automate the processing of my shooting targets to measure my performance in the range. I was able to process the shots, but I still have to select the center of the target by the use of locator function. Tried using the following questions as a base Detecting Grid Lines               src = ColorSeparate[Import["http://i.imgur.com/BW61u.jpg"], "RGB"][[1]];     p = ImageDimensions[src]/2;     shots = DeleteCases[DeleteCases[Last /@ ComponentMeasurements[MaxDetect@DistanceTransform     @ColorNegate@DeleteSmallComponents@           Binarize[            Closing[ImageAdjust[Blur@Blur@Blur@src, {1, 1}], 2]],        "Centroid"], {0.5, ___}], {___, 0.5}];     pts = Graphics[{Red, PointSize[Large], Point[#]}] & /@ shots;     Show[src, pts, Graphics[Locator[Dynamic[p]]]]      ![Identified Shots](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ptvuO.png) With the locator in place I can now extract the actual shots with respect to the center of the target.               values = (# - p)/100 & /@ shots;     sigImage =       DensityHistogram[values, {0.2}, ColorFunction -> "DarkRainbow",        Method -> {"DistributionAxes" -> True},        ChartBaseStyle -> EdgeForm[Thin],        GridLines -> {{{0, {Red, Dashed, Thick}}}, {{0, {Red, Thick,         Dashed}}}}, PlotRange -> {{-2, 2}, {-2, 2}}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/yrX10.png) I would like for Mathematica to be able to find the center of the target automatically, so then I can create a program to process several targets which I can extract the shots automatically and save in a database, which I can then use to review the Density Histograms of different dates, weapons, distances, stances, etc.
