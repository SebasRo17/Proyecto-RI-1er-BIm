(edited, after rasher comment, changing any detail and variable names) You can plot an evolution with 3 lines (up=maximmun, in the middle=mean, bottom=Minimum) with this code               historytargetmax = {10, 15, 20, 30, 35}     historytargetmean = {6, 8, 10, 13, 15}     historytargetmin = {6, 3, 5, 7, 8}          ListLinePlot[{historytargetmax, historytargetmean,        historytargetmin}, PlotStyle -> {Thickness[0.008]},       AxesLabel -> {"Generation", "Target"}, LabelStyle -> {24, Bold},       ImageSize -> Large]      My question is How do you do this with multiple (for example 3) series. For example... in the next lines... each list historytarget___ contains 3 list. Each list represent s the maximun/mean/minimun of target function trought iterations {1,2,3,4,5} We made 3 simulations and in the first simulation we obtain this evolution os maximun {10, 15, 20, 30, 35} and this evolution of mean {6, 8, 10, 13, 15} and this evolution of min {2, 3, 5, 7, 8} So we would like to view the maximun line in blue, the min-line evolution en green, and min-lin evo in red. The same in the other 2 simulations. So finally we can see 3 lines representing the evo of maximun (BLUE and UP) 3 lines representing the evo of mean (GREEN and middle) and 3 lines representing the evo of min (RED and BOTTOM) for example with               historytargetmax = {{10, 15, 20, 30, 35}, {12, 14, 17, 27,  31}, {11, 12, 22, 32, 32}}     historytargetmean = {{6, 8, 10, 13, 15}, {8, 9, 11, 12, 13}, {11, 12, 12, 13, 19}}     historytargetmin = {{2, 3, 5, 7, 8}, {2, 4, 5, 7, 8}, {6, 2, 5, 3, 7}}      Last thing.- I think that it would be interesting plotting all the maximun series in BLUE all the mean series in GREEN all the minimum series in RED how to do this?
