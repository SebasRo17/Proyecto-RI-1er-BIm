I am seeing a lot of programmers turning away from management and administration roles. They want to build stuff. And as a result, a lot of these positions are filled by non-technical people. I fail to see how they add value. Is scheduling meetings, booking offsites and other administrative work enough to justify their role? **Edit:** Thanks for the wonderful answers. I do know that administration details are important, but that is why we have a dedicated HR team, recruiting teams and other teams dedicated to support developers. This is different from a non-technical manager being in a important position.
