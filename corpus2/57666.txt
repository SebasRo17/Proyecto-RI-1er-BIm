I successfully used the `filledCurveToPolygons3D` function to create `Graphics3D` text in MMA 9 on a Windows 7 PC; see: How can I create a 3D FilledCurve object? However, when I installed MMA 10 on this very same machine and tried using this technique again, all the holes in the text are filled. I tried using the recommended changes to the RHS of `processHoles` that another user had had with MMA 9 on a Mac, but I still ended up with all the holes filled. The same problem shows up as well with the 2D function `filledCurveToPolygons`.
