I'm running into an issue with arranging Manipulate controls and a dynamic module around the content pane of the Manipulate. For example:               Manipulate[      Plot[a b c x, {x, 0, 100}, PlotRange -> {0, 100}],      {{a, 1}, 0, 2, Appearance -> "Labeled"},      {{b1, 1}, 0, 2, Appearance -> "Labeled"},      {{b2, 1}, 0, 2, Appearance -> "Labeled"},           Dynamic[       Plot[        Sin[t], {t, 0, 10}, AspectRatio -> 1.5, ImageSize -> {200, 300}        ]],           {{b, 1, Row[{Spacer[300], "a"}]}, 0, 2, Appearance -> "Labeled"},      {{c, 1}, 0, 2, Appearance -> "Labeled"},      ContentSize -> {400, 260},           ControlPlacement ->        Flatten[{Table[Left, {4}], Table[Bottom, {1}], Table[Right, {7}]}]     ]      ![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/6YMFfWz.jpg) I want the slider on the bottom, labeled "a" (oops, should have been b), to be sitting right underneath the content of the Manipulate (the linear graph). However, the dynamic module on the left-hand side, which is a plot of a sine function, seems to "push" the control further down than I want it to. How can I fix this?
