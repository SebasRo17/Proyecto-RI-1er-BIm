I am looking for signposting help to secure my API keys when accessing a database over REST API from Javascript on a webpage. I have read that in order to secure the API key I need to create a wrapper in PHP that will basically insert the API key into the request to allow the JS on webpage to access the database. Question:   1. Do I understand the concept correctly - re API keys and PHP?   2. Where can I get more info on the wrapper, maybe a tut or something? Thank you for your help. Regards, Nix
