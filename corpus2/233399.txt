I'm talking hypothetically but I'll use an example of what I worked on in a programming class a while ago. There's a better way to actually perform the operation, but that's not the point. An example to show what I mean I want to take a BufferedImage and individually manipulate each pixel. So something like this:               for(int x = 0; x < out.getWidth(); x++)     {         for(int y = 0; y < out.getHeight(); y++)         {             int color = in.getRGB(x, y);             int r = (color & 0xff0000) >>> 16;             int g = (color & 0x00ff00) >>> 8;             int b = (color & 0x0000ff);             //Do something with r             //Do something with g             //Do something with b             color = (r << 16) | (g <<8) | b;              out.setRGB(x, y, color);         }     }     return out;      Would this loop be more or less efficient if I declared color, r, g and b outside of the for loops?
