I'm working on a notebook, trying to expand the root of a cubic polynomial in Taylor series. When I type:               Series[(Sqrt[46656 a^2 - 864 (3 2^(1/3) a^(2/3) + 2 a B)^3] + 216 a)^(1/3) , {a, 0, 2}]       _Mathematica_ takes an indefinite amount of time and I am forced to halt execution. After this occurs, even simple functions like `Exp[x]` will not compute and I have to restart the kernel. Am I doing something wrong here? My computer is a month old, so I know the problem isn't old hardware.
