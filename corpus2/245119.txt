I am new to state machine modeling and while trying to model a system, I have a question. An example will explain it better: Considering a system that does calling (probably a customized cell phone device) with possible states: **idle->calling->signal-dropping->handle->call ended** **idle->calling->OS problem->handle->call ended** **idle->calling->battery drained->handle->call ended** **idle->calling->some other problem->handle->call ended** Above example is in form state1->transition1->state2->transition2->state3 Question is: Is there any significance of these intermediate states? Should they be shown/ modeled explicitly in UML or even programming? **Note:** It would be helpful if anyone can mention (some existing if applicable) technical term used to describe this scenario
