I'm interested to know if heuristic-based path-finding algorithms such as A* have any real world practical use outside the realm of game development. Are there any other fields of software engineering that employ path-finding algorithms, perhaps in a completely different or unconventional way, or is it by the nature of those algorithms and their design that they ultimately see very limited use in other areas?
