I am new to _Mathematica_ and to Math. I do not study math in English, so please bear with me as I try to state my questions.. This is what I am trying to "solve": $$∃!x : A(x) ⇔ ∃x : ¬A(x)$$ In words: "Is 'there is exactly one x for which the assertion A is true' equivalent to 'there is at least one x for which assertion A is not true' ?" Referred to that I have questions:   * Is this something you would normally do with _Mathematica_?    * In the program I opened a "New Notebook" and typed in:               Equivalent[!Exists[x, a[x]], Exists[x, !a[x] ]]       and it - surprise! ;) - did not work. What have I done wrong ?   * How would the answer look like ?
