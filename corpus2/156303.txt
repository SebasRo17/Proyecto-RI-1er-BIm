F# comes out of the box with an interactive REPL. C# has nothing of the sort and is in fact kinda difficult to play around without setting up a full project (though LINQpad works and its also possible to do via powershell). Is there something fundamentally different about the languages that allows F# to have the interactive console but makes it difficult to implement it for C#? **Edit** Since many years later people are still coming to this question I should note that now there are many options. You can use powershell (pre- installed on every modern windows machine) to play with the .Net framework. Or you can use LINQpad to prototype arbitrary c# code. Or you can use ScriptCs or you can use an online jsfiddle-type environment like Complify.net or Jsil. Lots of options.
