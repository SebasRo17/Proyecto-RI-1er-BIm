Quick question guys. It may be country dependent so this question is more directed towards EU citizens. If I did a programming job, raised an invoice but never got paid, am I still holding the copyrights and can disallow use of the software? No specific contract regarding copyrights was signed upfront. I don't know if you can help, but though asking you guys may be worth a shot
