After going through a lot of articles and this post, i know Why doctypes are used for and also about the different modes triggered by the browser like standards, quirks etc. I downloaded the a strict doctype from this url - http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd but couldn't understand a thing of what is written inside it. My question is, if i want to write a page with html and css which is going to have a doctype that will trigger standards mode, where can i get a clear and simple to understand list of all the rules(for instance, elements and attributes that i should avoid) that my html and css code should adhere to?
