Just signed in to the Embarcadero Developer Network and got this: > EXPORT CONTROLS ON EMBARCADERO SOFTWARE Your EDN membership and access to > Embarcadero Software is subject to your agreement to and compliance with the > following terms: > > -You agree that U.S. export control laws govern your use of the Embarcadero > Software. > > -You are not a citizen, national, or resident of, and are not under control > of, the government of Cuba, Iran, Sudan, North Korea, Syria, nor any country > to which the United States has embargoed or prohibited export. > > -You will not provide or export Embarcadero Software, directly or > indirectly, to the above mentioned countries nor to citizens, nationals or > residents of those countries. > > -You are not listed on the United States Department of Treasury lists of > Specially Designated Nationals, Specially Designated Terrorists, and > Specially Designated Narcotic Traffickers, nor are you listed on the United > States Department of Commerce Table of Denial Orders. > > -You will not provide or export the Embarcadero Software, directly or > indirectly, to persons on the above mentioned lists. > > -You will not use the Embarcadero Software for, and will not allow the > Embarcadero Software to be used for, any purposes prohibited by United > States law, including for the development, design, manufacture or production > of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons of mass destruction. I think it's BS, but what craziness is forcing companies like Embarcadero to hold developers to these very high standards? Also, what is "Embarcadero Software"? Does that mean I can't put a benign videogame on a website that may have a runtime that might be downloaded by a Iranian who love scrabble. Or does "Embarcadero Software" refer to anything I develop using Delphi.
