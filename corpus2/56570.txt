I have an external data file data which contains the position of stars of a galaxy simulations and it looks like this               data = Import["NGC_1566.out", "Table"];     L0 = ListPlot[data, Frame -> True, Axes -> False,           PlotStyle -> {Darker[Green], PointSize[0.001]},           PlotRange -> {{-60, 60}, {-60, 60}}, AspectRatio -> 1]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KffdP.jpg) and here is a real image of the NGC 1566 ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3WFIL.jpg) Now I would like to plot and fit my data on top of the real image. Any suggestions?
