I developed scientific software for use in my own scientific research. I am considering porting it to another language such as Java, and releasing a closed-source, commercial version of it for sale. I have been looking into Java, but I have some questions about the legal issues related to licensing Java for a commercial application, and the people who answer the phone at Oracle tell me that they do not talk to developers. I have carefully read the JDK license agreement here. But I still have questions. Does anyone reading this have any experience releasing commercial, closed-source, applications running on Java? If so, can you send me some links to information about the legal issues? My own web searches keep coming up with the same stuff. My understanding is that I would have to redistribute Java 6 with my application, and that my application would have to check to see if Java is installed in the end user's computer, and then install Java if it is not installed, or if a newer version of Java needs to be installed. Many of these end user computers might be in large organizations which might not have purchased Oracle licenses. Can my commercial application distribute the Java platform for free in this way without paying a fee to Oracle? Or are there fees or other restrictions involved? Can you please post a link to any information on the web about this? From what I have read, the only fees seem to be related to the commercial features of Java, which are limited to tools for optomizing large enterprise applications. But I would like to hear from other developers, and to read the information that you might link to on the web in your replies, if you are willing. Alternatively, I would consider writing my application in C++ or in c#.net instead.
