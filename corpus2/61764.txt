I'll cut to the chase. I'm looking for advice on how an experienced developer would convince a prospective employer that they should be considered for a position that uses another language. This is with other non-language specific requirements being met (knowing version control, OO, degree, etc...). For example an experience PHP developer looking to move to a Perl position. Is it even possible? How diffiult would it be? Is it language dependant? EDIT: The answers that I got are proof that this communitys future is bright indeed, but sadly it only allows me to select one answer. Thank you to all that replied.
