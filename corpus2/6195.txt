Consider a toy expression:               expr = Sin[x (a + b)]/(y (z + c))      I would like to expand all parentheses to get something like:               Sin[a x + b x]/(c y + y z)      I have been able to expand the argument of the `Sin` term using:               MapAll[Expand,expr]     (* Out[] = Sin[a x + b x]/(y (c + z)) *)      However, this leaves the denominator unexpanded. Is there a way to expand the entire expression?
