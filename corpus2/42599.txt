I have the need to remove "duplicates" from large (>10K members) lists, where a "duplicate" is either a verbatim duplication, _or_ the element's second entry exists as a first entry for some "earlier" member in the list. E.G., given               testcase = {{1, 2}, {2, 1}, {1, 3}, {3, 4}, {4, 9}, {1, 3}, {6, 4}, {9, 4}, {7, 5}, {6, 7}, {5, 7}}      the desired result would be `{{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {3, 4}, {4, 9}, {7, 5}}`. Of course the trivial method is `DeleteDuplicates[testcase, #2[[2]] == #1[[1]] &]`, but this goes exponential, as hinted to in the MMA documentation. I've been pondering for a bit, shooting blanks so far, looking for any ideas toward an _efficient_ solution.
