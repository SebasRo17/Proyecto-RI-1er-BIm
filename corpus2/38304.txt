I was wondering if someone knows enough about the FormCalc package to help me out: I am using FeynArts to generate Feynman-diagrams for certain tree-level processes in my own model and FormCalc to calculate the squared amplitude of these processes, the problem is that when I make               CalcFeynAmp[Amp]      it gives > preparing FORM code in /home/safi/Dro/FormCalc/fc-amp-12.frm running FORM... > ReadForm::formerror: !(*StyleBox[!("Illegal position for 33\nIllegal > position for 23\nIllegal position for 34\nIllegal position for 24"), "MT"]) > $Aborted One solution for that as on ( http://www.feynarts.de/formcalc/trouble.html ) FormCalc Troubleshooting page is to run fc-amp-12.frm manually by Form comes with FormCalc to see where does the problem come from, but when I make :               ./tform fc-amp-12       it gives > ./tform: cannot execute binary file Have I typed the command correctly .. any suggestions ?
