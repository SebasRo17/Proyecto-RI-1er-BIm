I find it tedious to write out the following:               a = {1, 2, 3, 4};          Fold[f, First @ a, Rest @ a]      > >     f[f[f[1, 2], 3], 4] >   It becomes additionally cumbersome when working with held expressions, e.g.:               b = Hold[1 + 1, 2 + 2, 3 + 3, 4 + 4];          SetAttributes[g, HoldAll];          b /. _[x_, __] :> Fold[g, Unevaluated[x], Rest@b]      > >     g[g[g[1 + 1, 2 + 2], 3 + 3], 4 + 4] >   Likewise for `FoldList`. Is there a shorter syntax to achieve this?
