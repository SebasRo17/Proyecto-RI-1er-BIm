I'm currently using Planning Poker to do our detailed estimates. This works great but relies upon a fairly detailed work breakdown. Often it takes 6-8 weeks to get a sufficiently detailed design and work breakdown. I've found the 6-8 weeks of analysis are often wasted as the estimate comes out so high it doesn't make economic sense to continue the project. I think providing a high-level estimate up front with a wide range might be better to weed out these shaky business cases. What tools and techniques exist for high-level initial estimates? Right now I just pick a previous project that "feels" the same and provide a -50%/+100% range.
