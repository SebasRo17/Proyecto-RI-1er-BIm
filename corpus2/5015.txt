In the following minimal working example:               Manipulate[BarChart[{a,b}],{a,1,2},{b,1,2}]      I'd like to be able to control the size of the bars by using some sort of `Locator` property for manipulate i.e. change the vertical size of each bar by placing my mouse on the edge of the bar (ideally anywhere along its width). Obviously, `Locator` won't work. Any ideas how to easily do this? I want the value of the bar chart to dynamically update. In the above example, I would have `a, b` obey some constraint (like `a + b = 2` so whenever one changes the other does so accordingly). \-------- Answered -------- This was so that there's some playing with the Greek general election. I wanted to play with the latest poll results and vary them before the election on Sunday. @Mike Honeychurch: You are right, barspacing doesn't change the locator positioning but the locators are off center like so (this is my output when I run your code): ![Mikes](http://i.stack.imgur.com/p3XcT.png) I assume you run a different version of Mathematica than me - I run 7, sorry, should have said so. So, I had to fiddle with the x-coordinates of your locators in some way like this when defining `pt`: `numberofpoints = 5; barspacing = 0.1; xcoords = Table[i + barspacing i - 1/2, {i, 1, numberofpoints}]; pt = xcoords~Riffle~RandomInteger[{0, 3}, 3]~Partition~2` I got the chart to look OK at the end (locators here for only the first three bars): ![Mikes to mine](http://i.stack.imgur.com/q7Miz.png) but wasn't entirely happy with the way it was done because of the fiddling I mentioned above. So I am going with @Heike 's approach that works a treat out of the box exactly the way I wanted:               lastpoll = {{LightBlue, 24.3, "ΝΔ"}, {Green, 15.4, "ΠΑΣΟΚ"}, {Red, 10.9, "ΚΚΕ"},      {Yellow, 8, "ΔΗΜΑΡ"}, { Pink, 9.5, "ΣΥΡΙΖΑ"}, {Blue, 9.6, "Αν. Ελληνες"},     {Gray, 6.3, "Χρυση Αυγη"}, {LightBlue, 4.2, "ΛΑΟΣ"}, {Green, 4.4, "Οικολογοι"},      {LightCyan, 2.1, "Δημ. Συμμαχια"}, {Yellow, .8, "ΕΠΑΜ"}, { LightRed, .8, "ΔΡΑΣΗ"},     {Blue, .8, "ΑΝΤΑΡΣΥΑ"}, {LightGray, .8, "Κοιν. Συμφωνια"}, {White, 2, "Λοιπα"}};     values = #[[2]] & /@ lastpoll;     dragBar[values,      ChartLabels -> Placed[(Last /@ lastpoll), Axis, Rotate[#, 55 Degree] &],     ChartStyle -> (First /@ lastpoll), BarSpacing -> .6, ImageSize -> Large]      with the following result (all fiddlable): ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Pnoct.png) In any case, thank you all for taking the time. This was harder than I expected it would be..
