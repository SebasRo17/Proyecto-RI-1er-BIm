Am trying to generate an `Evaluatable` cell which itself is an output cell which will be overwritten when the original `Input` cell will be evaluated again:               CellPrint[      ExpressionCell[Defer[1 + 1], "Output", Evaluatable -> True,        CellAutoOverwrite -> True, GeneratedCell -> True]]      Without `Evaluatable -> True` everyting works as expected: the generated output cell is automatically overwritten when the input cell is evaluated again. But adding `Evaluatable -> True` breaks this behavior. Is it possible to generate `Evaluatable` cell which will be automatically overwritten?
