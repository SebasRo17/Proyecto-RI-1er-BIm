I am working on an example from a book (An Engineer's Guide to Mathematica). The following code is in the book:               terms=1+Accumulate[2. Table[1/(1+(2 n)ˆ2),{n,1,500}]];      n={ 50,100,200,500} ;     p=terms[[n]];     exact=π/2. Coth[π/2.];     pd=100. (exact-p)/exact;     TableForm[{ { n,p,pd} } ,TableHeadings->{ None,{ "N","s",     "% diff"}}]      The output is supposed to look like this: > N s %diff > > 50 1.70279 0.578059 > > 100 1.70771 0.290481 > > 200 1.71019 0.145605 > > 500 1.71169 0.058329 But I do not get this output. The columns for p and pd are not evaluated, rather in the output I get long many series. I cannot see why this is happening. This is a confounding problem for me as I am trying to learn the platform.
