Basically, I have an application that does searches and requests results from a backend via long polling. It connects to the backend which collects results for 500 ms then sends them back to the client (I'm simplifying things here a bit of course). As we've optimized this, we've noticed a growing divide between users who search at night vs users that search during the day. Namely, users who search at night are _much_ slower than users that search during the day due to the fact that these users are mostly international and have higher latency. What are good high-level approaches to speeding things up for these users?
