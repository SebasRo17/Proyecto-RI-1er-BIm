I am looking for a command that will output a list of values that correspond to the current parameter values manually set on a particular `Manipulate` interface. For example, lets say I create an interactive interface using this code:                Manipulate[      Plot[      A*Sin[f*t + p],      {t, 0, 2 Pi},      PlotRange -> {{0, 2 Pi}, {-1, 1}}],      {A, 0, 1}, {f, 1, 10}, {p, 0, 2 Pi}]      Then suppose I use the `Manipulate` interface to set the parameters to some values I like as in the instance shown in the this screen cap: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CSetr.png) What I would like to do now is input some command that will output these parameter values that the interface is currently set to (in this case, A = .5, f = 6, p = 1.4). Ideally, I would like a `List` in a new cell of the form               {0.5, 6, 1.4}      Perhaps some kind of `Dynamic` automatic updating feature would be nice too. This will allow me to continue being lazy and not have to enter these values individually when I refer to them in later code. Thanks to anyone who helps!
