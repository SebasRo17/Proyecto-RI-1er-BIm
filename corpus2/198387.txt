I have to create a github-presence for an open-source organization. The aim is to distribute _code snippets_ and _reference implementations_ in **different** programming languages. These contributions are going to be (ideally) created by people outside of the organization and should be collected. I know that good practice is to create **one repository per project**. To this end, each implementation (in a specific programming language) should be considered a standalone project and should get its own repository. The point is that this approach makes hard for external people to contribute, because github pull-requests can only be made against existing repositories. By creating a **single repository** with a subdirectory per programming language code contribution becomes easier, but I'm afraid that some IDEs may complain about the directory layout. I'd like to know whether someone already solved this very specific problem in a satisfactory way.
