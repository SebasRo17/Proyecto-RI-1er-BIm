I'm trying to build a sortable grid:               sortBy[data_, idx_] :=        If[idx == 0, data, Sort[data, #1[[idx]] < #2[[idx]] &]];     sortableTable[data_, header_] := DynamicModule[       {h, sort = 0},       h = MapIndexed[Button[#1, sort = #2] &, header];       Dynamic[Grid[Prepend[sortBy[data, sort], h]]]];     sortableTable[       Table[         RandomInteger[100], {i, 3}, {j, 4}],          {"First", "Second", "Third", "Fourth"}]      For some reason it is not behaving like I expected: header disappears and sorting doesn't occur. I've tried all sorts of stuff but can't make it work like intended. Any help is much appreciated.
