After working for a while with `Manipulate` function and increasing the number of variables to be manipulated, keyboard stops working properly in the Notebook. It gets really crazy, mainly the keys `Backspace`, `Space`, `Delete`, `Ctrl`, `Alt`, `Left`, `Right`, `Up` and `Down`. For example, some times `Backspace` starts behaving as the `Left` Key, some times as `Right`, etc. all this randomly. I am running _Mathematica_ for Linux, and I have had this issue with Ubuntu 13.04 and recently with Ubuntu 13.10 as well. This is not an issue related to my computer since outside _Mathematica_ the keyboard works as usual.
