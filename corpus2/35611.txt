I'd like to automatically generate a graph where vertices correspond to (and have the coordinates of) points in an $A \times B$ integer lattice, and a graph is generated by connected vertices within a real-valued cutoff distance $r$. Is there a (relatively) automated manner of doing this in Mathematica v9? How can we display this graph properly, respecting the vertex coordinates?
