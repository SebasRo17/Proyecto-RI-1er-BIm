I have to advise a training on unit testing in my company. I would like to show a striking, real-life example of an unexpected regression not caught by compilation (of course) but detectable with unit testing. Something more like a seemingly valid change that in fact cause a regression in another part of the program. Would you share your unit testing epic-win stories ? (Target language is C++, networked distributed application, but any good example will do)
