If I have a list of 2D coordinates placed in subarrays of a data structure like the following:               testList = Table[RandomReal[{0, 1000}, {RandomInteger[{0, 32}], 2}], {i, 1, 10}];      And if I sneak in a few entries where 2D coordinates have non-real or non- integer component values (positive or negative Infinity values, etc.) is there a way to quickly prune these coordinates away? In other words, I'd like to go through a data structure like `testList` and quickly delete any coordinate that has a positive to minus `Infinity` in it. Is there a way to make something like the following work?:               Select[testList, {_Real, _Real} &];      What if `testList` is already flattened by one level? Does the larger context of the data structure matter for `Select`? The following works for `testList`, but is not exactly ideal:               For[i = 1, i <= Length[testList], i++,            testList[[i]] =          Select[testList[[i]], NumberQ[#[[1]]] == True && NumberQ[#[[2]]] == True &];          ];
