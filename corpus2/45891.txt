I'm looking for innovatives ways to improve the whole team & raise the global level in every aspects, not just technicals ones. My actual solutions :   * **programming challenge** vith votes, notes etc    * **teaching each others** : each month, a member might present a new api,strategy, whatever that help to build better sofwares. It will end up with votes. If it is approved, the team will commit to use it for a month. Then feedback.Then use it or leave it.    * **annual review to reduce you blind spot** of your Johari window. Personnaly, i really find instructive the _farewell feview_ , done each time i leave definitively a group of people.  Because of social conditioning, they need a warming up. So i really tell them to not filter their words & almost badmouth about me. No matter what they would say i will stay quiet. It works great with women, especially if they can answer with an email and you far away (double safety net) _**And what about yours ?_**
