I'm solving an expression like so:               Solve[u[x] == u[a] + u[b], x]      Mathematica returns               {{x->(u^(-1))[u[a]+u[b]]}}      If I now specify the function `u` more precisely, via               % /. {u[x_] -> x}      what I get is               {{x->(u^(-1))[a+b]}}      i.e. Mathematica replaces the function but not its inverse. Is there any way of replacing the inverse appropriately as well?
