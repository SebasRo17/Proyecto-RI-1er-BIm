I've got this really time consuming factoring problem. To decouple things a bit, I decided to start _Mathematica_ using the command line interface (under screen).               $ math      So my code is running, and I know that I can interrupt it with `Ctrl`-`C`, but what I want to do is interrupt it, and then write the state of the process to disk, so that I can reboot. On Linux, there is a program called CryoPID which might work. Unfortunately, my computation is running on OS X. I can detach from the screen session and re-attach to it, but if I reboot the machine I know it'll lose memory and the computation progress so far. My question is: can you save the state of a _Mathematica_ computation that you interrupt (to disk and reloadable after a restart). Thanks.
