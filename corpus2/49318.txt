For some reason when I use ? _function-name_ to ask for help on a function, I got a very clinical breakdown of that function with its options and attributes instead of the blurb about the function: ![?Function](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QjGUv.png) To fix this, I evaluated `ClearSytemCache[]`, killed the kernel (Evaluation > Quit Kernel > Local), and restarted _Mathematica_ \-- it's possible that I had to do only one of these steps -- after which the problem went away. ![?Function fixed](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4z7Eo.png) However, I was just curious about what brought it on.
