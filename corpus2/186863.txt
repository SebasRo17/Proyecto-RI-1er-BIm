I work within a closed environment that defines supported browsers organization-wide. Put another way: you can't use it unless it's an approved install. Given that (soon-to-be-formerly) Twitter Bootstrap and jQuery plan to drop‡ IE7 support, and IE itself has been on version 9 for a while, I'd like to put together a thoughtful case for nudging my organization past IE7. Our environment does have Chrome, but it's adoption hasn't yet caught fire, and in any case everything we need to build will have the IE expectation, for better and for worse, forever. What are some other resources (particularly security-related) that can help me make the case for moving beyond IE7? ‡-perhaps "deprecate IE7 support" would be a better term
