I'm really struggling to find a concrete, easy to grasp, explanation of Atomicity. My understanding thus far is that to ensure an operation is atomic you wrap the critical code in a locker. But that's about as much as I actually understand. Definitions such as the one below make no sense to me at all. > An operation during which a processor can simultaneously read a location and > write it in the same bus operation. This prevents any other processor or I/O > device from writing or reading memory until the operation is complete. > Atomic implies indivisibility and irreducibility, so an atomic operation > must be performed entirely or not performed at all. What does the last sentence mean? Is the term `indivisibility` relating to mathematics or something else? Sometimes the jargon with these topics confuse more than they teach.
