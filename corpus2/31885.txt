I have following problem: I want to set the values for the X-and Y axis by myself, but the values (e.g. 0.800) are not plotted as I defined them (see image 0,8), mathematica removes the zeros.               Data = {{58.771, 0.792}, {53.532, 0.801}, {48.083, 0.795}, {57.343,0.794524}};     AxisY = {0.795, 0.800};     AxisX = {48, 53, 58};     ShowLegend[        Show[         {ListPlot[Data]},         Frame -> {True, True, False, False},         FrameTicks -> {{AxisY, Automatic}, {AxisX, Automatic}}       ],       {{{Graphics[{Blue, Disk[{0, 0}, 1]}], "ABC"}}}     ]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gDxcy.jpg) I tried to solve this problem with _NumberForm_ , but that does't work, the Y-axis disappears. SetPrecision doesn't work in my case, because I don't want to set total positions, I want to set positions after decimal point. Have someone an idea to solve this problem with an easy way?               ShowLegend[        Show[         {ListPlot[Data]},         Frame -> {True, True, False, False},         FrameTicks -> {{NumberForm[#, {4, 2}] &@{Axisy}, Automatic}, {Axisx,Automatic}}       ],       {{{Graphics[{Blue, Disk[{0, 0}, 1]}], "ABC"}}}     ]
