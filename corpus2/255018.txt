Say I compile a simple application called `myproggy` that depends on the `libfoo` dynamic library. Assuming I have another dynamic library `libbaz` that implements absolutely the same interface (in other words it has definitions of the same functions as libfoo), is it possible to modify the `myproggy` to depend upon `libbaz` without the need for rebuild? I can easily do this in the case when I can dynamically load the library, but what if I can't, and I also can't re-compile the library? I am also aware of the security issues related to this.
