I want to do this: $P = (x^3+x)$ $Q = (x^2+1)$ $P \circ Q = P \circ (x^2+1) = (x^2+1)^3+(x^2+1) = x^6+3x^4+4x^2+2$ I used `Composition` for testing if that could be done then :               Composition[p, q][x^3 + x, x^2 + 1]      > >     p[ q[ x + x^3, 1 + x^2]] >   I've also tried to use `Expand` on it but It didn't work. The nearest thing I could do was this:               a = x^2 + 1;  Expand[ a^3 + a]      > >     2 + 4 x^2 + 3 x^4 + x^6 >   I was thinking that doing it by hand on longer compositions would be tedious, is there a function or way to do that?
