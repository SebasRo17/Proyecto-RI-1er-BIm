I was looking through CodePen's "popular pens" and I noticed this cool little spiral animation somebody made with a seemingly ridiculously small amount of code. This is quite impressive until you click the headings for HTML and CSS to show the "compiled" versions of the same code. Suddenly the 3 lines of HAML and ~40 lines of SCSS turns into a gigantic monster of repetition. Here's where my question comes in: Is it acceptable to do something like this in practice? Don't get me wrong - I love using preprocessors to help me write code faster, but in some cases it looks like it's an automatic copy-paste machine.
