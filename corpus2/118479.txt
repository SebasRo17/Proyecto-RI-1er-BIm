One programmer committed some work to the SVN repository, then went home. After he left, the Hudson automatic build failed. Another programmer saw this, and after looking through the code changes, detected that the problem was the absence of one library. He added this library to SVN and the next build completed successfully. Did the second programmer do the right thing or should he have just waited until the first programmer fixed the issue?
