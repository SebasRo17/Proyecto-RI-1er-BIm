I do quite a bit of ASP.NET work (C#, MVC), but most of it is typical web development. I do Restful architecture using CRUD repositories. Most of my clients don't have a lot of advanced requirements within their applications. I'm now looking at node.js and it's performance implications (I'm addicted to speed), but I haven't delved into it all that much. I'm wondering if   * node.js can realistically replace my typical web development in C# and ASP.NET MVC (not rewriting existing apps, but when working on new ones)   * node.js can complement an ASP.NET MVC app by adding some async goodness to the existing architecture. Are there use-cases for/against C# and node.js? ### Edit I love ASP.NET MVC and am super excited with where it's going. Just trying to see if there are special use cases that would favor node.js
