I have a series of rules that I would like to apply to a series of expressions with variables, but cannot get _Mathematica_ to correctly recognize that these rules should apply when my variables have exponents in them. For example, let's suppose I know that `a b=1`.               a b /. a b -> 1     (* 1 *)          a c b /. a b -> 1     (* c *)      So those work fine. Then I try:               a a b /. a b -> 1     (* a^2 b *)      In general, my rules are a good deal more complicated, but the problem is always the same. How do I get mathematica to recognize `a^2` as `a a` so that it correctly applies the reduction rules?
