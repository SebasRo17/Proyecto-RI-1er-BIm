I think today's typical/traditional 3-5 days developer training classes aren't so great, as you tend to forget half of it shortly after. It's too much one way communication and not enough interaction. Also brain research has shown that this kind of setup is usually not optimal for efficient learning. For clarification, I am referring to professional, commercial, paid classes. However this could also be applied for any kind of studies. How could the ultimate developer training package be setup to really make sure you learn what you are supposed to learn? Would that be more:   * Multimedia?   * Exercises?   * Homeworks?   * Spread out over time instead of 3-5 compact days?   * Group projects?
