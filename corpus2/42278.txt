I want to get all the non-descending tuples of a list with given length, for example:               f[{1,2,3,4},{3}]      > > > {{1,1,1},{1,1,2},{1,1,3},{1,1,4},{1,2,2},{1,2,3},{1,2,4},{1,3,3},{1,3,4},{1,4,4}, >      {2,2,2},……,{4,4,4}} >   A function lies between `Tuples` and `Subsets` to some degree. Is the an efficient way to achieve this? (It should be general for all kind of elements, like `Tuples`, not specifically for `Integers`.)
