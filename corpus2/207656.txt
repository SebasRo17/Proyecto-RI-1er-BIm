There are so many Java technologies that it is difficult for me to know where to start. I understand JSP and Servlets. I know what http servers to use. Real basic stuff. What I don't understand is what I do after that? I don't want to create a bunch of jsp and servlets. That's not very different than what I have. I need to query various databases. Some are direct hits. Some have webservices I need to consume. I will have to create a login system that hits active directly. Aren't I supposed to do more to make a "big java" enterprise application?
