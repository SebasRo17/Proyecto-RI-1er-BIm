If you feel curious about it, you may take a look **here**, or just google for it **image shadow removal** There are also a few questions on SE around it. For example:   * http://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/2247/how-can-i-remove-shadows-from-an-image   * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9081930/how-to-remove-the-shadow-in-image-by-using-opencv However, I did not find any Mma implementations out there, and I don't want to reinvent the wheel if it is already rolling. Does anybody know of some Mma codebase for using it as a starter? Note: I have to do this for a few images, so I may go the manual way better than spend many hours in developing a full blown algorithm.
