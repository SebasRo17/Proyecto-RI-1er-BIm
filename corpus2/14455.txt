This simple graph has vertex shapes of different sizes:               edges = {1 \[DirectedEdge] 2, 2 \[DirectedEdge] 3, 3 \[DirectedEdge] 1};     vsf[{xc_, yc_}, name_, {w_, h_}] :=       Module[{},        Switch[name,         1, size = 0.1,         2, size = 0.2,         3, size = 0.3];        Disk[{xc, yc}, size]        ];     Graph[edges, VertexShapeFunction -> vsf, VertexLabels -> edges]      ![graph 1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IeAUE.png) So now I want to reduce the distance between the vertices according to the size of the shapes: ![graph 2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2NVEw.png) It's like the edges are elastic. Perhaps there's some kind of layout option that does this that I can't find, or some way of allowing the edges to be controlled by the vertex shape function? I'm struggling with Mathematica 8 graphing a bit, to be honest (is it just me, or is the documentation not up to the usual standards?) so I don't know whether this is possible, difficult, or easy... I'm hoping to be able to use graph/network tools to produce images like this (see the interactive version here: ![londonworldmap](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rF97n.png) and also apply a similar technique to other ideas, such as this graph for the US 2012 election: ![us election](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gZlIn.png)
