I want to select a point on a graph and display a function of the coordinates value. Asking here a related question I learned to use Setting. Consider the example, where I display the coordinate `x` and its double `2*x`:               Manipulate[      xp = Dynamic[First[pt]];      z = Setting[2*xp];      Column[{        Style[StringForm["x=`1`, z=`2`", xp, z], Blue, 16],        LocatorPane[Dynamic[pt],         ListPlot[{{0, 0}},          Epilog -> {Red, PointSize[Large], Point[Dynamic[pt]]}          ]]}, Center],      {{pt, {0, 0}}, None}      ]      By clicking on the graph, the value of `x` and `z = 2*x` is correctly displayed above the graph. However, one cannot move the `Locator` smoothly, each point must be clicked! The problem is caused by `Setting`. By removing it, the point can be moved around smoothly, `x` is displayed dynamically but then the `z` is not calculated but displayed as `2 x`. Is it possible to display the value of `z` without loosing the fluency in the point selection? Is there a different way to get the value of `z` without using `Setting`?
