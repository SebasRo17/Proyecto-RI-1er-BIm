I have just started a new job and all is not well in neverland. I had high hopes for this company, but when I arrived, I walked into a team that I am having a hard time working with... The two existing developers on this project are having a hard time accepting any suggestions or changes to the code that they spent the last few months writing. It seems like a political minefield and so far their way of dealing with a new team member has been to avoid explaining as much as possible. example: this is a rewrite of an existing system and apparently I don't need to know anything about the old system because they have already reviewed it and know what needs to be done. I don't want to make this a long rant, but there are other issues including micro-management, assigning only trivial bug fixes, and an unwillingness to consider any suggestion, idea, or minor code change that is a departure from how it is currently written. Example: I had a bug fix to make sure a search screen truncated names longer than 25 characters. One of the existing developers made the comment that I need to talk to them before I start so he can show me how the existing string truncate is done, LOL. If I check in code without consulting them first then "the team" decides that it needs to be reworked. HOW do I deal with this? Has anyone out there ever overcome similar issues? Is this just a lost cause??? P.S. I'm not a junior level or incompetent programmer. I'm no rock star, but I've got as much experience and knowledge as the rest of my team, so I don't think that is the underlying issue.
