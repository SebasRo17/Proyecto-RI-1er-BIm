After reading some articles on Google, I decided to start working on Android apps since it's an open source platform from Google. So I wanted to create some apps.I have Android 2.2 Os So I just googled it to find the things and I finally found this link to create Android apps. Is this the link that enables me to create apps or does we need any other IDE? Like we have gcc for c and VC++ for C++. What other things to do I need to set up to get going on this?
