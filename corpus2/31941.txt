### how to change the width and height in the `HTML` code into some other values decided by ratio and a fixed width? The background is that you can adjust a image in your web-page to fit the fixed-width. * * *               string="<img src=\"/HTMLFiles\\Help\\Help\\Help_1.gif\" alt=\"Help_1.gif\" width=\"882\" height=\"382\" style=\"vertical-align:middle\" /><img src=\"/HTMLFiles\\Help\\Help\\spikeyIcon.png\" alt=\"Spikey\" width=\"20\" height=\"21\" style=\"padding-right:2px; border:0px solid white; vertical-align:middle;\" />";      Here is my tries, a snippet of my terrible codes. I want to change the $\text{width}>800$ into $800$, here it is $882$. `And` height becomes the corresponding value.               StringCases[string,(*strT:*) imgTag : Shortest["<img" ~~ __ ~~ ">"] :>   StringReplace[imgTag,    widthString :        Shortest["width=\"" ~~ width__ ~~ "\" "] ~~ (heightSring :         Shortest["height=\"" ~~ height__ ~~ "\" s"(*Here,          there is a strange thing I felt, try delete the 's'.*)]) ~~       pp__ /; (heightE =         ToExpression[         ToExpression[(ttt =             StringDrop[StringDrop[heightSring, 7], -1])]];        widthE =         ToExpression[         ToExpression[(tt = StringDrop[widthString, 6])]]) > 800 :>     "width=\"800\" height=\"" <> ToString[N[800 heightE/widthE]] <>      "\" " <> pp]]          (*         {<img src="/HTMLFiles\Help\Help\Help_1.gif" alt="Help_1.gif" width="800" height="346.485"      tyle="vertical-align:middle" />,<img src="/HTMLFiles\Help\Help\spikeyIcon.png" alt="Spikey     " width="20" height="21" style="padding-right:2px; border:0px solid white; vertical-align:     middle;" />}     *)      The value of `ttt` is               ttt          (*         "21"      *)      It's Ok, but there is a problem, see the comment of the above code. ### question1: * * * in the `heightString` pattern, delete the "s" of "style"(I think/hope "\" " is enough to work well like that in `widthString`, but why it dosn't work well?)               StringCases[string,(*strT:*) imgTag : Shortest["<img" ~~ __ ~~ ">"] :>   StringReplace[imgTag,    widthString :        Shortest["width=\"" ~~ width__ ~~ "\" "] ~~ (heightSring :         Shortest["height=\"" ~~ height__ ~~ "\" "]) ~~       pp__ /; (heightE =         ToExpression[         ToExpression[(ttt =             StringDrop[StringDrop[heightSring, 7], -1])]];        widthE =         ToExpression[         ToExpression[(tt = StringDrop[widthString, 6])]]) > 800 :>     "width=\"800\" height=\"" <> ToString[N[800 heightE/widthE]] <>      "\" " <> pp]]          (*         {<img src="/HTMLFiles\Help\Help\Help_1.gif" alt="Help_1.gif" width="800" height="346.485"      style="vertical-align:middle" />,<img src="/HTMLFiles\Help\Help\spikeyIcon.png" alt="Spike     y" width="20" height="21" style="padding-right:2px; border:0px solid white; vertical-align     :middle;" />}     *)          ttt          (*         "21" style="padding-right:2px; border:0px solid white; vertical-align:middle;"     *)      ## question2 * * * of course, my codes are urgly, as you see, too many `ToExpression`,and `StringDrop`. I definitely know you can think up a simpler method? how to optimize my codes? Welcome to comment, if you're interested with the question and feel hard to understand and badly I'm always poor at expressing. here is my page in GitHub with code formatted better One problem need under consideration is the spaces, and that in my method it's sensitive, for example: maybe not all `style`s are after `width=\"20\" height=\"21\" [other...?]style=\"padding...` . * * * @ssch's answer is good, but I wanna see some `StringManipulation` answers, since I'm learning `StringManipulation` via this example. Welcome to post your answers.
