I'm trying to find an explanation for the different sizes I'm seeing for fonts added to graphics in different ways, and haven't yet located an easy to understand explanation. Here's a minimal example:               Graphics[      {LightGray,       Rectangle[{0, 0}, {72, 72}],       Red,       Style[        Text["Hig", {0, 0}, {-1, -1}], 72,        FontFamily -> "Times New Roman"],       Black,       First[        First[         ImportString[          ExportString[           Style["Hig",             FontFamily -> "Times New Roman",             FontSize -> 72], "PDF"],          "TextMode" -> "Outlines"]]]       },      PlotRange -> {{0, 100}, {0, 100}},       Axes -> True,       Ticks -> {Table[x, {x, 0, 100, 10}], Table[x, {x, 0, 100, 10}]},      Epilog -> {Text["72", {200, 75}], Line[{{0, 72}, {200, 72}}]}]      ![fonts](http://i.stack.imgur.com/l2wT7.png) The red text doesn't change size when you resize the graphic, although everything else changes. The black text resizes along with everything else. But neither text seems to be the result of specifying 72. ## Update After changing the screen resolution to Automatic following @Sjoerd's suggestion, I can see how the red text is basically displaying at a fixed size that's independent of _Mathematica_. In this picture, the left image shows 72 dpi, the red font is using 70ish pixels of vertical space. The right image is at 'Automatic' (so presumably 133.51 for my machine, according to this site, and similarly uses up 70ish pixels. ![resolutions](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Qjbuv.png) I'm still puzzled by the size of the black font, which doesn't seem to be related to the specified font size or to the screen resolution. Perhaps the PDF translation introduces another scaling factor.
