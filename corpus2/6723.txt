Here is a theoretical problem. It could apply to many systems. Let's assume RESTful Web services for example. You want to find out something but as it happens you can't get it in a single query. You can make multiple queries. For example, you have a joint bank account (or a company bank account) and you want to find out how much money is in there. Meanwhile someone else transfers money from checking to savings.               Checking:  $5,000   Savings:  $3,000      > Me: Query Checking. Response: $5,000 > Joe: Transfer $4,000 from Checking to Savings               Checking: $1,000   Savings:  $7,000      Me: Query Savings. Response: $7,000 Total $12,000. How do you avoid anomalies like this? The example shows two accounts at one bank, but it can also happen with two accounts at two different banks.
