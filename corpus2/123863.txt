I thought this would be easy, but its been sort of a disaster. I want to set up a bug tracker that integrates with source control. At a minimum, when you commit to source control, it should notify the issue tracker and if the comment is set up correctly, push a commit reference to the issue tracker, so you can navigate back and see what happened. This works very well with github using its integrated issue tracker, but this requires github as the place where the source goes, and the issue tracker is VERY basic (which is good and bad). We work with multiple clients, and about 50% use SVN. We _could_ do round trips to github, but that's a mess. I tried Jira, multiple times, using their ondemand service. It was a huge waste of time. They integrate subversion, and everything else feels like its taped on after the fact. Documentation and everything else is comically bad. I still haven't gotten github to work with Jira, after multiple attempts, and the setup seems to be OK, but nothing ever comes over. Tried FogBugz, but that seems to include its own source control. Can't connect to outside repos. Tried plan.io for redmine. You can have subversion or git, which was very exciting, till I found out you can have either, but THEY host them, which totally doesn't work. Ideally I'd like Jira, or something similar, able to point at outside repos. Also looked at youtrack, and although it seems to mention github integration, from the demo it looks like it doesn't hook back into the repo on commits. They also have a link for hosted Youtrack, but when you get there its no longer live. Would download/install locally if I thought it would solve the problem, but I'd rather not go through that exercise without knowing if it has the features I need first. I'd also like some code review features, but we'll just start with issues hooked into source control. Thanks in advance.
