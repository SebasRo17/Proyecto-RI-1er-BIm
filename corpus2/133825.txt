I only have a verbal hosting agreement in place with a customer. Unfortunately the relationship has deteriorated to the point of no return, and I'd like to end the hosting agreement and hand them over the root password. This is a virtual dedicated server I pay for, and then they pay me. They are fine with this, but the problem is I don't trust this client even a little bit. Can I get them to sign something saying they release me from liability to changes made on the server once I give them the password? How is the root password usually given to clients who request it while making sure they don't come back later on and blame you for breaking the server? Does simply the act of giving them the root password infer that you are handing over complete control and thus complete responsibility?
