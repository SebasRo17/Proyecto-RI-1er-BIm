In my program I have an expression which looks like:               AnalyticalExpression = 2^(-1-n-np)R^(-2+n+np)(8np1f[-2+n+np,-1+p1+p1p,1+p2+p2p,1+q1+q1p,3+q2+q2p]-8np1f[-2+n+np,-1+p1+p1p,3+p2p2p,1+q1+q1p,1+q2+q2p]-4np1f[-2+n+np,p1+p1p,p2+p2p,q1+q1p,4+q2+q2p]+...)      I gave here a short example; full expression is few pages long. From my point of view, this expression serves as a function of the integer variables n,np,p1,p1p,q1,q1p,... and two real variables R,x. My program evaluates the above expression by using a replacement rule, for instance:               tmp = AnalyticalExpression /. {n->2,np->3,p1->0,p2->4,...}      The problem is that the program has to evaluate this expression hundreds of thousands times with different values of these integer variables. This makes the whole program painfully slow. Is there a tricky way to perform this substitution efficiently? Tabulation of AnalyticalExpression for every combination of the integer variables seems quite weird to me... Thanks in advance for the answers and suggestions. Michal
