I'm working on visualizing a hierarchy. There will be clusters of objects, each cluster containing rectangles of fixed width but variable height. I'd like to arrange these within a rectangular space so as to have equal visual spacing between them, something like this: ![mockup](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SapuH.png) download bmml source - Wireframes created with Balsamiq Mockups Before I spend a day inventing the wheel, are there standard algorithms for this kind of distribution and space-filling? If the objects were all the same size, I'd just use a grid. I'll be using this algorithm at two levels: once to lay out the clusters, and again to lay out the objects within each cluster. The latter would look best if they were arranged within a roughly circular space, but if that complicates things excessively I'm OK with rectangular. I won't be showing relationships between these objects, so distance minimization is not necessary. There's a similar question (What would be the best way to fill "space" in an User Interface for irregular image sizes gallery?) about laying out rectangular images while eliminating or minimizing white space. In my case, I want to equalize white space, clusters will be circular, and some clusters will be much larger than others.
