I know pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. But I just wonder the strategy still work in the case. For example   * if they have a very different programming skill level.    * if one never experience in the problem domain while another have.   * Is it still OK if they have low programming skill level? Could you suggest the pair programming strategy in the case above?
