We've all heard it; whenever there's a discussion about CS grads having poor development skills someone eventually says, > Computer science isn't software engineering. The problem that I see is that programming and software development _are_ taught in CS courses. They're just commonly taught poorly. If it's being taught, then why not teach it right the first time? * So I would like to see what the opinions are on 2 questions:   1. Is the CS != SE argument a copout or excuse for not properly teaching programming skills.   2. Regardless of your answer to question 1; if you were in the almighty position of making such a decision: would you force an emphasis on proper teaching of programming in CS courses? *. I have a suspicion, based on anecdotal evidence I obtained throughout my education, that most academics in the field haven't had to write code to be maintained and haven't maintained code, and as a result don't have the knowledge/skills to teach it effectively.
