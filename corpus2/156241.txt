I'm in the process of writing my own programming language which, thus far, has been going great in terms of what I set out to accomplish. However, now, I'd like to bootstrap some pre-existing data structures and/or objects. My problem is that I'm not really sure on how to begin. When the compiler begins do I splice in these add-ins so their part of the scope of the application? If I make these in some core library, my concern is how I distribute the library in addition to the compiler--or are they part _of_ the compiler? I get that there are probably a number of plausible ways to approach this, but I'm having trouble with the setting my direction. If it helps, the language is on top of the .NET core (i.e it compiles to CLR code). Any help or suggestions are very much appreciated!
