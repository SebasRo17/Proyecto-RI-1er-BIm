This includes everything that contributes to the success of the app and is non-programming. Some points to consider:   * How do you make people notice your app when there are hundreds released every week? How to get an article published in a mobile app blog about your app? Should you buy ads? What about a press release?   * How to shoot a promotional video? What material is good? Should you go for animation or real life footage?   * How to make a project website for the app? Should it be simple in design? What about feedback forum? Should you use standard forum like, uservoice.com?   * To which marketplace should you release the app? Should you stick to one or as many as you can?   * Should you wait with releasing until you have all these handled or should you do it immediately? Is there a good time to release your app?
