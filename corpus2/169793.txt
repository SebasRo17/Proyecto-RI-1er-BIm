I'm working on a project that uses some icons that are under a Creative Commons license (ND) that forbids modification of the picture. What can I do with this icons as a programmer? Can I modify the looks of the image in the program as long as I don't change anything in the file that contains the icon? Have I modified the image if I put a colored transparent layer over it so the color of the icon changes?
