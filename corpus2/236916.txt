I am developing a embedded system (computer + os + programs) to sell it to a company. I am confused about the licensing and the softwares I wanted to use to develop the system.So I want to know if I can use these programs free of charge and without distributing the source code for commercial use.I wanted to use:   * A linux distro o custom linux build:I thought Arch Linux   * A Web Server + PHP + MySQL: I thought XAMMP,they says that is free of charge for commercial use but I don't know if the components are also.   * A QT backend and frontend,but I don't know if I can use the LGPL version for commercial use or I need to use the Commercial License.   * jQuery (I saw that if I maintain the notice,I can use it) Thanks for your response
