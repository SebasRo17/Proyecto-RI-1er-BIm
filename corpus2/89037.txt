I'm a professional .NET -C#- developer who's interested in doing development for Android. I'd like to know if it's really necessary for me to first read a book or two on Java (like Java For Programmers 2nd), or if I should just be able to pick up an Android book (like Pro Android 3) and be able to -mostly- work my way around it without much fuzz. **Note 1** : Java is not 100% new to me. For testing purposes, I've previously done a few -very basic- console applications and web applications. **Note 2** : I'm not trying to shift from .NET to Java / Android anytime soon. I just wat to develop applications for myself and this wonderful community. :)
