Commenting in code I believe is very important but recently I've been reviewing code that has left me wondering particular this one.                //due to lack of confidence with web programming leaving this note in for now      What is the right level of granularity for code commenting? EDIT: Obviously the above comment is shocking hence why I'm asking the question. I've recently noticed the inline comments in the code at my work place annoying. Instead of getting angry I want discovery the acceptable level of granularity for code commenting in the community.
