I find myself talking about computers with a lot of non-tech people, who often use the word "glitch" to describe an undesirable outcome of a program or operating system(of course, never Linux!). I have never heard another programmer use the word "glitch" and hearing it makes me think the user has no idea what they are talking about. SO my question: Do you use the word glitch in everyday, technical conversation, if not, does its use imply to you ignorance and lack understanding?
