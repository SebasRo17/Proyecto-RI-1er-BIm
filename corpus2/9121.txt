From this question I successfully made an elliptical fit for my data. However, when I try and collect the datapoints within the ellipse via this question the coordinates of my ellipse correspond to an ellipse of a rasterized image of my listplot data and not the original. How can I transform or scale the ellipse that fits the rasterized image to the original listplot. Ok, with all that said heres an example.               data = RandomReal[NormalDistribution[], {100000, 2}]     p = ListPlot[data, ImageSize -> 4000];     f = FillingTransform@ColorNegate@Binarize@p // DeleteSmallComponents     {c, s, t} = 1 /. ComponentMeasurements[f, {"Centroid", "SemiAxes", "Orientation"}]     Show[Rasterize[p], Graphics[{Red, Rotate[Circle[c, s],t]}]]      where I get a nice image: ![example data](http://i45.tinypic.com/34tej38.jpg) however, the coordinates c, s, t of the ellipse are pixle coordiantes corresponding to the rasterized image rather than data coordinates. So when I need the ellipses parameter to do any calculations I get bunk results. The image processing approach would be the best as I am filtering out the most dense cluster of data. Thanks so much.
