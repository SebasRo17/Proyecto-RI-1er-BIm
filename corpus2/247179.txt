I am developing an mobile application for the first time and have some confusions around it **What I plan to do?**   The `iPhone` application will have `Sign in with Google` where user will authenticate on client side (I don't plan to have server access unless needed) and the user details (id, email for example) will be send to backend server (planning to write RESTful APIs in Java). **What is the confusion then?**   1. Since multiple mobile devices would be hitting the APIs what would be CORS settings on the server? Would it allow **ALL** origins?   2. If the application authenticates on client side, how can backend makes sure that this is authenticated user only and no one is playing around with the system(by playing around with REST API)   3. The problem goes to next level when multiple providers are involved, example Facebook, Twitter  What are the recommendations, how should the system be designed in this case? Thanks P.S Sorry for not making it `programmatic` question.
