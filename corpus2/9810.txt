Ever since the update, people keep calling and saying "Ever since the update X, Y and Z are slow, bad and crashing" This has happened ever since the dawn of updates. What do people expect? Gamma comes after beta, and gamma testing always turns our users into The Incredible Hulks... Perhaps you've never heard this from a client, perhaps you're in college or a FLOSS Dev who can spread the blame around more than 5 or 6 guys, perhaps you unit test your code, perhaps you're not in that interesting situation where customers actually call you requesting the exact time of day you'll be releasing today's patch (I'd love to do that to Microsoft) or perhaps you're a sorry son-of-a-biscuit like me who just shipped a new update and went home and is dreading going back to work tomorrow. Anyway, ya'll are smarter than me anyway. How do you field criticism framed in "You must be a bad programmer because you're making your software worse"?
