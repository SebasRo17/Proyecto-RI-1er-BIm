Suppose I give my developers a screaming fast machine. WPF-based VS2010 loads very quickly. The developer then creates a WPF or WPF/e application that runs fine on his box, but much slower in the real world. This question has two parts... 1) If I give a developer a slower machine, does that mean that the resulting code may be faster or more efficient? 2) What can I do to give my developers a fast IDE experience, while giving 'typical' runtime experiences? **Update:** For the record, I'm preparing my even-handed response to management. This isn't my idea, and you folks are helping me correct the misguided requests of my client. Thanks for giving me more ammunition, and references to where and when to approach this. I've +1'ed valid use cases such as:   \- specific server side programming optimizations   \- test labs   \- the possibly buying a better server instead of top of the line graphics cards
