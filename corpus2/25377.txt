This one must be simple, but I can't figure out a decent solution. Suppose, I have a symbol with a notational form applied to it, say `OverHat[A]`. Now, if I didn't specify anything about `A`, I would expect `Dt[OverHat[A]]` staying unevaluated. But in reality `OverHat` gets evaluated: `Dt[OverHat[A]] (* ---> Dt[A] Derivative[1][OverHat][A] *)` What are possible ways to prevent this from happening? **EDIT** To state more clearly, I want `OverHat[A]` to behave like ordinary symbol under action of `Dt`: `Dt[symb] (* ---> Dt[symb] *)`
