We have a client with whom we have a relationship of delivering proofs of concepts _only_. But when it comes the time to demo they expect an early version of what would be the solution. They want databases populated with real data, look-and-feel of a finished product and other things (including features) which are trivial and no way contribute towards _proving_ the concept. What do you do with that? How do you handle such a situation? (I'm the developer as well as the person who will be talking to the client along with other non-developers.)
