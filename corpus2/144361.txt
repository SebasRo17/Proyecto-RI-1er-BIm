We have a big collection of java (80%) and .Net (20%) apps.. And the people in charge want a way to monitor the applications somehow. So they told me they are interested in AppDynamics? I have spent a bit looking into it but I still don't get it. Can someone tell me what its about ? From my understanding it seems like you would someone inject the AppDynamics API in your code to tell about differnt events that occur? So sounds like Event Viewer ? I am on the .NET side of this and seems to me we can just write data to a log and report off of that data.. I don't get what the additional complexity of using'AppDynamics' does. Maybe it is overkill ??
