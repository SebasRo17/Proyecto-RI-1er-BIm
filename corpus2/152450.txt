A visually impaired colleague has asked me to recommend an IDE with easy-to- find and easy-to-use controls for:   1. font size   2. background and foreground colors   3. changing syntax color scheme   4. support for at least C/C++ and Java He would prefer an IDE that is either portable or that has similar versions for Linux, Windows and Mac. He prefers a dark background and light colored fonts and needs to sit very close to the display.
