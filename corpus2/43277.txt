I want to define simple matrix algebra (inspired by the following posts: Block Matrix Algebra with Mathematica ; How to define custom operators ). I assume the funtion `MatrixMult[A_,B_]` to be the matrix product. I surely can define some properties of this function, like linearity, associativity etc. (see referenced posts). Now I want to solve simple matrix equation               Solve[MatrixMult[A, X]==B,X]      Obviously, the answer is               {{X -> InverseFunction[MatrixMult, 2, 2][A, B]}}      Now the question is how can I explicitly define that the inverse of my function is the following:               InverseFunction[MatrixMult, 2, 2][A_, B_] := MatrixMult[Inverse[A], B]      (the last line results in _"Tag InverseFunction is Protected"_ error)
