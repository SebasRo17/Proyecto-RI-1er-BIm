testData = Table[N@Sin[500 x], {x, 0, 100}];     ListLinePlot[Abs[Fourier[testData]], PlotRange -> Full]      Gives me ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zM6mT.png) Which I do not expect because the Fourier Transform is `FourierTransform[Sin[500 x], x, f],` > >     I Sqrt[Pi/2] DiracDelta[-500+f]-I Sqrt[Pi/2] DiracDelta[500+f] >   I'm not saying that Mathematica's Fourier function is somehow faulty. But could someone please explain why there isn't a peak around 500? This is the frequency of the signal after all...
