In this picture you see a graph. The shortest path between vertex 5 and vertex 3 is highlighted in red. Instead I want blue highlighted edges of thickness 10.               HighlightGraph[WheelGraph[6, EdgeStyle -> Directive[Black,AbsoluteThickness[10]]],      PathGraph@FindShortestPath[WheelGraph[6], 5, 3],       GraphHighlightStyle -> {"Red", AbsoluteThickness[10]}]      ![a](http://i.stack.imgur.com/aZ1c9.png) I tried this. The thickness went to 10, but why is the highlighted path not blue?                 HighlightGraph[WheelGraph[6, EdgeStyle -> Directive[Black, AbsoluteThickness[10]],       VertexSize -> 0], PathGraph@FindShortestPath[WheelGraph[6], 5, 3],       GraphHighlightStyle -> {"Blue", AbsoluteThickness[10]}]      ![b](http://i.stack.imgur.com/d9Ykm.png)
