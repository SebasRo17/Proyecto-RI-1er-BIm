In this MSDN Magazine article Peter Vogel describes Extension Objects partten. What is not clear is _whether extensions can be later implemented by client code residing in a separate assembly_.   And if so _how in this case can extension get acces to private members of the objet being extended_? I quite often need to set different access levels for different classes.   Sometimes I really need that descendants does not have access to the mebmer but separate class does. (good old friend classes) Now I solve this in C# by exposing callback properties in interface of the external class and setting them with private methods. This also alows to adjust access: read only or read|write depending on the desired interface.               class Parent     {         private int foo;              public void AcceptExternal(IFoo external)         {             external.GetFooCallback = () => this.foo;         }     }          interface IFoo     {         Func<int> GetFooCallback {get;set;}     }      Other way is to explicitly implement particular interface. But I suspect more aspproaches exist. **Update 1**   New Peter's article makes it a bit clearer.
