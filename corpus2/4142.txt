Often when stating a new project I'll require a _"quick 'n' dirty"_ content management solution. Ideally something that can read my database schema and generated HTML forms. Previously I've used; phpMyEdit and phpMyAdmin but they are lacking is key areas. My wish list woulds be:   1. Database independent   2. Foreign key aware   3. Handles views as-well-as tables   4. Generates modern HTML and CSS   5. AJAX interface. What's your swiss army knife when it comes to CMS on a project?
