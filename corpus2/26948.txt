I am trying to plot a parametric circle in rainbow colors. It should go round once, but I'd like to be able to make it go round the rainbow an arbitrary amount of times. I currently have:               ParametricPlot3D[{Sin[u] Sin[Theta], Cos[u] Sin[Theta],        Cos[Theta]} /. Theta -> Pi/6, {u, -Pi, Pi},        PlotStyle -> Directive[Thickness[.01]],        ColorFunction -> Function[{x, y, z}, ColorData["Rainbow"][(Arg[x + I y] + Pi)/(2 Pi)]]]      Which I think should choose a color from the `ColorData` named `Rainbow` (which changes only between 0 and 1 (the result of `Arg` lies between `-Pi` and `Pi`, so adding `Pi` and dividing the resulting interval by `2 Pi` will give me a number between 0 and 1) depending on the angle of the circle. I get an almost decent result if I divide by `Pi/2` instead of `2 Pi`: ![Nearly rainbow circle](http://i.stack.imgur.com/88y7i.png) But I have no idea why there is yellow and green twice. I'm certainly missing something, does anyone know what?
