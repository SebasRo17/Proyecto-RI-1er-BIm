We currently have a complex VC++ software application, which uses a library like ObjectARX to build the dll. I feel there are many features in C# like Collections, Generics, and other libraries which can be used to build the current application in a better and efficient way. I have been thinking about it, but I am not sure on how to present it to my Supervisor and colleagues. I would appreciate any help, to help me think in the right direction and highlight the points to bring it to the team. Few points that I thought was;   1. With some current examples, implementing it in C# with the features.   2. Highlight the development time is comparatively lesser in C# than C++.   3. Use a Design Architecture.
