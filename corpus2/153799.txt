**Edit:** Thanks for all of the answers, guys! I think I'm just going to include some kind of text on my webpage telling users to only download from the links provided. The thing is that there have been some legitimate and illegitimate websites that have picked up on my software, so it would be safer just to tell users to avoid any website that I don't link to. Thanks a lot for all the help! **Original:** The software I've created is hosted on what you could call a "bad" website. It's hard to explain, so I'll just provide an example. I've made a free password generator. This, along with most of my other FREE software, is available on this website. This is their description of my software:               Platform: 7/7 x64/Windows 2K/XP/2003/Vista     Size: 61.6 Mb     License: Trial     File Type: .7z     Last Updated: June 4th, 2011, 15:38 UTC     Avarage Download Speed: 6226 Kb/s     Last Week Downloads: 476     Toatal Downloads: 24908      Not only is the size completely skewed, it is not trial software, it's free software. The thing is that it's not the description I'm worried about--it's the download links. The website is a scam website. They apparently link to "cracks" and "keygens", but not only is that in itself illegal, they actually link to fake download websites that give you viruses and charge your credit card. Just to list things that are wrong with this website: they claim all software is paid software then offer downloads for keygens and cracks; they fake all details about the program and any program reviews and ratings; they and the downloads site they link to are probably run by the same person, so they make money off of these lies. I'm only a teenager with no means to pursue legal action. This means that, unfortunately, I can't do anything that will actually get results. I'd like my software to only be downloaded off my personal website. I have links to four legitimate locations to download my software and that's it. Essentially, is there anything I can do about this? As I said above, I can't pursue legal action, but is there some way I can discourage traffic to that website by blacklisting it or something? Can I make a claim on MY website to only download my software from the links I provide? Or should I just pay no mind? Because, honestly, it's a bit of a ways back in Google results. Thank you ahead of time.
