As part of an interview process for a senior software development role, we are being asked to create a language-agnostic 'exam' that can be sat as part of the face-to-face interview. The reason being that we will need to produce non-subjective empirical evidence as part of the justification of who is offered the role. **How would you structure/format it to give the most reasonable results possible?** **What sort of questions would you ask?** _(Note: this is not the majority of the interview process, just a small piece we must do)_
