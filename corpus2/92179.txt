From Wikipedia: > In mathematics and computer science, an **algorithm** is an effective method > expressed as a finite list of well-defined instructions for calculating a > function. > > In software engineering, a **design pattern** is a general reusable solution > to a commonly occurring problem in software design. By description(assuming they are correct on Wikipedia), it appears that Algorithm and Design Pattern are somewhat similar/same. They both achieve the task of solving a problem and both are certainly reusable if properly implemented. Does it make any sense to compare them to evaluate differences between them?
