I'm just curious, I'm building a web app with a User model which has role- based permissions. I have the following roles:   * Visitor (anonymous user)   * ?? (logged-in user)   * Moderator   * Admin I'm having a hard time figuring out what to call a logged-in user. I want to just call them "users", but I find that having a role with the same name as the class creates confusing code sometimes. For instance: `if user.user? then...` If you've built software with roles for users, what do you call the basic, registered, no special permissions, user role? _EDIT:_ As a side consideration, this app has Subscribers and Non Subscribers. Whether or not a user is a subscriber is not the same as their role, but it affects the way I've been thinking about this. For instance, calling a regular user a "member" sounds a lot like what I would call a subscriber, so I haven't been too fond of that. I haven't ruled it out though.
