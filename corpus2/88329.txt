So I've been working at this job for a couple of months. I'm a little frustrated because I do my best work from 2 to 7. In previous jobs, I've come in at 9:30-10:00 and leave at 7. Some companies have been okay with this, others have not. But my current company insists on my being there at 8:30. Any deviation from this is a big deal. Is this typical? I have colleagues who are more 9:30 to 6:30, 10:00-7:00 guys...but maybe that is just startup culture? I don't see why, given that I don't meet clients, etc. what the advantage to having things be so rigid could be. I also don't see why if there is 15 to 20 minute variation sometimes in coming in, why people don't just assume that I will adjust when I leave... Are these unreasonable expectations as a developer or am I missing something?
