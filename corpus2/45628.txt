![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/47NjD.jpg) I have been attempting several methods to plot a 3D diagram of a n by n boolean array in _Mathematica_ but none of them produced satisfactory result. I want the $3D$ plot to have a cube when `M[i,j,k] == 1` and when `M[i,j,k] == 0` just leaves as blank. Below is the best result I got.               L=10     M = RandomReal[{0, 1}, {L, L, L}];     For[k = 1, k <= L, k++,       For[j = 1, j <= L, j++,        For[i = 1, i <= L, i++,         If[M[[i, j, k]] < 0.5,          M[[i, j, k]] = 1,          M[[i, j, k]] = 0          ]]]];     Image3D[M, ImageSize -> 500, Boxed -> True]      The `Image3D` function gives a very fluffy and opaque look on the cubes which I couldn't change!! Is there someway I can change the opacity and color of the `Image3D` function in this case? Or is there a better way to plot this matrix?
