Take a look at the following code. What my problem is is that I can't figure out how to redimension the n integer and the b integer. What I'm doing is the array sent1 is already working and it is populated with about 4 sentences. I need to go through each sentence and work on it but I'm having trouble. ` dim sent1() dim sent2() dim n as integer, b as integer, x as integer dim temp_sent as string b = 0 For n = 1 to ubound(sent1) temp_sent = sent1(n) for x = 1 to len(temp_sent1)               code               if a then     b = b + 1      **THIS IS THE PART OF THE CODE THAT IS NOT WORKING**               redim preserve sent2(1 to ubound(sent1), b)     sent2(n,b) = [code]          next      next `
