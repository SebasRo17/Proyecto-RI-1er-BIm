I'm a EE major who has been working as a software engineer for the past 4 years. Nearly all of the programming that I do at work is in C++. Like a lot of other members here, I'm afraid of being pigeon-holed in a particular area in this industry. I'm thinking about changing jobs to a new area, such as web or mobile. But because I don't have a CS degree OR web/mobile experience, I'm concerned that prospective employers will have a problem with hiring me--especially since I would not be applying for an entry-level job. I read in another thread that C++ developers are seen as a cut above other devs. Is this true, and would it compensate for my lack of experience in the relevant technologies? What should someone in my position do to improve my chances?
