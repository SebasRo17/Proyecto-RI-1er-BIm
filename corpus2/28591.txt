![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BNjHj.png) This example is in `DisplayFormula` cell.               cellExpression=Cell[BoxData[RowBox[{RowBox[{SuperscriptBox["f","\[Prime]",MultilineFunction->None],RowBox[{"(","x",")"}]}],"=",RowBox[{RowBox[{"sin","",FractionBox["1","x"]}],"-",RowBox[{FractionBox["1","x"],"cos",FractionBox["1","x"],RowBox[{"(",RowBox[{"x","!=","0"}],")"}]}]}]}]],"DisplayFormulaNumbered"];CellPrint@cellExpression      How can I format them to the appearance like the following in batch. I set `FontSize->Times`, and `Italic` for $\color{Green}{f'(x)}$, $x$ seperately, but not so easy for too many `InlineFormula`/`DisplayFormula/...` cells by hand. ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/puE3y.png) $$\begin{align*}\color{blue}{f'(x)}=\sin \frac{1}{\color{red}{x}}-\frac{1}{\color{red}{x}}\cos\frac{1}{\color{red}{x}}(\color{red}{x}\neq 0)\tag{1}\end{align*}$$ When I export notebook as html, the formulas are rasterized to image which not in `TraditionalForm` which shown above as that I setted by hand. sample typesetting, inline formulas are images, I'm thinking that how to make them more beautiful and more traditional formal. Most of them are typed into Mathematica by hand As you'll see that some single `f`s are Times Italic, they are good shown, but in `DisplayFormula` they are not. ### Edit: Mike Honeychurch's example ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1tQXR.png) My Setting(related?): ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Pik0D.png) ### ------------Note: I've tried Mike's method, however failed, how about yours. I'm on _Windows_ and _Mathemtaica_ 9.
