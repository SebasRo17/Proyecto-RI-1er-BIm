Without knowing anything I wrote a big application, almost 1 year coding. It does Video/Audio such as softphone for commercial use (we sell it). I used a framework which was licensed under the LGPL, lesser Gnu Public License. Now before I release it to production, since I used the `H.264` video codec and a 'LGPL' framework, what should I know and what should I do? Or I do not need to do anything? This is my employer releasing and selling the application, I just did my job making the application and getting it to run without crashing. Do I need to apply for a license to court? Or do I apply for license to the framework programmers? How do I make myself valid before I let it go to my company management. **Follow up:** H.264 Encoder has GPL license H.264 Decoder has LGPL license Where do i buy encoder license? http://www.x264licensing.com/features Where do i buy decoder license? http://www.mpegla.com/main/programs/AVC/Pages/AgreementExpress.aspx How much does it cost me license? http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/h264-patents- how-much-do-they-really-cost/2122
