I would like to know what kind of **jobs/roles** one could expect on their career path if they start as a developer. I also want to know **how many years** you'll be expected to stay in the same role until you progress to the next level. The career path is of course, based on how good you do your job, the company etc. but assume a normal person who balances life and family with career. Some examples of roles that I have in may head: developer, senior developer, architect, project manager etc.
