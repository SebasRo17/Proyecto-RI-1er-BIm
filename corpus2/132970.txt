In an answer on how to make time estimates it is said to write down all your assumptions you made when estimating a project. Seems like a good plan. Problem is, by assuming I already made an ass out of myself without realizing it. Assumptions are those evil things that like to stay hidden, things I took for granted. So when reviewing my estimate, what techniques can I apply to discover the assumptions I based my time estimate on?
