_Mathematica 9_ lets you create presentations with background images. There are 6 default stylesheets for this: Earth, Garnet, Sapphire, Opal, Sunrise, Steel and Water. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/V2Jpm.png) For your existing presentations I have found that you can apply the new appearance by selecting one of those stylesheets and copying the very first cell in a blank presentation created with the desired stylesheet. My question is: What is the recommended procedure to change the background image to something else? I have already found that the background images are controlled by the following cells in the stylesheet:               Cell[       StyleData["Notebook", "SlideShow"],       BackgroundAppearance -> FrontEnd`FileName[{"SlideShow"}, "EarthBackground.png"]]          Cell[       StyleData["FirstSlide"],       PrivateCellOptions ->          {"PagewiseNotebookBaseStyle" ->            {System`BackgroundAppearance ->              FrontEnd`FileName[{"SlideShow"}, "EarthTitleBackground.png"]}}]      And I can indeed put an adiditional background image file inside the `$InstallationDirectory/SystemFiles/FrontEnd/SystemResources/SlideShow` directory, but If I do that it will not be portable. So it is possible to use a background image that is contained inside the presentation notebook?
