Here is the context. The apps will:   * consume existing (and standard) web services.   * app is UI intensive (UI updated frequently and lot of data to display).   * development team experience level is average.   * development team has very few experiences in silverlight & WPF.   * I want it simple, but I want to avoid a complete rewrite in the near future, so I must (try to) take a correct path from the beginning. I know that using no pattern at all is the easiest and fastest way to go, and that implementing MTVT is the phantasm of all the .NET architects out there. But I don't have the budget ;) I need a pragmatic solution, easy to implement, easy to understand, and that works. When I browse the internet, MVVM Light is well positioned, but Microsoft is proposing its own implementation. Will it become standard like ASP.NET MVC?
