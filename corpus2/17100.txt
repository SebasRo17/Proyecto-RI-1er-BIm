I have a simple functional programming question: I have a simple EdgeList defined in Mathematica, I would like to modify the value of certain element of the list based on a condition. I see how to define the conditional `If`, but I don't know how to "scan" my EdgeList and modify the elements so that it returns another EdgeList. Could someone show me a simple example on how to accomplish this in _Mathematica_?
