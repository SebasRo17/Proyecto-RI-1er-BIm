We are working on a project that includes a web server and a mobile application, we need to access the user's private data (facebook, twitter ...) from the web server by requesting from the user to authenticate our app using the mobile. I managed to access the user's private data from the mobile easily after the user has authenticated the app. now how can I propagate/share this privilege with the server, so that the server can access the user data anytime and work on it ? A typical use case for example:   * user install our mobile app.   * user registers for a direct messages counter service (dummy service).   * user authenticate our app to access his twitter account on the mobile.   * server starts daily pinging the twitter apis and get some data about the user.   * server publish the results to the mobile app. is this scenario possible ? if so where should I be looking to make it happen ?
