I'm not exactly a new git user but I have never used any of its advanced features such as tags, branches, merging and others. I haven't even used anything equivalent features from other VCS software. My projects have been so simple that I have only needed commits and sometimes diffs. Now I'm planning to open-source a server project of mine which probably will get a lot bigger and it probably needs to be organized better. Git can probably help me with that but how? The development methods are scrum and TDD if that matters.
