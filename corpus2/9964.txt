I've recently had a talk with someone about how to include open source projects on my resume. I wanted to include a project of mine where I'd invested a significant amount of code and time: ~40,000 Lines of code and 8 months. He recommended against it though since it was GPL'd, saying it could turn off recruiters since I might include my project (in part or whole) while working there and force the whole project to be OS. I just don't think thats a realistic problem though, but I'm not sure. So my question: Is it safe to include GPL'd OS projects on my resume, or will it just turn recruiter's off?
