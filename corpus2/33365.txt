I know about Omondo's plugin for live code-UML synchronization in Eclipse, but I was wondering if there was any other tool/IDE/IDE-extension that has some form of live graphical code representaiton (structural, flow, call-stacks, dependencies, etc.). I'm essentially looking for richer visual feedback on code while programming, not really looking for purely graphical code editors, though round-trips would be nice (edit graphically, code gets modified; edit code, representation gets modified). If you don't know about any graphical live documentation tool for code, maybe someone that can coexist with code, such as MySQL Workbench or Enterprise Architect. **EDIT** : Please, original answers, meaning other tools different than what I quoted (even if they are similar to Omondo, MySQL Workbench and Enterprise Architect). **EDIT 2** : I found Netbeans' C/C++ call graph: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SNk6c.png)
