I've wanted to learn C++ for awhile and took AP Computer Programming in High School (back when it was C++ and not Java). I enjoy C and just haven't found the time to learn C++ or I'll just fall back on C# where I'm much more productive. My question is this: given that C++ '11 has been approved (although I know not fully implemented) does this change the way I should approach learning C++? I own C++: The Complete Reference By Herb Schildt which is from 1998. Does the newly approved standard make learning from such books less important than some of the newer tutorials/books that include things from the standard? Is there any benefit from learning from the older books?
