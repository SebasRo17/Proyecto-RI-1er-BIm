I've checked **_Mathematica_** â†’ **Preferences** , and poked around the options on the toolbar. However, I don't see a way to define new keyboard shortcuts in _Mathematica_. I've used VIM for 10+ years, and I've rebound `Ctrl`+`F` to be `Esc` for the last decade or so. I would like to also use this shortcut in _Mathematica_ , to have `Ctrl`+`F` be `Esc`, so hitting something like: `Ctrl`+`F` `S` `Ctrl`+`F` should give me capital Sigma. Question: how do I define new keybindings in _Mathematica_? (I have a CS background, so I'd prefer things that involve editing config files / writing scripts -- that would give me more power -- over clicking things in a GUI).
