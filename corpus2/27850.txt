I am trying to find the range of `(3 Sin[x] - 3)/(2 Cos[x] + 10)`, I tried this,               Function[x, (3 Sin[x] - 3)/(2 Cos[x] + 10)]@ Interval[{-Infinity, Infinity}]      _Mathematica_ returned `Interval[{-(3/4), 0}]`, but WolframAlpha returned `-5/8 <= y <= 0`. I'm sure Wolfram | Alpha is right What's wrong with my _Mathematica_ code?
