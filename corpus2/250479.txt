This is related to DDD for a desktop application in c#...with 4 layers ui/application/domain/infrastructure. Actually 3 desktop applications sharing part of the domain and part of the infrastructure. In an effort to avoid developers crossing the wrong layers and using the wrong classes, I separated the layer in assemblies and set the reference/dependencies in accordance. If the infrastructure is a dll/assembly and the domain another dll/assembly and the application is an exe/assembly and the ui is a dll/assembly... then the project cannot the build. Who's gonna load the the ui.dll? Am I missing something here? The only solution i have come with is creating a fifth layer called Program. That layer will have the entry point of the program and will wire everything together (I'm using DI with Unity ) Any idea?
