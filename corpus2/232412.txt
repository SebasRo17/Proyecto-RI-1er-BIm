We build Java applications and use Maven to create snapshot and release builds (via Hudson). Normally, we build/deploy snapshot versions to our lab environment and when we're happy, we do release build and deploy that to prod. We've been wondering if we should also be doing release candidate builds. I'm not sure how a release candidate build actually differs from the snapshot builds. I've read about the release:stage goal in Maven, but not it didn't really answer the question. Do you use release candidate builds? What do you use them for and how do you go from snapshot to release candidate to release?
