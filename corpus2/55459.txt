I'm giving a talk in April 2011 on "Developer English" and showing my **non- developer audience** , mostly English teachers, various diagrams to explain how developers see their industry etc. One of these diagrams is " **Hot Technologies** ", basically, if you want to become a developer, what technologies should you learn to have the highest chance of (1) getting a **job** (2) making a good **salary** , and (3) work with the most **exciting technology**. This is a draft I made just to get some ideas out, basically C#, PHP, Java are where the bulk of the jobs are. Mobile development has a big future. JavaScript is becoming more and more important, and I want to list "minor technologies" such a Python, Ruby on Rails to the side, I assume e.g. that in general, there are a much smaller percentage of jobs in these technologies as in C#, PHP, Java. **How could this diagram be improved?** ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/iMiOn.png) # UPDATE Thanks everyone for your suggestions. I included most of them in my updated graphic. Does anyone know of more **Java technologies** that would be appropriate here and could anything be added to the **gaming technologies**? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ddW6n.png)
