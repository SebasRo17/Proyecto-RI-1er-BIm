I tried to align the labels on the buttons of a `SetterBar`to the button centers. This is my code:               lis = {"1", "2", "3", "dsf"};     SetterBar[Dynamic[buttonValue],        Table[lis[[iteration]], {iteration, 1, 4}],        BaseStyle -> {Red, Alignment -> {Center, Center}}, {ImageSize -> {100, 50}}]      How do I get the labels of the buttons aligned to their centers? Can any one show me how?
