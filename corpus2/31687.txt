Mathematica, unlike many other languages, defines the variables in the global scope unless it is explicitly asked to define a variable in a local scope, _e.g._ , using `Module`, `With`, or `Block`. My question is how to define a scoping construct which defines the variables locally by default unless otherwise stated. For instance:               x = 1;     y = 1;     Scope[{x (* specify global variables here *) },       x = 2;       y = 2;       a = 0;       (* x and y both equal to 2 and a is 0 here *)     ]     (* x equals to 2, y equals to 1, a is undefined here *)      How can one define a function `Scope` as demonstrated above?
