When do you draw the line between relational tables, and fields holding multiple values of a particular type. Let me illustrate in an example below where a PokeMaster can be associated to multiple pokemon of unknown number.               TablePokeMasters         PokeMasterId         PokeMasterName          TablePokeMastersToPokemon <- Side question, what is a good naming convention for a linking table?         PokeMasterId         PokemonId          TablePokemon         LinkId         PokemonId         PokemonName      Vs               Table PokeMasters         PokeMasterId         PokeMasterName         PokeMasterPokemon (ex: Picachu, Charizard, Blastoise) <- parse this in code      Is the second method ever preferred over the first one where there is an unknown number of relationships from one table to another? The only value I can see in the second method is a smaller number of tables, and it is easier to see the relationships right inside of one table, instead of building queries to see the relationships.
