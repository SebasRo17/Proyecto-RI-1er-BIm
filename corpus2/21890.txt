trialList = {{0, 24.701}, {1, 24.69}, {2, 24.733}};     f[x_] := x + 1;      I would like to apply the function `f` to only the second element of each tuple. How is this done? The actual list is 16,000 entries long. How do I iterate over the whole list applying the function to only the second entry of each tuple? I tried the following, but it does not do what I want:               {trialList[[1]], f[trialList[[2]]]} & @@@ trialList
