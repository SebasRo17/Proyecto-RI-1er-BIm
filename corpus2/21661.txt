I'm trying to build a human operator model using an optimal control model in Mathematica: ![Human operator model](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OonUR.png) The vehicle dynamics are given by               a = {{-2, 0}, {1, 0}};     b = {{0}, {1}};     c = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}};     d = {{0}, {1}};      with noise and cost weightings               w = {{4}};     v = {{0.0025}};     q = {{0, 0}, {0, 1}};     r = {{1}};      I generated the state space model and added the time delay ($T_d = 0.2s$) using               ssm = StateSpaceModel[{a, b, c, d}]     td = TransferFunctionModel[SystemsModelDelay[.2]];     ssmWithDelay = SystemsModelSeriesConnect[td, ssm];      Now I am trying model the Kalman estimator and gains ($-l^*$) using a LQG regulator               k = LQGRegulator[{ssm, 1, 1}, {w, v}, {q, r}] // StateSpaceModel      which results in the error               The number of columns in {{},{}} is not equal to the length of {{4}}      I think my problem must be with the noise and cost weightings, but I'm not sure where I went wrong?
