Say you need to implement a few closely related functions that provide a piece of functionality, but there is no need to track any state between those functions, they just sometimes pass some parameters between themselves. What would be the best decision from the design standpoint? Make it a class, or just a separate source file that contains these functions? UPD: Objective-C, no namespaces
