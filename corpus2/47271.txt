I am trying to get solution to an equation in a loop. The isolate equation works               rb = 2;     ri[x_] := FindRoot[y - ArcTan[y] - x == 0, {y, 0.01}]     ri[0.02151]     srb = y /. %     s = srb/rb     rinv = (s^2 + rb^2)^(1/2)      However, when I try to do it repeatedly with a `While`, `Do` or any other command, I do not get a solution for `y`. Any clues?               rb = 2;     ri[x_] := (FindRoot[Tan[y] - y - x == 0, {y, 0.01}];       srb := y /. %;       s := srb/rb;       rinv := (s^2 + rb^2)^(1/2))     i = 0.001;     While[i < 0.004, ri[i]; Print["i ", i]; Print["s ", s];        i = i + 0.001];      Thanks!
