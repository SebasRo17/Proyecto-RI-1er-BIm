I am trying to that using a coarse grid with an explicit method for, say, the advection equation leads to an unstable solution. The trouble is _Mathematica_ avoids unstable solutions with good `Method`s or I am unable to set a coarse spatial grid or temporal grid spacing. **My code is as follows:**               sol = NDSolve[{D[u[t, x], t] ==          0.5 D[u[t, x], x, x] + u[t, x] D[u[t, x], x],          u[t, -Pi] == u[t, Pi] == 0 , u[0, x] == Sin[x]},        u, {t, 0, 2}, {x, -Pi, Pi}, MaxStepFraction -> 1/10]      **And a plot of sol is:**               Plot3D[Evaluate[u[t, x] /. First[sol]], {t, 0, 2}, {x, -Pi, Pi},       PlotRange -> All      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SNI34.png) Should I not be using `MaxStepFraction` to demonstrate instability? What is the most coarse explicit `Method` I could use? I have tried `Method->{"ExplicitEuler"}` but this was good enough to resolve instabilities and I found a stable solution without kinks at larger times.
