We need to create an API to our system. How do I convince my boss that REST is a better option than SOAP (or XML-RPC)? I say REST is...   * easier to implement and maintain   * not much new to learn -- plain old HTTP   * lot of people have chosen it Yahoo ~ Facebook ~ Twitter   * will be lot quicker to code My boss says SOAP is...   * richer and more expressive   * it's all standard XML (SOAP, WSDL, UDDI) -- and so will be easier to consume   * well standardized than REST   * Google uses a lot of SOAP   * it is important to adhere to SOAP standards than to create a custom XML schema in REST
