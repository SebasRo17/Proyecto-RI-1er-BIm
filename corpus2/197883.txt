I would like to know what options are available for documenting a project which has already been developed, as the developers who worked on didn't write even a single page of documentation. The project has no other details other than many pages of scripts with functions written and modified by developers who worked on this project from the past 2 years. All I have is the database schema and project files. I would like to know if there is any way to organize this project and document it so that it could be helpful for the developers who will be working on this project in the future. The project was developed with PHP and MySQL. The functions are poorly commented so I can't get good results when I run it with doxygen.
