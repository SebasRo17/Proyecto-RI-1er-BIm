I'm new to web-service programming, and I'm unsure of a few things. I know that REST web-services can be used to interact with the system like this:   * to retrieve a user: GET /user?id=1   * to retrieve all users: GET /user   * to insert a user: PUT /user?{all user data} When I need to do an update action for some tables using a JSON object can this be done with a REST API or does it need to be some other interface? If is REST, what is the right method (GET, POST, DELETE, etc) to use? Is it correct to have two type of patterns in the same web-service?
