I would like to use `TensorReduce` to work on the tensor contraction $y_{ib}y_{ia}$ (where index $i$ is summed). However, `TensorReduce` does not bring the following `t1` and `t2` into a unique form:               $Assumptions = y ∈ Arrays[{d, d}];     t1 = TensorContract[TensorProduct[y, y], {{1, 3}}];     t2 = TensorTranspose[TensorContract[TensorProduct[y, y], {{1, 3}}], {2, 1}];     TensorReduce[t1]     TensorReduce[t2]          (* Output: *)     (* t1 -> TensorContract[y ⊗ y, {{1, 3}}] *)     (* t2 -> TensorTranspose[TensorContract[y ⊗ y, {{1, 3}}], {2, 1}] *)      Shouldn't they be brought into the same form? Thank you!
