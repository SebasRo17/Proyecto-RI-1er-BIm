I wrote a system in Java that I want to release under the terms of GPL v2 or later. I've used Apache Maven to deal with all the dependencies of the system, so I don't have the source code of any of the libraries used. I've already checked, all the libraries were released under GPL-compatible licenses (Apache v2, 3-clause BSD, MIT, LGPL v2 and v2.1). Can I distribute my work under GPLv2 or later and provide the libraries on the same package as **separate works** , without having to apply GPL on them (as stated by **GPLv2 sec 2** ), even if they are necessary to compile and run the system? If so, I know I am bound only by the original licenses of each one, and than I know what to do.
