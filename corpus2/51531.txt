I'm working on a web application where there will be many different users from all over the world making updates. I'm wondering what the best way to handle timezones would be? Ideally, as an event happens, all users view it using their local times. Should the server OS time be set to GMT, physical location time, or my development location time? Should the application logic (PHP) and database (MySQL) be set to store data as GMT or local time (local to users)? Is there an industry standard or even a simple/obvious solution that I'm just not seeing?
