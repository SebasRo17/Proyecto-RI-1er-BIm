A few years ago, I was in a software engineering class and the teacher explained how messages, options, variables, etc. should not be negated to avoid confusion. He gave the example (something like): > Are you sure you do not wish to delete this file? Yes, No, Cancel explaining that, for a `DELETE` action, the user would require more time to figure out if `Yes` will delete or not the file, and may lead to frustration if the user chooses `No`. I'd like to know if a similar quick-response phenomenon exists with source code. I browse Node.js modules and I often see options like: `disableTimeout = false`, `noAutoDetect = true`, etc. Which, to me, would be better written as `timeoutEnabled = true` and `autoDetect = false`, etc.? This may seem like a matter of opinion, but I believe this is a matter of engineering and leading others to a correct understanding of a variable's purpose. I believe there are academic studies backing this principle, and would prefer answers backed by external references.
