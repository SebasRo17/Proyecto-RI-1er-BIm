When starting a new project, are "proactive" designs useful? I mean, if you create a UML diagram/Activity diagram/Use Case/Class diagram/etc. for anything and everything can think of, then when you _think_ you're done, you start coding. Afterwards, you realize an important feature or method was left out. All your spiffy UML diagrams are nice stacks of worthless paper now. Is it easier/better to design one class, work on it a bit, refine it, then work on it more?
