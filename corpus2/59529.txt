I am working on a project that requires some calculations to be done in Mathematica. I don't know Wolfram language and I don't have the time to learn it (I am using a 30-day trial) so I have a python program that is generating a lot of .nb files. What I would like to do would be to be able to run this .nb files from command line and then save their outuput to a .txt, .png, .jpg, any format I can work with without having to open Mathematica, run the notebook and grab the data. The output of the notebook file is given by some calls to Print and also the following command               Show[Graphics[...], Graphics[...],            Graphics[...], Graphics[...], Axes -> False]      The ... were added for this question. I am hoping for a command like: mathematica-command -options file.nb > output_file I have Windows 8 and the latest Mathematica. Thanks in advance.
