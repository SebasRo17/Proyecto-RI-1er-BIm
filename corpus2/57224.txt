I am trying to work with Mathematica 10's new font and have found a simple way to revert the font family to Times New Roman for all my figure. I enter the following command in the `Private Style Definitions`, under 'Format' > 'Edit Stylesheet'.               Cell[StyleData["Graphics"],FontFamily->"Times"]      However, if a `Graphics` is inside a `Grid`, the font may look like Times in the FrontEnd of Mathematica, but it goes back to the Sans font family once exported.               myFigure=Grid[{{Show[RegionPlot[1<0,{x,0,1},{y,0,1},FrameLabel->{"Text","Text"},ImageSize->400]]}}]     Button["Export Figure",Export["C:\\Figure.pdf",myFigure];]     myFigure2=Show[RegionPlot[1<0,{x,0,1},{y,0,1},FrameLabel->{"Text","Text"},ImageSize->400]]     Button["Export Figure 2",Export["C:\\Figure 2.pdf",myFigure2];]      Any thought why? Any ideas how to get Times in my final output?
