How do I go about improving my memory and recall as it relates to Programming? I have a tendency to cache API information short term and then immediately put it out of my head as I move on to something else. This sometimes makes me look bad as I can't recall API information on code I should be really familiar with. It also can be a big time sink, as I often know that I can do something with an API, but I have to look up the specifics on how to actually do it. Are there any tools or methods I could use to make up for my memory short comings?
