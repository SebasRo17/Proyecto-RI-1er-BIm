I am wanting to make a `Pane` scale to fit (if `Spacings` are zero) a `Grid` element.               Grid[{{x, x,        Framed[         Pane[x,          ImageSize -> {Scaled[1], Scaled[1]},          ImageMargins -> 0,          Alignment -> Center],         FrameMargins -> 0,         ImageMargins -> 0], x, x}, {x, x, x, x, x}, {x, x, x, x, x}},       Background -> {None, None, {{1, 3} -> Red}}, ItemSize -> {5, 5},      Frame -> All,      Spacings -> {0, 0}]      Note that I added the `Frame` solely to outline the `Pane` so that the dimensions could be seen. On my system, OS X 10.6.8, Mma V8.0.4, the scaling works in the x direction but not in the y direction. Can anyone offer an explanation and solution (or could this be a bug)? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BjnqH.png)
