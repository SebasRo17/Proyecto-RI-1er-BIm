In class we have a big trouble, how can we get the first "n" vampire numbers, we're working on oracle SQL but in my case I am totally lost, how can i do a query to get it. > A "vampire number" is a number with an even number of digits, and half the > digits (in any order) can be multiplied by the other half of the digits (in > any order) to be equal to that number. > > For example, 1260 is a vampire number because it can be broken in half, and > the two halves rearranged (21 and 60) can be multiplied together to make > 1260
