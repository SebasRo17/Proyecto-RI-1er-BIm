Background:                 bar := {1, 1, 1};       foo[var_] := {Hold[var], 2 var}       SetAttributes[foo, HoldAll]       foo[bar]      Result, as expected:                 {Hold[bar], {2, 2, 2}}      What I then do ( which is clearly not correct, but I don't know another way ) is that I `ToString` the first element of the list, i.e. `Hold[bar]` and then extract the substring "bar" out of it. What I want is just this:                 f[data_?VectorQ] := f[data, name_of_data]       f[data_?VectorQ, name_?StringQ] := "Save data as name" ...      So for example:                  ape = {1,2,3};        bear= {2,3,4};        f[ape] translates to f[{1,2,3"}, "ape"]        f[bear, "bird"] translates to f[{2,3,4}, "bird"]        f[ape+bear] translates to Null or False.      **Question: How do I access the name of a list in a function ?**
