There are multiple ways to convert an expression to machine precision, for example:               In[1]:= a = Sqrt[2]     Out[1]= Sqrt[2]          In[2]:= {1.a, 1`a, N@a, SetPrecision[a,MachinePrecision]}     Out[2]= {1.41421,1.41421,1.41421,1.41421}          In[3]:= Precision /@ %     Out[3]= {MachinePrecision,MachinePrecision,MachinePrecision,MachinePrecision}      My question is whether or not these methods are absolutely equivalent. Is it just a matter of personal taste which one to use, or are there examples where they behave differently?
