I'm writing a small research paper which involves software development methodologiess. I was looking into all the available methodology's and I was wondering, from all methodologies, are there any that have provided the foundations for the others? For an example, looking at the following methodologies:   Agile, Prototyping, Cleanroom, Iterative, RAD, RUP, Spiral, Waterfall, XP, Lean, Scrum, V-Model, TDD. Can we say that:   Prototyping, Iterative, Spiral and Waterfall are the "foundation" for the others? Or is there no such thing as "foundations" and does each methodology has it's own unique history? I would ofcourse like to describe all the methodology's in my research paper, but I simply don't have the time to do so and that is why I would like to know which methodologies can be seen as representatives.
