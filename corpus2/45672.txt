Guys! I need capture video from certain webcam which isn't `$DefaultImagingDevice`. As I know there is one legal way: `ImageCapture["Device"->$ImagingDevices[[x]]]` where x is number of needed device. However ImageCapture doesn't allow to make a grid on the image like this:               grid = Graphics[{Gray,         Table[Line[{{(i - 1)*16, 0}, {(i - 1)*16, 240}}], {i, 1, 21}],         Table[Line[{{0, (i - 1)*16}, {320, (i - 1)*16}}], {i, 1, 16}]         }];          Dynamic[Show[       CurrentImage[],       grid,       ImageSize -> 800]]      ![http://s18.postimg.org/hek0gtp2h/Camera_small.jpg](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XDXDQ.jpg) May be somebody knows how to apply CurrentImage for certain non-default imaging device? Or how to take just image without any interface elements using ImageCapture?
