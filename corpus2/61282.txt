I want to get started writing extensions for Google Chrome. I am a long time C, C++, Delphi, etc. developer for many years with some Java skills. I believe Chrome extensions are written in C++ but perhaps some people have figured out how to do development in other languages via alternate methods. [UPDATE: NPAPI plug-ins are written in C++. Generic Chrome extensions use HTML, CSS, and JS as pointed out in the comments and replies below.] Is there a book that covers developing Google Chrome extensions for those new to the field but are experienced programmers? Any other resources? I'd be most grateful for resources that cut out most of the ambient learning material and go straight to the heart of the matter with good samples along the way. Some tips on developing using development tools that run on the MS-Windows platform would be great too. \-- roschler
