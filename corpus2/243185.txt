I have a requirement for a workflow which I am trying to model as a state machine, I see that there is more than one outcome of a given transition(or activity). Is it valid for a state machine to have more than one possible states, but only one state will be true at a given time? **Note:** This is my first attempt to model a state machine. Eg. might be: **s1->t1->s2** **s1->t1->s3** **s1->t1->s4** where s1, s2, s3, s4 are states and t1 is transition/activity. A fictitious real world example might be: For a human, there can be two states: hungry, not hungry A basket can have only one item from: apple, orange. So, to model it we will have: **hungry->pick from basket->apple found** **hungry->pick from basket->orange found** **apple found->eat->not hungry** **orange found->take juice out of it and then drink-> not hungry**
