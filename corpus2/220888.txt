if(condition1)     {        Statement1A;        Statement1B;     }     else if(condition2)     {       Statement2;     }     else if(condition3)     {       Statement3;     }     else      {        Statement1A;        Statement1B;     }             return;      I would like to refactor that code so that I do not duplicate Statements. I **always** need to check condition1 before any other condition. (So I cannot just change the order of the conditions). I also do not want to write `&&!condition1` after every other condition. I solved it like this               if(condition1)     {     }     else if(condition2)     {       Statement2;       return;     }     else if(condition3)     {       Statement3;       return;     }          Statement1A;     Statement1B;     return;      However I do not think an empty if condition will be easily understandable by others (even by me after a while). What is a better approach?
