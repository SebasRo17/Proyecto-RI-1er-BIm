I am planning to create a website like what http://dohop.com is doing that will allow a user to pull the airlines price rate and date from the http://airasia.com website. Currently the site will only allow the user to view the flight schedule for one day and if they wish to view x days ahead they need to repost the data. I would like to collect the data in x days ahead and group them in table so that user can view all the flight prices & schedule variances in one screen without reposting. I have checked the `AirAsia.com` site and they currently don't have any API support which would allow me to extract their data. While they are using 'aspx' for their website and POST method. Can anyone give me some guidance on what is the method, approach or technique for me to harvest the data?
