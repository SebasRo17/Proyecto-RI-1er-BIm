I want to minimize a function `f` with `NMinimize` but an error occurs that says:               f[l_] := (       kk = NDSolve[{y'[x] == 2*x + 3, y[l] == 0}, y, {x, 0, l}];       out = Evaluate[y[0] /. kk];       out[[1]])          NMinimize[{f[t], 0 <= t <= 10}, f, t]      > During evaluation of In[18]:= NDSolve::ndsv: Cannot find starting value for > the variable y. >> > > During evaluation of In[18]:= ReplaceAll::reps: > {NDSolve[{(y^[Prime])[x]==3+2 x,y[{t}]==0},y,{x,0,{t}}]} is neither a list > of replacement rules nor a valid dispatch table, and so cannot be used for > replacing. >> > > During evaluation of In[18]:= NMinimize::argrx: NMinimize called with 3 > arguments; 2 arguments are expected. >> >   >   >     Out[18]= NMinimize[{y[0], 0 <= t <= 10}, f, t] >   How can I fix the function `f` to avoid this problem?
