There are 4 unknowns constants: `a`,`b`,`c`,`p`. The variable is `phi` and the result is `d`. For `phi={13,23,45,73}` the results are `d={32.08754292290807,32.1136624112758,32.1728430675844,32.2430287624866}` The equation is:               (c/0.3048*((1+(a*p/(b*c))*(sin(phi*pi/180))^2))/sqrt(1-sqrt(1-b^2/a^2)*     ((sin(phi*pi/180))^2))) = d      How can I solve it in Mathematica?
