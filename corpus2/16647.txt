A couple of friends at work an me are going to set up a little startup / create our own software, probably moonlighting at first, since we cant yet afford to quit our day jobs. Neither of us has have this experience, we've all worked for other companies before, where a set of guidelines are set, and I think this is the time to establish good practices to follow (like avoiding meeting-itis). For people that have gone this way, what piece(s) of advice would you give us? I'm looking more for the technical side of things, things such as:   * Is it worth to have some kind of build server or is that going to far ahead?    * Would you do extensive TDD or do you think it would be too much overhead for a small team that is not too experienced with it? But wouldn't mind to listen to the management side of things. * * * The project is a web application done in ASP.NET MVC, I'm thinking of using Mercurial and BitBucket or Kiln + FogBugz or some other online project tracking tool, since we are going to be working remotely.
