I have an interface called `Cell`. In the start of the code, I read input data from which I can come to know the implementing class (not as a class object but I can know for example the string). And after that I need to call the constructor for the implementing class to initialize an object. What would be the best way to implement that. The first thing in my mind is to do something like this (`Cell` is an interface, `Sphere` and `Rectangle` implements `Cell`. I can set a boolean flag called `sphere` after reading the input data):               Cell startcell;     if (sphere)         startcell = new Sphere(0);     else         startcell = new Rectangle(0);      But is this good design?
