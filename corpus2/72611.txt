I used to pride myself with the high quality of the code I delivered. Today I made a mistake that wiped the grin off my face. It was a null reference exception caused by a hasty fix to an edge case that was caught during testing. I didn't have proper unit tests and I didn't regression test after making the fix. So my question is, what do you do to force yourself to follow best practices? I know you should write tests (unit, integration, acceptance, etc.) and run them to validate any changes. But when the pressure's on and you're rushing to put out a fire, how do you keep yourself focused and sticking to those best practices? Physical exercise? Religious TDD?
