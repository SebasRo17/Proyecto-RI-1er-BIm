Say I have a 3D curve that is parametrically defined. How would I be able to plot shapes like figure 8s whose centers are aligned along the 3D curve? Say the curve was:               P[a_]:={-a,a,1/2 a (8-a)};     arch=ParametricPlot3D[P[a],{a,0,8},Axes->Automatic,AxesLabel->{"x","y","z"},PlotRange->All,Boxed->False,BoxRatios->Automatic]      Does anyone know how I might be able to do this?
