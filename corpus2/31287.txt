I am currently using _Mathematica_ 9 to find solutions for higher order ordinary differential equations. The following was my input for a tenth order boundary value problem (BVP):               DSolve[{y''''''''''[x] == (E^-x)*(y[x])^2, y[0] == 1, y''[0] == 1,       y''''[0] == 1, y''''''[0] == 1, y''''''''[0] == 1, y[1] == E,       y''[1] == E, y''''[1] == E, y''''''[1] == E, y''''''''[1] == E},       y[x], x]      `DSolve` returned unevaluated. So, I tried for a numerical solution with slight modification by giving the range for `x`:               NDSolve[{y''''''''''[x] == (E^-x)*(y[x])^2, y[0] == 1, y''[0] == 1,       y''''[0] == 1, y''''''[0] == 1, y''''''''[0] == 1, y[1] == E,       y''[1] == E, y''''[1] == E, y''''''[1] == E, y''''''''[1] == E},       y[x], {x, 0, 1}]      But, it gave me the result in terms of an interpolating function, so fine until here. The third time I used the last input but this time with `DSolve` that is :               DSolve[{y''''''''''[x] == (E^-x)*(y[x])^2, y[0] == 1, y''[0] == 1,       y''''[0] == 1, y''''''[0] == 1, y''''''''[0] == 1, y[1] == E,       y''[1] == E, y''''[1] == E, y''''''[1] == E, y''''''''[1] == E},       y[x], {x,0,1}]      However, I get the error               DSolve::dsvar: 0 cannot be used as a variable. and the output was same as input.      I know the exact solution for the BVP which is $y(x)=e^x$, But, how do I obtain it using _Mathematica_? What am I doing wrong in the first and the third case when I am using `DSolve` for getting exact solution instead of a numeric one. Is there some error or there is some limitation in the software? * * * Again let me clarify, i.e. it is possible to find a numerical solution using `NDSolve[]` for this example. So it's true that equation has an approximate solution which can be given in form of some interpolating function. You can check this by simply putting in my `NDSolve` input in _Mathematica_. The point is, this equation has a solution which is $y(x)=e^x$. Here is a link to the research paper where this is mentioned (please check example 3.1. Note that in the paper, there is a small mistake: boundary condition should be $y(8)(1)=e$ instead of $y(8)(0)=e$ since it has already been mentioned earlier that $y(8)(0)=1$. So there cannot be two different values at one point. Rest of it is fine and one can see that it is clearly written that the exact solution is $y(x)=e^x$.). My question is simple   1. If there is an exact solution to the problem above (which I've already told that there is an exact analytic solution) then how to get it through _Mathematica_.   2. Or there is some limitation of the software due to which we can have numerical solutions to say, problems of tenth or higher order BVPs and no analytic solutions. Please, be specific and, yes, I have a fair understanding that if an equation has a general solution that same one can be evaluated given boundary conditions.
