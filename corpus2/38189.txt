Typically, managers tend to be older and have more experience than the developers working under them. While young developers are often more knowledgeable about "newer" technologies/patterns (like .NET, Rails, SOLID, etc.), managers are more familiar with older technologies (COBOL, ASP). However, the manager often has proven experience in problem solving and providing value to the customer. Furthermore, many of the principles of good programming remain static. This generational gap can produce tension between the manager and the developer. A developer may feel that the manager has no idea what they are talking about and is outdated, while the manager feels the developer is naive and just going along with the current tech fads. How can this generational gap be bridged so that there is a healthy trust and respect between developers and managers even across age differences? How have you dealt with this issue?
