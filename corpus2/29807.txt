I'm trying to create a graph which has $\{a,b\}$ as labels:               g := Graph[{1 \[UndirectedEdge] 9, 1 \[UndirectedEdge] 10,         1 \[UndirectedEdge] 8, 10 \[UndirectedEdge] 2,         10 \[UndirectedEdge] 5, 9 \[UndirectedEdge] 3,         9 \[UndirectedEdge] 6, 8 \[UndirectedEdge] 7,         8 \[UndirectedEdge] 4, 7 \[UndirectedEdge] 3,         7 \[UndirectedEdge] 2, 6 \[UndirectedEdge] 2,         6 \[UndirectedEdge] 4, 5 \[UndirectedEdge] 3,         5 \[UndirectedEdge] 4}]      Any help would be appreciated.
