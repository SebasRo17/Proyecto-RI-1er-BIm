Having read a book I found a note that verification and validation can be both quality assurance and quality control. I cannot see how it can be quality assurance because both just provide evidence whether or not the product meets its use, requirements etc., which is quality control.   IMHO V&V cannot assure quality, they only asnwers the question "does it work?", "is it correct?.
