In the tags I frequent on Stack Overflow, a big chunk of questions _should_ be answered with some basic knowledge about how to debug things - ie., teaching the OP to fish - instead of giving a fix for the piece of code presented. Are there any good debugging tutorials for newbies, especially   * Basic debugging techniques - understanding a piece of code, finding the problem by walking through it step by step instead of posting on SO and saying "it doesn't work"   * How to debug simple PHP scripts (For situations like "my POST variables aren't showing", etc.)   * How to debug Ajax scripts (How to use Firebug to see what gets sent, etc.) but also other languages and platforms?
