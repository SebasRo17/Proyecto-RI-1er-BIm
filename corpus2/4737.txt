I need to plot a graph (to be specific: Fortune Algorithm output) with given vertex coordinates and a few unconnected vertices. I am thinking of using Mathematica for that. `GraphPlot` does much of the task with `VertexCordinateRules` option but does not plot unconnected points.   1. So is there any way to do this?   And it would be even nicer if that graph comes with 2-D Axes. I was thinking to use `ListLinePlot` and `Point` commands but they give two different graphs as output.   2. Is there any option for combining output from two graphs? (The `Show` command didn't help.)
