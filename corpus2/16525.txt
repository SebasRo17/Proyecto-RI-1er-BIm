I would like to combine two lists.               list1 = {{134, 12}, {136, 14}, {140, 45}}      and               list2 = {{134, "B"}, {135, "A"}, {136, "E"}, {137, "A"}, {138,"I"}, {139, "B"}, {140, "G"}}      the result should be:               result = {{134, 12, "B"}, {136, 14, "E"}, {140, 45, "G"}}      Thank you very much!
