I came across a snippet like this, and find it's over engineering. Is it a good practice?               public class SchoolList extends ArrayList<School> {     }          public class School extends ArrayList<StudentList> {     }          public class StudentList extends ArrayList<Student> {     }          public class Student {     }      Actually I prefer a straightforward option:               List<List<List<Student>>> schoolList;
