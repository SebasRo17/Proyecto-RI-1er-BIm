I would like to plot a graph in such a way that   1. The vertices are labeled using labels that I've given them, rather than just their number,    2. I can manually move the vertices around. In the code below, `A` is my 4 x 4 adjacency matrix, and `People` specifies the labels that I'd like for the 4 vertices. `AG` gives me a graph that accomplishes (1) but not (2). `GP` gives me a graph that satisfies (2) but not (1) -- it only labels the vertices by their number. How can I accomplish both (1) and (2) simultaneously? `GraphPLot` does not seem to allow for `VertexLabels` as an option, so I'm at a loss here.               A = {{0, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 0, 0, 0}, {1, 0, 0, 1}, {1, 0, 1, 0}}     People = {Bob, Eric, Lucy, Liz}     AG = AdjacencyGraph[A, VertexLabels -> Table[i -> People[[i]], {i, 1, Length[People]}]]     GP = GraphPlot[AG, VertexLabeling -> True]
