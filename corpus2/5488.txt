It is possible to export a notebook to plain text format (practically just extracting all the text from it and discarding formatting) using the `File -> Save As...` menu item. **How can a notebook be exported to plain text programmatically, without making use of any GUI?** With all the other document formats, such as PDF, HTML, NB, LaTeX, etc. it is possible to simply use `Export`:               ExportString[NotebookGet@EvaluationNotebook[], "LaTeX"]      This does not work with the export format `"Text"` though. It simply exports the notebook expression in a Mathematica expression format. Is there an export format which will export the contents of the notebook to plain text instead of the expression representing it? I would prefer a method that can produce an in-memory string as well (just like `ExportString`), and can avoid writing on disk. **EDIT:** Based on this answer, I found `First@FrontEndExecute[ FrontEnd`ExportPacket[NotebookGet@InputNotebook[], "InputText"]]`. I'd prefer something documented though, if it exists.
