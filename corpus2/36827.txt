I am trying to understand how Mma computes the Confidence Intervals after a `NonlinearModelFit`. Consider the following example:               data = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {3, 2}, {5, 4}, {6, 4}, {7, 5}};     nlm = NonlinearModelFit[data, Log[a + b x^2], {a, b}, x];     Show[ListPlot[data, Joined -> False], Plot[Normal@nlm, {x, 0, 8}],ImageSize -> 200]     (*out*)      ![Fitting results](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gBu0w.png) Which comes with the following R squared and confidence intervals:               nlm["RSquared"]     nlm["ParameterConfidenceIntervalTable"]          (*Out*)0.957573     (*Out*)      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/63avR.png) The table above assumes the default 95% Confidence Interval and, I am assuming, normal distribution around `a=1.50632` and `b=1.42633`. Questions:   1. How does Mma estimate the Standard Error of `a` and `b`?   2. The mean used to estimate such confidence intervals is the sample mean, i.e. ~2.6667? I could not find in the documentation how this was done from a fitting. Thank you in advance.
