I'm using Features to document the features as we originally communicated them to our client at proposal stage. I now want to create User Stories that relate to the features so that I can easily map our stories back to the proposal. Many of the stories naturally map across features, but Team Foundation Server (TFS) doesn't let me give a Story more than one Parent feature. Is this because I'm "doing it wrong" or is it more a limitation of TFS at the moment?
