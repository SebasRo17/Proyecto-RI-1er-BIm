I've been reading a bit about OOP in relation to Composition, Components and Composites. I believe I understand the fundamental principle (not sure). Can someone please provide a code example of a person or car (both have many properties) using Composition, Components and Composites? I think seeing it in code would clear up the confusion I have regarding this pattern. Preferably in Java or PHP.
