In 1989 Felix Lee, John Hayes and Angela Thomas wrote a Hacker's test taking the form of a quiz with many insider jokes, as “Do you eat slime-molds?” I am considering the following series:               0015 Ever change the value of 4?     0016 ... Unintentionally?     0017 ... In a language other than Fortran?      Is there a particular anecdote making the number “4” particular in the series? Did some Fortran implementation allow to modify the value of constants? Was this possible in other languages in common use at that time?
