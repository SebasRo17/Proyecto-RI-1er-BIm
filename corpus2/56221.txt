I am using the options `PlotTheme -> "Scientific"` and `PlotLegends -> Placed[Automatic, Right]` on a `MatrixPlot` and I would like to change the font size of the legend labels. I would usually do that by specifying               BarLegend[{"LakeColors", {0, 1}}, LabelStyle -> {FontSize -> 20}]      but   * I don't know the color function used by the base theme `"Scientific"` and   * I would like to keep the range of min and max values `{0,1}` as `Automatic` What would be the best way to change the legend font in this case?
