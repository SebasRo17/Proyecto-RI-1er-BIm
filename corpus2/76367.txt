It might be a bit young to be learning C++, but I've been hired to tutor a ten year old and I will happily oblige! I'm struggling to think of some fun but easy programs to work on. Ideally, I'm looking for something that can be done with a basic understanding of if statements, while loops, variables, vectors, input, and output. I came up with the idea of writing a "Mad Libs" style program, where it asks the user for input (adjectives, nouns, etc) and then outputs a story with that input filled in. However, he didn't seem very interested in this idea since he does not like "Mad Libs". I feel like he might be particularly interested in writing a program that has a visible effect on his computer. For example, he loves figuring out key presses to do things like invert his computers color, etc. Any ideas for a fun/easy C++ program for a 10 year old?
