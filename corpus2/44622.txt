Normally I can recover the options used on a DateListPlot easily with Options[]. However if one of the options said a Legend should be attached, it appears all the options are then unreadable. For example, here are two plots identical apart from p2 has a legend. I can read the options for p1 fine, but Options on p2 returns nothing.               data1 = {{{2006, 10, 1}, 10}, {{2006, 10, 15}, 12}, {{2006, 10, 30}, 15}, {{2006, 11, 20}, 20}};     data2 = {{{2006, 10, 5}, 15}, {{2006, 10, 20}, 8}, {{2006, 11, 10}, 5}, {{2006, 11, 15}, 1}};     p1 = DateListPlot[{data1, data2}, Joined -> True]     p2 = DateListPlot[{data1, data2}, Joined -> True, PlotLegends -> Automatic]          Options[p1, FrameTicks]     Options[p2]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GtZgF.png) I am keen to be able to read the FrameTicks option to complete a function to create DateListPlots with 2 y-axis. Alexey Popkov kindly solved what I thought was my final problem, only for this one to appear from behind it: Combine two DateListPlots and retain a time axis
