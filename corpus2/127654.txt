I'm developing various websites and functionality to cater to various different use-cases up in Django. Is there a good notation for showing what behaviour is at each stage, e.g., swimlanes. I use BPMN 2 notation for everything, but feel that I am overusing this, and probably abusing the notation :P Example: ![BPMN 2.0 diagram](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PMCzW.png) Please recommend a suitable **notation for showing the interactions between model, view and controller, as well as some of the inner business-logic in each stage**.
