In a scenario where you use an ORM to map your entities to the DB and you have setter validations (nullable, date lower than today validation, etc), every time the ORM gets a result, it will pass into the setter to instance the object. If I have a grid that usually returns 500 records, I assume that for each record it passes on all validations. If my entity has 5 setter validations, than I have passed in 2.500 validations.   * Does those 2.500 validations will affect the performance?   * If was 15.000 validation, it will be different? In my opinion, and according to this answer, setter validation is useful than constructors validation.   * Is there a way to avoid unnecessary validation, since I am safe to say that the values I send to the DB when saving the entity won't change until I edit it on my system?
