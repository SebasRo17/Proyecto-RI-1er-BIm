I understand why functions like `ElementData` or `CountryData` need to download up-to-date data when first launched. However, when trying to use CUDA for the first time in Mathematica, I ran:               Needs["CUDALink`"]; CUDAQ[]      which downloaded data for several minutes. Given that I have a quite fast net connection, that must amount to a really large amount of data. What does Mathematica download in that case? I guess drivers, but how can I _check_ what it downloads?
