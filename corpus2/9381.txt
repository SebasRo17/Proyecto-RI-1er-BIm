q has the coordinates of quadrilateral. I can get the output below with brute- force but I want to find a simpler solution, perhaps something like `f<-q[[1;;2]]`. **Initializations**               f[x_, y_] = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}}.{x, y} + {5, 6};     q = {{1, 1}, {3, 1}, {3, 2}, {1, 2}}      **Want: better way for this, perhaps in some matrix form?**               f[1, 1]     f[3, 1]     f[3, 2]     f[1, 2]
