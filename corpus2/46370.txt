I'm trying to create a wizard that enables the user to choose between different shaft components. At the same time, I need a flag to be 1 if he chooses a bearing and 0 otherwise. I extended the example code from one of the `GUIKit`` help pages which you can find here:               ref = GUIRun[       Widget["WizardFrame", {         "wizard" -> Widget["Wizard", {            "title" -> "Shaft sections",            "pages" -> {              Widget["WizardPage", {                "navigationNames" -> {"Next"},                "title" -> "Select the main feature of this section: ",                "content" -> Widget["Panel", {Widget["WizardHTMLPanel"]                         PopupMenu[                     Dynamic[flag[1]], {0 -> coupling, 0 -> shoulder,                       1 -> bearing, 0 -> gear, 0 -> pulley}]                   }]                }]              }            }]         }]]     GUIScreenShot[ref]      The program says that the GUI definition contains invalid content. Help??
