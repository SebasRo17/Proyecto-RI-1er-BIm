I have a complicated large integral I want to evaluate (does not have a closed form, need an approximation), but _Mathematica_ seems to keep "Running...". Is there any way to make _Mathematica_ use more CPU power or anything to speed the calculations up? The integral is the following:               Integrate[x (0.25 - x)^0.5*1/(Integrate[(1 - ((2 x/(1 - 2 x))*       Cos[z])^2)^0.5, {z, 0, Pi}])*Sin[y]*       (1 - ((2 x/(1 - 2 x))*Cos[y])^2)^0.5, {x, 0, 0.25}, {y, 0, Pi}]      Also, how long should I expect this to take? Thank you for any help!
