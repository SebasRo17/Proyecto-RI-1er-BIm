I have a Mathematica 6 course that I am using in Mathematica 9; there is no updated version. Every time I open a notebook I have to go to the Evaluation menu and click on "Evaluate Notebook". Is there a way for me to set it so that it automatically evaluates a notebook upon my opening it? I keep getting answers on shortcuts I can use once the notebook is open or pressing shift- enter on a cell but that's not an answer; I would like not to do anything at all other than open the notebook and have every cell evaluated already since the tutorial course is long and contains a ton of notebooks.
