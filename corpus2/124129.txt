This is something I've been wondering about for a while - are there any algorithms out there to scale pixel art down? I'm sure we all know about the upscale versions on the Wikipedia page on Image Scaling. I would have thought something like nearest neighbour resampling to get the colour pattern right, and then redrawing the outline, or high-contrast areas, over the top. Is there anything out there or am I going to have to learn how to do this myself? Thanks!
