Exhibit 1, Exhibit 2, I guess you won't find it hard to recall other examples. Thing is: if there is more than one way to solve a problem, the PHP programmer (I usually browse the PHP tag on StackOverflow) will ask for help on the solution involving regular expressions. _Even when_ it will be less economic, _even when_ the php manual suggests (link) to use `str_replace` instead of any `preg_*` or `ereg_*` function when no fancy substitution rules are required. Does somebody have a clue about why this happens? Don't get me wrong, some of my best friends are regular expressions and I don't despise Perl. What I don't get is why there is no looking for alternatives whatsoever, even when the overkill is obvious (regex to switch strings) or the code complexity rises exponentially (regex for getting data from html _in PHP_ )
