I'm having a set of data's, say               Question,     Question's Main Category,Main Category followers,     Question's Related Categories,Each Related Categories followers,     Whether it got answer in 24hrs [Yes/No]       Now, I need to analyse a database with thousands of sets of data's like given above and predict whether the new given question(with all details like main category,followers...etc) will get answer in 24hrs or not ? I have no idea which algorithm will be more suitable to solve this kind of problem.
