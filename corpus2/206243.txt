I've been writing JavaScript for a bit and have now seen code using the idiom               var that = this;      and               var self = this;      Used to gain access to `this` through closure scope. At this point `var self = this` seems somewhat more common. My question is which of these two idioms is truly the convention? Since they do exactly the same thing, are there advantages/disadvantages to either?
