A user story can be defined in a sentence like:               As a <type of user> I want <some goal> so that <some reason>      Just Google for 'user story formula' and first links all propose this formula. My question is, what is the purpose of **so that** clause? Is it there for managers? Is it there so that project managers and stakeholders can understand the priority of the item better? Why is it there? Note: I've worked with `as a <type of user> I want <some goal>` formula, and it works just well. I haven't noticed any problem in my work by implementing this format which is more brief.
