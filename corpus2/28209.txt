Dear Mathematica users I am looking into buying a new computer and Mathematica is one of the main applications I run. To help me assess the overwhelming welter of choice out there:   1. I'd like to know whether there are any system performance metrics, along the lines of those measured by Geekbench http://browser.primatelabs.com/processor-benchmarks, defined specifically for working with Mathematica, and whether there are any tables on the web comparing currently sold machines.    2. It would also be very helpful if these metrics came with detailed descriptions of what they mean. I haven't been able to find a clear definition of what Geekbench numbers mean - e.g. does a measurement of 2000 mean a machine that runs roughly twice as fast as one measuring 1000 and what exactly was it doing when it was running. Many thanks in advance
