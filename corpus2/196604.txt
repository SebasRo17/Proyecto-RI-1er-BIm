Before asking my question, I must explain the situation. I'm working for a company as a junior software engineer. One of the seniors always stops me when I have finished my development and want to commit. He always wants me to wait for him to review it. This is ok, because usually he finds some bugs, and does some optimisations. However I must commit my code before the deadline. When I finished, I call him and say it is finished. He usually comes late. So my code is late too. My question is, what should I do? Should I wait him for a review? **EDIT:** Addition to the question. I'm curious about one more issue. I want to be free when coding. How could I gain the trust for freedom of development? **Some explanations:** I've talked with him about this. But it didn't help. We use an issue tracker already, but there isn't any task for reviews. There are just development and test tasks.
