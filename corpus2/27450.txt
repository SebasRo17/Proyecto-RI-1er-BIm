I'm still new to Mathematica and this is the first time I've wanted to do something more complicated than plotting and changing parameters of mathematical functions. I want to make a simple simulation of a bus station. Two `SkewNormalDistribution`s with different parameters give the rates for arrivals and services. Basically, the program should draw a number from the arrival distribution, then draw a number from the service distribution, subtract it from the arrivals and go on to the next simulation step. If possible, each number should be represented graphically. For instance, drawing `20` from the arrival distribution could be represented as a list of 20 circles, or 20 `*`s. As far as I know, this is something that could be made with `Animate[]` (and maybe `Table[]`), but I don't even know where to start. I thought of using a `While[]` loop and using `Pause[]` at the end of each step, but I don't think this is a good way of doing it. Edit: Here's the procedural code of what I want to do:               arrivals = SkewNormalDistribution[30, 5, -4];     departures = SkewNormalDistribution[2, 1, 0];          Do[      entries = Round[RandomReal[arrivals]];      services = Round[RandomReal[departures]];      remaining += entries - services;      If[remaining < 0, remaining = 0];      Print[entries]; Print[services]; Print[remaining]; Print["    "],      {n, 10}     ]
