I have written an Android application. The application requires a Bluetooth connection to a very specific piece of hardware, currently a prototype. The only way I can test the app at present is to drive hundreds of miles to see if it works. If I end up with an ANR it can be very embarrassing in front of my client. The connection type and the mechanics of this app are very tightly tailored to this hardware. I am not permitted to bring a laptop, root my phone, or connect to any other device on the premises. Is there any way to test this application at home, or step through the activities to ensure I don't have another ANR on the second activity while the client looks at me horrified? I should point out I am not an experienced programmer and this is a new idea that I am helping someone with, as hiring staff is not on the cards at present, so I am undoubtedly missing some of the very basic concepts of developing this.
