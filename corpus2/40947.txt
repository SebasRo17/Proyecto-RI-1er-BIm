I'm trying to solve a system of coupled nonlinear equations using NSolve:               nbosons = 2;          x = Table[Symbol["x" <> ToString[i]], {i, 1, nbosons}];     k = Table[Symbol["k" <> ToString[i]], {i, 1, nbosons}];          u[j_] := Part[k, j];          BAE[c_, L_] :=        Table[Exp[I u[j] L] +           Product[(u[j] - u[l] + I c)/(u[j] - u[l] - I c), {l, nbosons},            Assumptions -> l != j] == 0, {j, 1, nbosons}];          BAEroots[c_, L_] := NSolve[BAE[c, L], {k1, k2}, Complexes]      But something goes wrong:               In[71]:= BAEroots[1, 1]      > During evaluation of In[71]:= NSolve::nsmet: This system cannot be solved > with the methods available to NSolve. >>               Out[71]= NSolve[{E^(I k1) - (I + k1 - k2)/(-I + k1 - k2) == 0,        E^(I k2) - (I - k1 + k2)/(-I - k1 + k2) == 0}, {k1, k2}, Complexes]      In general, I know that the values ​​of k's are such that               i) -2 Pi/L < Re[k] < 2 Pi/L and -2 Abs[c] < Im[k] < 2 Abs[c]          ii) k1 + ... + knbosons = 0      how could I use this extra information in Nsolve? Thanks in advance!
