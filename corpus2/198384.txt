Could you please share you thoughts about Mono patent safety? Is it risky to use Mono in production for commercial projects? In case of WEB application, for example the following technology stack: "Linux + PostgreSQL + C# Mono + EntityFramework(Mono) + ASP.NET MVC(Mono)", can I be sure that if I will use implemented by Mono Project frameworks (ADO.NET, ASP.NET/MVC, EntityFramework, WCF) and run them on Linux I will not get a persecution from Microsoft caused by some patent violation? Thank you!
