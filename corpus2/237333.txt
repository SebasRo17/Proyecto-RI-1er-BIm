I'm just wondering if you have an application where you define a class that defines some user configurable settings (from an xml file, or a GUI), should you design it so that it follows SOLID as much as possible like the rest of the application? More specifically, how do you change the available settings without violating the **Open Closed Principle?** Because I'm having trouble picturing this. I can see the addition of settings you can extend the class, but with the removal of settings, or change of a setting there would be no way to modify the configuration class so that it follows SOLID. Or is it possible somehow? I can also imagine trickle down effect from those settings changes, that require classes that depend on them to be modified as well.
