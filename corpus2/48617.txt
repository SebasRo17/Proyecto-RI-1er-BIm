What is the most appropriate way of writing this comment:                   /// <summary>         /// Order - Identifies the ordinal location of this category         ///     relative to other listed categories.         /// </summary>      if I'm wanting to wrap "category" in `<see>` tags? I've considered:                   /// <summary>         /// Order - Identifies the ordinal location of this <see cref="Category"/>         ///     relative to other listed <see cref="Category"/>'s.         /// </summary>      Do you see my dilemma? **Edit:** I should add that I am using Visual Studio's XML Comments. So I am somewhat restricted as to the schema. I believe `cref` has to point to a valid type reference.
