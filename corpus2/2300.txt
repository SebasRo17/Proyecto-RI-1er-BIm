This line returns `3`:               x = 1; ++++x      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/80WEy.png) However, the value of `x` after the increment is only 2. Similarly, this line returns `5`, while the value of `x` is again only 2.               x = 1; ++++++++x      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rTYeU.png) Why does it return `3` and `5` respectively in the above examples? * * * (This question is intended as a puzzle, and to encourage people to think through an opaque evaluation chain.)
