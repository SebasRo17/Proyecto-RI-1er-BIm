What are the real life use cases for tagged pointers? This is mostly coming from reading about small 64-bit systems and possible uses of 64-bit word pointers. To my understanding tagged pointers are addresses which can containing extra information in bits due to possible address space on that particular architecture is much smaller. But then, is it possible to use tagged pointers beyond trivial cases? Any cool ideas / examples? Are there popular libraries, frameworks taking advantage of 64-bit pointers via tagged pointers? Is that possible on every hardware?
