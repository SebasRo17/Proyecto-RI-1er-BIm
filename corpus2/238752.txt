Say you have a project that is a tangled mess. No code structure and breaking one area breaks the entire thing. Fixing one area breaks another area. The closest you can fix things is writing the code that's almost like redoing the entire thing. But then, **the release is in the next week**. Here's some facts that actually worsen the situation:   * There's very minimal testing. Makes breaking hard to find.   * The code has no structure. Imagine one app has everything _in one file_.   * No documentation. Very hard to replicate server requests when there's no documentation about the parameters to send, and what to expect. What should one do to address this situation? The best thing to do is extend the project release, but I'm not the one who calls the shots. I did comment on the issue though.
