I have set of Objects of the same class which have different values of their attributes. and I need to find the best match from a function under given scenarios out of these objects. In future these objects might increase as well. Quite similar to the way we have Color class in awt. we have some static color objects in the class with diff rgb values. But in my case say, I need to chose the suitable color out of these static ones based on certain criteria. So should I keep them in an arrayList or enum or keep them as static vars as in case of Colors. because I will need to parse through all of them and decide upon the best match. so I need them in some sort of collection. But in future if I need to add another type I will have to modify the class and add another list.add(object) call for this one and then it will violate the open-close principle. How should I go about it ? **EDIT:** To be more precise I have a roughly 7-8 branches of restaurants which wont increase that much..may be by 3-4 in few years and I need a function that will return the nearest Restaurant satisfying few other criteria. and For that I need to parse through all of them to decide which one suits the customer the most.
