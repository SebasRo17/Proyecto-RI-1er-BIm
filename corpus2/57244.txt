When I create two `TimeSeries` with some `MetaInformation` I can combine them into one `TemporalData` object. But I lose the `MetaInformation` for the `TimeSeries` objects.               ts1 = TimeSeries[{{1, 2}, {2, 5}, {3, 7}, {4, 3}}, MetaInformation -> {"signaalnaam" -> "CR1HAH90", "Eenheid" -> "m^3"}]     ts2 = TimeSeries[{{1, 4}, {2.5, 2}, {4, 4}}, ResamplingMethod -> {"Interpolation", InterpolationOrder -> 0}, MetaInformation -> {"signaalnaam" -> "CR1HAH98", "Eenheid" -> "m^2"}]          td = TemporalData[{ts1, ts2}]      In `td` the `MetaInformation` of `ts2` is gone. Is this by design?
