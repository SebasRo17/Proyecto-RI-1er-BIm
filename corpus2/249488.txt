I have one huge file.asp with all my reports. I have modularized the page using querystring, so this creates a lot of "virtual pages" with Report #1, Report #2, and so on. I have some blocks of code I use more than once in the page. Actually I am repeating the code, but I already started to use Function to, for example format the date. But the block of codes are like panels with some selects in databases, tables, and so on... I mean, one panel can have more than 200 lines of code. I would like to create some kind of function to reuse the code, instead of replicate it everytime. With classic asp, how many options I have? One that I have discarted is create one asp file per panel and in a master file include the panel where is necessary. I am really out of this approach. Is the Function the best approach?
