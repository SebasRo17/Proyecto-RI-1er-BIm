_The question may seem strange at first glance_ ... And **I may be alone** in this situation. But currently I want to improve my skill through learning new framework. however, do a simple "`HelloWorld`" application does not satisfy me. I think a **practical project** is required to apprehend the basics of a framework. I know there is many scholar-like project like design a library manager or CMS. But I have recently planned to learn ~3 differents frameworks and I can't find any motivations through " _unexciting_ " project. In the end I have not started any framework ... I'm aware of _I do not develop the project of the year_ ... I'm just looking for something **a bit exciting**. **I do not expect any project subject** , anyway stimulation provided by a project is something subjective. But I want to know your inspiration ! (or method to learn framework ^^) I'm talking about web-dev framework but I'm open to any kind information !
