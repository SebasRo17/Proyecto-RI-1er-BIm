I want to modify the value that is returned by Solve. Example:               SolC1 = Solve[Sin[ Ï€ x / L] == 1, x]     {{x -> L/2}}      I need to add n to x so that x becomes `n + L/2`. Both of the following I tried yields unwanted result in the succeeding calculation.               SolC1 = (x -> L/2) + n     ----     SolC1 = SolC1 + n      I particularly need the proper way to do this because `x` can have other variables depending on other `Solve` execution.
