I come from a PHP background so I'm used to everything being in one place. I want to install a python program (Zine)so that I can hack on it. The instructions I've found install it to the system in multiple folders. I do not want to edit files that are installed in Linux system directories. What is the python way to layout the directory on the filesystem for a web program that under active development? would it be:               /web/htdocs/python/modules/app.py      or               /web/python/modules/app.py     /web/htdocs/      or               /web/python/modules/app.py     /web/python/htdocs/
