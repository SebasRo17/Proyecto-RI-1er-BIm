Seems like a bug to me, don't have time to dig more now. WinXP V9.0.1.0               With[{           opt = Sequence[AxesLabel -> {"x", "y"}, PlotStyle -> {Thick}, AspectRatio -> 1,                           ImageSize -> {300, 300}, AxesStyle -> Arrowheads[0.05]]          },          Row[{Framed@Plot[Sin[x], {x, 4, 6}, opt],                Framed@Plot[(-5 + x)/(6 + x)^2, {x, 4, 6}, opt]}]         ]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UDGq7.png) and without `AxesStyle`: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HUqGW.png) So as we can see, `Arrowheads` is making the trouble but not with every function. Can you confirm this behaviour on other enviroments? p.s. **the solution** is `ImagePadding -> spec` ofc, but there should not be the issue.
