I have a "sparse array" like this               arr[1.5]=0.4, arr[3.5]=0.7, arr[7]=0.3      which is not really a sparse array since the keys are not all integers. This is like a hash table or associative array. How can I convert `arr` into a list? I tried `Normal[arr]`, but it won't work. I would like to be able to compute `Total@arr`, but first it needs to be converted to a normal list.
