I work for a large company which has several non-RESTful APIs. I am tasked with building a web application to interact with these APIs. Each API handles and provides very different business processes and data. I'd like to build RESTful (a) interface(s) fronting the APIs so as to make them reusable by other future web applications. Then, I'd like JavaScript to interact with the RESTful interface(s). Should I build one RESTful API (one subdomain) for my entire company               http://api.mycompany.com         /business_process_1/resource/         /business_process_2/resource         /business_process_3/resource      and make it front the very different business processes and data? Or, should I build multiple APIs (multiple subdomains)?               http://business-process-1.mycompany.com     http://business-process-2.mycompany.com     http://business-process-3.mycompany.com
