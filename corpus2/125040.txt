I am going to write a bachelor's science work on caching strategies and really, can't find any links to specifications or full descriptions of some of them. Only something like summaries from wikipedia. Please, help with some links on LRU, MRU caching and new-one - Clock Pro. * * * Thanks a lot. All links are very useful for me. The purpose of work - is to compare different cache strategies to get more effiency. It based on WebApplication with ejb 2.0, so algorithm's will be implemented there, espesially in ejbLoad() and ejbFindByPrimarKey(). Also, one of aspects of this application - it will use not common scheme of tables in database - it based on metamodel. So, if you had any experience on this topic, i would be grateful to take some of your knowledge)
