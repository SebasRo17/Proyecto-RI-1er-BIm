I wish to write a function like `MatrixForm`, that affect only display but not evaluation, i.e. a function that automatically is stripped away from output. More precisely I wish a `MatrixForm`-variant that collect the LCM of the denominators of the elements of the matrix out of the matrix. Is this possible? I think `Interpretation`, `Defer`, etc. combined with `Row`, `MatrixForm` doesn't fill exactly this need. This is the best I did.               PrettyMatrixForm[       m_ /; VectorQ[m, NumericQ] \[Or] MatrixQ[m, NumericQ]] :=      With[{lcm = LCM @@ (Denominator /@ Flatten[m])},       If[lcm === 1, MatrixForm[m],        With[{mm = m*lcm},         Interpretation[Row[{1/lcm, " \[Times] ", MatrixForm[mm]}], m]]        ]]          PrettyMatrixForm[{{1/2, 1/4}, {2, 1/3}}]      **EDIT.** I wish to be able to write and evaluate something linke this in a cell, as I can do with `MatrixForm`.               {{1/2, 1/4}, {2, 1/3}} //PrettyMatrixForm     % * 2      **EDIT 2** To be even more clear, I wish to reproduce this behavior of Mathematica Kernel.               In[1]:= MatrixForm[{{a,b},{c,d}}]          Out[1]//MatrixForm= a   b                              c   d          In[2]:= Out[1]          Out[2]= {{a, b}, {c, d}}      As you can see the Kernel show `Out[1]//MatrixForm` i.e. `MatrixForm[Out[1]]` but store in `Out[1]` only the list `{{a,b},{c,d}}`. This happens for all `XyzForm`-like symbols, and obviously happens also in the Mathematica Front- End.
