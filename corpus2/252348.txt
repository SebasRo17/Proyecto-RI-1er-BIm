Not having it means using only those tools that everybody uses (that comes with the same image for every PC). I can see the benefit of this - less worries that somebody's machine may get infected after downloading a corrupted file. But isn't this a bit of an overkill? What if I need a tool that could make my daily work much more efficient and there is no alternative? I know that it depends A LOT on the exact company and it's policies but having worked only in two companies so far (healthcare - no restrictions; finance - lots of restrictions), I'm wondering how common is it and if there are any other reasons besides security.
