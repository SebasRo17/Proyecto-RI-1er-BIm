I'm building a website fro a client which uses TinyMCE as the main WYSIWYG editor. Now my client asked if it is possible to write a line and make a line break and then continue without leaving a space between the text before and after the line break (e.g. just like in word). I told him that the web uses paragraph for formatting and not line breaks. Still he'd like to use line breaks for formatting. Should I convince him not to use line breaks for formatting or should I just switch TinyMCE to line break mode (which the is not recommended in the TinyMCE documentation).
