Is there a way to overlay a plot into a blank area of a Manipulate control panel, that will still update according to the controls in the Manipulate function? This is an image of what I have: ![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/NlHRqoi.jpg) You can see on the bottom left that I have a semi-function plot there. I am using the function Overlay[] to do this, but I'm not sure if its the best way. What you see is two nested Manipulates, one with the control panel on the left, and the 2nd with the control panel on the bottom. Unfortunately, the extra plot doesn't update with any of the sliders. I guess something with Dynamic[] could work, but I don't know how to combine that with Manipulate! Thanks!
