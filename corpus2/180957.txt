I have an open source project for `mydomain.com` which requires connections to a database (...as is tradition). What is the standard practice for allowing others to work on the site, without giving them full access to the database's credentials? For example: If I have a `connect.php` page that connects to the database. I don't want someone to be able to read that file, or simply write `<?php include("http://mydomain.com/connect.php")` because then they will have full access to the database. If I put the file in my `.gitignore` file, sure the file won't be in the repo, but it'll still be visible in the source code. Do I just make a read-only user and give them access to that, and then put the full read-write connection file and follow the guidelines of this answer?: Making sure database connection information is secured What is standard practice here? or what can I research to learn more about this?
