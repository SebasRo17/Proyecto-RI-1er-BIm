When the company I work in hired new managers, they offered us to overview someone's code on every meeting. We have meetings every two weeks, so each time one of developers was to show his/her code on the projector, and others were going to discuss it. I thought this would be great: each developer would be more careful when writing code and we could share our experience better. But somehow we forgot about this and the offer just remained an offer. What are the benefits of this and are there any drawbacks?
