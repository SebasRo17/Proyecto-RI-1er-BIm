For instance, would Python be a more ergonomic programming language since it doesn't force you to make curly braces which requires the AltGr key. Also Python usually requires less code to achieve the same or am I being biased towards Python and PHP actually is an ergonomical and comfortable language despite forcing the programmer to use the AltGr key? Isn't forcing the programmer to use the AltGr key not very ergonomical?
