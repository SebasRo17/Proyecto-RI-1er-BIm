just getting started with composer and I have a couple of questions. When I use composer to add a dependency, the dependency gets added to my folder's Vendor directory. The newly added package not only comes with the source code for that package, but all packagist required files for the developer to test and add that package to packagist repo (composer.json, .travis.yaml, license, readme.md, etc). For my project, do I need to keep the vendor's required packagist files in my project? Can I clean the package folder structure up a little? I added the package, Slim micro framework, which nests the source files three directories deep upon installation, `../vendor/slim/slim/Slim/(source Files)`. Is it worth moving these files to the top Slim directory like: `../vendor/Slim/(source files)`? Or will this ruin the integrity of the package?
