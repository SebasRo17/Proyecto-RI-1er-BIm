What is the best/fastest way to open a file in Visual Studio knowing only its name? In Eclipse there is "Open Resource" which allows you to interactively search for all files in the workspace, but I cannot find a similar good function in Visual Studio. The normal "open file" function in Visual Studio opens the Windows file dialog, which is pretty useless since I have to know exactly where the file is.
