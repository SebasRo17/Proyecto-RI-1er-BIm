I've been noticing something strange since updating to Mathematica 8, and that is that occaisionally I'll see that the MathKernel is using up to 800% CPU in my Activity Monitor on OS X (I have 8 cores). I have no Parallel calls whatsoever, and this is in a single kernel, not across multiple kernels. My code is pretty much only Interpolates, Maps, Do loops, and plotting routines. I'm curious if some of the built-in Mathematica routines are in fact already parallel, and if so, which ones?
