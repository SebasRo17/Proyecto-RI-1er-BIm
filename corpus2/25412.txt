This is hopefully a simpler version of this previous unanswered question of mine. Let me just focus on the two expressions $F_2^{(s)}$ and $F_3^{(s)}$ given in A.3 and A.4 of page 19 of this paper.   * How do I get Mathematica to just even manipulate such vector expressions? Like if I want to calculate $(F_2^{(s)})^2$ or $F_2^{(s)} F_3^{(s)}$ etc?  * * * To make the question clear let me add in some more details about what I exactly want, I define the function F2s as,               F2s[q_, k1_] := (5/     14) + (3 (Norm[k1])^2)/(28 (Norm[q])^2) + (3 Norm[        k1]^2)/(28 (Norm[q - k1])^2) - (5)/(28 (Norm[q])^2 (Norm[         q - k1])^(-2)) - (5)/(28 (Norm[q])^(-2) (Norm[         q - k1])^(2)) + ( (Norm[        k1])^4)/(14 (Norm[q])^2 (Norm[q - k1])^2 )      But when I ask it to be squared all I get is this! (basically nothing has been done and the situation doesn't change with taking a FullSimplify either)               (2 Norm[k1]^4 - 5 (Norm[q]^2 - Norm[-k1 + q]^2)^2 + 3 Norm[k1]^2 (Norm[q]^2 + Norm[-k1 + q]^2))^2/(784 Norm[q]^4 Norm[-k1 + q]^4)      I would have wanted the answer to be given in the way I gave the functions $F2s$ - as a sum of fractions each of which is a product of powers of $q$, $k1$ and $\vert \vec{q} - \vec{k1}\vert$. How do I get that?
