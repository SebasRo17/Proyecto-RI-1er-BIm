I ask this to the pros out there - Is it feasible to build a new LOB(Line Of Business) application with VS Shell as an stand alone application. There are some points that I thought needs to changed, but I'm unaware how, like - There will be no document. Instead there will be windows with controls where people enter data. There will be no file menu(new,edit). Instead there will be a login box when the application opens(something like the SQL Server Management Studio). There should be floating windows which hosts the control and some kind of window management where these windows can be minimized(obviously inside the shell) These are some of the points which I thought of. Obviously there are many other points which needs to be changed and I ask you to populate the list. Also please point me out how to start with it, best practices and possibly any other tips which you think should be mentioned.
