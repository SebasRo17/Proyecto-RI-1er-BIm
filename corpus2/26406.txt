I have two lists. The first, `coefficientlist`, is dense and has dimension `{176,176}` elements. The second, `cubelist`, is a list of three-dimensional lists, i.e. `cubelist` has dimension `{176,65,65,65}`. I need to perform the following summation:                   sumlist=Table[0,{65},{65},{65}];         Do[         If[coefficientlist[[n,m]]!=0,           sumlist += coefficientlist[[n,m]] (cubelist[[n]]cubelist[[m]]) ];           ,{n,176},{m,176}];      Essentially I want to perform a sum like $S = \sum\limits_{i ,j} T_{ij} \phi_i \phi_j $ where the $T$ matrix is called `coefficientlist` in the code above and the $\phi_i$ are represented as grids over real space. I have to do this several times, so I want to find the most efficient way to do it. Thanks in advance.
