I am facing the following problem: I need to work on several already-designed graphs, accessible in ".DOT" format. Mathematica can perfectly read these graphs, however because the nodes of the graphs only contains "IDs" instead of the actual textual data I'm interrested in. The data are stored in node- labels. So if I do a something like that:               argGraph = Import["http://www.arg.dundee.ac.uk/AIFdb/dot/4"]     VertexList[argGraph]      I only get a list of IDs: {"234", "235", "236", "237", "238", "239"} How can I easily reformat the graph so that the labels are assigned as node values ? The Graph looks like this: Graph Image and is a representation of this argument map: Argument Map Thanks a lot for your help.
