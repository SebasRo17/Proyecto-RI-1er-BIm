Two part question:   1. I am working on a project where the webservices all return a generic object. On success, that object then contains the data returned from the webservice along with additional information such as status messages or qualifiers. On failure, the object contains no data and error messages. What is the name for this pattern?   2. When I think that something I am working on is a common pattern and has a name, what strategies can I use to learn what that name is? I frequently see things that look familiar or common and suspect they have a name and are a common pattern. How can I find those on my own without asking StackExchange?
