I want to make an application where I can specify a function $f:\mathbb R\to \mathbb R$ and a dynamic value $n$ and get the function $\frac{f(x+\frac{1}{n})-f(x)}{\frac{1}{n}}$. I moreover want to compare it to $f'(x)$, i.e. plot it in the same graph. I first tried it with $f(x):=x^m, m=2$ and used Listplot, but even here I got into some obsticles. Here is my attempt:               Table[((x+1/n)^m)-x^m)/(1/n),{m,1000,100}]          Function[x,#][Rangle[10]]&/@%          %/.{n->3}//N          Show[     Plot[3 x^2,{x,0,10}]     ListPlot[#]&/@%     ]      If I do just _ListPlot[#] &/@%_ instead of the last line, the I get all the plots, however it doesn't compare. I'd also like to get away from $x^m$ and make an abstraction w.r.t. $f$, but my tries with Function fails. Is there a difference between _Function[$x$,term]_ and _$\lambda x.$term_ ?.
