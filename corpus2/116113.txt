I am creating a rails app with following constraints   * It has no database   * It uses a web API to store and retrieve the data   * The connection to the web API is via a custom gem.   * The Gem has a basic functionality to make a web API call based on the parameters given.   * I have 2-3 different kinds of object that I can think of ( or may be more precisely virtual model ) How should the structure of my program be ?   * Should I incorporate all the method calls within the gem ?   * Should I create models and put the api related calls in there (then through the gem's basic method)   * Should I just ignore the model and put everything in the controller . ? The second method seems most appropriate , but then all the methods from model would be static and I would be calling all methods in essence without any objects.
