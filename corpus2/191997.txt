I am new to unit testing, I've one REST web method that just calls DB and populates a DTO. Pseudo code is               public object GetCustomer(int id)     {       CustomerDTO objCust = //get from DB       return objCust;     }      My doubt is how to write tests for these methods and type of tests (Integration/Unit) to be included. And for unit tests, does it need to hit the DB. If it were and I pass a customer id and do few assertions, the data might change eventually resulting in failures. I think I am missing something here understanding these concepts.
