Maybe I'm doing it wrong, but in my experience, developing and maintaining heavily ajax-based web apps is much more difficult then a "more standard" web app. I'm not talking about an app that uses ajax to load in some data here and there, but the style where the page the server sends out is just a frame, and all the data is filled in at load time. I'd love to hear from those with experience in developing these types of apps. My personal experience is that they take more hours to both build and maintain.
