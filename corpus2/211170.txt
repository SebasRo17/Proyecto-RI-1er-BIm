I have been playing with Scrum methodology since year and half. I am using VersionOne as scrum tool. I have tried to follow most of the scrum principles. Sometimes, I feel like there is an issue with transparency of the stories. As of now, the whole team can get an access to all stories defined for the project. This creates issues with different levels of developers like junior and senior level developer. People's complains are about the work distribution or type of work they are assigned to. There is an issue of comparison among the developers. I don't know if I am following scrum properly or not. In scrum, should we give access of the all stories to everyone? or only assigned person can view his/her story?
