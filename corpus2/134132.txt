I have recently developed an application in C# which is supposed to run within the environment of the company i work for. I could technically generate a Setup or use ClickOnce to handle the deployment of the application, but I am considering basically copying the EXE file into a public directory and have everybody execute it from there. The program recovers data from a database, makes some computations and displays the results. I was wondering what the downfalls of this idea were. So far, I came up with the following:   * I have to make sure that the prerequisites are installed on each machine (for example, .Net Framework 4.0)   * I will not be able to "automatically" create a shortcut and the entries in the "Start Menu" (not a problem, user can do it manually). In particular, I was wondering if the fact that several user actually run the same application at the same time could result in a problem (cocurrency, efficiency)?
