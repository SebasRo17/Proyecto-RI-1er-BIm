Is there a native _Mathematica_ way to convert a string like `"<select></select>"` into `"&lt;select&gt;&lt;/select&gt;"` and similarly for other reserved characters in html (or another encoding that would work in a webpage)?. I'm working in _webMathematica_ , but I can't find a good way to print the literal string `"<select></select>"` into a page - it either gets converted into an node, or it gets wrapped in a `<pre>` tag.
