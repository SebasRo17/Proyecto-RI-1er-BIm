I'm trying to come to grips with parsing an XML file but I'm having difficulty working out how to extract specific attribute data from an XMLElement. Sample XML file below:               <!DOCTYPE DEXXMLDoc SYSTEM "DEXXMLDoc.DTD">     <DEXXMLDoc name="RSM-a.xml" creator="DX8" version="8.0.6">     <designInfo studyType="ResponseSurface" designType="CCD" noOfRuns="20" noOfFactors="3" noOfResponses="2">     <designNotes>This data file created by Design-Expert 6</designNotes>     </designInfo>     <blockInfo>     <block code="0" name="Block 1"/>     <block code="1" name="Block 2"/>     </blockInfo>     <factorInfo>     <factor id="A" name="time" unit="min." type="Numeric">     <numeric low="40" high="50" stdDev="0"/>     </factor>     <factor id="B" name="temperature" unit="deg C" type="Numeric">     <numeric low="80" high="90" stdDev="0"/>     </factor>     <factor id="C" name="catalyst" unit="%" type="Numeric">     <numeric low="2" high="3" stdDev="0"/>     </factor>     </factorInfo>      As you can see, this particular XML file relies on attributes to hold much of the data. I have no trouble selecting entire XMLElement(s) by name using `Cases` but I can't seem to work out how to extract specific attribute data by name. For example, I'd like to be able to extract the `studyType` attribute from the `designInfo` element. This is what the XMLElement that I'm working with looks like:                   XMLObject[       "Document"][{XMLObject["Doctype"]["DEXXMLDoc",         "System" -> "DEXXMLDoc.DTD"]},       XMLElement[       "DEXXMLDoc", {"name" -> "RSM-a.xml", "creator" -> "DX8",         "version" -> "8.0.6"}, {XMLElement[         "designInfo", {"studyType" -> "ResponseSurface",           "designType" -> "CCD", "noOfRuns" -> "20", "noOfFactors" -> "3",           "noOfResponses" -> "2"}, {XMLElement[           "designNotes", {}, {"This data file created by Design-Expert \     6"}]}], XMLElement[         "blockInfo", {}, {XMLElement[           "block", {"code" -> "0", "name" -> "Block 1"}, {}],           XMLElement["block", {"code" -> "1", "name" -> "Block 2"}, {}]}],      Does anyone have experience in extracting named attribute data from XMLElements?
