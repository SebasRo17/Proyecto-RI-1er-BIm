The autocomplete ("Complete Selection") feature `Ctrl`-`K` (or `F2` on Windows) works fine for functions and code input. Is there a way to enhance it for text input? Todayâ€™s standard (see e.g. OpenOffice etc.) is to autocomplete based on words already occuring in the text. For text _Mathematica_ will just display words from a (very simple) dictionary. If I type e.g. "Grav" it will show "Grave", "Gravy" etc. It does not even seem to know "Gravity" or "Gravitation" (despite these being common words and despite occurences in my text)
