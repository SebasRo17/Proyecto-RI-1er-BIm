The stereotypical view of a programmer can't do graphics very well, from what I've read and seen. However, I love programming (preferably OOP, PHP, C++, Objective-C) and can't deny the fact I have a unique taste in web design and others have said I am doing well at it (CSS). I thought to myself "Hey, wait, I'm a programmer - how can I design well?". Question is: is it possible to be good at programming and designing? Does anyone here feel the same? For the record: actual images I have created have been called programmer art several times before by friends
