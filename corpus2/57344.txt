I would like to call a JLink-based java function from Mathematica with a Mathematica Span[] object as shorthand, like so...               << JLink`     MyJavaPackage`myStaticMethod[ variable1, variable2, 1 ;; 10 ]      I would like to convert the `Span[1, 10]` object into a Java object automatically (actually, a `scala.range` object) I know you can specify the mapping of complex values in Mathematica using ` SetComplexClass["classname"]`. Is there any general equivalent, so I can do the above conversion automatically? I am thinking I need something like the inverse of `MakeJavaExpr[]`... The alternative would be, I guess, to specify in Mathematica, in the MyJavaPackage` scope, something like...                MyJavaPackage`myStaticMethod[ variable1, variable2, span_Span ]:=           myStaticMethod[ variable1, variable2, JavaNew["scala.Range", span[[1]], span[[2]]]      ... that would preclude doing this for non-static Java functions though, I guess. Thank you for your help!
