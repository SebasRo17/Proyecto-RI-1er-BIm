I am having difficulty plotting something along these lines in _Mathematica_. ![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/l7CTZIy.png) I will explain what is going on here. Basically, I am solving an interval equation $ax=b$, in the first example $a = [1, 20]$ and $b =[3, 4]$ and therefore $b/a = [3/20, 4]$. As you can see from the graph I want a circle representing the projective line. A straight line will come off the two end points of the interval which represents the solutions and those lines will go through the center of the circle and the region bounded by the lines should be shaded in. Similarly the other example below is an unbounded one where $a = [-1,2]$ and $b = [5,100]$ and hence $b/a = (-\infty, -5] \cup [5/2, \infty]$. Same type of plot though, the lines come off $-5$ and $5/2$ on the x axis and go through the center of the circle and the bounded regions are shaded. Could someone please help me plot this?
