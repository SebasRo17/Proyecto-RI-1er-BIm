I am trying to achieve the following: Three (dynamically updated) `Checkboxes` (a, b and c) can be toggled on or off individually. Depending on their status, a resulting list shall be set to `{a,b,c}`, `{a,c}`, `{b,c}`, etc. I am currently using the following code:               {"a:" Checkbox[Dynamic[a]],      "b:" Checkbox[Dynamic[b]],       "c:" Checkbox[Dynamic[c]],      Dynamic[{If[a, "a",], If[b, "b",], If[c, "c",]}]}      But this yields, depending on the setting, a list of the kind `{a,b,Null}`, etc. - that is, if a checkbox is set to `False`, the list element is set to `Null` rather than left out entirely. Is there any way to achieve my goal in a not-so-cumbersome way (i.e., avoiding something like a 8-cases `Piecewise` or `Which` function)? Thanks in advance!
