I want to use Notepadd++ for taking notes on python programming language. I want to write some normal sentences and also write codes on same page simultaneously. I don't want to show line numbers for the normal texts but I want to show line numbers for programming codes. Is this possible? I mean normal lines should be without syntax highlighting and line numbers which usually show on left hand side of each line. And syntax highlighting for the codes written in the same file? For example... To print strings in Python we should use single or double quotations after print keyword. For example... 1 print "Hello World!" (this line should be with line number and syntax highlighting)
