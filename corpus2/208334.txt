As an example I want to switch from C#/.NET to Scala/Jvm. I'm working as a self-employed and I'm free to choose my favorite language/platform. Having more than 8 years of experience in C#/.NET leads me to have lots of reusable codes, libraries and framework. I can work on my projects and ideas without thinking about language so I'm focused on what I'm doing. Why should I do such migration? Because;   * Scala is open-source and innovative   * Scala runs on JVM which is cross-platform that decreases costs and some risks   * Scala has all C# feature (with something more)   * Benefit of Java comminuty   * More open-source libraries in Java platform   * Doing open-source in .NET is a little harder and doesn't get attention as it does in Java or other plaforms. Is it OK to manage such a big risk and learn a new language/platform (in this case, Scala, Play framework, etc.) and use it in at least a small commercial project to find out if it's suitable?
