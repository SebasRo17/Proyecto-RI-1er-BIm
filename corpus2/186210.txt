I'm writing a small webpage that will allow the user to download small tools to run locally, I'm thinking what might be a suitable choice of language for the small tools. There will be a rather large amount of fairly specific small tools, so I'm interested in cutting down the development time for each one as much as possible. Requirements:   * The tools will have graphics, nothing fancy mainly 2D-shapes.   * Can be run offline.   * Preferably no installation at all, just run. Some of the users will not be very technically at all.   * Cross-platform, primarily Windows and OSX but also a bit of Linux. My current thoughts:   * Python. Easy to write in but can be a hassle for the user to get to run if using libraries like PyGame. I can't count on the user already having python installed on windows or osx.    * I'm discounting .NET and Mono for more or less the same reason as Python, they'd need installers, or is there a way to ship everything needed in the same folder?   * C++. Takes a slightly longer time to write things in, but does support the requirements. I thought about using a scripting language(Lua, Angelscript or similar) on top of SDL to get the benefits of both c++ and shorten the development time once the middleware is well developed enough. Do you have any other suggestions? EDIT: Please leave a comment as to why if you vote negatively.
