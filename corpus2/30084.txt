I have some packages inside a folder (named Packs) that is in the same file level of some executed package.               executedPack.m     Packs/subPack01.m     Packs/subPack02.m     Packs/subPack03.m      Today I use this structure do load the sub packages inside the executedPack.m:               (*Execution without Front-End*)      Needs["MyPack`",FileNameJoin[{DirectoryName@$InputFileName,"Packs","subPack01.m"}]]          (*Execution with Front-End*)         Needs["MyPack`",FileNameJoin[{NotebookDirectory[],"Packs","subPack01.m"}]]      The first I use when running the package without front-end, and the last when I evaluate in the front-end. There is some simpler way to do that, more symmetric? I read some kernel folder structure, but I didn't find more details on that. ## Update Now what I want, but better. This works both in Fron-End and no Front-End execution.               Quiet[Check[SetDirectory@DirectoryName@$InputFileName,SetDirectory@NotebookDirectory[]],SetDirectory::fstr];     Needs["Packs`subPack01`"];
