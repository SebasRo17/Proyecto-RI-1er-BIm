One of the requirements set for the graphing project I am working on is that plot and axis unit labels sometimes need to include superscripts. Here is an approximately minimal example (I have some plotting options set differently from the default, but these shouldn't matter here):               fakedata101 =        FoldList[0.92 #1 + #2 &, 0.,         RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[0, 0.5], 100]];     ListLinePlot[fakedata101, Filling -> Axis, PlotStyle ->Red,       FillingStyle -> Red,       PlotLabel -> "Test Label in k(\!\(\*SuperscriptBox[\(m\), \(2\)]\))"]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/kNR29.png) The `SingleLetterItalics` option appears to be turned _off_ in the Options Inspector, but that doesn't seem to work for `String`-format text labels. It _does_ work if set explicitly, e.g. when adding `Text` in an `Epilog` with an explicit `Style` wrapping:               Epilog ->       Text[Style["\!\(\*SuperscriptBox[\(Text with Footnote marker\), \((a)\)]\)",         SingleLetterItalics -> False], {10, -1.5}]      Is there a way I can robustly turn off `SingleLetterItalics` in styled text such as this? I would prefer not to have to catch every `String` passed to a `PlotLabel` or `AxisLabel` and send it through a `Style` command if I could help it.
