I have a few sites which are all hosted on the same web hosting service under shared hosting. My web host supports Git and I have SSH access to it, and I also have Git setup on my laptop as well. I want to make it so that when I do a "git push origin master", it will automatically update the files on my web server, and also save a backup of the previous commit's files so I can easily rollback if I want to. Is this possible?
