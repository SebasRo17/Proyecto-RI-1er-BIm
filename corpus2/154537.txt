Many browsers now disable Java applets by default, requiring them to be enabled on a per-page basis. It seems like applets have not changed much in the past few years. In fact, it seems that client-side Java (applets, desktop applications, ...) is dying completely, and Java is primarily becoming a server-side language. Except for the sake of compatibility, is there any place where applets are still useful on today's web? As a web developer who is familiar with Java and with JavaScript, why would I ever choose to use an applet instead of some JavaScript?
