I am building a program which would have WCF support. I am using the MVC pattern. For each controller there is a WCF service class. e.g. I have `CTRL.CTRLBooking`, `WCF.IWCFBooking` and `WCF.WCFBooking`. For each controller (total of 10) there is a WCF class and an endpoint. Is this a good approach or should I keep all the methods I provide in one single class e.g. `WCF.WCFService` (considering their count would be no more than 25-30)?
