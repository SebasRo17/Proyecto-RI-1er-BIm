I currently have a free WPC account, which I am using for testing purposes. Amongst other things, I want to find out more about how the credit system works, in particular how many credits are used, based on various different operations. However, whenever I try to access the Usage Summary Report in my WPC account I receive the following, unhelpful error message: "Sorry you do not have permission to access this item. Try using a different account." Are free WPC accounts not provisioned with access to usage reports? How does one budget credit usage without such information?
