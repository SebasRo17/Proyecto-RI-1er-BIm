Is checking count/size/length less than 0 necessary in modern languages anymore? For instance, in C# I quote often will check if a collection's count is less than or equal to 0. I assume that this was done in older languages, like C, where you could potentially have a size of less than 0. Is there ever a case where you can have the size/length/count of an object or primitive type be less than 0?
