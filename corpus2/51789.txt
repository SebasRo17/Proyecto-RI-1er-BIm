I'd like to draw some curves using Plot, and I tried follow codes:                Plot[Table[n/Sqrt[\[Pi]] Exp[-n^2 x^2], {n, {3, 5, 7}}], {x, -1, 1},       PlotStyle -> Directive[Black, Thick],       AxesStyle ->       Directive[Arrowheads[0.04], GrayLevel[0.7], Thick, Opacity[1]],      Ticks -> None, PlotRange -> {{-1.2, 1.2}, {-0.7, 4.5}},       AspectRatio -> 1, RegionFunction -> Function[{x}, Abs[x] < 1]]      Then it comes out this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HE9Fa.jpg) Which I confused is that the gray axes are in the front of the black curves(esp. for the x axes). How can I move the axes backward to show my curve well?
