Since now there are several good languages that target the JVM and can interop with Java with varying degrees of painlessness, and likewise for the CLR (especially with the recent addition of F# as an "official" language for the platform), it seems to me like more places could take advantage of this but are afraid to. In my own workplace, we can only write our components in C#. It's a good language, and I don't mind programming in it, but I'd really prefer to be able to use F# sometimes. I'm sure if we were in Java-land things would be similar, where I'd prefer Clojure or Scala. This is probably selfish of me, as I'm sure it's safer to stick with a lowest-common-denominator. What are your thoughts on this issue? Should more people take advantage of the great interoperability on these platforms?
