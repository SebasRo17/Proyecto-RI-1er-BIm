Our current user's guide is built using `asciidoc`. The documentation is managed by a non-technical person, but we keep the source text files as well as generated HTML in source control. Issues arise when they are making doc updates for version `x.z` in the `x.y` branch. Typically, one of the developers will update their environment, but they can be very forgetful. I know there has to be a better way to do this. How do you manage users' guides in a versioned manner without actually depending on non-technical users to learn VCS?
