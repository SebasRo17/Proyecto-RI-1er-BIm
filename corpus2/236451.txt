I'm seeking vital naming of string `filename` parameter in parameter list used in various methods where **filename with full path** is expected. In many cases also UNC path can be actually supplied as full path because many libraries handle it natively. I usually call the parameter just `filename`, but it can be misleading in two ways:   * Beginners tend to think it is only name of file – without path.   * If there is a need of splitting the value into path and filename, term **filename** sticks better with filename part without path which appeared after split. Anyway, it is not easy to give that second part better name than `filename`. Alternative of splitting `filename` to `path` and `filenameOnly` looks weird to me. I think it might be better to use clearly distinguishable term for filename with path than borrowing **filename** which already has stronger meaning for something else. I was thinking about term `absoluteFilePath` or `fullyQualifiedFilename` to stand as argument names. Maybe they are good and I need only some encouragement to start using them, but I would like to understand your best practices. **EDIT:** I would still like to stick with official VB.NET naming and capitalization conventions, so the only thing I need help sharpening is clear self-documenting wording of the term. (Not whether I should use Hungarian notation or not – I cannot.)
