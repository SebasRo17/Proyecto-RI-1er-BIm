I need to work with long time series, but I notice that this generates huge files that Mathematica doesn't handle well at all: even opening/saving one of this files is difficult, and the kernel quits often while doing simple tasks. I attach an example: the TemporalData object generated and stored in 'data' is 150 MB (and it's not even a half of what I need). Graphics are huge: each one of the Manipulate objects are ~ 150 MB, and they include no more than 300 stills. The total size of this notebook, once compiled, 650 MB circa, more or less a low quality AVI of a standard movie of one hour and a half. Is this standard for Mathematica? Should I send the output to external files and in this case which is the right way to do this, without losing the nice interactive features of the program?
