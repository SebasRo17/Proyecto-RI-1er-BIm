Today I was asked this question. We have 2 cases with code blocks A, B and C. These code blocks don't share any resources except an iterator (`int i`). Please give 3 possible reasons why case 1 could be faster than case 2, and 3 possible reasons why case 2 could be faster than case 1: **case 1**               for (i=0; i<N; ++i){      A;      B;      C;     }      **case 2**               for (i=0; i<N; ++i){      A;     }     for (i=0; i<N; ++i){      B;     }     for (i=0; i<N; ++i){      C;     }
