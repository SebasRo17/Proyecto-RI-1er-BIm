I would like to learn C# programming. I already studied it for several weeks and wrote some minor programs with VS2010, and I'm not completely newbie at programming because I worked on STALKER - Shadow of Chernobyl as scripter, but it was LUA. I want to become a real programmer. I think C# is a decent way to start with. I already learned about the most commonly used resource sites and got some nice eBooks as well, but unfortunately I don't have time to sit down in front my computer all the time, so my progress is pretty slow. I would like to ask that if someone can recommend me some decent interactive online courses to make my learning progress faster. I know about the "joe grip" course but I don't know if it's worth $39 also it's only for .NET 1.x and 2.0 while I'd like to learn 4.0 so I have no idea what should I do. **UPDATE** Thanks for the advices. I'm not sure if I will develop web or desktop applications in the future, time will tell. First I need to understand the basics of C# and .NET and get some experience. Thanks for the eBooks, I downloaded them, but anyway I've already got several eBooks, for example the Programming C# 4.0 6th Edition, what is approx. 900 pages long. I would rather need video tutorials because nowadays I don't have time to read through ten thousands of pages and it's not so exciting either. Now finally I've found some nice video tutorials where experienced people explains what they are doing. That's fine. I didn't know about that MSDN Virtual Labs, thanks for that too.
