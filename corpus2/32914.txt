If I draw a coloured diagram like `Graphics[{CMYKColor[0, 0.83, 1, 0], Rectangle[{0, 0}], CMYKColor[1, 0, 0, 0], Rectangle[{0.5, 0.5}]}]` and select the red rectangle using Drawing Tools Colours, it gives a different colour than I originally input. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qJGn8.png) When I exported the image as an eps and opened it in Illustrator, the red was back to [0,0.83,1,0]. Why are the colour sliders in Mathematica giving a different value?
