I have two matrices, for example:               data1 = {{"c1", "c2", "c3"}, {2, 5, 3}, {54, 2, 3}, {11, 2, 10}, {3,      5, 7}};      and               data2 = {{"c1", "c2", "c3"}, {11, 2, 10}, {3, 5, 7}, {2, 5, 3}, {54,      2, 3}, {3, 1, 4}, {5, 2, 3}};      I would like to merge these two matrices in a way that there is only one copy of the overlapping rows. This should lead to:               merged = {{"c1", "c2", "c3"}, {2, 5, 3}, {54, 2, 3}, {11, 2, 10}, {3,      5, 7}, {2, 5, 3}, {54, 2, 3}, {3, 1, 4}, {5, 2, 3}};      I'm looking for a procedure which works also for examples which don't overlapp.
