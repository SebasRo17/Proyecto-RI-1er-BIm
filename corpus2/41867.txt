I want to have some bottons inside manipulate to calculate some time consuming functions. For example the following code changes its color after the calculation of Total[Range[123456000]] is finished. I tried               Dynamic@Button["xxx", Clear[x1]; x1 = 0; FinishDynamic[];        Total[Range[123456000]];        x1 = 1/2, Background -> Dynamic[Hue[x1]]]      with success but when I want to localize the Dynamic variable x1 inside Manipulate(or DynamicModule) there is no result! For example, the following code does not work for me!               DynamicModule[{x1},       Button["xxx", Clear[x1]; x1 = 0; FinishDynamic[];       Total[Range[12345600]]; x1 = 1/2,        Background -> Dynamic[Hue[x1]]]]      Any ideas please?
