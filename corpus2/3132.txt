Ok, this is pretty specific... The objective is to use a `TemplateBox` to format something that is programatically inserted with `NotebookWrite`. That thing which is inserted is some dynamic control, an `OpenerBox`. So, for example:               (*Pause[3];*)NotebookWrite[InputNotebook[],       TemplateBox[{Dynamic[x]}, "blah",        DisplayFunction :> (OpenerBox[#] &)]]      Uncomment the `Pause[3]` to try it. Run it and select something in another input cell. The problem is, in this example, that the `OpenerBox`doesn't open/close, or not until you convert the cell to cell expression and back to normal doing nothing, or until you cut and paste the `OpenerBox`, or until you write something in the cell expression, etc... Point is, the cell expression is perfect but it doesn't work until you slap the FE a little bit... What's going on? How can I use a `TemplateBox` that gets pasted programatically to control some dynamic variable?
