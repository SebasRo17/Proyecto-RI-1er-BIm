# How can I plot this graph * * *               g1 = Table[x[i, j], {i, 5}, {j, 5}] // Grid;          Rasterize@g1      > ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gHWby.png) I added these arrows by `Ctrl+D`'s graphics tool. This way maybe hard to adjust the positions of x and arrows to a precise consistent level, also we need make arrows parallel.. One way is define the coordinates of x and then use `Graphics` to add `Text` and `Arrow.`. Any other good methods/choices? I think this could be one general job, because sometimes we may add other objects/marks over matrix.
