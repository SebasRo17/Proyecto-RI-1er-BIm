I've often come across bugs that have been caused by using the `ELSE` construct. A prime example is something along the lines of:               If (passwordCheck() == false){         displayMessage();     }else{         letThemIn();     }      To me this screams security problem. I know that passwordCheck is likely to be a boolean, but I wouldn't place my applications security on it. What would happen if its a string, int etc? I usually try to avoid using `ELSE`, and instead opt for two completely separate IF statements to test for what I expect. Anything else then either gets ignored OR is specifically handled. Surely this is a better way to prevent bugs / security issues entering your app. How do you guys do it?
