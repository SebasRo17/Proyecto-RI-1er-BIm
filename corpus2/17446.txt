I have a question concerning the maximum size of TIFF files Mathematica can handle. According to the TIFF 6.0 specification -revision 6.0 (see: http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/tiff/TIFF6.pdf) the maximum size of TIFF files is determined by the 32 Bit offsets used by this format. Thus, the theoretical maximum file size of a TIFF file should be about 4 GB. I am dealing with huge TIFF files that I need to import, process and export with Mathematica. Using Mathematica's Import and Export functions, I cannot import a TIFF file larger than 2 GB nor can I export a TIFF file that exceeds the 2 GB limit. Consider the following example i created:               data = ConstantArray[Image[ConstantArray[0, {1000, 1000}], "Bit16"],         1500];          Export["test.tif", data];      I create 1500 black images with a bit depth of 16. When i export the data, the export stops at about 2 GB. When I open the file with other software, the file only contains 1073 images. My first guess was that somehow one Bit is used to determine the sign, but I cannot figure out how to show that. Does anybody have a solution how to import and export TIFF files larger than 2 GB? Thanks in advance! **System specification**   * OS: Windows 7 Professional, Service Pack 1 (64-bit)    * Processor: Intel Xeon CPU E5630 @ 2.53 GHz (2 Processors)    * Installed memory: 96 GB   * Mathematica 9.0    * Java version 1.7.0_07 **Edit** Since I did not find any other solution, I tried reinstalling Mathematica 8 on my computer. Surprisingly, with Mma 8 it was no problem to export and import the testset. I am wondering why this is not possible with the new version. If you have any ideas, please let me know.
