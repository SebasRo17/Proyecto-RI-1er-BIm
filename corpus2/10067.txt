I need a function which can take an expression and return a pure function based on the symbols in the expression. The symbols might have values so must be protected from evaluation. It is probably easiest to give an example: I would like to evaluate something like               x = y = 1;     extractPureFunction[Sin[Pi x^2] + y]      and obtain               Function[{x, y}, Sin[Pi x^2] + y]      or               (Sin[Pi #1^2] + #2) &      Any ideas?
