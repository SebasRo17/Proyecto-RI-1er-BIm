I have a list named data that contains lists of arbitrary size,               data={{0.5, 0.5}, {}, {0.5, 0.5, 0.5}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}}      I now want to generate for each sub-list the appropriate number of sliders (for the empty sets none, ~~though I believe they are easy to skip~~ ). However, I am not sure if this is even possible. In my quest I stumbled upon this thread, Manipulate with a variable number of sliders, which allows me to generate sliders for one sub-list,               Dynamic[Grid[     Table[With[{i = i}, {Slider[Dynamic[data[[1]][[i]]]],       Dynamic[data[[1]][[i]]]}], {i, Length[data[[1]]]}]]]       This works perfectly fine if I use a constant as an index for `data`, in this case 1. However, if I want to extend this by using a for loop or a table to make that index variable, say               Table[Dynamic[Grid[     Table[With[{i = i}, {Slider[Dynamic[data[[k]][[i]]]],       Dynamic[data[[k]][[i]]]}], {i, Length[data[[k]]]}]]],{k,1,1}]      the `k` gets marked red and the code fails. Is it even possible to generate sliders this way? I imagine the reason that the code fails is that Dynamic requires the object under consideration to remain constant, but is there a way around this?
