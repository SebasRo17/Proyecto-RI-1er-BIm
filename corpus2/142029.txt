I've started working at a company that uses the Yii PHP framework. I'm mostly using Yii but also some frontend stuff like jQuery and Ajax. What I'm worried about is limiting my skill set to a framework that isn't very popular. I mean, if the company I worked for was using Ruby on Rails or even Django, I wouldn't have this feeling of concern for the future. My first question is then, in regards to being able to find a job in the future somewhere else, is my feeling of concern warranted? Secondly, I see a lot of PHP jobs out there but do you think experience using a PHP framework counts as valuable experience to a company that doesn't use that particular framework or any framework at all?
