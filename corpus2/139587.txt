The requirements are to take an existing list of identical tables (AAA0001 - AAA9999) which generally don't meed our current requirements and need to be swapped out with three tables (XXX0001-XXX999, YYY0001-YYY999 and ZZZ0001-ZZZ999). Currently, the guy who is programming this update which is supposed to take place on our clients machines who run both mysql and microsoft SQL Server is running select and insert queries which is bound to make the next update the slowest and most painful in the history of our product. I'd think we could so something faster by dumping the tables to a database, doing some string manipulation and undumping the database. However, we've never used any database connectors besides ODBC for our program and don't necessarily have the faculties to do both a mysql and a SQLServer dump (unless it's easy). So, what's the speediest way to dump and undump rows over ODBC? If there is no speedy way what's the safest and easiest to implement alternative? * * * We use Delphi XE2 Enterprise, if anyone has any 3rd party DB tools or knows any shortcuts. We've never used datasnap, as we didn't have the "good version" of Delphi until we updated to XE2, so I'm clueless as to whether it's got this functionality.
