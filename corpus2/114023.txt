I am creating a web application. I have primarily used Javascript specifically jQuery. Because of some very specific functionality, I am running into practical limitations of Javascript--they're not hard limitations but stuff that I would find easy in Java, like making an equation editor where you can edit directly as opposed to entering TeX, is difficult in JS even using MathJax as a base. I'm going to have to build even more complex functionality that involves 3D and physics engines. For a large scale application like this--specifically one that involves 3D and physics engines--would Java be slower or faster than Javascript when one is run within a browser? (Assume that code is written well in both cases.) Or is it completely uncertain--i.e. dependent on far too many specific variables? Thanks.
