In my ASP MVC application I decided to add another Business Layer and made the model only to have properties. All other functionality like save to db, get from db is done on this new Business layer. So now the controller will be calling this business layer and model for various operations. Is it a good approach to design like this? I decided not to use model for this purpose because I would need a number of models for different actions. (for eg, one for edit and other for create)
