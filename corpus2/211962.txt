I'm just wondering if anyone knows about some well designed .NET Open Source Applications using WPF? I have already tried to search at the usual sites like GitHub and Sourceforge, but I wasn't very satisfied by the results at all. Actually I'm interested in the right usage of MVVM, Data Binding etc. in the context of relatively large Software (at least more than the few lines of sample code, you will find at most Tutorials and Books). Also ORM with NHibernate lies in my main concern. Currently I also do have the overall impression WPF is not used very extensively at all, am I right with that? Which closed source (commercial) Software Products are out there, using it?
