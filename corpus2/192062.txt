I have developed a Java program for academic purposes (non-profit, non-open- source). In the process, I made extensive use of many apache common libraries. The program is now to be set free on the net, so I was wondering what my precautions should be. My program will (preferably) consist of a single .jar file, having all the apache commons .jar files living inside it (I didn't modify them in any way). Is the described approach just enough? Or do I have to take any more steps such that I don't commit an infraction? Thanks
