I've been running StyleCop over my code and one of the recommendations SA1122 is to use string.Empty rather than "" when assigning an empty string to a value. My question is why is this considered best practice. Or, is this considered best practice? I assume there is no compiler difference between the two statements so I can only think that it's a readability thing? UPDATE: Thanks for the answers but it's been kindly pointed out this question has been asked many times already on SO, which in hind-sight I should have considered and searched first before asking here. Some of these especially forward links makes for interesting reading. SO question and answer Jon Skeet answer to question
