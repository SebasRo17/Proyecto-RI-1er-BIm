xdomain = Table[i , {i, -10, 10, .1}];     ListPlot[InverseFourier[       Fourier[E^-#^2 & /@ xdomain]*E^#^2 & /@ xdomain]]      So I want to numerically fourier transform a function, multiply that fourier'd function by a second function, and then inverse fourier transform it. The code above doesn't work. I get a blank graph, I think, because it doesn't properly multiply the two vectors that I commanded to multiply. I'm not sure why I can't get {a,b,c}*{1,2,3} to multiply inside my fourier function, but I have tried putting evaluate functions in different spots inside to see if that would fix it.
