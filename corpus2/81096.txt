I am having someone develop a program for me and I want to sell it for like $10. I was wondering what's the best way to create a trial version that I can tell my programmer to do. Like 30 day trial. And what's one way I can make it so once they pay, I can send them a unlock code. What's done in the program to allow that? If you could give me an answer that I could tell my programmer, that would be much appreciated. Thanks!
