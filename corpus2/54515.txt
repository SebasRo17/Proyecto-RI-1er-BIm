I want to improve my code to make it working faster even for very large numbers.               fun[n_, a_, b_] := (       low = n^a;       low2 = n^b;       p = Table[Binomial[n, x]*StirlingS2[a, x]*x!/low, {x, 1, a}];       pp = Table[Binomial[n, x]*StirlingS2[b, x]*x!/low2, {x, 1, b}];       ListPlot[{p // N, pp // N}, some options]     )      I know that I should use as many built-in functions as I can, so I made it. And also I should not repeat the same thing many times. I want to run this function for values like for example $n = 1000000, a = 800000, b = 800000$. Is it possible to improve the speed of the program? And is it possible to evaluate the function for such huge numbers in a reasonable time (for example less than 2 hours)? Maybe is any way to make working on tables faster?
