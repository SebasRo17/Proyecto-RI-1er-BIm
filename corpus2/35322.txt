Apolgies if this has been asked and answered, but I'm not even sure what to search for. I have two functions defined as follows:               F[n_]:=Max[Select[Divisors[n],#<=Sqrt[n]&]];     P[n_] := Select[Range[1, 1000], F[#] == n &];      I have two questions:   1. I have read the _Mathematica_ help page on the `#` symbol, and I think I understand most of that. I do not, however, understand what `#` and `&` do in this specific context.   2. How can I write `P[n_ ]` using a single line of code? It doesn't work if I simply copy and paste the definition for F into the definition of P:              P[n_] := Select[ Range[1, 1000], Max[Select[Divisors[n],#<=Sqrt[n]&]] == n &]
