So here's the problem: I can evaluate the indefinite integral:               Integrate[D[u[x], x], x]      > >     u[x] >   However, I'd like to evaluate:               Integrate[D[u[x],x], {x, x0, x1}]      and get > >     u[x1] - u[x0] >   Or especially, evaluate               Integrate[D[u[x, y], x], {x, x0, x1}]      and get > >     u[x1, y] - u[x0, y] >   Is there a way that I can assume that `D[u[x], x]` is continuous in the range x0 to x1? Is there a some assumption that can be met in order for me to evaluate the fundamental theorem of calculus?
