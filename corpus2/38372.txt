I'm having trouble detecting when my InputForm supplied String variable has a value. After looking at: How to compute values only if input fields are filled? I tried a StringQ test:               Clear[foo]     foo[t_] := If [ StringQ[t], {t, "defined"}, {t, "undefined"} ]          DynamicModule[{symbol},      Column[{        Row[{"Text field:", InputField[Dynamic[symbol], String]}],        foo[ Dynamic[symbol] ]        } ]      ]      Before the field is supplied this gives me what I expected: ![before field keyed](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uVCHv.jpg) but after keying the field, I see that my test hasn't worked: ![after keying text](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Uyj05.jpg) Based on How can I make sure all InputFields have values before processing a nb form? I tried:               Clear[foo]     foo[t_] := If [ !Equal[t, ""], {t, "defined"}, {t, "undefined"} ]          DynamicModule[{symbol = ""},      Column[{        Row[{"Text field:", InputField[Dynamic[symbol], String]}],        foo[ Dynamic[symbol] ]        } ]      ]      but this produces a kind of odd unevaluated If block: ![other try](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SuUlW.jpg) I'm clearly doing something wrong with how I'm testing or using the input variable or form, but it's not obvious to me what that is?
