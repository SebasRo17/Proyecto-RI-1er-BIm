I need to figure out how to find the Normal and Tangent of acceleration. I know the formula for the tangent of acceleration is $((Acceleration . Velocity)/(Velocity.Velocity))*Velocity$ and the normal of acceleration is the same but with $Velocity$ replaced with the perpendicular of velocity. I think my errors arise because I am trying to manipulate parametric functions incorrectly. Any and all help would be appreciated. Anyways, here is my attempt:               Clear[t,x,y,z,P,velocity,acceleration,atan,tanvector];     x[t_] = 2 Sin[t];      y[t_] = 6 Sin[t/2]^2;     z[t_] = 3 Cos[t];     P[t_] = {x[t], y[t], z[t]};           curveplot = ParametricPlot3D[P[t],{t,1,6},PlotStyle->Thickness[0.01]];     velocity[t_] = {x'[t], y'[t], Z'[t]};     acceleration[t_] = {x''[t], y''[t], z''[t]};          atan[t_] = ((acceleration[t].velocity[t])/(velocity[t].velocity[t]))*velocity[t];     tanvector[t_]:= Vector[atan[t],Tail->P[t],VectorColor->Blue]          Show[curveplot,Table[tanvector[t],{t,1,6,(6-1)/10}],       PlotRange -> All, AxesLabel -> {"x","y","z"}]      This question is different from Finding unit tangent, normal, and binormal vectors for a given r(t) because I am asking for the tangent and normal of acceleration using the equation : $((Acceleration . Velocity)/(Velocity.Velocity))*Velocity$ I am missing an undertanding of how to manipulate paramteric plots.
