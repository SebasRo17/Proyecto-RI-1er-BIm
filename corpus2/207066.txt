I have rather specific question about licensing but first of all I would just like to state that I already read a lot of Q&A's here but I'm still not sure about the problem in that particular scope. As I've understand from other Q&A's, you are allowed to distribute your commercial application even with LGPL library as long as this library can be replaced by another version of it by user himself. That means that you pack it as .dll or whatever. The rest of the application remains proprietary licensed. This is clear at all for compiled software. But my question is: how this relate to software which is not compiled (which is distributed as source code but still proprietary) like all PHP applications? To be really clear I will show you exact example. I'm building a CMS applications for various purposes. All of them are different but most of them share the same "basic element" - JavaScript WYSIWYG editor. I would like to use one which is GPL/LGPL/MPL licensed. So there are several questions:   * Can I use this LGPL editor at all so that rest of my application remains proprietary?   * What I have to do to be able to do that?   * Are there any special "ways of distributing" the library like separated ZIP archive or something like that? As for non-native English speaker it's really hard for me to read the licenses in their original form. I just don't want to get in any trouble.
