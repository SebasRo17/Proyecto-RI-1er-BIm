I am implementing a UI application using the MVVM design-pattern. The thing is, sometimes when you detect that something is wrong with data that was inputted by the user, you'd like to notify him somehow. The solution I used so far was to have a "messaging framework" which allows me to basically show messages in a `ListView` I integrate within the window. However, sometimes the windows get a bit "overloaded" with graphical elements, and I would like to be able to show the messages in a message box (basically a modal window). As the `ViewModel` is not supposed to be aware of anything about the UI, I cannot instantiate any window "explicitly". Ideally, this modal window would also use the MVVM pattern and hence I would implement a `ViewModel` for that window, which would be instantiated within the "main" windows's `ViewModel`, and passed to the modal window through the `DataContext`. I would like to have a "simple" example of how to do such thing? Or should this approach be banned from an MVVM application? **EDIT** : Would the use of the Unity Framework be something you recommend?
