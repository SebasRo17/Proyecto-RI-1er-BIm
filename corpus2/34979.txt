I have recurrence and I need to calculate first $N$ members of the sequence               ClearAll[aa];     l=3;     aa[n_, l_] := If[n <= l,         Quotient[n, l],        (l + 2 (n - l) aa[n - l, l] + (n - l) (n - 1) aa[n - 1, l])/(n*(n + 1 - l))     ]          Table[aa[i, l], {i, 0, 30}] // AbsoluteTiming      I guess it is stupid to use `Table` since its recalculate some of the members several times. How I can output all members in one pass? Can I use `RecurrenceTable` in this case and is it the quickest way to do it?
