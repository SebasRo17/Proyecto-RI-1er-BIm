I'm trying to follow the single responsibility principle (SRP) in my applications. I have lots of CRUD classes I just name xxxxxManager. Following the SRP, I made 4 classes for each one : xxxxxCreator, xxxxxGetter, xxxxxDeleter, xxxxxUpdater They end up having only one static method : xxxxxCreator::create(Model $model), xxxxUpdater::update(Model $model), etc. This is a code smell for me. Am I pushing the SRP too far ?
