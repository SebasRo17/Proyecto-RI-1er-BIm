We have a dispute regarding who owns which tasks when it comes to the CSS on our live site. Our designer argues that he is not responsible to log-in to word press and modify the css or use ftp for any changes because that's not his job description while developer argues that since it is css, it belongs to designer and that he is to update the changes to the server and then compare and correct the output. I'd like experienced people working in professional development environment to put a light on this scenario. I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this question, or is there a separate forum for business development or project management specific questions?
