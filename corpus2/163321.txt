I know an example of the first thing that causes a function or expression to have side effects - **modifying a state** Function and Expression **modifying a state** : 1.)               foo(int X)     {     return x = x % x;     }          a = a + 1;      What does 2.) - **Has an observable interaction with calling functions or the outside world," mean?** \- Please give an example. The article continues on to say, "For example, a function might modify a global or static variable, modify one of its arguments, raise an exception, write data to a display or file, read data, or call other side-effecting functions...." Are all these examples, examples of 1.) - **Modifiying some state** , or are they also part of 2.) - **Has an observable interaction with calling functions or the outside world?**
