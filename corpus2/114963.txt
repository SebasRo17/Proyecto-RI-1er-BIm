I found older questions but I was wondering if newer, better books/guides have been published in the last two years. I am interviewing for a technology analyst position in finance and I expect to have a lot of technical questions based on running time/data structures etc. This is for an entry-level position so I have not had previous experience programming for work, only experience through my coursework.
