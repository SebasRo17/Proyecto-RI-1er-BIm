I'm developing a CMS, inside it I use many various plugins/addons wich licenses mostly like MIT, GNU, GPL (such as jQuery, nivoSlider, DataTables and so on..). After reading those licenses I believe I can use them inside my CMS and charge users for my CMS. In my project I have a specific folder where I store all these plugins with their license and all notices. Is this the correct way? Or should I somewhere on my site notice the all plugins Im using with the path where they can be found in my project folder? What about if I would use my CMS as SaaS? The end users would not have the access to source files so I would not exactly be distributing it. Is it posible? And lastly, can I protect my own source files with the license? Wouldnt it collide with the other ones? I would like to protect it as much as I can at least in a legal way as I cannot really protect it as all PHP files are easy accessible. Thank you for any help. Also note that I have read a lot about license, but these are things I would like to confirm or to see if I misunderstood something.
