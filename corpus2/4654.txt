I'm tired of how luggish my developments PC is. It's Core2 Duo, 2GB RAM, Seagate ST3500320AS HDD - not the top model, but quite a decent one. Typically I open several copies of Visual Studio 2008, lots of tabs in Firefox, Outlook, MSDN, plus the programs I debug are quite huge, plus whatever Windows thinks it can't live without so I end up with Task Manager showing something like 2,5 GB pagefile usage. All the software above becomes luggish to such extent that it's really annoying. Something like I click on a menubar in Visual Studio - and instead of just opening the menu it works the harddisk for say 10 seconds. I'd like to have some magic "don't make me think" solution - so that it is installed once and then the lugs disappear or at least decrease significantly. It should not be very expensive - something like the current price of a hybrid drive. Will a hybrid drive magically help overcome my problem once and for all? Do you have experience using hybrid drives for similar purposes?
