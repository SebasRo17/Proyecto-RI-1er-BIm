In Mathematica 9 a new flavor of `Root` object with multiple polynomials was introduced. For example,               Root[{327680000000000000 - 1280000000 #1^8 + #1^16 &, #1 + 25 #2 + 25 #2^5 &}, {7, 3}]      I've read the documentation several times, but still do not have a clear understanding of what these expressions mean, or what advantage they have over the older syntax with a single polynomial. Any advice or explanation are welcome.
