Just thinking out aloud - we programmers love all this voting/badges/rep stuff so could a scheme like this be introduced into a companies code review process to encourage better coding. Something like   * You (or others on your behalf) can post a review (could be snippet, single commit or series of) for a code review   * Others can comment on it (would be similar to answers in SE)   * Badges can be given/suggested (some would be good, some would be bad like "Comment Desert" or some such)   * You can vote up/down on the code itself and the comments and badges (e.g. if someone suggested a badge and you did/didn't agree) The aim of a scheme like this would be   * Introduce a bit of fun to encourage the use of code reviews   * Improve quality (in this scheme both code reviewee and reviewers are likely to learn)   * Reduce the chance of code reviews sparking 'ego wars'   * Give some metrics to _help_ measure individual performance Could this work? Thoughts?
