I'll use C# as an example, but it should apply globally. Say I have a string value that should be one of a few constants, but I also want the client to set which string value to use so:               private int foo;     private string bar;          public int Foo {         get { return foo; }         set         {             foo = value;             bar = getStringValueFromDatabase(value);         }     }          public string Bar { get { return bar; } }      I use this technique quite a lot and want to know if it's considered as any formal concept.
