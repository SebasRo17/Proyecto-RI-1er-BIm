I have a notebook(.nb) which its calculation is time-consuming and long. I can not observe it if the calculation is done or not. Therefore, I want to : (1) Save the results in the notebook(.nb) ( I do not want to save the data in a .Xls,.CSV,... file) and then (2) Use a command in that notebook(.n) to shut down the computer from _Mathematica_ when the calculation and saving the data is done. I wonder if you could possibly help me with this problem. P.S: I have already searched the documentation and found `NotebookSave[]` command, but I'm not sure if it is a proper command to save the notebook. However, I couldn't find anything relate to shuting down the computer after calculation.
