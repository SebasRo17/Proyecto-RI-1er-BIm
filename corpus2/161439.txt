I am a dot net developer, with over 7 years experience in VB, Vb.net, C# and Asp.net. Would it be worthwhile to learn VBA/VSTO? Would it be adding value to my career? Would there be any companies hiring a person who knows both VBA and Dot net? I heard that VBA would be used mostly used in finance industry and it won't pay much. Is it true?
