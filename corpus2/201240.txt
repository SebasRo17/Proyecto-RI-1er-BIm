First of all this is not a comparison between the languages. So I've asked a question before telling that I am a beginner programmer (hardest thing done is a chat server/client when I was reading about threads, and I've used twitter api, which is somehow very easy.). My goal is to become a better programmer and understand more things since I'm only 14 years old. I read that learning c++ will make me understand more things in programming, and help me in future becoming a better programmer but, I think, at the moment, that I'm improving in c#, creating more programs and enjoying... do you think I should continue and become better in c# and java and forget learning c++ till I go to the university and I will be forced to learn c++? Personally I think I'm wasting time in c++ focusing more on theoretical things rather than programming itself.
