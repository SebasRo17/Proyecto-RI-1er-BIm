I need a programming language for text editing and processing (replace, formatting, regular expressions, string comparison, word processing, text analysis, etc.). Which programming language is more powerful and has more functions for this purpose? Since I work PHP for my web projects, I currently use PHP, but the fact is that PHP is a scripting language for web applications; my current project is offline. I am curious if other programming languages such as Perl, Python, C, C++, Java, etc. have more functionality for this purpose, and worth of shifting the project?
