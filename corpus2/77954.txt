After reading Jeff Atwood's article "Working with the Chaos Monkey" and considering the implications of "Fallacies of Distributed Computing" it made me wonder if the first task of developers creating a cloud-based application should be to create a Chaos Monkey. Actually, given that even an entire data center can be lost within a cloud, the Chaos Gorilla may also be necessary to simulate a major outage. Netflix certainly seem to believe so but I was wondering if their conclusions were shared by others here. So, as the title says, when embarking on a cloud computing project should a Chaos Monkey be the first application?
