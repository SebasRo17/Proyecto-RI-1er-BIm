I have an expression in the form of $\tt \frac{Sin[x]}{x}$ that I would like to simplify to the form of `Sinc[x]`. I've tried the `Simplify`, `FullSimplify` and `TrigReduce`, but none of them work.               Simplify[Sin[x]/x]     FullSimplify[Sin[x]/x]     TrigReduce[Sin[x]/x]      all gives the result $\tt\frac{Sin[x]}{x}$. However               FullSimplify[Sin[x]/x == Sinc[x]]      gives `True`. I have two questions:   1. Is there a way to tell MMA that I prefer `Sinc[x]` than `Sin[x]/x`, so that it can simplify $\sin(x)/x$ to $\mathrm{sinc}(x)$?   2. How doees `TransformationFunctions` and `ComplexityFunction` work in `Simplify`? Could you give some examples and explanations of how to use them to control the form of the outcome expression? Can I use them to let _Mathematica_ apply my own defined simplify rules (for example in this case `Sin[x]/x -> Sinc[x]`)? I found their documents are difficult to understand for me. Thanks. * * * _**update**_ `FullSimplify[Sin[x]/x,ComplexityFunction->Composition[StringLength,ToString,InputForm]]` also doesn't work. However,               Composition[StringLength,ToString,InputForm][Sin[x]/x]      gives 8 which is larger than               Composition[StringLength,ToString,InputForm][Sinc[x]]      which gives 7.
