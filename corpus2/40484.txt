I would like to know whether there is any general approach to obtain the most compact form of an equation with Mathematica. I used to believe that the `FullSimplify` command would do that for me, but I recently found out that it will not necessarily give the most compact form. I found out with the following equation, which has been FullSimplified: $$\left[\sec (\alpha ) \left(\coth \left(L \sqrt{\text{Bo} \cos (\alpha )}\right)+\text{csch}\left(L \sqrt{\text{Bo} \cos (\alpha )}\right) (\text{Bo} L R \sin (\alpha )-1)-R \sin (\alpha ) \sqrt{\text{Bo} \sec (\alpha )}\right)\right]\left(R \sqrt{\text{Bo} \sec (\alpha )}\right)^{-1}$$ Or, in inputform for your convenience:               eq1 = (Sec[α] (Coth[L Sqrt[Bo Cos[α]]] - R Sqrt[Bo Sec[α]] Sin[α] +            Csch[L Sqrt[Bo Cos[α]]] (-1 + Bo L R Sin[α])))/(R Sqrt[Bo Sec[α]])      However, if I now run the following:               Collect[eq1,Bo] //FullSimplify      I get a much more compact form, namely: $$ -\tan (\alpha )+L \sin (\alpha ) \sqrt{\text{Bo} \sec (\alpha )} \text{csch}\left(L \sqrt{\text{Bo} \cos (\alpha )}\right)+\frac{\tanh \left(\frac{1}{2} L \sqrt{\text{Bo} \cos (\alpha )}\right)}{R \sqrt{\text{Bo} \cos (\alpha )}}$$ Can someone explain why I get a more compact solution when I first collect the equation for a certain parameter and then run `FullSimplify` and whether there is a general 'recipe' to get the most compact form of an equation? P.S. sorry for the long equation, but it seems that most of the smaller equations do not have this behaviour which makes sort of intuitive sense
