It seems we'll never have built in two axis plots and list plots in Mathematica but you can make them in R.               Needs["RLink`"]     InstallR[];     REvaluate["{      x <- 1:5      y1 <- rnorm(5)      y2 <- rnorm(5,20)      par(mar=c(5,4,4,5)+.1)      plot(x,y1,type=\"l\",col=\"red\")      par(new=TRUE)      plot(x,y2,,type=\"l\",col=\"blue\",xaxt=\"n\",yaxt=\"n\",xlab=\"\",\ ylab=\"\")      axis(4)      mtext(\"y2\",side=4,line=3)      legend(\"topleft\",col=c(\"red\",\"blue\"),lty=1,legend=c(\"y1\",\"\     y2\"))}"]      Which returns this plot in a popup window: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SGj64.png) How can I get the plot that is generated from this code to appear in an `Output` cell?
