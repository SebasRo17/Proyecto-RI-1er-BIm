Can someone help decipher what is the meaning of this computation that _Mathematica_ has done?               Assuming[Re[x] >= 0 && a ∈ Reals,       Reduce [1 / ((x Tanh[π x]) / (x^2 +  a^2)) == 0, x, Complexes]]          (*       (C[1] ∈ Integers && x != 0 && (x == (-((I π)/2) + 2 I π C[1])/π ||           x == ((I π)/2 + 2 I π C[1])/π)) || (Sin[a π] != 0 && a != 0 && (x == -I a || x == I a))     *)      * * * My understanding is that the $\frac{x\;tanh (\pi\,x) } {x^2 + a^2 }$ blows up where $tanh(\pi\,x)= \infty $ and where $x^2 +a^2 = 0$. And these happen respectively at $x = i(\mathbb{Z} + 0.5)$ and $x = \pm i \vert a \vert$. But why is _Mathematica_ detecting a totally different set of imaginary zeroes for the reciprocal of the function than the first set of poles that I can see in the above?
