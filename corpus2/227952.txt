I'm a programing student. I've been having problem to organize Java classes that use inheritance and static final variables. Let say I have an abstract class named Form that has two children named Rectangle and Triangle. Those two children have a final static variable named NumberOfSides. Both children classes need identical getters for that variable.... Would it be possible to write that getter in the "mother" class? Thanks for your help.
