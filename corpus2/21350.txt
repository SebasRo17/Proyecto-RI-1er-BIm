I want to create a bar chart from two different data sets.               data = {{38, 4.637, 88.3238, 2.26935}, {277, 75.724, 1442.36, 5.07813}, {561, 72.623, 1383.3, 2.39955}, {253, 32.727, 623.371, 2.39955}, {1305, 181.438, 3455.96, 2.58557}}      and               data = {{27, 93.14, 1816.67, 67.2842}, {92, 248.898, 4854.7, 52.7685}, {510, 1681.48, 32796.8, 64.3075}, {234, 933.986, 18217.2, 77.8512}, {443, 4117.78, 80316.2, 181.301}}      These two charts have to have the same range on the y axis (0, 100000), so they can be compared easily. So I can still see the bars for the lower values, I set the ScalingFunctions to "Log". I plot them both with this code:               plot1 = BarChart[data, PlotRange -> {0, 12}, ScalingFunctions -> "Log"]      However, when I create the first plot, the bars don't start at the y-axis, but below, whereas the second data set has the bars start at 10, not at 0. I am using Mathematica 8. If I use PlotRange-> {Automatic, 12}, then I don't have the problem of the bars being off the x axis, however they still start at different values (0 and 10).
