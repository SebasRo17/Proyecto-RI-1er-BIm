I find that even when working with a MVC framework (e.g. CodeIgniter), I regularly resort to passing nested arrays rather than objects. This doesn't follow my understanding of object-oriented well. For example, if I were to port the code to Java then I wouldn't dream of passing arrays (or Vectors, or whatever) around like that. I was wondering if this is the appropriate way to handle data. Is there a reason why arrays are passed around like this in PHP, or why objects aren't used? What's the best way to pass data around?
