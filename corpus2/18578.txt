Getting a Project Management Professional (PMP) certification can be rigorous. Did you attempt it? How was your preparation process? Was there any hiccups filling out PMP project experience details? Currently, I am going thru PMbok guide. Looks like full of theory to me!! And I have read it at least twice !!
