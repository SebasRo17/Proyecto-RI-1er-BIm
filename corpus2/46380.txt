I am currently doing a signal analysis and filtering using Matlab. The filter I am using is Butterworthfilter model to filter scattered data (vector data). I am using Matlab as follows:               function [y]=fButterworthfilter(input_data,f_cut)     rng default;     [b,a] = butter(8,f_cut/(200/2));     y=filtfilt(b,a,input_data); % zero-phase filtering      I want to see how can I do the Butterworthfilter filtering using Mathematica. I tried ButterworthFilterModel in the help but the input is a function not a vector data. Let us say I have the following noisy data:               data1 = Table[Exp[-i^2], {i, -5, 5, .01}];     noise = RandomReal /@ RandomReal[{-0.3, 1}, Length[data]];     data2 = data1+noise;      How can I do Butterworthfilter filtering for this data? Thanks
