I am trying to solve a system of equation which seems to be simple but much as I tried I couldn't solve it in _Mathematica_ and it says the coefficients need to be exact. Now, I was wondering if someone walk me through the step by step procedure of solving such equations. I have a variable, `phi`, which is a function of `P`. `P` is a real number and `0 < P < 1`.               phi = 45 beta^P;       where `beta` is a constant. Now the system of equations:               x^(-1/2) y^(-P) - x^(-1/2) y^P phi^2 = 3 phi     2 x y^(-P) - x y^(1 - P) = 4/phi
