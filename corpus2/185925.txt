I am a Software developer who works on J2SE (core java).   Often during our code reviews we are asked to reduce the number of lines in our code. It's not about removing redundant code, it's about following a style that focuses on doing the same things with fewer lines in the code, while I believe in having clarity in code even if it means increasing the number of lines. What do you think is the right way of doing things?   If LOC (lines of code) is a small number, how does it affect the code? If LOC is a larger number, how does it affect the code? example from the website : "javaranch" -               public static void happyBirthday(int age)     {               if ((age == 16) || (age == 21) || ((age > 21) && (((age % 10) == 0) || ((age % 25) == 0))))                 {                  System.out.println("Super special party, this year!");         }         else         {             System.out.println("One year older. Again.");         }     }      VS               public static void happyBirthday(int age)     {              boolean sweet_sixteen = (age == 16);         boolean majority = (age == 21);         boolean adult = (age > 21);         boolean decade = (age % 10) == 0;         boolean quarter = (age % 25) == 0;              if (sweet_sixteen || majority || (adult && (decade || quarter)))         {             System.out.println("Super special party, this year!");         }         else         {             System.out.println("One year older. Again.");         }     }
