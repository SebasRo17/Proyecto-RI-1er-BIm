Since `PolarPlot` doesn't support `Filling`, what is the best way to shade or fill the a region between two polar curves? For instance, how would I generate a version of the following graph with the region inside the first curve but outside the second curve filled?               PolarPlot[{{1, -1} Sqrt[2 Cos[t]], 2 (1 - Cos[t])}, {t, -\[Pi], \[Pi]}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/C7rJB.png)
