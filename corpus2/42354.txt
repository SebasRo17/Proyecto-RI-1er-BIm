I'm making a program where i need to plot the soluton of an ODE and ,if possible, obtain the analytical solution. My idea was to use DSolve, check the output, and if it failed use NDsolve. Now, i know i can set a time limit using `TimeConstrained[]` , but how do i check when DSolve instantly return the input because the alculation is too complex or there is no analytical solution? sorry if this was answered elsewere, i tried to search but i couldn't find anything related.
