One major problem in my attempt to answer to the CountryData flags question is that the way Mathematica handles filled curves differs from the way SVG and EPS style editors do. The latter two have the option to apply either of two rules, the non-zero rule or the even-odd rule, with the non-zero rule being default. The Windows .NET Framework 4.5 knows both rules too. Mathematica's`FilledCurve` doc page says: > Filled curves can be non-convex and intersect themselves. Self-intersecting > curves are filled according to an even-odd rule that alternates between > filling and not at each crossing. Unfortunately, since `Import` translates filled curve as a `FilledCurve` with this even-odd rule one gets a star that was efficiently coded in SVG with five points as follows:               Graphics[{Thickness[0.001388888888888889],            {FaceForm[{Blue, Opacity[1.]}],             FilledCurve[{{{0, 2, 0}, {0, 1, 0}, {0, 1, 0}, {0, 1, 0}}},                {{{366.902, 230.137}, {258.902,265.33599999999996},                  {326.105, 173.336}, {326.105,286.93799999999993},                  {258.902, 194.93800000000002}}}            ]}},             AspectRatio -> Automatic]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/of7eu.png) (BTW: I would consider this behavior of `Import` a bug, as it doesn't respect the original's default setting.) Getting a star, filled as desired, takes twice as much points:               Graphics[{FaceForm[Blue],        Polygon@{{427.3, 183.3}, {401.5, 218.4}, {360.2, 204.8}, {385.7,           240}, {360, 275.2}, {401.5, 261.8}, {427.3, 296.6}, {427.2,           253.5}, {468.1, 240}, {427.2, 226.6}}}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gyZZi.png) (and, of course, `Import` doesn't do this automatically.) > My question is: Is there a way to let `FilledCurve` behave according to a > non-zero rule, for instance using some undocumented properties like > discussed here and here?
