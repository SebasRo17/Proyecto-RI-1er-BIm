Java omits multiple inheritance on the grounds that it obviates the design goal of keeping the language simple. I wonder if Java (with its eco-system) is really "simple". Python is not complex and has multiple inheritance. So without being too subjective, my question is... **_What are the typical problem patterns that benefit from a code designed to make heavy use of multiple inheritance_**
