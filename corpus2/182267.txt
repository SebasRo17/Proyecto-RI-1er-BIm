For a project I'll be doing in school soon I will be working with 6 other people. We will probably be using YouTrack to track our bugs and we can obviously see the value in this system. My question, however, is whether a bug should always be entered in the bug tracking system. In our case, some people will be front-end developers, others will be back-end developers but the complexity of the project will not be of such a high level that back-end developers wouldn't know how to solve a front end bug. By this I don't mean that they will actually solve it but because they (think) they know it's an easy fix, what's stopping them from just letting one of the front-end developers know about the bug by telling him across the table. The main reasons I can come up with are these:   * The bug might at first seem very easy to fix but actually uncover a far larger problem (at this point in time presumably it would be entered, but by the frond-end developer.   * You might take someone of out of the "zone" by just casually mentioning they have a bug somewhere, which might be solved in 10 seconds but then requires them 15 minutes to get back in the zone. On the other hand it does seem silly that you'd have to enter a bug which **could** be fixed in 2 minutes, especially if the part you're working on at the time needs that bug to be fixed. I understand this is probably a bit subjective, but I also feel that other people could give very good reasons for doing it one way or the other which is what I would like to hear.
