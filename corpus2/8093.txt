Can someone explain to me why the following does not simplify to `True` (as all constituents are positive)?               FullSimplify[a+b/(c+(d-e)^2)>0,Assumptions->And@@Thread[{a,b,c,d,e}>0]]      Most special cases including `e=0` or `a=b`,... do simplify correctly. What I eventually want to do is to simplify expressions of the kind               Abs[a+b/(c+(d-e)^2)],      which should evaluate to `a+b/(c+(d-e)^2)` under given assumptions. Any workarounds? **Edit**   What I ended up doing for larger expressions was this:               expr[Abs[a+b/(c+(d-e)^2)]]/.Abs[x_]/;Simplify@Reduce[$Assumptions&&x>0]:>x      It's not particularly pretty, but it works. Thanks to ssch for the idea!
