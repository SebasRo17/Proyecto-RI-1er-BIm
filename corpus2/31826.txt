I'm trying to write a notebook from the kernel, so using one list of elements in one document, I'd like to create a second document with some interactions between the elements of the list. For that, I'm already trying to write on a separate document, which works with                NotebookWrite[ newDoc, Cell[ "2+3", "Input"]]      Now, this works fine, but I'm trying to get this string "2+3" computed in the new notebook. Nor using ToExpression, Evaluate seems to be working. Any help for this? Also: is there a good book explaining these different concepts of how the Kernel works? I'm reading the online documentation, but sometimes, I'd like to have a more "book"-approach, if possible. What would you recommend? Thanks all, once again!
