I am trying to export a set of data into a file but I can not force mathematica to keep a certain width for each column. For example, when I export a table:               table={{10,2},{3,40}};     Export["file.dat",table, "Table", "FieldSeparators"->" ", Alignment->Right]      The result is:               10  2      2 40      Mathematica automatically determines column width such that the number with largest number of digits fits in. How can I export data with arbitrary space in each column to get:                10    2       2   40      such that `"FieldSeparators"->" "` is still the same but first column has space for three digits and the second one has space for 4 digits?
