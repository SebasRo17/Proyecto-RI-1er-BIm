I have the following output $\text{Li}_2\left(3-2 \sqrt{2}\right)-4 \text{Li}_2\left(-1+\sqrt{2}\right)$. This turns out to be equivalent to $\displaystyle\log^2(1+\sqrt{2})-\frac{\pi^2}{4}$. How can I get mathematica to simplify the first result to the second? I have other (more complicated) results like this that I need to simplify. `FullSimplify` and `Simplify` don't do anything, it just throws the same thing that I put in back at me...               FullSimplify[PolyLog[2, 3 - 2 Sqrt[2]] - 4 PolyLog[2, -1 + Sqrt[2]]]          Log[1+2^(1/2)]^2-Pi^2/4
