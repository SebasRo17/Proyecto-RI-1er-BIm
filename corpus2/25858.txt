I am sure I am not the only one who gets frustrated when they see a page of code littered with SQL queries. The ActiveRecord and other ORM patterns help mitigate a good amount of SQL used in a project, but in many cases of complex queries, the use of SQL is seemingly unavoidable. I am looking for opinions on how SQL queries should be organized with the rest of the code (or externally to it) to keep it from being scattered all over the place? One obvious idea is the use of Views, but often Views can be a source of performance issues when dealing with multiple large indexed tables, etc. **EDIT 1 - I am assuming you've already got it separated into the model layer**
