This may be a rather strange question. I will try to create a sort of minimal working example. Suppose that I have two lists, `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are ragged, and they both have multiple levels. However, `list1` and `list2` have the same number of elements, and their level distributions/arrangements are the same. For example:               list1 = {{{a, b, c}, {d, e, f, g, h}, {i, j}}, {{AA, BB}, {CC, DD, EE}}};     list2 = {{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, {9, 10}}, {{11, 12}, {13, 14, 15}}};      I would like to "thread" or "transpose" `list1` and `list2` to obtain `list3`, which has the same basic structure but with corresponding elements paired:               list3 =      {{{{a, 1}, {b, 2}, {c, 3}}, {{d, 4}, {e, 5}, {f, 6}, {g, 7}, {h, 8}}, {{i, 9}, {j, 10}}},         {{{AA, 11}, {BB, 12}}, {{CC, 13}, {DD, 14}, {EE, 15}}}}      Is there a relatively simple way to obtain `list3` from `list1` and `list2`, apart from using a complicated nesting of `Table` commands? `Transpose`, `Thread`, and `MapThread` all seem potentially useful, but not entirely straightforward for such "deep," ragged lists. Do you have any suggestions? Thanks for your time.
