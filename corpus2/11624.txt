I need to hire a web designer. How do I test his creativity and skills before I hire him. Ideally I'd like to give him a fairly open-ended task i.e. I give him a problem statement and ask him to design a PSD file. Any suggestions on the problem statement I might give him? Also, is there a better way to hire /test a web designer?
