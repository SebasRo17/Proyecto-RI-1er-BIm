I attempted to evaluate the following               Plot[x^2, {x, 1, 2}, PlotStyle -> {RGBColor[a]}]      which, of course, failed. After the failure, putting my mouse over the graphics produced > RGBColor called with 1 argument; 3 or 4 arguments are expected. As far as I'm concerned, _Mathematica_ messages are in the syntax of `Symbol::Tag : Message`, yet these don't follow that format. I can also add the message to the Messages window by clicking on the red [+] at the top-right of the graphics cell. So what does _Mathematica_ call these messages and how are they generated?
