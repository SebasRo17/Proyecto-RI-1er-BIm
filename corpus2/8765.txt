I work with histograms and would like to export it to EPS format. I've noticed that my exported image loses the PlotRangeClipping option that I set up when I export the plot. This is true for at least EPS, PNG and PDF. Based on this question and its accepted answer, I defined the function               OutlinedExport[name_,gr_,opts:OptionsPattern[]]:=     Export[         name,         First@ImportString[             ExportString[                 gr,                 "PDF"             ],             "PDF",             "TextOutlines"->True         ],         FilterRules[             {opts},             Options[Export]         ]     ]      Now here is an example of histogram               data = Table[InverseCDF[NormalDistribution[0, 1], Random[]], {i, 1000}];     PlotB = Histogram[data, 20,         PlotRange -> {{-2, 2}, Automatic},         Frame->True]     OutlinedExport["output2.pdf", PlotB, ImageSize -> 600]      which appears to have lost the clipping during the export. ### The questions are :   * Is there a way to preserve clipping as defined through options like PlotRangeClipping and PlotRangePadding ?    * If the problem is related with the OutlinedExport, is there a way to answer my question while also keeping the outline of fonts (which I need but have here removed for the sake of example) ?
