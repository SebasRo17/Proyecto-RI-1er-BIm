Continuing with the same question I have posted earlier I would like to find the equation of the stable fixed point curve using my graph, i.e. from the curve somehow find the equation for $x=f(x)$. I have been trying using Solve but I keep getting errors. I would also like to find the value of $a$ where bifurcation begins, i.e. it becomes unstable. It looks like about $-1.5$.               f[c_][x_] := x^2 + c;          [c_] := Take[NestList[f[c], 0., 1500], -1]     plotdata = Table[Flatten[{i, d[i]}], {i, -2, 0.1, 0.0011}];     ListPlot[plotdata, PlotRange -> All, Frame -> True, Axes -> True]
