I like the way planning poker works at the beginning of any project, letting you compare and discuss details of each story with one another. One of the issues I've noticed with this is that through time and as you gain more experience with the problem domain, you tend to vote less points for each story, i. e., a story that was worth a 5 or an 8 at the beginning of the project might now be worth a 3. How do you avoid or tackle this problem in the best possible way? Is there a better way to estimate? Should the stories always remain the same, or is this story points decrease ok?
