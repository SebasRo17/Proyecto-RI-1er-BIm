Other than being annoyed at whitespace as syntax, I'm not a hater, I just don't get the fascination with Python. I appreciate the poetry of Perl, and have programmed beautiful web services in bash & korn, and shebang `gnuplot`. I write documents in `troff` and don't mind REXX. Didn't find tcl any more useful years ago, but **what's the big stink about Python**? I see job listings and many candidates with this as a prize & trophy on their resumes. * * * I guess in reality, I'm trying to personally become sold on this, I just can't find a reason.
