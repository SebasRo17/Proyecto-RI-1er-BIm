I'm trying to display the output response of a transfer function in Mathematica with and without a compensator. The problem is very strange: while the transfer function compensate is showing well, the other is not. The plot seems incomplete and no matter what `PlotRange` I set, the graph always stays incomplete at the same point. Here is a screenshot: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/w43qV.png) Anybody have an idea of what is wrong? I'm pretty sure the math itself is okay, because I get the second transfer function from the first. But when I want to compare the two responses graph, the first always stays incomplete.
