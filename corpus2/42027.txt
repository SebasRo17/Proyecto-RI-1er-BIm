In the documentation about BandstopFilter it says that the cutoff-frequencies `w1` and `w2` in `BandstopFilter[data,{w1,w2}]` should be values between 0 and Pi. I am certain that this is helpful information for someone more knowledgeable than me, but I cannot figure out how to apply it to my specific problem. I have time-series data acquired at fixed sampling rate (1 kHz) of a certain duration (let's say 20.000 data points). The data is contaminated with 50Hz line noise. How do I properly set up `w1`and `w2`, as a function of the sampling rate and the length of the data, to properly reduce the 50Hz contamination? Incidentally, it would be nice to have an appropriate example in the documentation.
