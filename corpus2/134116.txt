I have an issue with `Roles.IsUserInRole` function. It take hell amount of time to just check if the logged-in user is in particular role(typ 3-9 sec). I searched to find a solution and arrived on this but I am not sure If I have fully grasped it. What I got from the above, A new derived class is created. Inside that class, there is a list which retrieves all user at once. The next time you check `IsUserInRole`, you do not use the actual IsUserInRole method but rather use the one you overrode in your class. Is this the correct description? Am I on track? **My question is, can data be share between two different users in ASP.NET application?** If yes, will the shared data exist only if there is at least one user logged in. If all users logs out, that shared data is destroyed? My point is this data will be created only one time whenever a user logs in. For all subsequent users they can use this data and check their roles against the list? I need a detailed answer. My application has users and different roles. We are using ASP.NET roles.
