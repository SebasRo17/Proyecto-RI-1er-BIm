I have developed and deployed few ASP.NET applications. Sometimes I want to stop the users from either inserting or updating a record when:   1. Maintenance is going on.   2. Stop operations due to payment delay. In one of my recent application I have implemented this feature to first check the database operations for locked status. If any of the above condition fulfils, database operations like insert and update are not carried out. I now need this feature in all the old applications and the future applications I build. I want to know whether WCF is suitable in this scenario as I want to share methods or an independent locking application among various other applications. Is WCF appropriate for this type of scenario?
