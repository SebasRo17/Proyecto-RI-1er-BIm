Recently John Resig (creator of the jQuery library) wrote on his twitter that "When it comes to hiring, I'll take a Github commit log over a resume any day.". As much as I respect that (motivating developers to give back to the community), it also puzzles me, as not all of us have the opportunity to do so, for a number of reasons (family, employer agreements, etc). How would you make a case for the non-contributor developer? Do you think that developers that do not contribute to open-source software are doomed from certain kinds of organizations?
