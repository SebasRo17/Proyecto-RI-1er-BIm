I would like to use many global assumptions. Say I have two global assumptions.               $Assumptions = 0 < a < 1          $Assumptions = 0 < b < 1      Then I would like to print `Yes` if `a b > 1` holds and print `No` otherwise. For this I have               Refine[If[a*b > 1, Print[Yes], Print[No]], $Assumptions]      My result is just a repetition of `If` term as follows:               If[a q > 1, Print[Yes], Print[No]]      Can anyone help?
