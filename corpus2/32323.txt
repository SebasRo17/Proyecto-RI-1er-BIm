I'm back with the labels and tags questions! Here is my code:               mb = CreateDocument[Null, ShowCellTags -> True];      In the new document, I create a new cell, add some random code, and select the bracket of the cell. When I then process               SetOptions[NotebookSelection[mb], CellTags -> "tag test",       CellLabel -> "label test"]      I indeed see in the mb notebook the label and the label appear. Good. Now, I process the code (with the same selection: the cell bracket in the notebook mb)               Options[NotebookSelection[mb], {CellLabel, CellTags}]      and I get as output > >      {CellLabel -> None, CellTags -> "tag test"}. >   Why isn't the CellLabel showing up? I can't get my head around this one... Thanks for all help, as always!
