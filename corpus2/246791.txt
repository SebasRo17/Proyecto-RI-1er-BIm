I’m evaluating hg4j to see if it’s useable in my current project. I need a (preferably) pure Java hg library that can:   1. Check out a working copy of a _remote_ hg repo at, say, http://myhg01.example.com/myapp   2. Create a new repo on the same hg server; perhaps a new repo called “fizzbuzz” that would then be hosted from http://myhg01.example.com/fizzbuzz   3. Check code in (“push”) to that new repo My question: does hg4j currently do this? If not, does anyone have any suggestions for me?
