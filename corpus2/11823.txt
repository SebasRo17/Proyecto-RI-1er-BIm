I have a Graph object that contains a forest with directed trees. I want to draw the forest such that the root of the trees are on the top and the leaves are on the bottom. If I use the following line of code:               Graph[{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, {1 \[DirectedEdge] 2,        2 \[DirectedEdge] 3, 4 \[DirectedEdge] 6, 5 \[DirectedEdge] 6,        7 \[DirectedEdge] 4}, VertexLabels -> "Name",       GraphLayout -> "LayeredDrawing"]      I get this image: ![forest](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XSARB.png) Everything looks fine except the root (#3) is not on top. How can I resolve the issue?
