I'm developing a software documentation in a project, and much of it are just CRUD or CRUD based functions. As you can imagine, a lot of the rules are constraints about fields validation, things like length, range, data type and masks of the field. Writing all those rules would be cumbersome to write and to read, so I'm wondering, what are the option available to include such rules in a software documentation, in a way that it is not tedious to write/read it all? **Edit - Clarification** The rules and being taken from an old desktop legacy application, and we are going to document the current validations, features and forms; so the application will be implemented in a more up-to-date (web) platform, considering usability and consistency in the new system. The documentation is handwritten using the Sybase PowerDesigner tool, but the document can be written in doc inside the tool. Some of it are cross-field validation rules, for example;   * For a person of type X, residing on country Y, the value of field A must be validated using the B rule.   * For a person of type X, residing on country Z, the value of field A must be validated using the C rule, and the field D, validated through E rule. Type X, country Y, field A, field D, etc, are all values extracted from fields on the forms.
