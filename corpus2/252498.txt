This is a general question to understand how await in C# works, and particularly I am interested in implementing it in Android. So C# await allows you to go in to waiting mode in the middle of the method until the the task you are waiting for is complete, then you will continue the method execution.   How ever the interesting part is while you are waiting inside the method, the thread that you are working on is not getting locked(or at list it does not looks like it got locked) and the code will continue running from where you called that method. I want to understand what is happening there in C# and how can I implement it in Android?
