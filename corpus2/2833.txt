I need to numerically integrate an expensive positive-definite function over a 2D domain. I know by other ways that the function is basically zero for values outside the following ellipse: `Ellipsoid[center,Sqrt[Eigenvalues[matrix]], Eigenvectors[matrix]]` How do I tell Mathematica to integrate only within the ellipsoid? * * * Here is what I got using your nice suggestions (timings are normalized to the slowest): 100 sec - integration over the rectangle circumscribing the ellipse 55 sec - using Boole to integrate only over ellipse (@b.gatessucks) 47 sec - directly limiting the domain to the ellipse (@whuber) 41 sec - mapping the ellipse to a unit circle (@Jens)
