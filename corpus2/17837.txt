I'd like to do a simple regression with millions of rows of (x,y) data. It seems to be too long for Mathematica. Is there a way to speed it up? It shouldn't be that hard to do, I am not sure what Mathematica is doing. For example here's how the timing grows with the size of the input:                   First@Timing[LinearModelFit[RandomReal[NormalDistribution[], {#, 2}], x, x];] &              /@ {10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000}      generating on my machine:                   {0., 0.015600, 0.046800, 0.670804, 26.722971}      It doesn't seem like it should be taking so much longer for longer data, and yet it does.
