I recently did some hacking with Qt, and found it quite pleasant. Then I switched distributions on my laptop a couple of time, and noted that only KDE is using Qt, all the others are using the Gnu Image Manipulation Program Tool Kit. GTK is primarily a widget toolkit, although Windows and Mac ports do seem to exist. Not sure why one would build a DE on top of a toolkit for an image editor. Qt more of a cross-platform framework including threading, networking, and other non-GUI features. I heard licensing is considered a problem. Did I just answer my own question, or are there other things besides getting all zealotty about freedom? **update** I'd like to clarify that I'm not after opinions, but _observations_. "Qt is not real C++" is an observation, as is "GTK has been general purpose for a very long time". Besides, > But software and programming isn’t always a hard science, either.
