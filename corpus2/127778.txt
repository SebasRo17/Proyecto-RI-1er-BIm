I was just wondering what skills and technologies I need to know to in order to start a career path in Sharepoint. I know that it primarily depends on the job I am applying for but there must be a number of baseline skills that are common among most Sharepoint jobs. Btw, I'm currently a CS student who has only learnt Java.
