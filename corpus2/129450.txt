This is sort of the opposite of Is there an open-source project that can be an example of well-written code?. I am teaching software engineering to undergraduates and I would like a blob of object oriented code that demonstrates tight coupling, bad abstraction, low encapsulation, poor maintainability, the works. Anyone have a good example? Something that is digestible (as in, able to skim in an hour or less) would be great. Thanks in advance.
