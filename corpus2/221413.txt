Last week, a few colleauges and I were participating in career fairs at three major universities (two here in the US and one in England), where we were trying (without much success) to recruit for several compiler positions, ranging from internship, to entry-level, to more senior, for our team. To our surprise, 80% of the students that we talked to responded somewhere a long the line of "I want to build Ansroid apps", when asked what they were interested in doing. (And the other 20%? "iPhone apps"! ) Some even expressed openly that they did not "want to build a compiler, ..., it's boring"; they said and I quoted. So what is it about mobile apps that is so appealing to (young ?) "developers" these days? And by the same token, why is compiler such a"boring" topic to them? ( I don't necessarily think these two are mutually exclusive. One can certainly build a compiler for a mobile phone, but that's beside the point) What can we do, if anything, to attract more talents, or even just interested candidates?
