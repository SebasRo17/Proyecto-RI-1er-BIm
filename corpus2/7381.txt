I am trying to make some figures using ListLinePlot in Mathematica 8. Although the PlotRanges are the same, the resulting frame sizes are different. The only difference (as I see it) between the two plots is that one has a Legend, while the other does not; I made sure the legend sits well within the plot and does not stick out. I experimented with AspectRatio and ImageSize, they only modify the overall size but is not changing the frame size. I am trying to align these plots one below the other in a document, and this varying frame size is causing misalignment. I am attaching a screenshot, and please note the "excess space" on the right hand side plot in comparison to the left. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Xv3Kp.png)
