I'm aware that this may be closed as offtopic but there are people around with "offtopic" knowledge :) So, in `List` context we can: `#[[n ;; ]]` and `#[[ ;; n]]`, but we can't do this in context of `Sequence`. Only `##n` is available. One may do               f[n_] := Unevaluated[##][[;; n]] &     f[2][1, 2, 3, 4]      > >     Sequence[1, 2] >   but it is not what I'm looking for. It is very often when I would like to use it. Of course thare are no problems with workarounds. I'm just curious. p.s. Syntax is an issue for sure, I thought something like `###2` could stand for this but `###` is automatically interpreted as `##1 #1`.
