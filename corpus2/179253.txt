I wrote an open source library that parses structured data but intentionally left out carriage-return detection because I don't see the point. It adds additional complexity and overhead for little/no benefit. To my surprise, a user submitted a bug where the parser wasn't working and I discovered the cause of the issue was that the data used CR line endings as opposed to LF or CRLF. Hasn't OSX been using LF style line-endings since switching over to a unix- based platform? I know there are applications like Notepad++ where line endings can be changed to use CR explicitly but I don't see why anybody would want to. Is it safe to exclude support for the statistically insignificant percentage of users who decide (for whatever reason) to the old Mac OS style line- endings? **Update:** To clarify, supporting Windows line endings (ie CRLF) doesn't require CR token recognition. For efficiency purposes the lexer matches on a per-char basis. By silently ignoring CR chars, the CRLF token simplifies to LF. As such, the CRLF token itself could be considered an anachronism all its own but that's not what this question is about. The last OS that provided system-wide support for CR style line endings was Mac OS 9. Ironically, the only application that still uses it as the default in OSX is Microsoft Excel.
