I was trying to see the effect of time slicing, and how it can consume significant amount of time. Actually, I was trying to divide a certain task into a number of threads and see the effect. I have a two core processor. So two threads can run in parallel. I was trying to see if I have a task `w` that is done by 2 threads, and if I have the same task executed by `t` threads with each thread doing `w/t` of the task. How much does time slicing play a role in it. As time slicing is time consuming process, I was expecting that when I do the same task using a two thread process or by a `t` thread process, the amount of time taken by the `t` thread process will be more. Any suggestions?
