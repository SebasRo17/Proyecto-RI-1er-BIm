I need to develop an app for booking appointments. This is going to be **hosted in a shared server**. So performance is the most important thing. I have used symfony2. I quite liked the framework. But seems to be heavy. Which framework would suit me considering my requirements? I have shortlisted three frameworks **yii, symfony2 and ZF2.** I am not asking which framework is better. **All the three are good frameworks**. I want to know which will suit my requirements. My first priority would be performance (I will be using AJAX wherever possible), second would be maintenance and development time and third community support. Or should I use my own handlers to separate views and logic and just use raw php?
