I am following a tutorial. The guy keeps on adding different plug-ins such as subclipse, maven, spring source tool suite, etc after setting up jdk, eclipse, tomcat. While installing spring, he was saying that spring makes it difficult to debug the programme. That didn't make me happy. He also added, it's up to you if you want to install it. Since I am not familiar with it, I just want to know if it's alright to not to have spring at all? Is there really any use of having all those plug-ins?
