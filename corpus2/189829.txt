Right now building an app that authenticates using either email or different social accounts. Because it is going to function on multiple subdomains and domains, I'm wondering if there's a design pattern that's been used in the past to accomplish this without issue. Basically, it's for authentication only as we are using profile information stored locally. I was originally thinking of doing something like an iframe pointed to `accounts.domain.com` that could always check login status of social accounts. Thanks!
