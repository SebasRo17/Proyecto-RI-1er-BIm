I know that we all are trying to improve our structure and style of our code, striving to be truly agile. Websites like Stack Overflow are great when you want an answer to a specific question but what about when you want to get your work critiqued. Are there any communities out there that focus on code review or, even better, agile solutions or even better still focus on T/BDD solutions?
