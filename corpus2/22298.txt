How I can define a function in _Mathematica_ such that it acts same as the `cell2mat` command in MATLAB? Example (in MATLAB):               c = {[1],    [2, 3, 4];          [5; 9], [6, 7, 8; 10, 11, 12]};     m = cell2mat(c)          %/* Output:     % m = 1     2     3     4     %     5     6     7     8     %     9     10    11    12
