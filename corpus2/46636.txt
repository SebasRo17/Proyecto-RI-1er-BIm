Say I have a list of a million integers each with a million digits, and I want a crude sieve to see which have a chance at being prime. Mathematica has a PrimeQ function, which appears to be slow because it performs a large number of trials of Miller-Rabin's primality test and the Lucas primality test before giving a Yes/No answer. Now I could try looking at small factors first, but say this only removes a small fraction of my list. Is there a way to turn down the certainty of PrimeQ, or are there other, faster, tuneably-cruder ways to test for primality within _Mathematica_?
