This `DensityHistogram` doesn't display very well. Some bins are shown much larger than others and, oddly, empty bins appear to be drawn smaller than occupied bins.               DensityHistogram[RandomVariate[BinormalDistribution[.5], 50000], {100, 100}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jx6pn.png) In `ArrayPlot`, similar problems are solved with `PixelConstrained`. How can `PixelConstrained` be emulated with `DensityHistogram`?
