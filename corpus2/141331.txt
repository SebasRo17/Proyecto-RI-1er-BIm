I'm trying to make some positive changes in my company and one of the changes is implementing continuous integration. We do mobile development (iOS/Android) so I need a CI that supports both types of projects. As you can tell I don't know a lot about CI but I've googled a little bit and I think that Jenkins and Hudson are the two most popular. I have a two part questions.   1. Your thought on Jenkins?   2. Is there a way for CI to check if the project is compiling to the   coding standards (like loose coupling and so on)?
