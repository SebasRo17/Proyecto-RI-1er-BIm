In the .NET world, I was able to find several industry figures or luminaries' blogs to read or to follow on twitter to learn about features and trends. Moving into the iOS realm, I'm kind of surprised how difficult it has been to find analogous resources. What resources should I be reading/following/osmosing to get better integrated into the iOS community?
