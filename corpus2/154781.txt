My question is hopefully simple--should I copyright my work (art, software, web design, etc.) under my real name or my screen name? My real name and screen name are also easily connected with a bit of searching, so does it really matter in the end? I'm not a professional (at this point). I read this question: Is it a bad idea to sell Android apps in the Android Market under your real name? and they recommended releasing on the app market under a company name. I also read this question: On what name should I claim copyright in open source software?, but that didn't answer my question. I know it probably matters for big projects, but for little projects, does it matter?
