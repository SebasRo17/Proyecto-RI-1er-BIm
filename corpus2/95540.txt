I've been wondering how to determine if I _know_ functional programming. By know I mean in a Journeyman sense, not a master, but competent enough to do the work. I like languages w/ query/data shaping constructs built in, but is knowing the ins and outs of maps, filters, and aggregates in the form of `Linq`, `Sql`, and `Reactive Extensions` sufficient to claim that one knows functional programming? Or are additional specific concepts and skills required? Edit: I've been working in OO and languages that identify primarily as OO langs for 15 years. As I'm not in an env that is self-identified as functional, there's little to measure against. Is avoiding immutable state and knowing how to use `fold` all there is?
