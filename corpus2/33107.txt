We build a project with _Java_ and _Mathematica_ technologies. For this project we have written a bunch of functions in _Mathematica_ and integrated some functions in one `JSP` file. In this way, we made four `JSP` files containing _Mathematica_ code. These `JSP` (in which files _Mathematica_ functions are integrated) files are linked and triggered by _Java_ `servlet's`. Note: for every request, _Mathematica_ (four `JSP`) files should be run. We are using _Mathematica_ for back-end computations purpose. I have two _Mathematica_ kernels, thus my **question** is: How can I use these two kernels efficiently for processing requests? I've never worked on more kernels than two, if anyone has some experience on that point please let me know.
