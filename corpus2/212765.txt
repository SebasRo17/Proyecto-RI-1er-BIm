In terminal based scripts (Shell, Bash, Python, etc), if you prompt the user _"Do you wish to continue?"_ and the user chooses _"No"_ , what exit code should the script ideally return? On one hand, the script executed as the user expected it to (the user wanted to quit, so it quit), so it should give an exit code of `0`. On the other hand, the script was unable to complete its main task, which should be a non- zero exit code.
