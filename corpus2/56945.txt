I have a data list where the elements have the form (time, velocity ). I need to remove some malformed elements in places where the data does not change smoothly and then replace those points by interpolating the elements before and after them. Here is an example of my data:               {{27.342, -0.01}, {27.443, -0.03}, {27.546, -0.01}, {27.743, -0.01}, {27.945, -0.01},       {28.145, -0.03}, {28.246, -0.05}, {28.346, -0.06}, {28.547, -0.01}, {28.747, -0.01},       {29.149, -0.01}, {29.249, 0}, {29.45, -0.01}, {29.651, -0.05}, {29.852, -0.05},       {30.053, -0.01}, {30.153, -0.01}}      For instance the 7th and 8th elements are malformed since the wind cannot change from -0.3 to -0.05 and -0.6 and then back to -0.01 in 0.1 sec0, so I want to replace them with -0.03 and -0.02.
