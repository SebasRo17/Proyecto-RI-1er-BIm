I exported data form Mathematica to txt-format on my Mac. When opening the txt-file on a Windows-System the file does not appear as on my Mac (see screenshots). Code: `Export["Example.txt", {{"Test1", 1, 2, 3, 4}, {"Test2", 5, 6, 7, 8}}]` Mathematica Documentation Center says "`Export` uses the line separator convention of the computer system on which Mathematica is being run." How can I generate a txt-file under Mac OS, so that this file can be read correctly under Windows to? BTW: I would like to get rid of the braces, quotation marks and commas within the txt-file. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/joDw3.jpg) ![Mac Screenshot with code](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Iemh9.png)
