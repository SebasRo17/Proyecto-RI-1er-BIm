I have a windows service program that is running on one of our servers. It has a memory leak of some kind within the program. When it first starts running it is using 20,000k memory. Within a few days it is up to 400,000k of memory. It is a fairly simple program that tracks running processes and writes the information to a database. I am unsure on how I can debug a program running on a remote machine to find out where the memory leak is coming from. What methods would you suggest I use in order to try and track this down? **Update**   The program has a lot of exception handling in place already. However, it has no logging whatsoever. What information should I be logging in order to track down the memory leak?
