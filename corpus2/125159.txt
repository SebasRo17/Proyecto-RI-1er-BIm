I recently started working at a new company that currently doesn't use linq, but does use C# and the .net framework. I'm coming from a LINQ background, so I'm biased, but I still think there are a lot of advantages to using linq. That being said, it's still going to be hard to influence change as I'm still very new. What suggestions do you have to sell this to management? The database systems are still relatively new, so I think now, as things are still developing, would be the best time to try convincing people to use this. This is both a technical and political question. Any help would be appreciated.
