Some might argue this question is too general, but because keeping up seems especially relevant to programming, is anyone's experience that:   * do employers expect you to stay current? what is the "industry standard" of expected time a programmer should spend keeping up-to-date?    * is it generally acceptable that a programmer can spend some time during working hrs on meeting the expectation to keep skills current? If not, how do most programmers find the time?  -
