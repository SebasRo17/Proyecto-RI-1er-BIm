After performing some calculations with excel sheets I end with a tridimensional matrix **a** to be export to a .xlsx format and a vector **q** that contains the name of all the sheets (so $Length[q] = Length[a]$). In the documentation the usual way to export this named excel data is to do something like               Export["file name.xlsx", q[[1]] -> a[[1]], ..., q[[n]] -> a[[n]]] ]      But since the $Length[a]]$ is variable I do not know an automatic way to do that. I tried something like               q -> a      But Mathematica can't process in this way. How can I do that? Thanks
