I'm starting to pick up all of the perks of C++11, and being a 2010 user i'm considering installing 2012 instead for better c++11 support. But why is it that 2012 doesn't seem as popular as 2010? Am i going to be losing anything when I switch from 2010 to 2012? Or is it a more ease of use concern, and a different GUI that pushes people away? I dont want to install 2012 to learn of some big limitations that 2010 did not present to me, thanks for any input!
