I am quite new to programming, and was wondering if someone might be able to help me get the following working in python: Define ![$\\Phi_mx\(mn+r\)=mx\(n\)+\\frac{r}{m}\(x\(n+1\)-x\(n\)\)$](http://i.imgur.com/ZQeqIvx.gif), where we consider x(0)=0, r is always positive and less than m, and all values of n are positive integers. ![$\\Phi_m$](http://i.imgur.com/JAncAHQ.gif) takes in a string of numbers and outputs another string. How might I program this?
