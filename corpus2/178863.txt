Been teaching myself how to code over the past four months or so -- mainly in JavaScript, but just started Python -- and had a revelation today. I can write in JavaScript pretty well, but I don't actually know what JavaScript **is**. Basically I know how to use it, but not the advantages/disadvantages, its origination, its purpose, etc. What is the purpose and background behind Javascript and why was it created?
