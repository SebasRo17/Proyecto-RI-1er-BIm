I am trying to solve an equation of the form as follows $\left(\begin{array}{cc} -\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\frac{\delta^{2}}{\delta z^{2}}+\sin^{2}\left(z\right) & z\\ z & \frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\frac{\delta^{2}}{\delta z^{2}}-\sin^{2}\left(z\right) \end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c} u_{n}(z)\\ v_{n}(z) \end{array}\right)==\epsilon_{n}\left(\begin{array}{c} u_{n}(z)\\ v_{n}(z) \end{array}\right)$ Assuming required no. of boundary conditions but with no knowledge of the eigenvalues, please tell how to solve such a system of equations in Mathematica. Here $n$ is an index for the eigenfunction and the corresponding eigenvalue. Take $z$ as real and assume that $z$ runs on a finite lattice of fixed size of length $L=Na$ where $N$ is the number of sites on the lattice and a is the lattice constant. If you take $a==1$, take $N$ of the order of $10000$. There is a specified value of the eigenfunctions at the boundary of the lattice which you can take zero for the simplest case. Please multiply everything by units such that dimensions are consistent- Here the derivative term is the kinetic energy term while sin2z term is the potential term.
