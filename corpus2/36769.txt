How can I change the base font style for _all_ graphics objects, including the ones generated using plotting functions? I would like to change this _a single time_ and have it affect all graphics generated from there on (i.e. not specify the font on a plot by plot basis). Say, I'd like to use 16 point Helvetica for everything by default. * * * My original thought was `SetOptions[Graphics, BaseStyle -> {...}]`, but this will be overridden on graphics created using the various plotting functions (e.g. `Plot`). My second try was changing the `BaseStyle` in the `GraphicsBoxOptions` of the notebook, but this didn't have an effect.
