I am working in a Linux machine.The name of my mathematica file is deres.nb Code:               a={};     AppendTo[a,1];     a>>"file"      Now, if I run this code, by simply evaluating the cell, there is no problem, I get the file saved in the directory I am working. But I want to run a script. Then I prepare my file by: 1.Cell -> Cell Properties-> Initialization Cell 2.I save the file with a .m extension(deres.m) 3.Format -> Style -> Code Now I run the script by writing in the terminal:   1. screen   2. math -script deres.m & Then I exit by writing "exit". The problem is that I do not get my file saved. This works perfectly for me in Mathematica 8. Any solution please? Thanks a bunch.
