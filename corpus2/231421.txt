I'm part of a 7 person software development team which supports a company with a few thousand staff. Our team is putting together a quick review process for measuring the success of a software project. Projects are mostly internal, which means our "customers" are more often than not other staff. Projects are reasonably small (generally 100 to 1000 hours). Our review process will need to have a few aspects to it, probably including:   * A questionnaire sent to the customers (filled in by people in a variety of roles if possible, such as managers who may not be users of the software, and users), looking at the ease of use, quality of documentation, incident response, value for money, reliability.   * Cost compared with the budget. Estimated development time compared with actual time would be looked at here too.   * Security, if applicable.   * Maintainability, such as how easy it is to log in as a particular user to replicate problems, and how easy the code is to follow.   * Technical documentation, such as instructions on setting up development environments and test data. Is there anything glaring I've missed, or anything that should have a particularly strong (or weak) focus?
