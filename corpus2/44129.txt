The question is completely formulated in the title. However, to make it more presize, I am making presentations for lectures. The presentations are done in Mma. I have some illustrative material to show in a form of movies (avi and gif). It is possible to remove Mma from the screen, open a file with the movies and play one. I would like, however, to be able to call a movie from Mma just for the sake of speed. In addition it is aestetically better. I tried to embed a hyperlink into the presentation notebook to call the movie file. This does not work. It opens an empty notebook with the title of the movie-file in question, and after a rather long waiting the notebook becomes filled by some symbols. Evidently, it opens the file rather than plays it. So, can I do anything?
