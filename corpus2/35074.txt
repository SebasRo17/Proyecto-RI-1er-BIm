I'm trying to figure out how to prepare a notebook for NICE online viewing when it's been converted to PDF form. The students I am working with (sadly!) will not be able to use the CDFPlayer to view existing documents. I'm to use Google Docs and save the notebooks in PDF form. I've been working with settings for margins and page sizes and paper sizes, I'll admit I'm out of my depth completely. Specifically, I'd like two things. FIRST When I save as PDF, I'd like the pages to be like actual slides in terms of size. It would be nice if each page was viewable on screen like a nice "distinct" slide. Below, a 2 second pdf creation, being viewed in Google Docs. ![sample](http://i.stack.imgur.com/U7Dlr.png) B Is there any way to set the stylesheets so I would be able to 'see' in Mathematica what my pages would look like so I can edit, space, page break accordingly. I know, I expect my question is too vague and may get "punted", but I'll need to get going on this ASAP and I simply can't get my mind around it myself. I have tons of content all ready to go in existing notebooks and now find I am faced with a massive reformatting task. I can simply format for nice "regular" pages and students would scroll, but I figured since they were viewing documents on computer, there HAVE to be ways to capitalize on that. Tom
