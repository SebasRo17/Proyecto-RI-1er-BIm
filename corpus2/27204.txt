I am fairly new to Mathematica and I am faced with a problem. I tried to search for the solution but it seems that I don't know how to formulate the short search request. I need to perform a matrix product of               g = -I*Pi {{I1[x], 0}, {0, I2[x]}}.{{1 + G[x].Gt[x], 2*G[x]}, {-2*G[x], -1 - Gt[x].G[x]}}      However, I know that all the entries are matrices themselves, so I would like the dot product to be preserved in the output, i.e. to get something like               {{-I \[Pi] (1 + G[x].Gt[x]).I1[x], -2 I \[Pi] I1[x].G[x]},       {2 I \[Pi] I2[x].G[x], -I \[Pi] (-1 - Gt[x].G[x]).I2[x]}}      as opposed to               {{-I \[Pi] (1 + G[x].Gt[x]) I1[x], -2 I \[Pi] I1[x] G[x]},      {2 I \[Pi] I2[x] G[x], -I \[Pi] (-1 - Gt[x].G[x]) I2[x]}}      Is there any way to do this in Mathematica? N.B.: I don't want to specify the entire form of `G[x],Gt[x]` and other matrices at this stage.
