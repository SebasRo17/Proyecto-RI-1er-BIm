We are a small team of programmers, and we are now facing a situation where we have to outsource some of the work in order to complete it in time. Project is about website that was previously build with asp.net webforms, EF and SQL server. We have previously build a data layer and optimized SQL, but we need to complete front end of the project. Clients wants asp.net MVC and HTML5. The problem for us is how to open data layer to outsourcing team without compromising or disclosing any data?
