I recently pitched a project I've been working on to a small company that I know, coincidentally, has a need for something similar. They seemed excited by what I have, and what I said I could do, but worried that, as a lone (actually, they said 'rogue') programmer I could up and leave them with a non- functional program. They suggested that I get a few people together, write up a solid proposal, and meet with them again. They've promised office space and a good budget because this is an application that would greatly increase productivity for them. The problem is I'm still quite new to the field, I have no professional experience, and while I know I could complete this project, I don't know how to find other people to bring in on it. Does anyone have any experience in situations like this? Any ideas on where I could look? Also, the company and I are both located in Manhattan, if that helps determine where to look for people.
