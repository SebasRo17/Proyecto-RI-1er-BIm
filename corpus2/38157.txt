Is there any way to get Bessel function equivalent to a Hypergeom function. Would it be possible in general ? From maple integration (As discussed in Answer ID 37931), the result of a symbolic integration is                r^4/32 * hypergeometric([1/2],[3/2,3/2,2,2],r^4/64)      Is there any way to represent the above hypergeom function into equivalent BesselJ function. Your inputs are greatly appreciated.
