I have a rails app. I'm writing code to integrate it with a third-party service, "Foo Bar". The integration affects many parts of the system -- models, controllers, and an API wrapper. Thus far I've been putting the integration stuff into the modules of each model and controller. So inside **app/models/user/foo_bar.rb** is `User::FooBar`, which I then include into my user model. I have the API wrapper inside **lib/foo_bar_api.rb**. It occurred to me today that perhaps I should have all my integration code in **lib**. So **lib/foo_bar/user.rb** would contain `FooBar::User`, which I then include in my user model. Is there a particularly standard way of doing this, or is it 6 of one, half- dozen of another? (p.s., this is my first programmers.stackexchange.com question -- it's appropriate for here, right?)
