I'm in a project with 4 other people, and I've been willing to fully adopt a collaborative tool in order to make it possible to share information and store data (PDFs, DOCs, etc.) in an online tool, rather than doing it by e-mail. The problem is that I'm the only one enforcing it; actually I'm the only one using it. The others only use it when I ask them to do so. How would you handle this? Have you experienced something similar, if so, what have you done?
