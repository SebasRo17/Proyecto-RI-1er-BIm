I'm a little curious about the reason behind the Windows header file declaration styles. When I read them, I see multi-line declarations such as the following:               WINBASEAPI     HANDLE     WINAPI     GetStdHandle(         IN DWORD nStdHandle         );      What is the primary reason why they're not written as something like:               WINBASEAPI HANDLE WINAPI GetStdHandle(IN DWORD nStdHandle);      i.e. in a single line?
