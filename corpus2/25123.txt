For the first time, our team is taking a rigorous approach to technical code QA. We identify work to QA by picking out top level classes and QA'ing it and everything it calls or uses below it (and what they call/use etc.). I reckon our QA code coverage to be reasonably close to 100% and its an eye opener for me in terms of improvements both in code and design as well as catching bugs early. I'll definetly be promoting this in the future, but wondered how other teams approach techincal code QA. Do you have a rigorous approach? Do you aim to QA everything? Does one or two people tend to do it or is it spread evenly about the team? What do you look for when QA'ing? Any thoughts appreciated!
