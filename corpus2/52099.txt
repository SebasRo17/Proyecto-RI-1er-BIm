I noticed that the following line,               Image[Table[x, {y, 1, 250}, {x, 30/256, 40/256, 0.02/256}],       Magnification -> 1]      results in the following image: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/riUoH.png) In the preceding image, there are 10 vertical bars, each a different shade of grey; based on the range I used in `Table`, this means that there are 256 shades of grey when going from black to white (ie, 8-bit depth per channel). Similarly, this effect also shows up in full-color images. Is there a way to make the colors produced by `Image` have less of this "staircase effect"? This related question asks about boosting the channel depth beyond 8-bits per RGB channel, but the highest-voted answer does not appear to computationally scale well when applied to image sizes of $3000\times3000$ or larger.
