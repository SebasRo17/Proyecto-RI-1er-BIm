I am trying to create a Java frontend for Mathematica. Following examples from J/Link guide and looking around the API manual I came up with this code:               public class Mathematica extends MathJFrame {     public Mathematica(String[] args) {         initComponents();               try {             ml = MathLinkFactory.createKernelLink(args);         } catch (MathLinkException e) {             System.out.println("Fatal error opening link: " + e.getMessage());         }              try {             ml.discardAnswer();                  ml.evaluate("2+2");             ml.waitForAnswer();                  int result = ml.getInteger();             System.out.println("2 + 2 = " + result);                  graphic1.setLink(ml);             graphic1.setMathCommand("Plot[x,{x,0,1}]");             graphic1.repaintNow();             System.out.println(graphic1.getMathCommand());              } catch (MathLinkException e) {             System.out.println("Fatal error opening link: " + e.getMessage());         } finally {             ml.close();         }         private KernelLink ml = null;     }      Graphics.java:               public class Graphic extends MathGraphicsJPanel {        public Graphic() {             }     }      I know the link is working because I get 2 + 2 = 4 displayed in console but the panel where the graph output is expected is empty. Also, does J/Link not ship with sample programs anymore? Thanks for any suggestions.
