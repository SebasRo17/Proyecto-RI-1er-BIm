So I've been able to make a list given by               list = Table[{xValues, f[xValues, t (*fixed*)]}, {xValues, xmin, xmax}]      For example:               list =       Table[{x, Sin[x/(2*Pi)*1/10]*Cos[1/(2*Pi)]}, {x, 1, 10}]      this list is easily plotted with the command `ListPlot[list]` (or even `ListLinePlot` if I wanted some kind of interpolation between my points). Now if I go to the 3D-case it becomes slightly harder! So I again make my list of data, this time given by:               Plotdata =       Table[{x, y, Sin[x/(2*Pi)*1/10]*Cos[y/(2*Pi)*1/10]}, {x, 1, 10}, {y,         1, 10}]      This now gives me a nested list, and my attempt to plot it with `ListPlot3D` is futile. I'm wondering if I need to do something special to get this done? My goal would be to get a nice 3D-plot of the whole. I know I could do it for my example with the regular `Plot3D` command, but that's just an example, the real case involves a lot of functions which can't be done by the plot-command (or would demand to much time). My problem comes essentially down to the above. I'm hoping someone could help me.
