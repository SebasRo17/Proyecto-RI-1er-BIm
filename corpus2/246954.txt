I'm not a native English speaker, currently I'm reading some articles about Scrum. I was wondering if the English terms used in Scrum seem strange to you? For example, backlog instead of todo; artifact instead of element; retrospective instead of review; even the name of Scrum, it make no sense to me as a process name. Can anyone give some hint to me? For example, I don't see the relationship between a scrum in football and iteration process. Fei
