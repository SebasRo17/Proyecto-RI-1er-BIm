My friend has 15 years of programming experience and Ph.D. in mathematics. He has also cerebral palsy with speech impairment. Because of his handicap, he chose to being a software developer after his Ph.D. As far as I can see, he is still an excellent c# developer. Nowadays, however, he has hard time to find a job for himself because most of developer jobs require good communication skills. Looking at him struggling so much, do I have to advise him software industry is not suitable for him any more? It will be extremely difficult for me to do that to the friend but I think it would be better than making him wasting his time. What do you think? **Update:** Thanks a lot for your excellent answers. I can see most answers recommend against my advice and I really really hope you guys are right. In reality, however, he has been rejected in 100 or so phone interviews. That's where I want to be a potential bad adviser rather than a politically right friend.
