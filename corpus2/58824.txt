I am interested in doing some projects that involve heavy use of JavaScript. Namely HTML5 based canvas games, potentially using node.js as well. I am interested in learning modern best practices, tools and resources for JavaScript. JavaScript is tough to research because you end up wading through a lot of really outdated material, hailing from the times that "JavaScript" was a four letter word. If you are heavily involved in JavaScript programming...   * What text editor or IDE do you use?   * What unit testing framework do you use?   * Do you use Selenium, or something else?   * What other tools do you use?   * What communities exist that discuss recent advents in JavaScript?   * What books do you read/refer to?   * What blogs do you read?
