I run this sum and get the symbolic answer below :               Sum[ (1/(k^2 - k) - 1/k^2), {k, 2, Infinity}]      > $2 - \frac{\pi^2}{6}$ I look up the sequence on OEIS and find these digits:               RealDigits[ N[ 2 - Pi^2/6, 105]]      > {{ **3, 5, 5, 0, 6, 5, 9, 3, 3, 1, 5, 1, 7, 7, 3, 5, 6, 3, 5, 2, 7, 5, 8, 4, > 8, 3** , 3, 3, 5, 3, 9, 7, 4, 8, 1, 0, 7, 8, 1, 0, 5, 0, 0, 9, 8, 7, 9, 3, > 2, 0, 1, 5, 6, 2, 2, 6, 4, 4, 4, 1, 7, 7, 0, 6, 2, 9, 9, 9, 2, 5, 2, 9, 5, > 9, 6, 7, 9, 9, 1, 2, 6, 1, 6, 6, 3, 7, 1, 0, 9, 9, 3, 8, 0, 2, 4, 1, 2, 9, > 4, 6, 9, 5, 9, 9, 5}, 0} When I try to replicate those digits, I get some differences at the 27th digit.               RealDigits[ NSum[ (1/(k^2 - k) - 1/k^2), {k, 2, Infinity},     WorkingPrecision -> 105]]      > {{ **3, 5, 5, 0, 6, 5, 9, 3, 3, 1, 5, 1, 7, 7, 3, 5, 6, 3, 5, 2, 7, 5, 8, 4, > 8, 3** , 2, 1, 5, 3, 5, 8, 4, 4, 8, 1, 8, 6, 0, 5, 0, 6, 9, 8, 9, 7, 9, 3, > 3, 4, 8, 2, 1, 4, 0, 3, 2, 9, 8, 8, 0, 8, 5, 6, 2, 7, 0, 3, 0, 0, 8, 1, 8, > 8, 4, 1, 0, 2, 5, 2, 8, 6, 3, 7, 0, 7, 4, 1, 8, 9, 3, 1, 3, 7, 3, 4, 0, 4, > 0, 3, 0, 3, 2, 3, 5}, 0} So, which is correct ? The symbolic sum or the NSum? **Edit** I tried with a plus between the two sums, which returns `Zeta[2]` and I get the same variances starting at the $28$-th digit.
