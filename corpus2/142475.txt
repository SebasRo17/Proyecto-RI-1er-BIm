In Item2 on page 16, (Prefer consts, enums, and inlines to #defines), Scott says: > Also, though good compilers won't set aside storage for const objects of > integer types... I don't understand this. If I define a const object, eg               const int myval = 5;      then surely the compiler must set aside some memory (of int size) to store the value 5? Or is const data stored in some special way? This is more a question of computer storage I suppose. Basically, how does the computer store const objects so that no storage is set aside?
