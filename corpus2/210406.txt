Well while developing a web application that allow users to draw graphs (flow charts, ER diagram , UML, .... etc) the information of drawn items and their relation to each other and position on canvas is expressed as JSON object The question is: 1- is saving such graph in database as raw (json object text) is enough (in one field of a table) 2- or is it always required to break down the json object into logical pieces and store them into a well built database structure! option 1- other than making devilopers life easier it will eleminate the need of recreating json object from small bits and pieces of information when the user open a graph he have built and saved long time ago option 2- will have fine grain details in proper structure but will cost kind of heavy processing while opening a saved graph from Database which way is correct way to go ?
