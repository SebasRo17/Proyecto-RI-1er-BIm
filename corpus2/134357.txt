We have a family of apps, all having the same base. Until now I've been developing this base, and the Git workflow was very simple:   * Development is done in `develop` branch   * New features are developed in `name-of-the-feature` branch   * Releases are made in `release-**` branch Until now, the code was the same for every app of the family. Let's say the base they share is now complete, and from now on the code will be different for every app. I'm not sure how should I deal with **git** and this **multiple apps** that have the same base.   * Should each one of them have its **own git project**?   * Should they be on the same project, but each one in its **own branch**? The point is: if I put them on separate projects, every modification done in the **base** of the app will have to me repeated in each of the apps. I'm not very familiar with **git** , but if I store each project in a **branch** , will be possible to merge the base modification with each app? Does anyone have experienced a situation like this? I'm not sure how to proceed. Thanks! **EDITED** When I said **version** I didn't mean like version numbers. They are actually different apps that share the same base.
