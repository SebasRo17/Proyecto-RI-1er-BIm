I have a function for which `0` is a special case:               f[A___, 0, B___] := 0      But since I am doing numerics, sometimes in the course of things `f` gets called with `0.` instead of `0`. Of course I can add the line               f[A___, 0., B___] := 0      But I don't understand why I need to because I don't understand the difference between `0` and `0.`. Can anyone illuminate this for me? (In addition to saving a line of code, or as Jens points out, a couple of characters, I also want to know the difference between them so I don't run into hard-to-debug problems in the future because of something I didn't know about.)
