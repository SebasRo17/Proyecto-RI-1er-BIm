I need to find the position of the first element of a list that is either greater than zero (or some other criterion) or a symbol. Something like                lst={0,0,k,1,4}      and as result                position = 3      If there was no symbol the following command would do the job                First[Flatten[Position[lst, _?(Abs[#] > 0 &)]]]      If I add `|| MatchQ[_Symbol]` the answer will always be zero. Many thanks
