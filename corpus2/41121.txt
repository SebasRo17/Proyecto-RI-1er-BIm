I have a plot               g = RevolutionPlot3D[{Sin[t], t}, {t, 0, π}, {θ, -π, π + 3 π/4}];      Is it possible to extract the generatrices (generating curves) from `g`? Sometimes, I want to concentrate on plotting the surface in different ways, and what I need is the all the generating curves. Can I obtain these curves from `g`?. * * * For example, this is what I need (the data could be plot by `Line /@ curves` and could be exported elsewhere).               curves = Table[RotationMatrix[θ, {0, 0, 1}]. {Sin[t], 0, t}, {θ, 0, 2π, .3}, {t, 0, π, .3}];      The example result, `curves`, is what I want, but I obtain that by re-think about generating method and `{Sin[t], 0, t}`. Seems defining `g` was a waste of time. But in the plot of `g`, such lines/meshes are really shown by _Mathematica_ , so I would like to extract them.
