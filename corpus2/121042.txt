which is the best way to correlate and group similar articles? I mean something like Google News, which groups under a single topic different articles from different sources. I'm not interested in something much sophisticated, it is just important to be efficient in terms of speed and resources needed. I can live with a correlation only on short text like the titles of the articles, not the article itself. I read a paper which talks about tuples of two or three words (best with three) to extract and use to produce a score to achieve the correlation, but it's way too much academic for me
