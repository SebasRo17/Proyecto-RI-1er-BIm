I have a list:               list1 = {{{a1, a2, a3}, {b1, b2, b3}}, {{c1, c2, c3}, {d1, d2, d3}}};      ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6bbDh.png) I want an operation that gives me: ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GOtfL.png) Is there a built-in way of doing this? Basically, this is meant to be the `ImageData` of a picture and I want to double the resolution by increasing the number of pixels and doing further operations on it. I tried               KroneckerProduct[list1, {{1, 1}, {1, 1}}]      but it didn't give me what I wanted. If there is no built-in method of doing this, what is the most efficient way of this?
