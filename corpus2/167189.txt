I'm have good resources on both security, domain modelling, and architecture patterns. I've noticed a distinct lack of any suggestion of how and where to integrate security into the systems I build. I imagine the thing that applies the most is Access control, as Authentications and many other security forms would seem to be obviously a layer above the model and is pretty easy to separate and find a place for. Access Control to actions seems more of a grey area. Are there any good resources on this? I prefer well written books, but other resources are also welcome.
