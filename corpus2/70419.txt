The single largest factor in what is holding me back from being a stellar developer is my reliance on others. I feel like I ask too many questions because I fear the consequences of breaking everything and holding everyone back. So I'm overly cautious by asking so many questions that I basically get the answers after enough questioning. I've recognized that's bad but I want to stop it. Part of it comes that there are times where I simply don't know the code (either it's a branch I've never worked with or it's a brand new product), but I want to rely on others less. To preface, these kinds of questions are not the ones about generic patterns or languages: usually my questions revolve around how we do code at our company, and how we get things to work in our ecosystem. I want to be able to take specs and roll with them without having to feel like I need to get help every step of the way. Is this normal? Have you been through this, and if so, how did you get over it?
