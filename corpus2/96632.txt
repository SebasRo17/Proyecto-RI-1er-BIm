I am after some advice in regards to an assessment day I have coming up in 38 days time. I am a computer science graduate who graduated last year and have since been having difficulty finding work. I have had a bit of luck in being accepted (through passing a phone interview) and have now been invited to an 'assessment day'. The company involved is an IT solutions and consultancy company. The job position is titled 'graduate IT consultant'). I was wondering if anyone could give me any advice in what to expect on these 'assessment days'. Will it be a day of tests or would it be a day when we are given tasks (maybe in groups) and then observed to see how we handle those tasks to find a solution? I really haven't the slightest idea and so am wondering through people who have been through a similar experience (even with other companies) what they found. I am after advice in regards to what to study for this position. At university I was exposed to JAVA programming and some design work that was associated with that. This job being an 'graduate IT consultant' position I am after advice in what area to focus in. Would focusing in system analysis & system design be most suited or should I just continue focusing on my programming skills and maybe look into design patterns etc?
