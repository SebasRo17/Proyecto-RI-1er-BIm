I need to solve this Fredholm integral equation of the second kind:               f[s]+integrate[f[t] K[s,t],{t,0,1}]=s       where `0<=s<=1`. The kernel is:               K[s,t]=(a/2)*(BesselJ[1,a*(s+t)]-BesselJ[1,a*Abs[s-t]]-i*StruveH[1,a*(s+t)]+i*StruveH[1,a*Abs(s-t)])       where a: real, i: imaginary unit. I tried to solve this with the method described here: Integral equation numerical solution with NDSolve, this is the best algorithm for this case I have come across so far but it takes for ages and in the end it doesn't produce any result (due to memory insufficiency). Could anyone please help me solve it?
