I have the following list               l1 ={{{-1.342}, {-0.28}, {1.372}}, {{-1.34266}, {-0.278541}, {1.37156}}, \       {{-1.34459}, {-0.274215}, {1.37026}}, {{-1.34769}, {-0.267169}, \        {1.36807}}, {{-1.35177}, {-0.257626}, {1.36499}}, {{-1.35661}, \        {-0.245864}, {1.36101}}, {{-1.36197}, {-0.232184}, {1.35611}}, \        {{-1.3676}, {-0.216888}, {1.35026}}, {{-1.37326}, {-0.200263}, \        {1.34346}}, {{-1.37875}, {-0.182564}, {1.33567}}}      I'd like to take it and transformit into the following form               newList = {{-1.34266, 0}, {-0.278541, 0}, {1.37156, 0}}      I have tried               {{#1, 0}, {#2, 0}, {#3, 0}}  & @@ {#1, #2, #3} & @@  l1      Which does not work. It gives the output: which is almost correct               {{{-1.34266}, 0}, {{-0.278541}, 0}, {{1.37156}, 0}}      I want to feed this data into the following function to animate the data:               Animate[ListPlot[{{l1[[n]][[1]], 0}, {l1[[n]][2]], 0}, {l1[[n]][3]], 0}},        PlotStyle -> PointSize[0.1], PlotRange -> {{-2, 2}, {-1, 1}}], {n,        1, 750, 1}]      I thought It would be easiest to first construct the list we want and then pass it directly to ListPlot.
