According to this answer every object in Java is of the same size? Is the answer talking about the object itself or the reference to the object? Here's the statement: > every object size is rounded to 16 bytes in Hotspot, so an object with a > single byte field will take up precisely the same space as a single object > with a long or double field; I am completely baffled by the claim in this statement. So many upvotes to this answer further befuddled me. Can some one please explain what is meant by the above statement?
