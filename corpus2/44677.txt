I'm trying to make a plot with many objects in it using a `While` loop. Something like the following:               Graphics3D[       While[ϕforwhile < Pi/3,          {Lighter[Blue, .1],             {Tube[               Table[                 u*{Sin[Pi/2]*Cos[ϕforwhile], Sin[Pi/2]*Sin[ϕforwhile], Cos[Pi/2]},                 {u, 0, 1, 1/10}],               .005]}};         ϕforwhile = ϕforwhile + Pi/12;]]      Does anyone know how to make this work?
