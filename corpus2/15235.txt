Are table headings for aesthetics only? If I have:               table1 = TableForm[{{1, 1, 0, 0, 0}, {0, 1, 0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 1, 0, 0}, {0, 0,         1, 1, 1}, {0, 0, 1, 0, 1}, {1, 1, 0, 0, 0}, {0, 1, 1, 0, 0}},       TableHeadings -> {{"1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7"}, {"a", "b",          "c", "d", "e"}}]      Is there any way to refer to a part of the table by the heading names? For example, if I want the position of all 1's in the table,               Position[table1, 1]      I would like this to return both numbers and letters. Is this possible? I apologize if this question is elementary. Any help is much appreciated!
