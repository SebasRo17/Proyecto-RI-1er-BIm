I've been in the financial engineering arena (after BA Math and BA Computer Science) for about 5 years (20% analysis/programming, 80% communicating) and take pride in my ability to communicate with people and discuss technical problems (i.e. interacting with a team). I love this part of my job. Going to the white board to draw abstract ideas and brainstorm. However, for many reasons, I want to transition my career into a technology company (software engineering) but I'm deeply afraid that I will fall into a stereotypical programming job where programmers code with big headphones on. I certainly know this is only a stereotype but I've witnessed similar environments before (at startups) and it scares me to think that I would be migrating to a career of isolation. I love coding and thinking algorithmically, but I don't want to give up interacting with people. I understand that having communication skills is only a positive, but am I setting myself up for career-happiness failure by transitioning into software engineering. I'd love to hear any clarifications and/or advice.
