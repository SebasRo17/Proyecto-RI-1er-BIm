Let's say I have a JavaScript web application which entirely uses a RESTful API for data. Let's say this application has a data form, and let's say I'm editing a record at /product/12345. When building the form, I make a RESTful request to /product/12345 and get JSON data:               {       "id": 12345,       "name": "Some Product",       "active": true,       "sales_user_id": 27     }      _So, my form obviously may have a dropdown list for selecting a sales person. I need to populate this list._ **Where should the data come from?** What's the most common approach? Would it make sense to make it part of the /product/12345 request response?               {       "id": 12345,       "name": "Some Product",       "active": true,       "sales_user_id": 27,       "sales_users": [         {"id": 1, "name": "Anna Graham"},         {"id": 2, "name": "Dick Mussell"},         {"id": 3, "name": "Ford Parker"},         {"id": 4, "name": "Ferris Wheeler"},         {"id": 5, "name": "Jo King"}       ]     }      What about when creating a new record? Should my API also respond to GET /product/new, with the following?               {       "sales_users": [         {"id": 1, "name": "Anna Graham"},         {"id": 2, "name": "Dick Mussell"},         {"id": 3, "name": "Ford Parker"},         {"id": 4, "name": "Ferris Wheeler"},         {"id": 5, "name": "Jo King"}       ],       "categories": [         {"id": 1, "name": "Category 1"},         {"id": 2, "name": "Category 2"},         {"id": 3, "name": "Category 3"},         {"id": 4, "name": "Category 4"},         {"id": 5, "name": "Category 5"}       ],       "etc": [ ... ]     }
