I have a project that needs Hibernate jars. I added them as dependencies in the pom.xml and Maven compiles my project well. However, in the IDE, all annotations and calls to Hibernate API are marked as unresolved (red). How could I get IntelliJ being able to resolve them ? Is there a way to use Maven when I click on Build Project ? (ctrl+F9) Also, I am confused with the concept of facets within IntelliJ. Do I need them, let's say JPA facets to enable Persistence assistant etc... or there's an option to let Maven take care about ?
