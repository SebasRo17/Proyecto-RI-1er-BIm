I have used WolframAlpha since it was launched (now a pro member) but am new to Mathematica 8. Is there a way to automatically add data from WA to a Mathematica dataset? For example, what if I have data on annual sales and I want to add the USA's GDP in the given year as the third column. I have used the WolframAlpha[] function but am not sure how to integrate it into my data. I'd want to add a "GDP" column to this data:               In[4]:= sales = Import["C:\\Users\\Andrew\\Desktop\\DemoData.xlsx"]          Out[4]= {{{"Year", "Sales"}, {2000., 105704.}, {2001.,      120042.}, {2002., 118973.}, {2003., 126539.}, {2004.,      105582.}, {2005., 126510.}, {2006., 101745.}, {2007.,      105821.}, {2008., 127313.}, {2009., 100908.}, {2010.,      115692.}, {2011., 116188.}}}      This isn't the best example, but this kind of thing would make my grad school life markedly easier. No more downloading, cleaning, and merging independent variable sets from random sources!
