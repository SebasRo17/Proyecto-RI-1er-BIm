I recently read Crockford's book "Javascript: The Good Parts" and one of the underlying premises was that programming languages can have bad sets of features which programmers should avoid. I'm a Rubyist and whilst I love the language there's always value in getting perspective. So, **what do you see as the worst feature (e.g. methods, classes, practices) in Ruby?** My intention here is not to start an argument about the merits of the language itself or its speed and so on. Rather I'd prefer a discussion of what features you consider dangerous / troublesome / painful to use, based on past experiences.
