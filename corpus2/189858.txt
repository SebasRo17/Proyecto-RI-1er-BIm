Uncle Bob's rules for TDD are specified here.   1. You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.    2. You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.    3. You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test. But, is it ok to write a bunch of tests that pass as soon as the test compiles? For example, a test that asserts null and the default impl of a method I'm testing returns null. Am I doing something wrong by doing this? Should I skip to the first test that will fail or is it ok to write tests that automatically pass first?
