I have a list of objects that all require the exact same filtering, basically a set of conditionals in a function which outputs if the object is "good" or "bad". I want to keep all of my "good" objects in the list. Lets say I have 1000 objects in this list and the function I want to filter on in written. What languages/functionality would maximize how parallel this operation could be? I have played with python's multiprocessing, which does improve performance, but still left me unsatisfied. I suppose this is an "embarrassingly parallel" problem as no state needs to be shared.
