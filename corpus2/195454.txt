I have written a rather small App with only one activity. From my understanding an activity has to be seen as kind of a view and controller in one class. But even for a little app, with 3 dialogs (made with AlertDialogBuilder and all those anonymous inner classes that come with it) my activity has 500+ LOC and became very hard to maintain. The activity houses mainly android lifecycle handlers and view handling. Business logic is very little. How to handle activity classes to keep them readable and maintainable?
