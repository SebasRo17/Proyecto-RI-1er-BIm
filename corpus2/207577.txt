I'm comparing floats in Java right now and the simplest formula is:               Math.abs(a - b) < THRESHOLD      When naming your variable for the threshold of difference, should you name it delta or epsilon? Specifically, which of the two is the correct term for the smallest value that a floating-point number can represent? Is the term programming language specific, or is it universal across languages?
