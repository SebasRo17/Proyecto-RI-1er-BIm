As someone who first encountered relational databases and SQL at uni in the early 90's, and who has spend a goodly slice of a fifteen year career working with MS SQL Server, I'm probably a textbook example of the people who, according to NoSQL enthusiasts, "have SQL as my hammer and see everything as a nail." So, to broaden my horizons, I'd like to do some sort of mess-around project using one of these NoSQL databases, as a learning experience. Question is, though, which one should I mess around with?   * MongoDB seems to be one of the best known and most respected   * Raven DB? It's getting some buzz and Hibernating Rhinos have made stuff I respect.   * CouchDB, since it's part of the Apache project?   * something else? I don't have a problem to solve, a project to complete, or a client to satisfy, so I'm not asking which might be best suited to any particular purpose. Just recommendations based on quality, potential, and perhaps most importantly, availability of good docs, guides, tutorials, screencasts, etc. Oh, C# / .NET is my field of expertise, so looking for something which fits that well, e.g. has C# examples in its documentation. Any tips?
