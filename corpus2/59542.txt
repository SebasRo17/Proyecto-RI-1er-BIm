Suppose I do some big experiment, presumably in a `Table[]`, or a `ParallelTable[]`. Experience shows that there is a non-zero probability of Mathematica (or the computer) crashing part-way through (usually through excess of ambition by the user, but whatever), so it would be nice to export the results of the individual computations as soon as they become available. Is there any preferred way of doing that? (`Reap[]` and `Sow[]` seem like they could do the right thing, but it seems likely that they wait for the whole computation to finish). (and, by the way, I have no idea what the right tag for this is, maybe someone can help).
