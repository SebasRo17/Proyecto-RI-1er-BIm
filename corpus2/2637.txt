Trying to round-trip expressions through JSON, I'm getting unexpected errors for held expressions, and would be grateful for advice or clues. Consider, first, something that works well               Export[Environment["USERPROFILE"] <> "\\AppData\\Local\\test.json", {1, 2, 3},"JSON"]      and read it back in               Import[Environment["USERPROFILE"] <> "\\AppData\\Local\\test.json","JSON"]      producing the expected `{1, 2, 3}`. However, when I try a held expression, such as (and now you can see why I might want to do this):               Export[       Environment["USERPROFILE"] <> "\\AppData\\Local\\test.json",       HoldComplete[myList = {1, 2, 3}],       "JSON"]      and we get               Export::badval: The element Data contains invalid values. >>      I haven't been able to find anything useful on this error message. I suspect it's something to do with `HoldComplete` and its friends not being real expressions, but rather some kinds of special syntax in the front end or the kernel, but it's a bit surprising since one of the oft-repeated slogans in Mathematica is _everything is an expression_. Btw, lest we think that the assignment to `myList` is the problem, the following fails with the same message:               Export[       Environment["USERPROFILE"] <> "\\AppData\\Local\\test.json",       HoldComplete[{1, 2, 3}],       "JSON"]
