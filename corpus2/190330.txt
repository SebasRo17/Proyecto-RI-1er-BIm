I know this is a place where people ask advice for designing code. I am at a bit strange side on my coding quest, on one side people send me design stuff. Special graphics and ideas on how they should be shown in a program workflow. (i think the marketing designers are a bit to powerfull in this project They tend to think here that their pictures are the program itself, but all that coding still has to be written still ..by me in 1 week.. ) They want tweans of graphics and rotation etc.. Well in short this reminded me of things i have seen in flash But flash is for the web, as far as i know. But i think.. those people most likely use Adobe software so might safe it as some Adobe flash formats. In the end it is all about a interface for a machine Because of some hardware limits, i need to do it all in .net 2 on normal win forms. And on slow PC hardware (no direct10 or so).. directX is to much for me to finish in 1 week anyway Now i was thinking would it be possible to run flash on a form, or what would be something close the the Flash Experience ..you know text tweens/ slide ins etc something that could be combined with C# ?.
