I need to plot ticks with values on the following `ParametricPlot[]` ![Parametric Plot of A2\(gamma\) and A4\(gamma\)](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CZq2W.png) The ellipse can be obtained by               F[k_, x_, y_, z_, w_] = (-1)^(z + w - 1) ((2 x + 1) (2 y + 1) (2 w + 1) (2 k      + 1))^(0.5) ThreeJSymbol[{x, 1}, {y, -1}, {k, 0}] SixJSymbol[{x, y, k}, {w, w, z}];          A[k_, x_, y_, z_, w_, d_] = (F[k, x, x, z, w] + 2*d*F[k, x, y, z, w] +      d*d*F[k, y, y, z, w])/(1 + d*d);               ParametricPlot[{A[2, 1, 2, 2, 2, d]*F[2, 2, 2, 0, 2],      A[4, 1, 2, 2, 2, d]*F[4, 2, 2, 0, 2]}, {d, -2000,      2000}, (*Frame->True,*) FrameLabel -> {"A_{22}", "A_{44}"},       PlotRange -> {{-0.5, 0.5}, {-0.5, 0.5}}, PlotPoints -> 1000]      I tried it with Meshpoints, even though I need thicks with the values, and could not even figure this out. As the uploaded pictures says: The curve is labelled with values of the parameter `delta' = delta/(1+|delta|)`. In my case `delta` is `d`.
