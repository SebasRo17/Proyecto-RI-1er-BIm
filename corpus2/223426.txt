I was hoping someone might have some ideas on how to create a RESTful web API where models/entities are searchable by a foreign key. I see a a lot of tutorials where the functionality consist of listing all records in the entire model or retrieving a single record from the model by a primary key, but not by an arbitrary/foreign key. It my be as simple as checking for extra conditions in the request but I thought I would get some advice all the same.
