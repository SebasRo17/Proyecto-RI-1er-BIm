I have put the "lib_mysqludf_sys.dll" in C:/Xampp/mysql/lib/plugin. in "my.ini" config file the plugin directory has been set correctly. after putting that .dll file in the appropriate place, I restarted the mysql server. all things seems are correct. then I write CREATE FUNCTION sys_exec RETURNS INT SONAME 'lib_mysqludf_sys.dll' in phpmyadmin but I confront with Can't open shared library 'lib_mysqludf_sys.dll' (errno: 193 ) ... can anybody help me and say to me where I have done incorrectly or might have not done? your cooperation is appreciated before. meisam...
