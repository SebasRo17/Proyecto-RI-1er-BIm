Sometimes we need higher numerical precision to deal with large number cancellation in an equation. But if this cancellation happens only in a small (and known) parameter space, would it be possible to only use high precision calculation in that small part of the parameter space? For example, something like               NDSolve[{y'[x] == y[x] Cos[x + y[x]], y[0] == 1}, y, {x, 0, 30},        WorkingPrecision -> If[x < 5, $MachinePrecision, 50],            PrecisionGoal -> If[x < 5, $MachinePrecision, 50]]      This code doesn't work, because _Mathematica_ doesn't relate the `x` in the two `If` expressions to the `x` in the ODE. Is there any way to make the above idea work?
