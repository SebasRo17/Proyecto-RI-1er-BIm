Is there any way to force `Det` to do itself in a certain way? I've been running the same notebook on 2 differents computer, one MacOSX Lion and one W7 (both 32bit) with _Mathematica 8.0.0.0_ on the two of them, and we don't get the same `Det` expression and `Solve[Det[F[x]]==0,x]` doesn't give the same solutions either. How to know which one says the truth? How could we calculate the `Det` in order the have the same solutions on both computers?   Note: as its the same nb the matrices (26*26) are exactly the same.
