I am working with two multi-variable functions `A` and `B`. They depend on some counting factors `n` and `n primed` (integers, larger than, or equal to zero) and additional real variables `x, y, z`. My functions are actually complicated, but for simplicity assume, for example,                A[nn_, np_, x_, y_, z_] := (1/nn + 1/np) (2 x + 2 y + 2 z);           B[nn_, np_, x_, y_,z_] := (1/Factorial[nn] + 1/Factorial[np]) (3 x + 3 y + 3 z);      I would like to use an `If` statement to assign either `A` or `B` to become the definition of a third function `V`. In the example above this is needed to prevent division by zero. I tried different variations of                V[nn_, np_, x_, y_, z_] :=        If[nn > 0 || np > 0, A[nn, np, x, y, z], B[nn, np, x, y, z]];      but I cannot figure out what the correct syntax is. What I would like to accomplish is to use a statement that assigns the expression given by function `A` to function `V` when `n` or `n prime` are NOT zero and assigns function `B` to function `V` when either `n` or `n primed` are zero.
