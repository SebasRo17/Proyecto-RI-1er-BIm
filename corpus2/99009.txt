I am interested in hearing how various people remain in the Software Engineering industry for so long in their careers. I am at a crossroads myself as I have worked with Network Engineering, Communications, VoIP, Parking, Government Contracting, and Military related projects. **Question: How does one manage to stay relevant as a programmer while bouncing between different engineering areas (Testing, Integration, etc) and remaining motivated in the profession?** Old questions:   1. Do you bounce between pure Software Tester, Integration, and back to straight coding?    2. How do you prevent being a one-hit wonder in this economy?    3. How do you find your passion ?
