Have you had this problem? You are building a complex web application for a target market, and after a while you reach a point in complexity where you can't decide if you are building more than one product. A decision has to be made. Do you add features to turn it into a framework for multiple domains or do you resist the urge and focus just on the one product. I'll give you a theoretical example; You are building a web application for reviewing Movies and Television shows. Users can login and write their own reviews. After months of hard work you start to see how useful the application would be for reviewing Automobiles. All the terms/themes are for the Movie/TV industry. So you would have to refactor and take into account a multisite structure to run the web application for two different markets. What do you call this type of problem, and how do you know when you should and should not split the project up into multiple domains.
