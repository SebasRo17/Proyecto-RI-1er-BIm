I am working on an ASP.NET application. One requirement by the users is they are capable of exporting to Excel of some UIs. I have worked on them using the Infragistics library, and I have supplied them with the exports they want. However, some of the UIs they see are so complex that it takes a great amount of time to be accomplished (for a web application experience). For instance, an export may take a few minutes, like 4-5 minutes. I was wondering, if there would be a way, in which I could make this task to be done asynchronously, using threads and make it to last shorter.
