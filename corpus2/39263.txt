I have the following construction, which defines a function that I subsequently call in a loop multiple times. I use this very often, but I have never looked into if there is a more professional way to do it in Mathematica. I would be happy to get feedback on my following MWE               g[x_] := Log[x] + 1000;          f[a_, x_, c_] := {        temp = 4*a*c + g[a] // N;        a + temp};          data = {};     For[i = 1, i < 10, i++,      data = Append[data, {i, f[i, 1, 1][[1]]}]]      EDIT: The inner part of the function `f` is not important, it could be anything.
