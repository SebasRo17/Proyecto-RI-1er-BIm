Someone told me `Session` or `HttpContext.Current.User` will return different value when we are working with ajax postback, in case of when the are so many user are live to site. For example, suppose there are 1000 people are online in site, and from them 100 call ajax method/ wenmethod and on this we might get different value of `Session` or `HttpContext.Current.User` as per every user's `Session` or `HttpContext.Current.User` value are different. But my concept says it will return specific person's (who requested) `Session` or `HttpContext.Current.User` value, and server will be clear whose value need to be return. What you all guys says?
