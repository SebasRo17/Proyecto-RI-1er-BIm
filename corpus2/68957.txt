I had thought that this was one of the few _solved problems_ in C# coding standards / style; `Attributes` always appear on the line above the thing to which they are applied _a la_               [SomeClassAttribute]     class SomeClass     {        [SomeFieldAttribute]        bool someField;             [SomeEnumAttribute]        SomeEnum        {           SomeValue        }             [SomeMethodAttribute]        void SomeMethod()         {         }     }      But recently I've started to see `Attributes` in-line with the thing to which they are applied:               [SomeClassAttribute] class SomeClass     {        [SomeFieldAttribute] bool someField;             [SomeEnumAttribute] SomeEnum        {           SomeValue        }             [SomeMethodAttribute] void SomeMethod()         {         }     }      For example on the Microsoft website and in the FileHelpers open source project. Is this just _laziness_ on the part of the author of example code, or something that people actually use on a day to day basis, and if so why?
