Should I break SQL queries in different lines? For example in the project I am working on, we have a query that is taking 1600 columns! 1600 + tab chars. I wrote queries like this:                  "SELECT bla , bla2 , bla FROM bla " .           "WHERE bla=333 AND bla=2" .            "ORDER BY nfdfsd ...";      But they demanded me to put them in one line and said that my style is bad formatting. Why it is bad practice?
