Does anybody have any advice on this? I currently work as a kind of lead developer/team leader and we have some remote team members and sometimes a contractor or two. At times, the entire team might be working on a large project and server details are usually managed by the entire team. What is the best practice way to deal with this? Is there something I'm missing? I can't see anyway to have somebody access a server without the details. Also, I'm considering the security protection they have on their machines, should I be ensuring certain things happen to the data like encryption, shredding. Should I use a 'company' proxy for connections? Please advise!
