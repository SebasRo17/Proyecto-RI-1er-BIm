I have a javascript project which uses Grunt and several plug-ins such as:   * jshint   * qunit   * requirejs optimizer Not all of the developers run the grunt tasks locally (e.g. jshint, qunit), so they might not know if code they committed has issues. It's easy enough to set up a grunt watch task, but emailing the team upon error/warning has been less obvious than I expected. I was expecting to find something like grunt-contrib-emailstatus for emailing a nicely-formatted status, but so far have not come across this. Did I miss it? If not, what's the recommended practice here? In the past I've seen things like Cruise Control, Jenkins, or Hudson handle the build status reporting, but it seems like too big a hammer for this nail. And on the other hand, trying to use crontab to email status seems too small.
