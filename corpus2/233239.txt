I'm wondering about functions used like this:               object1->objectMethod1(arg1, arg2);      if `objectMethod1`:   \- does not change the object state   \- does not use the object's state at all   \- is used by the class extensively   \- logically fits as being used by the class should it be made into a member function? example:               class CSVFile {     private:       filestream stream       string header       int num_columns     public:       CSVFile(string filename)       CSVFile() throws DefaultConstructorException()     ...     CSVFile::initHeader() {       header = stream.getLine()       assert(isInCSVFormat(header)) <-- that      should isInCSVFormat(string) be a member function or not?
