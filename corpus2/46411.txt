Are there any processes, guidelines or best practices that can be followed for the successful implementation of a common code libraries. Currently we are discussing the implementation of common code libraries within our dev team. In our instance, our common code libraries would compliment mainstream .net software packages we develop against. In particular, im interested in details and opinions on:   * Organic vs design first approach   * Version management    * Success stories (when the do work)    * Horror stories (when they dont work) Many Thanks
