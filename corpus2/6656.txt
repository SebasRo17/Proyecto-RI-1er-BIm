This is related to my C++ teacher of semester one and, unfortunately, the coming second semester as well. I have already completed the first assignment; needless to say, it's horrible. How can I gently tell my professor that the homework he is forcing us to do is giving us a bad example of good OOP as well as bad OOP practice in C++. For example, he is forcing us to class all of our functions, use get/set methods for all members and painstakingly horrible functions to call our data. This is an example of the homework project we have to do:               AuctionApplication aA;     Auction *auction = aA.CreateAuction("Hello");     Bidder *bidder   = aA.CreateBidder(", World");     Bid *bid         = aA.bid(bidder, auction, 0);          std::cout << "Auction:  "  << aA.GetLatestBid(auction)->GetAuction()->GetName()               << "\nBidder:  " << aA.GetLatestBid(auction)->GetBidder()->GetName()               << "\nPrice:  "  << aA.GetLatestBid(auction)->GetPrice() << "\n\n";          std::cout << "Auction:  "  << bid->GetAuction()->GetName()               << "\nBidder:  " << bid->GetBidder()->GetName()               << "\nPrice:  "  << bid->GetPrice();      Every single function must have a non-void return type, I cannot simply retrieve any data whatsoever without jumping through hoops. Above that, it's not even encapsulated properly, as I can easily get a bid member and then, if I was an unknowing programmer, continue programming with said value. There is no const-correctness, there is no efficiency (everything is pass by value, even vectors and lists), there is no exception safety, nothing whatsoever. The homework assignments are bug-ridden and goes against the nature of C++, which is, in my opinion, OOP in moderation, as it demands. I'm not sure if it's me, and how my other classmates feel about it. I know my friend feels the same way, but most of the class is struggling as it is with a fail-rate of 60% on exams. Is there any way I can tell my teacher to try and give better assignments in a more C++ style environment without possibly raising his ire? Posting this in Programmers as opposed to SO since the question deals with how to talk to programming professors, not write actual code :)
