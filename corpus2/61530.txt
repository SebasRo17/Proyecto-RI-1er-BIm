I am a fairly novice programmer - 6 months into an internship. I have decided to sign up to an Open Source project to learn new skills, and I have been accepted onto one. It seems the project is quite early in its life. They accept beginner programmers and I have explained that I am one. Obviously as this is my first contribution, I don't want to annoy anybody ont he project. As such, what things do I need to be aware of? Any specific etiquette I should be aware of? Will I need any specific software? I have VS2010 which is okay for C#, but what about source control? Is that managed through the Codeplex site? Thanks.
