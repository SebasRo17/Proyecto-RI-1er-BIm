Let's say I have a one dimension list `d` with length `L`. The $x$-axis in the plot starts from `{2013, 8, 28 + start}` and ends in `{2013, 8, 28 + end}`, and I want to change the `start` and `end` date with `Manipulate`. So               d[[1]] (*--> 2013/8/28*)          d[[2]] (*--> 2013/8/29*)      So I think it would be:               Manipulate[       DateListPlot[d, {{2013, 8, 28 + start}, {2013, 8, 28 + end}}],       {{start, 0}, 0, L},       {{end, L}, 0, L}     ]      But when I plot it, it gives me an error when `a>3` because the day of the date is greater than `31` (I think). How would be the correct way to do this?
