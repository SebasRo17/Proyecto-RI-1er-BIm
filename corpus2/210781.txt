I've been programming a lot with C# on Visual Studio and many minor/other languages, but I'm having a really hard time to get the grasp of ActiveX, OLE, COM interfaces. All I got is that they're like dll, you can write something in a language and make it work on another. Searching here but found nothing, searched on google but I found only hardcore explanation of people assuming it's the easiest thing in the world and building explanation on the assumption you already know what they are, giving just a line or two of explanation about them. I really need to know what's better now (as I've seen on wikipedia ActiveX it's the evolution of both COM and OLE which are older standards...) and a full blown explanation of them, possibly with code in it. In C# and Visual studio it's all much easier. You can create dll and include them in your project without much effort... Please explain here or paste links here with all the explanations you know/can find... Thanks
