It seems like to become a successful programmer one should choose a single language, technology, platform, field and focus on it. The problem is there are so many interesting things in this area I can't stop choosing, I found myself learning basics of a lot of programming languages/technologies and immediately moving to something else. So I'm spending a lot of time with such a little use. I've been .NET/C#/WPF developer for more than a year now, I'm not a bad programmer, but I could be so much better if I were more focused on my current technology stack though I feel like I'll be stuck with making meaningless business application and GUI this case. May be getting a fulfilling job making something useful would help me, but to get this kind of job one should already be proficient in some field. So I desperately need an advice. How to choose your way and be sure you're not making a mistake? How to stop worrying and start programming?
