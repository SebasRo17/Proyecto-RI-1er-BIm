I've gotten into the habit of using excessively descriptive names. In addition, I've also gotten into the habit of creating the conditions for ifs like so:               bool user_is_female  = user.get_gender() == GENDER_FEMALE;     bool user_is_warrior = user.get_unit_class() == CLASS_WARRIOR;     bool user_can_wear_battle_skirt = user_is_female && user_is_warrior;          if (user_can_wear_battle_skirt) {         user.equip(EQUIPMENT_BATTLE_SKIRT);     }      So, yeah, I dropped the "== true" or "true ==" that I've been taught was good practice. It seems to need less comments too. It is quite wordy/lengthy though. I was going for making the code more readable. So should I continue using this method? Any alternatives?               if (user.can_wear(battle_skirt)) {         user.equip(battle_skirt);     }      Was a suggestion that I had to delete because I posted in the wrong place.
