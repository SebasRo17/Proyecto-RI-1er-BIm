`x\[Prime]` looks like $x_'$, ugly right? Is there a way to make a symbol with prime to look like $x'$? * * * That's what I'm trying right now:               Notation[ x_', Primed[x_]]     Primed[x_] := Symbol[SymbolName[x] <> "\[Prime]"]      But how then I use it in patterns? If I do this:               f[q_, q':_] := q + q'      Weird syntax errors appear:               Syntax::sntxf: "T[r_," cannot be followed by "q':_]".     Syntax::tsntxi: "q':_" is incomplete; more input is needed.     Syntax::sntxi: Incomplete expression; more input is needed .      If we replace `q':_` with `Pattern[q',_]` another error:               Pattern::patvar: "First element in pattern Pattern[q',_] is not a valid pattern name. "      But `Head[q']` returns `Symbol` and `Pattern` requires a `Symbol` as first parameter. What is wrong?
