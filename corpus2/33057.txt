My Stack Exchange favorites are getting bigger and bigger. It is becoming unmanageable and is getting hard to find what I look for. A related question is _Sort favorite questions_. Is it possible to use the structure of Mathematica's _Documentation Center_ to arrange my favorite questions by subject? For instance, adding a subtopic with links to Stack Exchange. Is it to difficult to do?
