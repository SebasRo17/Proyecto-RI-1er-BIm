I have my first programming job interview today (in a few hours!) and would like some advice.      **The job title is Trainee Programmer and it is for a secure printing company.** I have found a lot on the internet about programming interviews, but since this is a Trainee role I have no idea what to expect. I know that the company prefers Java and C#, and I have a little knowledge of them, but my main language is C++. **I would like:** * Some pointers on what to expect from this Trainee interview. * Tips on how to improve my chances.
