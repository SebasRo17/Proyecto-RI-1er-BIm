I have several equations with many variables, and here and there I would like to do a variable substitution. For example, in the equation:               a (b + 42 c / d)      I might want to remap variables _a * b --> p_ and _a * c / d --> q_ in order to get:               p + 42 q       Can _Mathematica_ do this? I tried to play with the `With[]` and `Rule[]` function and the like, but that doesn't seem to produce anything. I can imagine that _Mathematica_ is not capable of doing such a thing, but I thought it would be worth asking. **And the pro question:** And then very much related to this: is there a way to use `With[]` not to set a single variable but to set variable relations, e.g. the sum or product of two variables. So that this:               With[{a * b = 5},  a (b + 42 c / d)] (* This doesn't work*)      would reduce to:               5 + 42 a * c / d
