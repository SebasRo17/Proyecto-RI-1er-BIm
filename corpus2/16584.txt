I want to obtain a good numerical approximation (up to 10 decimal place would be ok for me) to an integral: $$ \int^{\infty}_{0} f(r)r^2dr $$ I am using the function $f(r)$, which is related to the function $$g(r)=-\frac{\sqrt[3]{3} \sqrt[3]{e^{-2 r}}}{\pi ^{2/3}}-\frac{\sqrt[3]{2 \pi }}{5 \sqrt[3]{e^{-2 r}} \left(\frac{3 \sqrt[3]{\pi } \sinh ^{-1}\left(\frac{2 \sqrt[3]{2 \pi }} {\sqrt[3]{e^{-2 r}}}\right)}{5\ 2^{2/3} \sqrt[3]{e^{-2 r}}}+1\right)}$$ by the relation $$ f(r)=-\frac{1}{4\pi}\nabla^2_{r,\theta,\phi} g(r) $$ Obviously, explicit integration is impossible. The product $f(r)r^2$ is well- behaved and integrable for sure. The function $f(r)$ decays faster than $\frac{1}{r^2}$. When I try to increase `WorkingPrecision` in `NIntegrate`, _Mathematica_ says the expression I am integrating itself is not specified so precisely. How can I overcome this? Any tips/ hints? I am asking for a general strategy to obtain a precise value of the integral:               NIntegrate[f[r]*4*Ï€*r^2, {r, 0, y}, WorkingPrecision -> x]         where y and x are some numbers. P.S., I've been using _Mathematica_ for only two days.
