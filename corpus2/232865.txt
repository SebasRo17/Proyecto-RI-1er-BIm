I am very curious as to thoughts and industry best practices regarding static members, or entire static classes. Are there any downsides to this, or does it participate in any anti-patterns? I see these entities as "utility classes/members", in the sense that they don't require or demand instantiating the class in order to provide the functionality. What are the general thoughts and industry best practices on this? See the below example classes and members to illustrate what I am referencing.               // non-static class with static members     //     public class Class1     {         // ... other non-static members ...              public static string GetSomeString()         {             // do something         }     }          // static class     //     public static class Class2     {         // ... other static members ...              public static string GetSomeString()         {             // do something         }     }      Thank you in advance!
