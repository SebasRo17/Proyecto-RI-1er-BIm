I moved to another city and the weather sucks. Sometimes I feel like getting sad and so I go to _wolfram|alpha_ and check for example ${}$ ![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/nYzrp.png) http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=weather+in+Rome+vs.+London ${}$ Today I feel like getting depressed. Consequently I wonder if there is a way to import all the data into _Mathematica_ and write a function               TemperatureComparison[{city1,city2},{date1,date2}]      which should evaluate to $$ \frac{ \int_{\text{date 1}}^{\text{date 2}} \left(T_{\text{city 2}}(t)-T_{\text{city 1}}(t)\right) \text dt } { t_{\text{date 2}}-t_{\text{date 1}} },$$ $T_{\text{city X}}(t)$ being the temperature in $\text{city X}$ at time $t$.
