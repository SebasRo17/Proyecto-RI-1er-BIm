Unfortunately, Excel format is required for the project I am working on. I have no problems getting the data I need in objects and arrays, and currently PHPExcel is doing handling the document generation. It works, but it's slow and loopy. Was wondering if there is a more efficient server language to generate Excel documents (not CSVs). This is a pure Linux environment so I need to stay away from .NET. I am open to any programming language that does it cleanly and efficiently.
