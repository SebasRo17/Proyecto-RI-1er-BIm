I have a command line app, that will be multi-threaded and serve inbound and outbound clients. It will send and receive Binary data structures generated by protobuf.net My question is, how should I go about having the clients send and receive data? Does my usage of protobuf.net mean that WCF is less relevant? or just certain serialization features?
