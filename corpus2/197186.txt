I am reading "Javascript : The good Parts" to improve my Javascript bases and knowledge. I was reading stuff about `prototype` and I encountered in this function :               var stooge = { ... }      if(typeof Object.create !== 'function'){        Object.create = function(o) {        var F = function () {};        F.prototype = o;        return new F();        };     }     var another_stooge = Object.create(stooge);      I didn't really get the meaning and the benefit of creating this function.
