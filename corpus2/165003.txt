The company I work for develops custom factory automation applications for multiple customers. Even though each application is custom, they contain common code which is re-used across projects. One of the customers is now looking for the source code to their application, which has caused a major storm in the company. Management have decided that we can't give them the source to the shared components as they are used by other customers. I've been asked to modify the shared components 'enough' so as they aren't common. So my questions are: 1) Legally, should there be any problem with re-using common components for different customer? 2) If I really need to modify the common components, then how much is 'enough' ? (I know this sucks, but I either do this or hand in my notice). Oh yeah, and my company has no license in place with any of these customers.
