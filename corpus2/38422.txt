I want to solve the following function:               DSolve[(A1*Exp[B1*f[x]] + A2*Exp[B2*f[x]])*f'[x] == A1*Exp[B1*x] + A2*Exp[B2*x], f[x], x]      And this is what I get as an answer:               {{f[x] -> InverseFunction[(A1 E^(B1 #1))/B1 + (A2 E^(B2 #1))/B2 &][(A1 E^(B1 x))/B1 + (A2 E^(B2 x))/B2 + C[1]]}}      Mathematica says that some results could be given in the form of the inverse functions. Does anybody know how I can solve this to get some result? Generally the given equation involves the function composition, and has the following form: $(g \circ f)f'=g$, where Where $g \circ f=g(f(x))$. By inspection, $f(x)=x$ is a solution. There are also other solutions. Anybody has idea how to tackle the problem to find more solutions?
