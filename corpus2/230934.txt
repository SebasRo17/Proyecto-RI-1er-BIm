I'm currently developing a product (in C#) that will be available for downloading for free but requires a monthly subscription in order to be used after a specific trial period. What i am intending to do is to let the user register an account on our website and charge it with credits in order to use the application. However a couple of problems faced me as a new comer to the licensing field   * How is this logic usually implemented.   * How to connect my C# application to my website's database and grab the data required (is trial expired, if yes does the user have enough credits).   * How to make sure that i am at least 80% (or so) secure from attackers who might start some MATM attack in order to alter the received packets and gain unauthorized access to my program.   * As i already heard. Using SSL may grantee me that my application is connecting to the right address, But how again to make such connection with my basic website. (Wordpress website or VBulletin). Excuse me if my question seems a little broad but i have crawled the internet searching for a specific answer for my needs and found nothing. So i really need an efficient answer (or maybe a conversation) about this :D. Oh and a small declaimer: by saying grabbing `DATA` and so on i am not asking for a way to grab them i am just giving an example of what i want to achieve. For the sake of narrowing up the things i came up with an idea that i want to know more about.   * Can i use `Wordpress` or VBulletin and create and RSA encrypted login to them and let the response be encrypted too ?
