I'm wondering if anyone has a good solution for when you're working as a team and there's a single file used throughout a project (like a styles.css file) and everyone needs to use it throughout the day - inevitably someone will make changes and save without grabbing the most recent version first. Is there some sort of group editing program for Windows/web? We currently just access the CSS files via FTP & edit in our usual editors. Probably an editor that can load & save changes on the fly?
