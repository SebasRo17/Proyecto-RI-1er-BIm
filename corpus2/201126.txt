I currently have a SQLite DB on my server that is needed by an android app I am currently developing. I download the DB to the android device using HTTP each time the contents are changed. Does anyone have any suggestions as to how to do this more efficient. ie. when the database gets large I don't want the android user to have to download the whole database again just because one record was added.
