_Context_ I am interested in computing numerically the number of extrema at a given threshold for random fields. These numbers are expectations of MultinormalDistributions. _Problem_ This integral should give the differential number of maxima of a scale invariant Gaussian random field ($\gamma=0$ i.e. white noise) at threshold zero.               NExpectation[(-(x*y) + z^2)*Boole[x*y - z^2 <= 0],      {x, z, y} \[Distributed]      MultinormalDistribution[{0, 0, 0}, {{3/8, 0, 1/8}, {0, 1/8, 0}, {1/8, 0, 3/8}}]]      Its value should be `1/4/Sqrt[3]= 0.144338` whereas Mathematica returns 0.138245 which is wrong by a factor of 5 %. Strangely enough if I split the integral in two as               NExpectation[(-(x*y) + z^2)*Boole[x + y >= 0 && x*y - z^2 <= 0],       {x, z, y} \[Distributed]       MultinormalDistribution[{0, 0, 0},{{3/8, 0, 1/8}, {0, 1/8, 0}, {1/8, 0, 3/8}}]] +     NExpectation[(-(x*y) + z^2)*Boole[x + y <= 0 && x*y - z^2 <= 0],        {x, z, y} \[Distributed]      MultinormalDistribution[{0, 0, 0}, {{3/8, 0, 1/8}, {0, 1/8, 0}, {1/8, 0, 3/8}}]]      Mathematica returns the correct answer to 5 digits. I understand integrating numerically Boole is likely to cause problems but I am nonetheless surprised by the poor result. On a related topic                NExpectation[-(x*y) + z^2 \[Conditioned] (x*y - z^2 < 0),       {x, z, y} \[Distributed]       MultinormalDistribution[{0, 0, 0}, {{3/8, 0, 1/8}, {0, 1/8, 0}, {1/8, 0, 3/8}}]]      seems to take a while before returning unevaluated (even though it should probably be the correct way to proceed?). **Questions**   1. Why is the first method doing so poorly?   2. Why is the second method failing altogether?   3. Any guidance on how to tell NExpectation to be "smart" about the Boole condition? Thanks Regards
