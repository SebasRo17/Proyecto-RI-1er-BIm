I'm not expecting C# to be on par with say Java or Python in the open source community, but it still surprises me just how far behind it is. 'Multi language' open source repos like google code or github have barely any C# projects in comparison to the other languages I mentioned. I'd like to see C# and .Net shake off that slight corporate feel and move more into the open source arena but I just can't see that happening. I'd be interested to hear peoples opinion on why this might be?
