In Java, the `String` object is both immutable and also a pointer (aka reference type). I'm sure there are other types/objects which are both immutable and a pointer as well and that this extends further than just Java. I can not think where this would be desirable possibly due to my own experience I've only used either a reference types OR immutable primitive types. Can some one please give me a situation where it would be useful so I can get an appreciation for their meaning/value/concept.
