What practices do you apply when working with large teams on multiple versions of a software or multiple competing projects? What are best practices that can be used to still get the right things done first? Is there information available how big IT companies do development and management of some of their large projects, e.g. things like Oracle Database, WebSphere Application Server, Microsoft Windows, ....?
