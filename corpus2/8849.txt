I've been using               scPhiDecomp[expr_]:= PolynomialReduce[expr, {x^2-y^2,2 x y}, {x,y}]      which works great on               scPhiDecomp[a x^2 + 2c x y -a y^2]     >> {{a,c},0}      but doesn't do what I want on               scPhiDecomp[y (a x^2 + 2c x y -a y^2)]     >> {{0,(a x)/2+c y},-a y^3}      How do I use `PolynomialReduce[]` to produce `{{a y, c y}, 0}` on the second expression, while still producing the desired result on the 1st? Thanks, Keith
