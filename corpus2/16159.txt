This question is raised from the problem of package `FiniteFields` being very slow (please, see the corresponding question): I have had an evidence that Mathematica takes the exponential time from count of multiplications/additions to compute, say, just the value of polynomial at specified point. Please, see the following example:               << FiniteFields`;          Table[       AbsoluteTiming@         Sum[           GF[2, 12][RandomInteger[{1, 2}, 12]] x^i,           {i, 0, deg}         ] //. {x -> GF[2, 12][{0, 1}]},       {deg, 12, 22}      ]      For Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2540M CPU @ 2.60 GHz I have received the following results of computation time (in seconds):               {0.0440, 0.0780, 0.1550, 0.3350, 0.7230, 1.5470, 3.1891, 6.7934, 14.3468, 30.1807, 64.2497}      I have to do common polynomial stuff over finite fields extensions. For instance, factorization (looking for roots) and multiplication. Does any fast solution exist for this? Thank you!
