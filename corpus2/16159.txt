We're outsourcing some work to an external developer, so I'm busy writing up a contract about what constitutes a deliverable. So far I require that the code is shipped with automated tests. But, what is a reasonable way to specify the detail of tests up-front in the contract in a measurable way? I'm loathe to say "100% code coverage" because it's been established pretty often that 100% is pretty meaningless, and the diminishing returns above about 70-80% would probably just be pushing up our costs unnecessarily, and possibly even pushing up the complexity of certain things that might otherwise be very simple. Internally we pretty much leave it up to our developers to decide on the level of tests needed, based on their intuition and experience. With a contractor however there is a fixed price that has to be agreed to up front and we need some way to enforce a certain level of quality. Any suggestions or recommended reading matter would be appreciated!
