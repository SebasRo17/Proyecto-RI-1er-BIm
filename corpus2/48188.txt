Is it possible to solve an equation in which some some of the parameters have defined ranges? Example:               Solve[x^2 + 0.09149 x + 6.263*10^-6 + kp (10.95 x + 0.9574) == 0 &&            y^2 + 0.09149 y + 6.263*10^-6 + kp (10.95 y + 0.9574) == 0 &&            kp (10.95 z + 0.9574) == 0, {kp}]      where `x < -4` and `y < -5` and `0 > z > -5`. I am trying to solve for variable `kp` and would like to know how the value of `kp` differs for different values of x, y and z which is defined. X and y shall of course have some kind of max value for which it shall evaluate the solve function. Ohh.. one important fact. Kp can't become negative. it's the main reason why i want to to solve it for for changing parameter defined within a range.
