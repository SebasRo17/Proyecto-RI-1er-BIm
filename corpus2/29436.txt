We're about to go live with a new version of our system. It's getting really close to Christmas. I work in a very small company. Everyone will be on leave or sporadically available over the next week or so. I've argued with my boss that this is very risky and that we should go live in the new year when everyone is back and when we can provide full support. He is unflinching - he argues that we need to go live sooner - so that we can get new users and more revenue which we need. The number of new users will be minor amount over the next week or so. There has been a decent amount of system testing performed on the system. However a new live system, in my experience, needs a lot of care and attention in the first few days. Am I being pessimistic or realistic? Update - January: The system did not go live over Christmas. Ongoing system testing revealed various problems. So no support issues to deal with. Still preparing for release...
