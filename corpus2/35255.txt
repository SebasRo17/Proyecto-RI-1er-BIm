The image below shows the cumulative distribution of a normal distribution with mean = 4 and standard deviation = 1. Notice that if you have a value with a rank of 0.8 (meaning it would be 80th item from the bottom in a sorted list of 100 items) you could get the corresponding value from the CDF of a normal distribution of any mean/sd (if you knew how to do it). I'll bet there is a nice way to do this. I can only think of overly complicated, never do it what way! ways. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KBJau.png)
