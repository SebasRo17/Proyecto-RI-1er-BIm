How do I create a new shortcut for creating a "Equal Symbol Aligned Math Cell" in Mathematica 8? **Update** I meant a keyboard shortcut. An "Equal Symbol Aligned Math Cell" is exactly what @Heike mentioned. I noticed that for some stylesheets there are keyboard shortcuts e.g. Cmd+7 for text, and I was wondering how to edit the stylesheets to add my own shortcuts, in particular for the math cells.
