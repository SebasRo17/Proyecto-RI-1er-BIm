There have been some questions dealing with how to draw individual US states since such data doesn't come with _Mathematica_ through its `CountryData` which offers similar functionality for countries. However, thus far, I haven't seen any questions regarding Swedish counties and municipalities. How would can I get similar functionality for Swedish counties and municipalities as that which exists in `CountryData`?
