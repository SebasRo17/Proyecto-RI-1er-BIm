I have the following problem solved in Mathematica               m=Table[For[i = 0, i <= .7, i = i + 0.1,        Print[NMinimize[{i*Abs[(E^-k*(N*p)^k)/k! - k^-g] +            i/3*Abs[p - N^-r] + (1 - (2*i)/3)*            Abs[Log[N]/Log[N*p] - (A*Log[N - B] + CC)], A != 0, B != 0,           CC != 0, N > 0, k > 1, N <= 1000, k <= 100, N - k >= 0,           N - B > 0, BB, g > 2, g < 3, r > 0, r < 1, N^-r < 1, k/N < 1,           p <= 1}, {A, B, CC, N, k, g, r, p},          Method -> "SimulatedAnnealing"]]], {j, 1}]      I want to turn it into a form which can be exportable to excel. I tried:               m//TableForm      but doesn't work. Can you please help me? Thank you in advance
