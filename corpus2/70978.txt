It seems strange, but my manager sits right next to me and, well, when he isn't near, I feel free, and I'm planning, doing, etc, doing my work with flashes in the eyes, feel accomplishments. But everything is opposite when he's on his workplace, I simply have to force myself to do anything, I'm feeling very much worried and nervous and my brain doesn't work normally. How to deal with it?
