Object `x` should be composed of thick lines, object `su` should have no or a thin border. With `BoundaryStyle`, I am not able to differentiate between `x` and `su`. I haven't had much luck with `PlotStyle -> {Thick, }` or `PlotStyle -> {EdgeForm[Thick], }` either.               x1 := {u, 0, 0}     x2 := {u, 1, 1}     x3 := {0, w, w}     x4 := {1, w, w}     x := {x1, x2, x3, x4}     su := {u, (1 - u) w^2 + u w^2, (1 - u) w + u w}     ParametricPlot3D[{x, su}, {u, 0, 1}, {w, 0, 1}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IqCDx.png)
