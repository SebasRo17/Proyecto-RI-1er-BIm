I have built a JavaScript library that I'd like to release for free within my user community. However I want to keep it under control, and not allow my users to pass it on to others without my permission. As far as I can tell, a MIT or GPL license won't work for that scenario. What licensing options do I have? Background: I've had some bad experience in the past where my solutions were used in situations other than the intended purpose, and this triggered maintenance and security issues. I am more careful this time.
