My manager has recently really been pushing to use velocity as a target and measure of productivity. We are currently working at an average velocity of 50 story points. My manager wants us to increase it by 40% to 70 story points (with no increase in team members). If we don't achieve this increase he wants us to deliver a full break down explaining why. The whole idea of measuring team performance by velocity and using it as a target seems wrong to me, but I am finding it difficult to explain why. Any help? Why isn't this the right way to measure and incentivize productivity?
