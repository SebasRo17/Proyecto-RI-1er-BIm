At my company, we have a quagmire of disparate cron jobs (on multiple systems) and manually kicked off processes which keep our business functioning that is a result of years of expedient development and subsequent neglect. Someday, we will need to come up with a more centralized solution for obvious reasons. One thought that we have been kicking around is to use our Continuous Integration software (Jenkins) to run these processes, which seems logical. **My question is whether or not other companies are doing this? Is this a generally accepted practice? Doesn't this conflict with the definition of a CI tool implicit in its name? Are there any other options?** Note: https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Meet+Jenkins Jenkins claims that it focuses on "Monitoring executions of externally-run jobs, such as cron jobs and procmail jobs". I'm not sure if this is exactly what I am talking about.
