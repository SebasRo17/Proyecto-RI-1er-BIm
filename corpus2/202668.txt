We have a large bazaar repository and we want to convert it to a git repository. The bazaar repository contains the folders of each of the interns. Any documentation/code prepared by interns is committed in their directory so there are a huge number of commits. What steps should be performed to securely convert the bazaar repository to a git repository so that we do not lose any commit information. We firstly need to create a backup of the existing bazaar repository and then convert it. Edit: I followed this link: http://librelist.com/browser//cville/2010/2/9/migrate-repository-bzr-to-git/ It's working fine on my system with Ubuntu. But when I try to run it on the actual server it gives me EOF error and crashes               Starting export of 1036 revisions ...     fatal: EOF in data (1825 bytes remaining)     fast-import: dumping crash report to .git/fast_import_crash_11804      Edit 2: I also tried it on a new CentOS system and received the following error               fatal: ambiguous argument 'HEAD': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.     Use '--' to separate paths from revisions
