I'm not sure if this is the best StackExchange to post this question, but I figured it had more to do with the specifics of Mathematica than Quantitative Analysis so I've posted it here. Basically, I am trying to make a notebook in Wolfram Mathematica 9 which allows me to easily monitor and analyse share prices on the British FTSE 100,200 etc. stock exchanges; I know that Mathematica has the `FinancialData[]` function, and I was hoping to be able to use it for the FTSE markets. I have tried the following without success:               FinancialData["^FTAS","Members"]     FinancialData["^FTSE","Members"]      So I tried to look at the entire list of entities contained within `FinancialData` using:               FinancialData[]      However, this yielded a large list of indices and I was not able to find anything useful. The only reference I have managed to find on this was here, but as shown above I have tried this and only got the following output:               Missing["NotAvailable"]      Do I need to preload the british financial data in Mathematica at the beginning of my notebook, or is the data already there I just need to access it in a different way?
