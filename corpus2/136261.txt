I develop a suite of productivity tools, for Mac, iOS and Windows. They all communicate with a sync server via a RESTful interface (using Protocol Buffers), but as we add new platforms, we realize the pain it is to recreate different versions of the same code just to communicate with the client, so we have thought of using a modular design:   * The backend client module would be the same for all clients, so that changes to the protocol can be easily ported to all clients   * Clients we need to support: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Web, possibly Windows Mobile The only way I can think of is via a JavaScript module that's shared across all clients and handles communications with the server, but perhaps that's even more work because of the integration required with the JavaScript interpreter. Maybe we might be better off writing a couple of backend modules instead of just one.
