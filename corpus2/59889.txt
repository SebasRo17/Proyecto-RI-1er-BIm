I have some customers who expect everything for next to nothing. They also want things to behave a certain way, or look a certain way, but when explaining to them why it's not a good idea to implement a certain feature and offering suggestions, they don't listen. When things go wrong, they get moody, and demand I change/recode the entire feature to their liking, but when told that it's because they wanted it that way, they don't listen. I've found that after years of being around these types of people, it's had a major impact on the way I deal with people I can't stand, and I've seriously run out of ideas. How do you deal with people who never listen, never learn, and want everything for free?
