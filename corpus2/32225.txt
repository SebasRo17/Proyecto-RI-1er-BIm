I have a list of coordinate pairs, take for example the following list of three pairs:               exampleList = {       {{151.335, 245.102}, {151.332, 245.187}},        {{41.435, 245.021}, {41.3617, 244.986}},       {{131.048, 243.364}, {131.046, 243.321}}     }      Assuming the list is very large, what is a fast one-liner to calculate the median difference between elements in each pair? The output should be the same as:               Median[exampleList[[All, 1]] - exampleList[[All, 2]]]      Is this the fastest way to proceed?
