When designing an application where scalability is going to be important, it would be useful if the application could be designed to "scale out" on cheap commodity servers. However, there are many scale up applications (see my previous question). Is it always _possible_ to design an application to scale out, or do some requirements make scale out impossible, even if all software can be designed from scratch and no legacy software is involved? I am looking for cases where scale out is an inferior solution to scale up, and where good application design could not mitigate this. In other words, the application _cannot_ be designed to scale out effectively, no matter how hard one tries. I am _not_ looking for cases where legacy software or data structures -- or even entire architectures (as in the answer to the previous question) -- were not designed to scale out and could not be changed. Alternatively, if there is reason to believe that one can _always_ scale out, if the application is well designed, I would love to know that as well. Edit: I am looking for an explicit example of such a system, if there is one.
