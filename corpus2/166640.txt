> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Programming languages with a Lisp-like syntax extension mechanism I'm making a programming language, and, having spent some time in Lisp/Scheme, I feel that my language should be malleable. Should I use macros, or is there something else I might/should use? Is malleable syntax even a good idea? Is it perhaps too powerful a concept? In doing some research, I found `fexprs`. I don't really understand what these are. Help with that in an answer too please. Is it possible to have a language with macros/something-of-a-similar-nature without having s-expressions?
