I'm working with ASP.Net and trying to style an ImageButton. I tried to do this via CSS only to discover that for some reason, .Net writes out an inline style setting the border width to 0 automatically. This overrides the border width from CSS, so I have to set it manually in the codebehind. My question is, should I do all the styling in the codebehind to keep it all in one place, or only do the border width there and do the rest in a style sheet? For clarification, I mean all the styling _for that object_ not for the whole site.
