My current client has several internal products which the IT-department supports. All product owners are non-technical and each application is always developed by one developer (and so is all change requests). The current methodology is a bit like waterfall. All uses cases are defined first by the product owner. Then the application is developed and released into a test-environment. The user tests it and says yes/no. Any changes results in a change request and a new release (including setup-packages). And it continues like that until the user is happy which results in the product going to production. I want to introduce an agile method instead to capture changes quicker and focus on the most important features from start. Scrum seems to be overkill since there only is one developer per project. Any other suggestions? **Edit** My client isn't going use anything that isn't documented. So I'm looking for an established and documented method (if there are one which suits one developer).
