I'm trying to figure out if I can distribute the Faenza icons, which are GPL licensed, with some MIT-licensed software I'm working on. What does the GPL license really mean when applied to a non-software medium, like an icon set, that is primarily used in software applications?   * If I load the icons dynamically from external files instead of compiling them into an executable, would this violate the GPL license?   * If not, would it make a difference if the icons were compiled in?   * If I can compile them into a program, does the license just mean I can't compile the SVG "source code" of the icons into a program?   * If I can't compile the SVG source into a non-GPL program, can I load it dynamically?   * Even if I'm technically allowed to package the icons with my software under some of the above conditions, would I be violating the _spirit_ of the license? Relevant: Does distributing non-GPLd assets with a GPL application violate the license?
