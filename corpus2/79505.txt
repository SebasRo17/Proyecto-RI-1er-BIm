i know that UDP does not care about segment (packet) order and their arrival on the destination. then how on earth are we able to stream videos?   * if a segment is lost (doesn't reach the destination), destination has no idea about it. so, it can't ask the target to retransmit it.   * if a segment arrives out of the order, should't the video being streamed be distorted? since the whole segment order is wrong now, because of that one segment is not on its place.
