I am trying to create a voting system like Stack Exchange. Should I create a table and insert values like following and then sum up the "vote" or there are some better ways to do this? Table name: vote               id  userid   article_id  vote      1    1001      12       1      2    1002      12      -1      3    1003      12       1      4    1002      10      -1       Table name: articles                article_id     article_title   article_content  article_author        12              something       something       something             10              something       something       something            From the example above the total vote for the article `12` is `1+(-1)+1 = 1`
