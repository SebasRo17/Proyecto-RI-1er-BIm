I've got this strange parametric function and I want to implement it on Mathematica. I know that I could use Excel and calculate it, but my database is quite large and I want to do some reproducible code. So, this is part of my dataset:               data = {{"M",    "tr",     "tb",    "type"   },             {556.35, 0.535904, 349.79,  "methane"},             {556.35, 0.526917, 349.79,  "methane"},             {556.35, 0.544891, 349.79,  "methane"},             {556.35, 0.512537, 349.79,  "methane"},             {561.6,  0.557603, 356.594, "ethane" },             {561.6,  0.57541,  356.594, "ethane" },             {535.5,  0.603455, 344.12,  "propane"},             {535.5,  0.610644, 344.12,  "propane"}};      and these are my parameters:                   (*if methane  if ethane  if propane*)     α  = {8.9669,     6.436,     2.532};     β  = {0.952,      0.764,     0.548};     γ  = {8.111,      5.771,     2.395};     a  = {0.60,       0.66,      0.55 };     a1 = {3.357,      0.987,     1.977};      I want to implement this function:               A = a1*tb^α/(M^beta*tc^γ);     fi = 1.6;     λ = A*(Sqrt[5]*(fi - tr)^2/(fi + tr))^a      where tb, M, tc are the values contained in the data and alfa, beta gamma, a and a1 vary with the type of fluid. I've used the functions Piecewise or If, but it is too complex for me! Thanks in advance.
