I've decided to write a blog to see if it helps me, and maybe even others, as programmers, and to help invest myself in programming communities. Because I've just started, I have plenty of ideas, but I've been unsure if I should write articles on all these ideas at once, or space them out more regularly. I'm guessing it won't matter if I write them quickly, but I was concerned that my other content would be lost behind the newer content, and that I could exhaust content too quickly before I think of more topics. So, should I write them quickly as possible, or publish them more slowly and regularly?
