You try a new tool and it does not work. You google the problem and if you are lucky a random answer says you need to edit some weird configuration file and place it in a specific directory you don't know. You try but during the process things go wrong. Either because you don't understand the steps listed in the answer or because the solution is not exactly the same situation as yours. I can't be the only who is puzzled/annoyed when I am in these kind of situations. I find these problems a lot more scarier than when I don't understand a particularly algorithm. Often I can end up using 10 hours trying to get something to work without getting anything done. After that I just give up. I like programming but I really hate these moments when you need to integrate with a tool and you end up in situations as described. Often I don't even want to try new tools because I am afraid of this happening. My question is: Is there a way to get better at this? Is there a faster way to learn all this without just practicing? I have thought about getting books about unix and begin using the shell for every day use but I am not sure it is worth it.
