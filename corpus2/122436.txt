We're writing a requirements document for our client and need to include the use cases of the system. We're following this template:               ID     Description     Actors     Precondition     Basic Steps     Alternate Steps     Exceptions     Business validations/Rules     Postconditions      In the Basic Steps section, should we include steps that the system performs in the back end or should we only include steps that the user directly interacts with? Example: Basic Steps for Search 1:               User goes to search page     User enters term     User presses search     System matches search term with database entries     System displays results      vs Basic Steps for Search 2:               User goes to search page     User enters term     User presses search     System displays results
