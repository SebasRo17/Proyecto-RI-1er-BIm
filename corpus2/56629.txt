Suppose I have this function: $$z(x,y) = \left| \frac{ \frac{1}{3x +iy} -2x}{iy + \frac{1}{x}} \right| $$ I want the contour plot of $\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}$ with axes $(x,y)$. Tried this code, but didn't work.               z = Abs[ ( (1/3 x + I y) - 2 x )/ (I y + 1/x) ]     ContourPlot[D[z[x, y],x], {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2}]      This seems rather straightforward, so I'm not sure what I'm missing.
