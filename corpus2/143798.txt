There are many ways to expose a Java web application to the consumer: application container (JBoss etc), servlet container (Tomcat etc), OSGi (Knopflerfish etc), self-executable WAR (Winstone etc) and so on. Are there any clear considerations where one approach should be favoured over another? As an example, could a collection of self-executable WARs running as raw Unix processes outperform the same applications deployed within Tomcat taking into account administration and scalability concerns?
