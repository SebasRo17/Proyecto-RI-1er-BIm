If I have a simple list, say {1, 2, 3}, and I want to extract a subset of the elements, what is the correct syntax? e.g.               { i, _, j } = {1, 2, 3}      I want i = 1 & j = 3 (which works), but I get the following warning:               Set::nosym: _ does not contain a symbol to attach a rule to.      so clearly I am using the wrong placeholder for elements I wish to ignore.
