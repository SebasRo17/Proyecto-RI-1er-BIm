I am working with square (non-symmetric) matrices with named rows and columns. The data I receive is sometimes messy and rows/columns may come in various permutations. I usually need to semi-manually put every matrix into a canonical permutation before I can work with it. I'd rather never have to think about permutations and not even define a canonical one, just index the matrices using the names of their rows/columns. I was hoping that `Dataset` would be helpful here, and I made `Dataset` objects like these:               ds1 = Dataset[<|"a" -> <|"a" -> 1, "b" -> 2|>, "b" -> <|"a" -> 3, "b" -> 0|>|>]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/NgsA5.png)               ds2 = Dataset[<|"a" -> <|"b" -> 1, "a" -> 5|>, "b" -> <|"b" -> 1, "a" -> 2|>|>] (* I used a different permutation on purpose *)      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KkfQn.png) What is the simplest way to merge these together to obtain the following?               Dataset[<|"a" -> <|"a" -> {1, 5}, "b" -> {2, 1}|>, "b" -> <|"a" -> {3, 2}, "b" -> {0, 1}|>|>]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vxdps.png) Instead of merging with `List` I will usually need to merge with other operations, e.g. `Plus`. Once I've built a dataset with `List` it's easy to do that though.
