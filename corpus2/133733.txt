I am working on Application which goes and get's market data from different sources, I am using polling mechanism where vendor/broker put his data file and my application would go and hit that ftp location multiple times during the day to get data. Right now, we hit location every 5 mins and if data is not there then again after 5 mins. In it's current software architecture system using lot of resources between time window of 3 hrs where we do this polling mechanism. I want to improve performance of application and so what would best practices to solve this kind of software problem? **Note:** Some might say that this problem is engineering and should not be post here but my target audience is software guys working in finance and so i have posted this question here, if you feel that this is not right location for this then please feel free to migrate it to stackoverflow or programmers.stackexchange.com
