I'm generating some figures for a paper. One of them has a pattern like the following figure:               DensityPlot[      Abs[Exp[-Sqrt[x^2 + y^2]/5] BesselJ[0, Sqrt[x^2 + y^2]]], {x, -20,        20}, {y, -20, 20}, ColorFunction -> "SunsetColors",       PlotPoints -> 100, PlotRange -> All, PlotRangePadding -> 0,       FrameTicksStyle ->        Directive[FontFamily -> "Arial", 12, Plain, Thick],       ImageSize -> {Automatic, 150}]      ![modulated Bessel beam](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OAawn.png) Since the magnitude in the middle could be much higher than that in the outer region, some rings cannot be seen if I print it. In addition, since the pattern represents magnitude, I prefer a kind of "hot" color map to render these data. How can I solve the problem such that the pattern can be seen clearly on a printed copy?
