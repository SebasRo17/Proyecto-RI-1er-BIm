Here is a trivial system of equations in three unknowns for which `FindInstance` obtains a solution:               FindInstance[      c3 + c2 == 1 && c1 == 0 && -c2 == 0, {c1, c2, c3}]          (* ==> {{c1 -> 0, c2 -> 0, c3 -> 1}} *)      But in my application, I have a linear system where I want to rule out the trivial solution `c1==c2==c3` with an inequality:               FindInstance[      (c3 != 0 || c2 != 0) && c1 == 0 && -c2 == 0, {c1, c2, c3}]          (* ==> {{c1 -> 0, c2 -> Indeterminate, c3 -> 1}} *)      This incorrectly returns `Indeterminate` for `c2` only in _Mathematica_ version 9, whereas it gives a correct result `c2 -> 0` in version 8. In general, my variables are complex so that I can't restrict the domain to `Reals` (which solves the problem in this simple example). My current solution to this issue is to replace the inequality by an equation, e.g., `Norm[{c1, c2, c3}] ==1`. But I would like to understand (if at all possible) what change between versions is causing the `Indeterminate` result. I have a version-8 notebook that suddenly produced `Indeterminate` in over half its calculations, and there is no documented change in `FindInstance` that I'm aware of. So I'd like to hear what the safest and/or most efficient way would be to rule out the trivial solution in `FindInstance` for a system of linear equations.
