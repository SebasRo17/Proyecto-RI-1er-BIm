I read the answer to this question and this one. According to those, `Block` is safer (if something aborts, it restores the values) and faster (perhaps something to do with the low-level pointer redirection that I believe it uses) than `Module`, but less memory-efficient if the function is defined a certain way. That being said, (1) why does Leonid say that `Module` is "safer" when it doesn't have as-good garbage collection, and (2) if I am to use `Module` for most of the time, what are some of the "advanced" uses which require `Block`?
