I want to replace the values of 1. in `slot` under the condition that the year and month in `basevalue` and `slot` have to be matched Here are my matrices: `basevalue = {{{2012, 9}, 0.2819}, {{2012, 10}, 1.01406}, {{2012, 11}, 1.06447}, {{2012, 12}, 0.929704}, {{2013, 1}, 1.11471}, {{2013, 2}, 1.08585}}` `slot = {{{2012, 3}, 1.}, {{2012, 4}, 1.}, {{2012, 5}, 1.}, {{2012, 6}, 1.}, {{2012, 7}, 1.}, {{2012, 8}, 1.}, {{2012, 9}, 1.}, {{2012, 10}, 1.}, {{2012, 11}, 1.}, {{2012, 12}, 1.}, {{2013, 1}, 1.}, {{2013, 2}, 1.}}` I have tried the following code by my own `Map[Function[arg, ReplacePart[arg, 2 -> Select[basevalue, #[[1]] == arg[[1]] &][[All, -1]] ]], slot]` , but it returned me different from what I want. I think I still do not fully understand how to use `function` :( Any helps or suggestions would be appreciated Thank you
