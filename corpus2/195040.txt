I saw a video about random numbers and how the programmer in that video was talking about computers generating pseudo random numbers and that they are not really random. I knew about this. Then he showed the decay of a radioactive material to generate random numbers where he claimed to be truly random. Is there really such a thing? I mean the process of the radioactive material shooting electrons might seem random but is it? Isn't it just a mysterious black box to us simply because we don't know how it really works? Or does randomness just depend on the current level of scientific knowledge? If so, then how come quantum computers are often quoted to be capable of generating truly random numbers? Can they really do this?
