I have a php/mysql applications which I designed, and the client doesn't want it to be online (installed on a webserver) or available on the internet, he wants his employees to use it on a local system. I don't want them to go through the process of starting up wamp to access the program, is there a simple way to make php web programs run on a local windows pc? using mysql database?
