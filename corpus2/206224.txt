Up until now it seems that when you register on a random web site you do so with blind trust. You assume that the site isn't harvesting information and passwords. You assume the site is reasonably secure. And you also assume that the information you've submitted isn't used in an undesireable way. More recently, it's become possible to connect up to a site with a Google+ or Facebook account. But that brings along another problem. Anyone that has access to the social account can access anything that's linked to it. So, has any thought gone into making something that's truly independant ? Something like an information locker a person could set up themselves. Do any relevant projects exist ?
