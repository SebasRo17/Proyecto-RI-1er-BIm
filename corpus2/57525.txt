The default options in a MagnificationPopUp menu (50, 75, 50, 100, 125, 200, 300) are sometimes not sufficient to meet all user's needs. This may have more applicability when creating user interfaces. Anyone knows how to modify this menu? In other words, I'm asking if it is possible to modify the Notebook's menu such that it contains other values than the listed above. I'm not asking how to modify the Magnification of a Notebook which is formally referenced as MagnificationPopUp in the WindowElements.
