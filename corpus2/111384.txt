I'm trying to improve my use-case writing skills but I'm stuck on a certain scenario. The idea is that there are a bunch of entries in a task list (some kind of todo list). Now the user wishes to process the list (divide it amongst other lists). He can do this by answering a series of questions / completing extra data. Based on the choices of the user the system perform different actions on the task. I'm really confused on how to write this down in a use case. What I was thinking is something like (I'm only writing down the main success scenario):               Use Case: Process Inbox     Primary Actor: User              1. User indicates he/she wants to sort his/her inbox     2. System presents the next question and provides possible actions     3. User makes choice          _steps 2-3 get repeated until inbox is empty_      The problem with this is that it's not specific enough so something else I was thinking of is to make sub use-cases for all the different steps in the question process like:               Use Case: Handle Project     Level: Sub Use-case     Primary Actor: System              1. System requests additional information (description, due date) from user.     2. User completes data     3. System classifies the task as a Project      What I'm puzzled about here is:   * How to include this sub use-case in my main scenario in a proper way   * How to indicate that after this action, the user starts again from step 2 in the main use case. I was thinking of using extensions in which I include the different sub use- cases but it's getting pretty confusing. So to bundle this request into one question: Can someone clear up how you would usually tackle this kind of scenarios and/or provide me a basic possible solution for this example? Thanks in advance ;) If anyone is interested, the flowchart of questions I'm intending to use is from David Allen's book Getting Things Done: link to diagram
