I'm drowning in user emails and I'd like to implement a better way to manage all these requests I get and put them in a queue where those people on a team, as well as users, have access to them and can make common notes. I'm thinking about some sort of task management tool that would allow multiple tasks to be created under a project where emails, comments, ideas, etc. could be dropped/entered and easily accessible. I need something that all parties can be involved in - users, managers, team leaders, developers. I'm looking for a tool that can allow:   * Users to just drag/drop an email to submit a request for maintenance or enhancement.    * Developers to just see their queue and the weighted priority of each task/project.    * A team of developers to see what everyone is working on in real-time.    * Management to keep a a log of time spent on each task. I I am starting to look in more of a Agile/Scrum direction for solving this problem. I found list of scrum agile sofware project management open source tools. Since I am limited on time, has anyone used these? Which one should I test to see if it will meet my needs? TeamPulse is a good direction, but think it is a little too bloated. I need something simple for all parties.
