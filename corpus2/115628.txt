I am working on a webapp project using flask framework and sqlalchemy orm in python. Its the first time I am working on a project like this and I am having trouble in how to divide work properly among my teammates. We are 5 guys, one is handling designing, two front end and 2 on backend. I am on the backend. Flask follows MVC type pattern. How does teams divide work in MVC pattern? Moreover I am more confused in dividing work with my team mate in backend. Should one handle all the database queries and let the other one handle processing on those returned results? Need some advise on work division in web projects.
