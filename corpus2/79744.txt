I'm developing a **prototype** of a web application. I want to only use HTML, CSS and Javascript. I prefer to use my text editor and not having to learn (or pay, for that matter) a new tool like Axure. What would be, to your mind, the best practices? To me there are many qualities for a good prototype:   * Quickly developed   * Easy to improve   * Fair fidelity as regards UX (this disqualifies tools like Omnigraffle or PowerPoint that are more dedicated to wireframing) I trying to learn as quickly as possible, but I would like to know, based on your experience, on how you managed to be both quick and agile.
