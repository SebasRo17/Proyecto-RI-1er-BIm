I need to evaluate `NIntegrate` with a variable number of variables. Here's a concrete example. I'll accept an answer that finds a way to make the example work. I want to calculate the following integral: $$\int_0^1 \left( \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \right) \prod_{i=1}^n\mathrm{d}x_i = \frac{n}{2} $$ where $n$ is the number of variables. This particular integral can be separated into independent integrals, but in general this is not possible. I chose it because it is a simple example. In Mathematica, we start by defining `n`, say:               n = 4;      Then I try to evaluate the following command:               NIntegrate[Sum[x[i], {i, 1, n}],          Sequence@@Table[{x[i], 0, 1}, {i, 1, n}]]      and it gives an error. What I'm trying to do here is use `x[1], x[2], ...,x[n]` as variables of integration. Note that `Integrate` does work. So the problem is restricted to `NIntegrate`.
