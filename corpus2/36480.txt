I've heard that Apple pays the developers in lump sums (I forget how often) for their app downloads. My question is does Google work the same way with Android? If not, how do they operate their payment system? Kind of a side question as well, but how do Apple and Google get you the money from other countries? Do they automatically convert it for you and take a cut for swapping the currency or is that your job?
