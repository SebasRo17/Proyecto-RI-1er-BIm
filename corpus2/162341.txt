I have a following method to find index of a book object which have a book name:               +(NSInteger)indexXXX:(NSString *)bookName XXX:(NSArray *)books     {       for (NSInteger i = 0; i < books.count; i++) {         NSDictionary *book = [books objectAtIndex:i];         if ([[book objectForKey:@"bookName"] isEqualToString:bookName]) {           return i;         }       }       return -1;     }      But I don't know what name should I use for this method.   Could you tell me some method names commonly used for this kind of method.
