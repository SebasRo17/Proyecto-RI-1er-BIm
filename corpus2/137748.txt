I have made a web application and now I would like to add a search option to it. Since it is a learning project, I can't afford to buy some Google license. That is why I consider creating my own search engine. From what I have read, there are two major ways to do it: using `Apache Lucene` or using `Apache Solr`. I have read a bit about both, but I really don't understand what is the difference between them. Which one should I choose? I am looking for something free which is easy to learn and use, so you have other suggestions please let me know.
