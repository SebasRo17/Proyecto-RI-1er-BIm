When I'm doing large scale refactors I'm often commenting out the contents of methods and using NotImplementedExceptions for stuff that I still need to refactor. Problem is that this is interfering with 'valid' NotImplementedExceptions. I'm thinking about introducing a custom RefactorException, that I quite easily find back by reference to see what I still need to do. Good idea or bad idea? What are other common ways to do large scale refactors in stages? (of course the idea is that all these exceptions are removed before the I commit the whole refactoring)
