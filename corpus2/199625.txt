What constructs in OOP languages (specifically Java) allow you to enforce design decisions and intent? I think some examples would be the 'final' keyword, access modifiers, template methods, perhaps interfaces - but clearly I am having trouble coming up with an exhaustive list. Some constructs, like inheritance, feel like they fit this criterion but I find it difficult to explain exactly why. [edit] Turns out I took down a few more notes: Enum types, constructors, constants, and generic types. Although as in all things explaining why will be more important than just listing examples.
