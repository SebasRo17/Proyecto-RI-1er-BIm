We have a situation where our users need to geocode a location (programmatically turn a description into latitude/longitude coordinates) from within an application unable to show a graphic image. Since the Yahoo Geocoding API and the Google Geocoding API both require that the result is used for showing maps (which is a graphic image) this means that we cannot use them immediately. Is there a Geocoding facility available - web service or locally installed (preferred if it does not require network access) - that can be used for such a scenario with a reasonable price model? We can use either Windows applications, Java libraries or remote web services in this particular scenario. Suggestions?
