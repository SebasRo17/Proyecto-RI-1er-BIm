Is there a simple way to use Integer types (in particular, a table of Integer types) that require only 4 or 8 bytes (reps. 32 and 64 bits) representation? It seems that integers in _Mathematica_ have a 192 bits representation:               ByteCount[RandomInteger[]]      > >     24 >   Using a 64 bits representation would save up lots of memory in problems where you know you don't require too large integers and memory is an issue. Note that this question applies to other types.
