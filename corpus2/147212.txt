I am currently developing an IRCX AJAX Chat Based system and have a few questions regarding the Server and Client implementation. Any suggestions are welcome: **Server:** Should this be implemented as a Web Service or a Windows Form application? I have experience in developing Windows forms based servers however I am wondering if this would be better implemented as a Web Service, if so why? **Client:** How are Web Based Clients implemented today and what is the preferred way to implement a web based client? My solution so far are:   * ASP.NET Web Forms with an AJAX Update Panel (This seems the most viable)   * Using jQuery connecting to the web service with a JavaScript timeout **Polling:** How frequently should the server be polled for new messages? 0.5 seconds seems a bit excessive and anything between 2 or 3 seconds seems sluggish? Thanks for your input
