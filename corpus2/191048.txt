I'm building an API and want to count hits for each user. It's a HTTP API implemented in Python. I could keep the count in a database (using PostGreSQL) but it'll be a very busy API, so I don't want the overhead in the DB. I'm looking at Redis or just writing plain text logs. But is there a better approach? It's a map tile service, so bursts of hundreds of hits per sec. I want to report usage per month to the user--not keep total count of hits.
