Is it possible to compute trapezoidal rule numerical integration? I know that Mathematica has `Interpolation`, and that a list of points can be interpolated and then integrated simply using `Integrate`. However, my functions are highly oscillatory (they are based on simulation data), and I am not convinced that the interpolation is perfect, even when I set `WorkingPrecision` to a very high value. Also, I know that `ListIntegrate` is deprecated, and even if I use it, I am not certain if it is using the trapezoidal rule, which I would like to use. Do you know if any resources where I can find Mathematica or pseudocode for trapezoidal integration of lists of points? Or do you have any suggestions about how I can use Mathematica efficiently to program such an algorithm myself? Thanks!
