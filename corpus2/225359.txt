I have a proprietary project, with parts of it written in javascript. We would like a software license to include in the header file for this code which ensures the work remains:   * proprietary    * cannot be reverse engineered (as it will be obfuscated / minimized)   * cannot be reused elsewhere   * cannot be linked to does the DMCA do all of this? Does anyone use the DMCA in this way? I looked at this other question, Best existing license for closed-source code, about other possible language, but want to know specifically about the benefits and failings of the DMCA as a license.
