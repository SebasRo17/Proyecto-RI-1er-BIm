Below are three formats for representing an undirected edge between vertices a and b:               ClearAll[a, b]     a \[UndirectedEdge] b     FullForm[a \[UndirectedEdge] b]     InputForm[a \[UndirectedEdge] b]      Here's a screenshot of the output (to be clear about it's appearance): ![output1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HTvtZ.png) Now let's look at some other `Form`s:               a \[UndirectedEdge] b     OutputForm[a \[UndirectedEdge] b]     StandardForm[a \[UndirectedEdge] b]     TraditionalForm[a \[UndirectedEdge] b]      ![output2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KwQ4a.png) `Part works on the FullForm and InputForm as expected:               FullForm[a \[UndirectedEdge] b][[1, 2]]     InputForm[a \[UndirectedEdge] b][[1, 2]]          (* out *)     b     b      But Part does not return consistent results for other cases:               a \[UndirectedEdge] b[[1, 2]]     (a \[UndirectedEdge] b)[[1, 2]]     OutputForm[a \[UndirectedEdge] b][[1, 2]]     StandardForm[a \[UndirectedEdge] b][[1, 2]]     TraditionalForm[a \[UndirectedEdge] b][[1, 2]]      ![output3](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YIAUA.png) Can anyone help explain why Part gives different results? In particular, why doesn't it respond to all of the cases as if they were the FullForm version? * * * **Edit** In retrospect, I realize that I was both (a) miscounting levels and (b) oblivious to the role of Forms as wrappers of expressions. The second issue is touched on by this contribution by R.M
