Denote by $h_n$ the $n$-th Hermite function. $$ h_n(x) = \frac{(-1)^n }{\sqrt{2^n n! \sqrt{\pi}}} \mathrm{e}^{\frac{x^2}{2}} \frac{\mathrm{d}^n}{\mathrm{d} x^n} \mathrm{e}^{-x^2} $$ I am trying to find the 40th, 41st and 42nd terms in Gram-Schmidt process with Hermite functions $h_n$ on $[-1, 1]$. I've used the usual procedure for Gram-Schmidt process, but I've been able to calulate only the first 6 terms and then my computer got stuck. Is there some way to calculate them?
