I am writing a web-application in which I am retrieving data's from server through `AJAX` requests and the generate `HTML` content dynamically. I have some data to load, generate HTML from it and `append` into my web page. Now I was thinking on two solutions: 1) Do AJAX call, generate HTML from response, set `display: none` to it when I need, and when I'll need it later, set `display: block;` instead and `hide()` other content I don't need to display (always dynamically generated). 2) Save AJAX response into `variables`, remove HTML generated before, re- generate from `variable` when I'll need it later. I don't know if I explained it well, but I would like to know which is best practice in terms of client/server performance.
