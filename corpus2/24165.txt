How to add a slider for the x-axis that shows the value of the y-axis based on the position of the slider. Basically providing the result of the probably given a specific lot percent defective, lpd value. I can calculate the value and when I use Column the calculation doesn't respond to changes in the plot's manipulated changes. If I put the calculation within the manipulate plot line - it shows and formatting is pretty hard to read.               Manipulate[      Plot[N[Probability[x<=c, x \[Distributed] PoissonDistribution[SampleSize *lpd]]], {lpd,0,.1},       PlotRange -> {0, 1}, Filling -> Axis],      {SampleSize, 50, 1000, Appearance -> "Labeled"},      {c, 0, 10, 1, Appearance -> "Labeled"}]
