I generated some graphs. The smallest vertices in the 1st graph should be the same size as the smallest vertices in the second graph. The smallest vertices have the same size (`VertexSize` value is the same) in each graph. When I generate those graphs the size of the smallest vertices seems different: ![graph 1](http://i.imgur.com/AnvNAQj.png) ![graph 1](http://i.imgur.com/tXMiZ2l.png) Those 2 graphs in cdf: dropbox link . The size of graphs is set to 'Large'. How it can be fixed? I need that to do some animation. Thanks!
