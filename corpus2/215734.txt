Whenever I see programs or scripts that convert between high-level programming languages they are always labelled as converters. "VB.NET to C# converter" on Google results in expected, useful hits. However "VB.NET to C# compiler" on Google results in things like comparisons between the C# and VB.NET compilers and other hits that are not quite what you'd be looking for. Webopedia defines Compiler as > A program that translates source code into object code Eric Lipper in an answer to: "How do I create my own programming language and a compiler for it" suggests: > One of the best ways to get started writing a compiler is by writing a high- > level-language-to-high-level-language compiler. Is a VB.NET to C# _converter_ really just a _compiler_? If not, What separates the converter from also being a compiler?
