I've been learning touch-typing for about two weeks now, and I'm really commited to mastering this skill. Eventhough I'm doing ok with prose already, I'm struggling with **programming syntax** and even more with **keybindings**. Those stray you away from the home row more than regular words, and aren't as easy to practice. So I often hunt and peck in order to just get it out, but when reverting to old habits like this, I find it hard to get back into the touch-typing mindframe quickly. One little trick that has helped me so far when getting lost is to reposition every finger on its home row key, and mentally visualize the layout bias of the keyboard, ie the backslash kind of alignment of key columns. It's hard to describe though and probably a bit weird... Hope you guys have better tips !
