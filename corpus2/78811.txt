This is related to the (closed) question New job - not got any work to do. I'm a week and a half into a brand new job and despite asking for work to do I keep being brushed off. The set-up here is just an aggregate of of services, which are then provided to the outside world, so any bugs that do occur are usuaully with the service provider so as far as I can tell there's very little to do. In my first week a contractor actually quit (after a month of just sitting there) and a co-worker (6 weeks in) was discussing leaving, am I destined to go the same way? I moved cities for this job, and would hate to think of the impact on my cv of a short stint at a big company - may look like I can't 'hack' it to future employers?
