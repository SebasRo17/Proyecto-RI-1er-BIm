Since DTMF seems impossible on Android devices, I really wonder how it is possible to setup a direct dail service like Jinggling (http://www.jinggling.com/how_it_works.html). I realize one registers his phone number, but to what end? Say a customer now dails an international number, the App intercepts the call, reroutes it to their own service but how gets the desired number transmitted? The whole point is that this is works without wifi-/data-connection, no VOIP. The only way I can imagine this to work is using SMS to exchange auth and other related data. Or am I missing something?
