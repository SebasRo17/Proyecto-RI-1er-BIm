I'm just getting back from WWDC13, and had the opportunity to see Bill Nye speak at the last day's lunch session. Of course, I grew up watching him, and left incredibly excited for what lies ahead for humanity ... but at the same time, I'm left wondering how can I, as a "lowly" software engineer, contribute to progress in the space industry. Of course, there are some obvious choices: I could donate cash to the Planetary Society. Or I could go to college and start doing physics research (I never went, though am really happy with my career arc over the last 14 years). So, I guess it's a bit of an open ended question, but what areas of opportunity might be available to someone with more time and skills than money that still wants to find a way to contribute?
