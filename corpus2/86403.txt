I have been developing web sites/applications using the LAMP stack for almost 5 years. Currently I am interested to dig more into Linux OS, specifically BASH **but from a web developer perspective, not from sys admin perspective.** I am not intending to administrate Linux Servers. Only, I want to know, does learning shell scripting benefit me as a PHP developer? Does it make me a better, more skilled developer, or just its something irrelevant? Reasons, and examples are highly appreciated. Thanks in advance.
