I have the following pair of things:               ClearAll[foo, labeledFoo];          labeledFoo = {"FooBarBazQuux", foo};      This works like you'd expect:               labeledFoo /. hdr_String :>        StringReplace[hdr, l_?LowerCaseQ ~~ U_?UpperCaseQ :> l <> " " <> U]          (* {"Foo Bar Baz Quux", foo} *)        So does this:               labeledFoo /. hdr_String :>        StringReplace[hdr, l_?LowerCaseQ ~~ U_?UpperCaseQ :> l <> " " <> U] /.         {hdr_String, x_} :> (hdr -> x)          (* "Foo Bar Baz Quux" -> foo *)      Heck, even this works:               labeledFoo /. {hdr_String, x_} :> (Rule @@ {StringReplace[hdr,        l_?LowerCaseQ ~~ U_?UpperCaseQ :> l <> " " <> U], x})          (* "Foo Bar Baz Quux" -> foo *)       This, though, doesn't work at all:               labeledFoo /. {hdr_String, x_} :> (StringReplace[hdr,       l_?LowerCaseQ ~~ U_?UpperCaseQ :> l <> " " <> U] -> x)          (* "Fo" ~~ l <> " " <> U ~~ "a" ~~ l <> " " <> U ~~ "a" ~~         l <> " " <> U ~~ "uux" -> foo *)      I really have no idea what's going on. This is so weird that I feel like I must be missing a simple syntax error, but all the other things that **do** work make me doubt that.
