The organisation I work for is very application rich i.e. there are lots of SQL and Oracle databases. We are thinking about a data warehouse. I believe there is a difference between an Enterprise Resource Planning system and a Data Warehouse. An ERP would involve integrating all the systems together and having one database schema for everything. A Data Warehouse would involve creating a copy database (or copy databases) for analysis reasons. The Data Warehouse could extract information from the original repositories or the ERP system. Have I understood this correctly? Are there Data Warehouse products that are available to but or to you have to use Microsoft tools/Oracle tools e.g. SSIS, SSAS etc to write your own?
