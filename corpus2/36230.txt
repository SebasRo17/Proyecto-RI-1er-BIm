**Which is the best why to go when there are no documentation?** For example how do you learn business rules? I have done the following steps:   1. Since we are using a ORM tool I have printed a copy of database schema where I can see relations between objects.   2. I have made a list of short names/table names that I will get explained. The project is client/server enterprise application using MVVM pattern.
