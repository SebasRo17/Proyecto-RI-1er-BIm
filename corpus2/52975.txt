I'm on the Irish team heading to the International Olympiad of Informatics in Bulgaria at the start of August, and from the great pools of wisdom of SA, I wish to ask a few questions of those of you who have competed in programming competitions (or indeed, the IOI) before. Mainly, what tidbits of advice can you give for those competing? What's the best way (in your eyes) to go about solving a problem? I've got my own methods, but I am interested to hear your point of view. How do you manage time? Is it worth loading troublesome code up in gdb to try to work out tricky bugs, or is it best to try to hack solutions? Is there even time to debug things properly? I have been memorizing some algorithms, such as graph search algorithms, brute force algorithms, recursive algorithms, etc. What other common algorithms do you think are useful? Thanks in advance.
