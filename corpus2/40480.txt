I'm trying to extract a connected bipartite graph Bconn from the a given incidence matrix B- I have a matrix representing a bipartite graph - the incidence matrix B (weighted or not is unimportant). I want to extract the incidence matrix Bconn of the corresponding connected bipartite sub-graph. The incidence matrix may be rectangular. Ã¹ One can transform the incidence matrix B into a squared adjacency matrix A, where the off-diagonal blocks are the incidence matrices (one the transpose of the other if the bi-partite graph is undirected and thus A is symmetric) - standard basic graph theory. I would like to find a method for both directed and undirected graphs, and I do NOT want to transform the incidence into an adjacency matrix and in turn A into a graph, and then use ConnectedComponent or SubGraph, and then re- transform the graph object into a matrix: this method is not very efficient. I think that just working with matrices is faster. I have been able to find a method for undirected NON-bipartite graph, but probably there is a even more efficient way to solve the problem and especially to find a way so to operate directly with the incidence matrix B. My code is the following:               Sx = Dimensions[B][[1]]; Sy = Dimensions[B][[2]];          A = Join[Join[Table[0, {i, 1, Sx}, {j, 1, Sx}], B, 2],Join[B // Transpose, Table[0, {i, 1, Sy}, {j, 1, Sy}], 2]];          isnode = Position[Total[A], 0] // Reverse;          Aconn = Transpose[Delete[Transpose[Delete[A, isnode]], isnode]];          Bconn = A[[1 ;; Sx, Sy + 1, Sx + Sy]];      Of course I can do a function doing all these operations, but the point is that I'm not convinced of this algorithm, as I'm looking to something faster and that I can use directly to B. Thanks for any suggestion/solution!!
