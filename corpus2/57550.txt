Mac OS, MMA 10 -- I accidentally discovered that typing `Ctrl``V` between cells reads out the cell below, or, if you have text selected, reads out the text. `Ctrl``V` would be _Edit > Paste_ on Windows, so the text-to-speech feature would be triggered differently on Windows, if it's present at all. I know there is a global Mac text-to-speech function ( _System Preferences > Dictation & Speech_), but I have it turned off. Just to be sure, I changed the global Mac text-to-speech voice to "Vicky", but the voice in MMA stayed on "Alex." That is evidence that I'm triggering a MMA special. Where is this text-to-speech configured; in particular, can I change the keyboard shortcut for it? It would be nice to explore if it has any other configurable features. I trolled the menus and the _Preferences_ dialog box for a hint, but didn't find one. MMA has a `Speak` built-in function, but that appears to be something else altogether.
