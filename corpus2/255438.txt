I'm interested in building a browser-like rendering engine. I understand a bit about how OpenGL and GUI toolkits work. But how do browsers actually put pixels on the screen? Are they like software rasterizers that scan every line and paint whatever's in the render tree? Or do they act like GUI toolkits and call functions to display elements at certain coordinates? Are there any libraries that focus specifically on the painting portion of the browser's critical rendering path?
