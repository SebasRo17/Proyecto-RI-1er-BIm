Next year I'm going to school to study IT. I went to some schools' open door days already and I was given much information. However, at one school I was told they primarily focus on the .NET Framework and Java. I'm concerned about this because I think the programming language and frameworks used isn't as important as the design of a software program. I'm also concerned about the fact that you can get used to the flaws in those languages and frameworks and you may lack knowledge of other paradigms (such as functional programming). Am I getting this right? Is it normal for a school to focus on a specific language or framework?
