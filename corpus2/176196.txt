Based on answers I have received here and then confirmed in some authoritative sources (not ISTQB which seems to be too vague), there are 3 activities:   * Static analysis    * Dynamic analysis    * Testing But is there any reason why we cannot combine all of that as "testing"? I mean, even a dynamic analysis review of a program to look for memory leaks is a kind of testing, right?
