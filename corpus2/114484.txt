If you have a good > domain knowledge, then writing code for that is not a big deal." (Here domain knowledge is something related to area you are working in. For example, I work in telecom domain, someone might be in Finance or Pharma or Web development or Embedded and so on.) I disagree with above passage and think exactly opposite. In my career _till now_ , I have seldom missed any deadline for bugfix or feature enhancement. I have kept changing the domains (within telecom) but stuck with learning the programming techniques. Though I might be wrong. **Questions** :   * Is my current approach correct ?   * Given a choice between domain or programming (with limited time) which one should be chosen ?   * Is there a good future for a person, who is primarily a very good coder but not so great in a domain (of course initially) ? I ask this because, I feel that every domain ultimately boil down to code sea in which one has to dive!
