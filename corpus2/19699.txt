With some matrices I am receiving the following message > >     Inverse::luc Result for Inverse of badly conditioned matrix (M) may > contain significant >     numerical errors. >   How can I tell to _Mathematica_ to isolate (or detect) that result (or badly conditioned matrix)? For instance, using the `If` statement, which _condition_ should I put into the argument of `If` statement when my matrix is badly conditioned? P.S. Some advice to tackle with these kind of matrices would be good.
