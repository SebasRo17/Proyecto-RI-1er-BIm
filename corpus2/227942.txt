I am working on ANSI C and having some issues with the pointers. That is that after a point in my program the pointer's values change without me interfering, is something like overwriting them. I know that this could happen in C, but while being a beginner, can not find a remedy for that. Is there a straightforward way of solving this? As I understand, many people will have faced similar issues. Thank you guys for your answers,were very helpful,was indeed a memory problem solved by just allocating larger blocks of memory!!! Thank you again!!!!
