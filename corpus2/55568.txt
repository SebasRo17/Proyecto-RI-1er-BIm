I have some experience with SharePoint. My company has decided to use Oracle WebCenter to create a internal portal. None of the IT staff have any experience with Oracle WebCenter, and I think we could use SharePoint for this job, as we have been using it until now. So, what are the advantages to using Oracle WebCenter? Which are your experiences with Oracle WebCenter 11g? And how different is it from SharePoint? What can I do with Oracle WebCenter that I cannot do with Microsoft SharePoint?
