I'm trying to plot the solution of an equation using NDSolve. For some reason nothing shows up in the plot. I checked the output of the interpolating function and it doesn't look like there is anything wrong with the data - though I could be wrong - so I'm just trying to figure out what is going on.                    q2 = NDSolve[{u'[ϕ] == -Sqrt[3 - 2 u[ϕ] ArcSech[1/u[ϕ]]/Sqrt[u[ϕ]^2 - 1]],                        u[1.494706195984861] == 3.208921901232091},                        u, {ϕ, 1.494706195984861, 20}]      Then when I use PolarPlot to plot the function, nothing appears:               s2 = PolarPlot[Evaluate[1/u[ϕ] /. q2], {ϕ, 1.494706195984861, 14.708465676522565},                    PlotRange -> All, PlotStyle -> Thick]      Thanks in advance for any help.
