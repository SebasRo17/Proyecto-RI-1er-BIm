Google translates '早请示晚汇报' as 'Consult early and late reporting' or 'Ask for instructions to report back later'. Bing translates as 'Early and late reporting'. Some translated content: > The politics invaded all aspects of daily life during the **Cultural > Revolution** , as **早请示晚汇报**. Every day at a political activity or ceremony, > everyone, after getting up or reported to work/study, had to " _consult the > great leader Chairman Mao_ ," about that day's work, study. At the end of > the day/before going to bed, everyone had to _confess_ to the "Great Leader > Chairman Mao," that day's work/learning. **Late reporting** is called " > _confessing his/her sin_ ," because a day's work or study certainly would > contain errors, which delayed revolutionary work; hence, the person would > confess, " _I am sorry, great leader_ ", akin to " **confessing his/her > sin**." However, as "confessing one's sin," has a serious religious > undertone to it, so it was not considered appropriate and was renamed to " > **late reporting.** " Anywhere people gathered--schools, army, cadre > schools, community centers that provided three meals per day--everyone > involved had to appear for the **collective report**. Here is another excerpt that sounds beautiful even after machine translation: > Anyway, several times a day for several years removed from the > "instructions", "reporting" so that "life" of this short period of time is > finally free of political control winding all the time, everyone has a sense > of relief. Ref: Lin Zhao, a blog entry, a news paper article I feel compelled to be certain that this practice is definitely the source of 'Scrum' process. Some of these similarities cannot simply be ruled out as coincidences. My question is,   "Is there really a relation? If so, should we read some mission statements before we begin work, and we have stand-ups at the end of the day, before we leave?"
