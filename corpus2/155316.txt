I've been reading some papers from the early 90s about a US Department of Defense software reuse initiative called the Defense Software Reuse System (DSRS). The most recent mention of it I could find was in a paper from 2000 - A Survey of Software Reuse Repositories > ### Defense Software Repository System (DSRS) > > The DSRS is an automated repository for storing and retrieving Reusable > Software Assets (RSAs) [14]. The DSRS software now manages inventories of > reusable assets at seven software reuse support centers (SRSCs). The DSRS > serves as a central collection point for quality RSAs, and facilitates > software reuse by offering developers the opportunity to match their > requirements with existing software products. DSRS accounts are available > for Government employees and contractor personnel currently supporting > Government projects... > > ...The DoD software community is trying to change its software engineering > model from its current software cycle to a process-driven, domain-specific, > architecture-based, repository-assisted way of constructing software [15]. > In this changing environment, the DSRS has the highest potential to become > the DoD standard reuse repository because it is the only existing deployed, > operational repository with multiple interoperable locations across DoD. > Seven DSRS locations support nearly 1,000 users and list nearly 9,000 > reusable assets. The DISA DSRS alone lists 3,880 reusable assets and has 400 > user accounts... > > The far-term strategy of the DSRS is to support a virtual repository. These > interconnected repositories will provide the ability to locate and share > reusable components across domains and among the services. An effective and > evolving DSRS is a central requirement to the success of the DoD software > reuse initiative. Evolving DoD repository requirements demand that DISA > continue to have an operational DSRS site to support testing in an actual > repository operation and to support DoD users. The classification process > for the DSRS is a basic technology for providing customer support [16]. This > process is the first step in making reusable assets available for > implementing the functional and technical migration strategies. > > ...   >  [14] DSRS - Defense Technology for Adaptable, Reliable Systems   >  URL: http://ssed1.ims.disa.mil/srp/dsrspage.html   >  [15] STARS - Software Technology for Adaptable, Reliable Systems   >  URL: http://www.stars.ballston.paramax.com/index.html   >  [16] D.

Is DSRS dead, and were there any post-mortem reports on it? Are there other more-recent US government initiatives or reports on software reuse?
