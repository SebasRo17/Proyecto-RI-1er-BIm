I have a subversion server setup that I need to look after several projects, grouped by language, then client (company) and then by project e.g.               repos/          flex3          \com1               \project1               \project2          \com2               \project1               \project2               \project3          flex4          \com1              \projectx          \com2              \projecty          java         \projectz      repos is my repository root and then I have the 3 repositories inside (create with svnadmin create) flex3, flex4 and java, then flex3 should have two folders com1 and com2 for different clients, each will contain different "project" repos. I have a feeling I have done this wrong, should I simply create the top level structure as normal folders and then make the com1 and com2 etc into repos with "svnadmin create" so that different projects can be added directly below them. Is this correct? Thanks
