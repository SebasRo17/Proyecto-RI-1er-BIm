When displaying graphics in the Mathematica front end, and leaving `ImageSize` at the default, the result will always keep its previous size. For example,   * `Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 5}]` produces an output 360 pixels wide (the default size).   * Resize the plot with the mouse to make it bigger.   * Change the input to `Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 10}]` and re-evaluate it.   * The output figure remains at its manually set size and won't revert to 360 pixels wide. If we were to use `Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 5}, ImageSize -> 500]` instead, then the size of the output would be re-set to 500 pixels every time this command is re-evaluated. `ImageSize -> Inherited` will generally allow this behaviour. **Question:** How can I create a function that will output graphics at sizes larger than 360 pixels by default, yet when re-sizing the output manually and re-evaluating the function, the manually set size will be kept? I do not wish to change the default output size for other functions.
