I've got a simple authentication solution, where a user can log in with either email or username. Since I want to show the little feature in the acceptance tests but don't want to pollute them, I thought I'll introduce some randomness. Do you think this is bad or good?               step "Fill in my credentials" do         fill_in :user_login, with: [@user.email, @user.name].sample         fill_in :user_password, with: @user.password     end
