I was wondering if _Mathematica_ has an equivalent of MATLAB's "MATLAB Builder" as seen here? I found this but it reads as if all programs using .NET/Link must have _Mathematica_ installed on them as well. I have several systems to replicate and it would be impossible to have _Mathematica_ installed on all 25-1000 computers. Thanks! **EDIT** Additional Information: I use C# applications to control various systems and I would like to use a bunch of _Mathematica_ 's functions (interactive plots, optimization, statistical analysis, etc.) within them. From the link, MATLAB's "MATLAB Builder" can create assemblies of user designed functions/scrips for standalone use in C#/.NET applications (i.e. MATLAB isn't required on the deployment PCs for the MATLAB assembly functions to run). I'm looking for a _Mathematica_ equivalent.
