I made a plugin for jQuery, which I think is quite useful. It combines an animated colours plugin with an easings plugin, and adds a completely new feature of being able to refer to colours numerically (more useful in hex notation, so 0xff00cc for example) and therefore manipulate them mathematically more easily. I created a repository on github, and it sits there, nobody looks at it. Mostly, I would like people to look at it, use it, and improve it, so I can use the improvements and so on. I think this idea of numerically manipulating colors could be interesting. It makes it easy to change the hue without changing the saturation for example. Combined with animated colors, I think something interesting could be done, but I don't know what exactly. How do I let people know it (or any other project) is there..? I was going to post it on http://plugins.jquery.com which is currently down. Are there any other outlets for this kind of code?
