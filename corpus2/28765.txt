I’ve written a function TableauForm to draw a standard Young Tableau. This problem is related to this one, however, the difficulty is that, a _function_ has to be applied to the list in my case. This is my first version code:               TableauForm [l : {{__} ..}, opts : OptionsPattern[{Alignment -> {Center, Center},FrameStyle -> Thin, Grid}]] :=        Grid[l,        Frame -> {None, None,          Thread@Rule[Flatten[Function[{a, b}, {a, #} & /@ b] @@@ Transpose[{Range@Length@l, Range /@ Length /@ l}], 1], True]},        Alignment -> OptionValue[Alignment], FrameStyle -> OptionValue[FrameStyle]];      The function works well when evaluate this:               youngTableau = {{1, 2, 3}, {4}};     TableauForm [youngTableau]      ![first output](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XB9AP.jpg) Or even this:               TableauForm [youngTableau, FrameStyle -> {Red, Thin}]      ![second output](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ggLRg.jpg) But the flaw is that if someone _doesn’t wants to show the lines_ (regardless of such a strange usage of this function) and evaluate this               TableauForm [youngTableau, Frame->None]      The output will still draw up the lines just like the first one. ![first output](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XB9AP.jpg) I’ve put the drawing function into the `OptionsPattern`, but only make it worse               TableauForm [l : {{__} ..}, opts : OptionsPattern[{Alignment -> {Center, Center},          Frame -> {None, None, (Thread@ Rule[Flatten[Function[{a, b}, {a, #} & /@ b] @@@ Transpose[{Range@Length@#, Range /@ Length /@ #}], 1], True] &)},FrameStyle -> Thin, Grid}]] :=        Grid[l, Frame -> OptionValue[Frame],Alignment -> OptionValue[Alignment],FrameStyle -> OptionValue[FrameStyle]];      Now evaluating `TableauForm[youngTableau]` will give a table with empty frame. ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rSK2T.jpg) To sum up and put the problem into another way, how to write a function sharing the same `OptionsPattern` with `Grid` only changing some default settings? (Note that some default settings may be a function of the parameters.) Is it possible to put a function into `OptionsPattern`, or are there any other ways to do this(plot a Young Tableau)?
