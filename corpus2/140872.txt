From wikipedia, Anytime algorithm > In computer science an anytime algorithm is an algorithm that can return a > valid solution to a problem even if it's interrupted at any time before it > ends. **The algorithm is expected to find better and better solutions the > more time it keeps running.** Hill climbing > Hill climbing can often produce a better result than other algorithms when > the amount of time available to perform a search is limited, such as with > real-time systems. It is an **anytime algorithm** : it can return a valid > solution even if it's interrupted at any time before it ends. Hill climbing algorithm can stuck into local optima or ridge, after that even if it runs infinite time, the result won't be any better. Then, why hill climbing is called anytime algorithm?
