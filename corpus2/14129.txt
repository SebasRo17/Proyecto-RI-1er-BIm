I have four coupled ODE's. I am not sure how to plot and solve them using Mathematica. I won't give the exact problem, but the following is something analogous: The equations               a= x'[t]     a'=-c1*x[t]/c2+c1*(y[t]-x[t])/c2     b=y'[t]     b'=-c1*(y[t]-x[t])/c2      Can be written as               x'[t]= -c1*x[t]/c2 + c1*(y[t]-x[t])/c2     y'[t]= -c1*(y[t]-x[t])/c2      The question is, now how do I use these in NDSolve to give solution and later a plot as well? I have initial conditions to plug in, but I am hung up on how to solve these coupled equations... Thank you in advance. _Edit_ I do not know how to input this into NDSolve.
