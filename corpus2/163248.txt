While solving the problems on Techgig.com, I got struck with one of the problems. The problem is like this: > A company organizes two trips for their employees in a year. They want to > know whether all the employees can be sent on the trip or not. The condition > is that no employee can go on both the trips. Also to determine which > employees can go together the constraint is that the employees who have > worked together in past won't be in the same group. Examples of the problem: > >   1. Suppose the work history is given as follows: {(1,2),(2,3),(3,4)}; then > it is possible to accommodate all the four employees in two trips (one trip > consisting of employees 1& 3 and the other having employees 2 & 4). Neither > of the two employees in the same trip have worked together in past. >   2. Suppose the work history is given as {(1,2),(1,3),(2,3)} then there is > no possible way to have two trips satisfying the company rule and > accommodating all the employees. > Can anyone tell me how to proceed on this problem?
