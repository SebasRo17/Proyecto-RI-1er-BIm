I'm trying to setup a Manipulate where I have a variable number of sliders similar to this one, where every slider controls a function. In my case, there will be an additional slider which sets the number of functions. I've tried with               Manipulate[       Block[{},         Manipulate @@            {Plot[Table[Cos[2\[Pi]Subscript[h, i]x], {i, 1, n}], {x, 0, 1}],             Sequence@@Table[{Subscript[h, i], 0, 1}, {i, n}]}],        {{n, 1, "Waves"}, 1, 4, 1}]      but that does not work. I hope I have been successful in explaining my problem. For instance this is partially working, except I can not add controls on functions, i.e. Subscript[h,i] in a nested manipulate               Manipulate[       Block[{         trange = {t, 0, tmax},         plotrange = {{0, xmax}, {-1, 1}},         aspectratio = 1/xmax,         f = Table[Cos[2 \[Pi] i t], {i, 1, n}]         },         Plot[Evaluate[f], Evaluate[trange], PlotRange -> plotrange,          AspectRatio -> aspectratio]         ],       {tmax, 0.1, 1},       {xmax, 0.1, 1},       {n, 1, 4, 1}     ]
