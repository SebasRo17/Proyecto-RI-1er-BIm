I want to draw a _normalized_ tangent arrow, so I use the `Normalize` command as follows:               tangent =        Table[{{t, Sin[t]}, {t, Sin[t]} + Normalize @ {1, Cos[t]}}, {t, -π, π, π/2}];     Plot[Sin[x], {x, -2 π, 2 π},        PlotRange -> 2, Epilog -> {Red, Arrowheads[0.02], Arrow /@ tangent}]      and I get this plot: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/W3A50.png) Seems good, but if take a close look at the length of the arrows, you'll see that the length is not normalized at all. I've tried the `Show` and `Graphics` command instead of `Epilog`, but got the same plot. Can someone tell me what I missed here?
