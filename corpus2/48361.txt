I am trying to get started with the Stanford NER tools tools in Mathematica, and am having difficulty translating the demo they provide into JLink. The relevant code in the demo is:               /* Usage: java -cp "stanford-ner.jar:." NERDemo */          import edu.stanford.nlp.ling.CoreLabel;     import edu.stanford.nlp.ling.CoreAnnotations;          ...           for (CoreLabel word : sentence) {       ... w.word() ... word.get(CoreAnnotations.AnswerAnnotation.class) ...      So I tried:               InstallJava[ClassPath -> ".../stanford-ner.jar"];          answerAnnotation = LoadJavaClass["edu.stanford.nlp.ling.CoreAnnotations$AnswerAnnotation"]      > JavaClass[edu.stanford.nlp.ling.CoreAnnotations$AnswerAnnotation,<>]               (...things that appear to be working correctly...)          w      > « JavaObject[edu.stanford.nlp.ling.CoreLabel]»               w@word[] (* works *)     w@get[answerAnnotation] (* $Failed *)      > Java::argx1: Method named get defined in class > edu.stanford.nlp.ling.CoreLabel was called with an incorrect number or type > of arguments. The argument was > JavaClass[edu.stanford.nlp.ling.CoreAnnotations$AnswerAnnotation,<>]. The (inherited) method signature of `get` is               get(java.lang.Class<? extends TypesafeMap.Key<VALUE>> key)      http://nlp.stanford.edu/nlp/javadoc/javanlp/edu/stanford/nlp/util/ArrayCoreMap.html#get(java.lang.Class)
