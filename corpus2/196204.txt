To make things simple to explain: I've got two tables: `Table1` and `Countries`. The `Countries` table contains a nice flag and some information, such as DisplayName, the ISO3166 ALPHA3 code and the phone code (+49, +xx). `Table1` contains customers with a column `Country`. Is it (in terms of usability, normalization and common human sense) okay to reference from `Table1.CountryId` to `Countries.Id` via a foreign key instead of having a plain `Table1.Country` `nvarchar(255)` field and insert a `string` into that?
