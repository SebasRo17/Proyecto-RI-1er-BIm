I'm only interested in changes in the language itself - not in the standard library. Perhaps this would be interesting to discuss, but as it is shared between many languages it would be better to discuss this in another question instead. **Please post a single idea per answer; if you want to post several ideas, post several separate answers. Thanks!**
