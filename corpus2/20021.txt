Little background: I've always been kind of a Microsoft hater. A while ago just the fact of learning a something like C# scared me. I was only interested in opensource project and programming languages. Wasn't impressed with vista(actually I hated vista), so I went back to XP Pro. I had to use Windows because some software I use/used wasn't available for linux. Then came windows 7 and before even trying/using it I already judge it to be a 'insert insult here'. I kept hearing really good stuff about it so I removed XP and install windows 7. After using it just for maybe 2, 3 days I started to really like it. Now I like it a lot actually. It even has these small features that may feel irrelevant to someone (like being able to arrange the windows' in the taskbar) which are very useful to me (I used to open programs in a specific order, even close some and reopen just to rearrange them). Actual question: Now I think more and more about learning .NET and C#. I also seen PowerShell which looks tempting. Call me an idiot but I kind of feel weird about this. It almost feels like I'm betraying someone. Have you ever been in a similar situation?
