The problem is that a typical harmonic time history will not have an integer number of cycles in the data. For example, with the following time history you get a numerical Fourier transform.               sr = 400; (* sample rate *)     nn = 200;  (* number of points *)     f = 17.2;   (* frequency in Hz *)     A = 1; B = 0.1; (* Coefficients of Cos and Sin *)     th = N @ Table[A Cos[2 Pi f t] + B Sin[2 Pi f t], {t, 0, (nn - 1)/sr, 1/sr}];     ft = Fourier[th, FourierParameters -> {-1, -1}];     n = Position[#, mx = Max[#]] & [Abs[ft]][[1, 1]];     ListPlot[Abs[ft[[1 ;; n + 10]]], PlotRange -> All]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/aO6XH.png) This produces a plot with several points making up the peak. The frequency resolution is 2 Hz and there is no point at the harmonic frequency of 17.2 Hz. Clearly the frequency is bracketed between the 9 th and 10 th point (16 Hz and 18 Hz). How do we find the exact frequency and amplitude? I have considered extending by zeros but although this increases the resolution it still results in points on either side of the frequency. Also, I have considered calculating points with non-integer values. However, the resulting spectrum does not have a maximum at the frequency of the time history. My actual data includes noise and other harmonics hence my use of Fourier which is good at concentrating the data I am interested in around a few points in the spectrum. I have worked out one very poor way of finding the frequency and amplitude and will post this when I have worked out how to use StackExchange more fully.
