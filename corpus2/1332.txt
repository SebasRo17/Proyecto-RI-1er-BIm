Is it possible to use a background image in a polygon without rasterizing the polygon? I tried with textures, but they seem to be viable only for simple polygons. I want to put a flag as the background of the polygon that represents a country shape. I can do this for one country by rasterizing the polygon:               ImageAdd[         Graphics[CountryData["Monaco", "Polygon"]],          CountryData["Monaco", "Flag"]     ]      ![monaco](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gQrkk.png) But by rasterizing the polygon, I make it difficult to apply this procedure to several neigboring countries and assemble them together. I would like to put each country flag in the background of, for example:               Graphics[         {EdgeForm[White],           CountryData[#, "Polygon"] & /@ {"Venezuela", "Colombia"}}]        ![colombia and venezuela](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6tCtL.png) * * * ## Solution After seeing cormullion answer, I was able to do what I wanted:               Graphics[      {EdgeForm[Black],       {{Texture[ImageReflect[CountryData[#, "Flag"], Top -> Right]],          CountryData[#, "Polygon"] /.            {Polygon[a_] :> Polygon[First[a], VertexTextureCoordinates ->             Transpose[Rescale /@ Transpose[First[CountryData[#, "Coordinates"]]]]]}} & /@      CountryData["SouthAmerica"]}}]      ![southamerica](http://i.stack.imgur.com/T2jnb.png) The key part is the use of Rescale[]. Thank you!
