I have been working (alone) on an open-source project without using any sort of formal version control. I recently started using Git and GitHub for this project and am wondering if it is possible for me to build a code/commit history based off of the archived, older versions of the code that I have. Development thus far has been solely linear. It's progressed from version 0.1 through 0.9.6.3 without any branches. I've looked through the Git User Manual and the closest thing I can think of would involve making labeled or named commits for each previous version. What is the best way to handle this? Do I need to create a new repository and start pushing labeled commits into it, ending with the current version? Is it possible to change the dates of existing commits? Is there a more straightforward way? I'm using Git on Windows XP (native, not Cygwin), but if it would be easier I can set it up on my Ubuntu box.
