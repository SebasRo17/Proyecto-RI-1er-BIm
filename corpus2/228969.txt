I worked in a group in Microsoft that developed the upgrade to the Microsoft Security Essentials antivirus. For a year we worked on the next version of the product. We had 6 milestones (milestone each two months). Most of the features were developed in the first few milestones, and for the second part of the year these features were refined and bugs were fixed. Each milestone a larger portion of users (subscribed to the various alpha/beta programs) would get the product and provide feedback. I was told by the program managers in the project that the advantage of this approach is that there is more time for potential users to give feedback on the features, so it is preferable to ship all the features as soon as possible. However Scrum doesn't advocate this approach. In Scrum are you advised to deliver completely tested and functional piece of software and not half baked and brittle features. This approach has various benefits, but it also has some drawbacks. One of them is that feedback is delayed. So which approach do you prefer and why?
