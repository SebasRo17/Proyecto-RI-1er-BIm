At the company I work we use SVN. The SVN repository resides on the local server. When developing we commit the changes to SVN on the local server which transfers the changes via ftp to a testsite remote test server. The whole team uses the same testsite. We use a remote testserver so that we don't have to setup anything on our local machines. If developer A wants to see the changes of developer B on is local machine, he must simply update his working copy. Most of the time we are very happy with this approach:   * it's simple   * svn is nicely integrated in Netbeans Things that bother us are:   * the changes are transfered via ftp. When transferring a lot of files this can be quite slow   * we would like to have a repository "in the cloud" so we can develop not only from our office but from anywhere (and without have to setup a vpn) Is our workflow possible if we were to use github to host our repository? These things are important to us:   * we are not going to develop locally, we would still like to use a testsite on a testserver that is shared by the entire team   * because we do a lot of small changes pushing the changes to the testsite should be very easy   * we have a lot of small sites so the setup that a developer should do per site should be minimal
