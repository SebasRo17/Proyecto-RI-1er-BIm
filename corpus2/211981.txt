I have a fiery debate running in the office. We have an app with two buttons of different size. (One is 40 px wide and one is 150 px wide). They have the exact same look in terms of background image. I would like to know which is best practice: 1: Make one image for the background that is 40px wide, and another image which is 150px wide. OR 2: Make one image (150px) and scale down and re-use for the 40px button. I'm not sure what performance overhead the scaling operation has, and I need to offset that against the size of the app if we go with seperate images for every different sized control. Thanks!
