I am trying to plot a function with specific options for the appearance of the plot. I want the X axis to not show up, and the Y axis to be labeled normally (i.e. numbers outside the plot).. Yet, I don't get any numbers in the Y axis' ticks: ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/baC8b.png) The code I am using is the following (the function to be plotted is different, but still returns this behavior):               Plot[5 t + 3, {t, 0, 10},         PlotRange -> All,         AxesOrigin -> {10, 0},              LabelStyle -> {FontFamily -> "Arial", Bold, 40},         Axes -> {False, True},         PlotStyle -> {{Thickness[0.007], Darker[Blue, 0.5]}},              AxesStyle -> AbsoluteThickness[3], ImageSize -> {640, 480}     ]      Could you please help me get the ticks numbered automatically?
