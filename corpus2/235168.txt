The current way i have my form is a user selects a drop down menu of a particular folder and it displays the current logos in that folder in a row below. These images are grabbed on page load all at once. The problem is, as of right now, i have around 700 logos totaling around 10mb, and every time the user reaches the form, it has to load all 700 images before the page loads, unless the images are already in the browser's cache. My problem isn't so much now, but later if I end up having 1500 logos, or more. I thought about 2 different ways to isolate this issue.   1. To have the drop down selected folder load the images AFTER selected. I asked how to get this accomplished in stack overflow with no success.   2. My second idea now is to create a simple search engine bar that will just show the logo they are searching for it on the fly instead of loading the images.  I know this is possible, i've seen it on a number of image search sites. my question is, does this type of search engine script already exist? if so .. could you point me in the right direction.
