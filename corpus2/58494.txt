I want to solve a simple linear PDE about $p_0$ which is a function of ξ, ζ and τ. However, the boundary condition is defined at `ζ = h`, which is a function of ξ and τ. The other quantities are all constant. In fact, this PDE can be solved by hand. I want to find p0 as a function of `h` and ζ. I just want to verify it, then I will try another more complex one. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GYHRo.jpg) The solution I want is as follows which is obtained by hand. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Aw0ft.jpg) I tried the following code, but it does not work.               DSolve[      {D[Subscript[p, 0][          h[ξ, τ], ζ], ζ] == (R/            Pr)*(1 - ζ*(h[ξ, τ] + k)^-1) - G, (2/3)*         Subscript[p, 0][h[ξ, τ], h[ξ, τ]] ==         e^2* d^(-1)*((h[ξ, τ] + k)^-1)^2 -          2*s*D[h[ξ, τ], {ξ, 2}]       },      Subscript[p, 0][       h[ξ, τ], ζ], {h[ξ, τ], ζ}      ]      I get the message > DSolve::conarg: The arguments should be ordered consistently. >>
