I've been reading about software licensing as I feel that I'm at a stage now, where I should probably have some sort of a license associated with my code. What I am looking for is a copyleft (weak or strong) license that basically is very liberal. So I'd like the license to allow anybody to do anything with the code/program with the exception that nobody can ever make money from the code. I don't want anybody to be able to get my code and sell it, or to get my code and sell it or get my code, modify it in any way and sell it. I don't want anybody to be able to make money from any code I write. Aside from that, I don't care how it is used as long as the original author of the code (in this case, me) is associated with the code that I wrote. I've looked at the GPL license, the MIT license and a few others and I can't find what I want. Does anybody have any suggestions? If it matters, the license will be associated with C/C++, assembler and Ruby programs.
