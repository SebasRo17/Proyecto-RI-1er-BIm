diamond[n_Integer] :=       Table[1, {#}] & /@ (Range[n]~ Join~Range[n - 1, 1, -1])          diamond[5] // MatrixForm      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/e0sFG.jpg) How could a more functional, "tablefree", solution look like? **EDIT** Thanks for the nice comments and answers so far :) But I'm looking for a `1-2-3-4-3-2-1` or `1-2-3-4-5-4-3-2-1` sequence which `DiamondMatrix` doesn't seem to offer.
