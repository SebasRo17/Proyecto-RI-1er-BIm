One thing that I've heard a lot over the years is that those working in the IT world generally don't make life time careers out of it, but tend to "burn out" and start a new career doing something else unrelated (e.g. going from software development to being an accountant). Have you found this to be generally true in your experience and if so, what is the general impression on how long people work as developers before starting a new career?
