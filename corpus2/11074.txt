I would like to create a random matrix with the constraint that the matrix must be normal, i.e. the matrix and its Hermitian conjugate must commute. I would create a random matrix "without constraints" as                   RandomReal[NormalDistribution[0,s],{n,n}]+          I*RandomReal[NormalDistribution[0,s],{n,n}]      But I have no idea how I can implement the constraint, that the matrix must be normal.
