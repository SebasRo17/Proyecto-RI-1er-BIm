May seem strange at first, but can you make mathematica change the value of 0 to 10 and 11 to 1 for all occurrences. Let me explain: I'm looping through a matrix and for each element, I want something to happen depending on the values in each element above, below, to the left and to the right. When you're at the first element however there is nothing to the left, or above, so instead I would like to use the values on either side of the matrix as if you'd curled the matrix back round onto itself, as shown below. ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9i2Uo.png) X denotes what element you're looking at and then T,B,L & R, correspond to the cells at the Top, bottom, to the left & right respectively. Here's the code I wrote without thinking too much and it throws up an error because it asks for elements that do no exist. (e.g. "i-1" when i=1)               Do[       Do[     {n, m} = RandomChoice[{image[[i + 1, j]], image[[i, j + 1]],      image[[i - 1, j]], image[[i,j - 1]]} -> {{i + 1, j}, {i, j + 1}, {i - 1, j}, {i,j - 1}}];     newimage[[n, m]] = image[[i, j]];     , {j, columns}];       , {i, rows}];      So, without whacking loads of If statements in there, is there an elegant way to accomplish this? Hope I explained this half decently.
