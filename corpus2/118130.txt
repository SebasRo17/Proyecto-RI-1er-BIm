I have detailed information on the latest developments in functional programming. I think haskell is quite an advanced and high level programming language. With coq and agda this gets even more complex and advanced. With "advanced" and "high level" I mean many distinct features, that can only be found in the respective languages. Like for haskell   * everything is pure and lazy per default    * support for advanced concepts like GADTs, Monads, Functors, etc. For coq / agda   * a dependent type system  And both haskell and coq are used in academics, a good sign that they are 'state-of-the art'. However I have no clue what comparable developments in object oriented programming are. What are some of the latest developments in object oriented programming? What would be a state-of-the-art OOP language counterpart to haskell / coq? (I even search for advanced programming language on google, but I found mostly haskell related information. The only language I could think of is D 2.0. Scala is for me mainly a java compatible version of haskell.)
