We're going to do a complete review of a Java/JEE based application. This includes an architecture review, code review and platform hardware review. While we're a bit aware of code review techniques, I'm wondering if there is a template or reference model for doing **an architecture review for Java/JEE systems**. Currently we're looking at following the ATAM Model to build a Quality Attribute Tree to cover the elements of Performance, Reliability, Availability, Security, Modifiability, Portability, Variability, Subsetability, Conceptual integrity and Functionality This is a first for us - so the question is whether there are any other standard models you follow or whether anyone has tried ATAM before and has any **tips/recommendations/tools for the Architecture review.**
