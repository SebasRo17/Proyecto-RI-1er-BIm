I am building an app using Code Igniter, it is being based on CI-Bonfire. I am pulling in the dev branch of CI-Bonfire using git, I want the entire project to be git controlled as well, but I want to be able to just pull the latest changes from the dev branch of CI-Bonfire, but push my entire app to a different repository. All changes that I make to the files that come from bonfire will be config changes, so all pulls will be able to merge automatically. Is this possible?
