Help me please. Task: Disk movement inside the Ellipse so that naturally Disk reflected from the walls and continued to move. Thanks. My friend was able make a move on the square only:               x = 0.5;     y = 0.5;          vx = 1;     vy = Pi/2;          step = 0.01;     radius = 0.05;          Animate[           x = x + vx*step;      y = y + vy*step;                If[Abs[x - 1] <= radius || Abs[x] <= radius , vx = -vx];      If[Abs[y - 1] <= radius || Abs[y] <= radius, vy = -vy];           Graphics[       {        Cyan,        Rectangle[{0, 0}, {1, 1}],        Gray,        Disk[{x, y}, radius],         Point[{0.0, 0.0}],         Point[{1.0, 1.0}]        }       ],           {t, 0, Infinity}           ]      P.S. Sorry for my bad english =)
