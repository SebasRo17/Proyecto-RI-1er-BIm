In one of my previous question in this Q&A site, someone suggested me that freelancing is not for everyone. I gave a thought over it and came to a conclusion that it is correct. While it may be a choice of veterans and experts in their own fields in some countries, it is like a rescue boat option in few countries, where there is fierce competition. I am confused on when to use the term freelancing and when to use the term start-up. I may be a freelancer with my name on my business cards, whereas, I may be a freelancer with a one-man start-up, with my firm's name on my business card. I registered my start-up legally but still, it is a one-man show. It is a one- man company. Is it still freelancing? In that case, should I print my firm's name on business card or wait till I get a handful of hired employees? When does the label of freelancing get removed for someone who plans for a start-up?
