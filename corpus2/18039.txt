I would like to solve the equation:               A Exp[m t + s Sqrt[t] x - 1/2 s^2 t] >= K      with respect to `x` (which is in the exponent) using _Mathematica_. All parameters are positive. Of course, the answer is easy to get by hand. However, for some reason I could not figure out how to do it with _Mathematica_. What I tried gave me some error messages. Also, I would like the solution to be expressed without all those conditionals. That is, I want the answer in which all the parameters satisfy whatever they need to satisfy so that the generic solution holds, I would greatly appreciate help in figuring out how to do this.
