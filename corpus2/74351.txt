I currently write web apps using asp.net web forms and getting my company to move to another technology is like [insert funny line here]. I would really like to start writing apps using MVC, but they fear any type of change. How is the best way to convince/ease them into using MVC? I guess this can go for moving to any new technology. ### Update Decided to go the rogue developer route and just started using it. I recreated a small app in MVC and learned the ropes that way, and moved up from there.
