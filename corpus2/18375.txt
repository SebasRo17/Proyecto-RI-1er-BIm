I would like to plot the world map without the countries' borders and just the coastlines (in _Mathematica_ 8). I need to overlap a temperature contour plot on the world map. When I plot country data with lines, it is so crowded because of the lines related to the borders. Plotting with polygons does not help, since I cannot overlap the second plot on top of it. For example in the following command how can I add an option to exclude the borders?                   Graphics[CountryData[#, "Polygon"] & /@ CountryData["Continents"],                   ImageSize -> 400] /. Polygon -> Line      In other words, I need something nice like this but not with polygons and only the coastlines:                   map = Graphics[{GrayLevel[0.5], AbsoluteThickness[1.6],         CountryData[#, {"FullPolygon", {"Equirectangular", {0,             180}}}]} & /@ {"Antarctica", "World"} /. Polygon -> Line,         Frame -> True, FrameStyle -> Directive[Thick],         PlotLabel -> "Precipitation",         FrameLabel -> {"Longitude (°E)", "Latitude (°N)"},        Axes -> True, AxesStyle -> Directive[Gray],        LabelStyle -> Directive[Black, 18, Bold], PlotRangePadding -> None,       ImageSize -> 600,        GridLinesStyle -> Directive[AbsoluteThickness[2], GrayLevel[0.25]],       GridLines -> {Automatic, Automatic},        Method -> {"GridLinesInFront" -> True}];
