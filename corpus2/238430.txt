Is boxing of primitives required in OO languages to keep them consistent with the rest of the object system (generics etc.)? Or is it avoidable - is it possible to avoid any additional performance cost of having both primitives and objects in a language? One solution I can come up on the spot is having references big enough to store values of every possible primitive type. Are there other (better) solutions and are there implemented in popular languages?
