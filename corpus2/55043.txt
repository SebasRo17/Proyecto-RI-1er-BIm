I want to compare 2 plots, and view that 4 lines are exactly the same tangent. So I would like to view 2 images with the same scale in the y-axis and the same scale in the x-axis How can I do this. AspectRatio itÂ´s not a solution for me becasue is a ratio for the image not for the scale               Expr1 = -alfa + 1;     Expr2 = -2 alfa + 2;     Expr3 = 5 alfa;     Expr4 = -alfa + 1;          Plot[{Expr1, Expr2, Expr3, Expr4}, {alfa, 0, 1},      BaseStyle -> AbsoluteThickness[4],       PlotLegends ->        LineLegend["Expressions", BaseStyle -> AbsoluteThickness[4]],       AspectRatio -> 1]      If you plot this one, the same lines moved up/down, you can see that the sacale of y-axis is diferent because the y-range is longer.               Expr1 = -alfa - 2;     Expr2 = -2 alfa + 4;     Expr3 = 5 alfa;     Expr4 = -alfa - 1;          Plot[{Expr1, Expr2, Expr3, Expr4}, {alfa, 0, 1},      BaseStyle -> AbsoluteThickness[4],       PlotLegends ->        LineLegend["Expressions", BaseStyle -> AbsoluteThickness[4]],       AspectRatio -> 1]      I want to maintain the same scale in the y-axis
