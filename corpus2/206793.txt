I was asked to sell the source code (along with existing users) of small utility app I created years ago. I've investigated how to put a price on the source code but so far haven't come up with a good solution. I've searched the net, but haven't found anything useful. Then I came across a few others who also sold their source code with users, but their prices seem unrealistically high. For example, one person calculated price per user at about $200. He had 80 users and ended up selling the source with users for $30k. How did he come up with this price? Can I find a good price with this formula: > (number of users x app price) + (app price x num of new users in one year) ? If this is a good formula, how do you price source that doesn't yet have users?
