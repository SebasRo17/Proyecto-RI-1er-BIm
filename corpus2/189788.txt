I have the following problem. Given A=1, B=2 , ... , Z =26 I need an algorithm that given a letter combination, like the column order in excel, returns me the number/ AA=27 AB=28 ABC? Thanks a lot This is my algorithm so far, I dont like the switch inside the for. Any help is appreciate it, I will write it later in c#               Given A=1, B=2, Z=26. AB=27, ABC?     Variable = ABC     Positions =  Variable.Length -1     Int  result= 0     FOR (i=0; i<= Positions; i++)     {          Letter=Variable[i];         Switch(Letter)         Case A:             LetterValue=1          result=+ result+26*(LetterValue)^i     }
