I'm new to functional programming of Mathematica and trying to remove one list of assorted elements from another. However I only find functions working with the Index rather than the values itself:                list1={b,a,e,f,c,d}        list2={f,e,c}      I can now remove `list2` from `list1`:                result={b,a,d}        I already found out, that you can "abuse"               DeleteCases[list1, a]       to remove 1 specific element from a list, but not a whole assorted list... I would be very grateful for a simple solution to do it.   Thanks a lot for any answer!
