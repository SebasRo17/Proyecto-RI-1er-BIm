I would like to calculate a system of two differential equations in Mathematica using `DSolve`, like:               fx''[x] + a*fx[x] == -I*eta*fy''[x] - b*fy[x], ...      where `fx[x]` and `fy[x]` are unknown functions. Using `DSolve` I can easily find some solutions of the type `fx[x] = C[1]*cosh[x/L] + C[2]*a*sinh[x/L]`, where `L` is a term of the dimension of `x`. The problem is, that the parameters `a` and `b` in my equations have physical dimension (e.g. meter). From the analysis of the solution the two terms in the result have different physical dimension, which is nonsensical. Another option is that Mathematica rescaled `C[1]` so that finally it has dimension of `a*C[2]`. My question is: Can I somehow control the physical dimensions of the parameters `(a,b)` in the differential equations or the constants `C[1]`, `C[2]` in the result?
