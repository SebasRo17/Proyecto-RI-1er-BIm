I would like to show some eye-movements datas as animation on an iPad. That is to see the gazes as they occured as a function of time. Ideally We would only see the Graphics objects, not the dynamic controls. I have about 50 trials with each 3000 gazes I would like to show. Preferably, all in one video with each trial looping 3 times. Now I have encountered mny problems : To illustrate, this is equivalent to my situation exept I`ll have about 50 different animations instead of 2.               pts = RandomReal[{-#, #}, {100, 2}] & /@ Range[2];     graphObj = {{Blue, Rectangle[{-1, -1}, {1, 1}]},                  {Red,Rectangle[{-.5, -.5}, {.5, .5}]}}                    Manipulate[      Animate[       Graphics[{        graphObj[[stimNo]],        White, Line@pts[[stimNo]][[;; gazeNo]]},        Background -> Black,         PlotRange -> {{-3, 3}, {-3, 3}}],      {gazeNo, Range[2, 100, 1]},       DefaultDuration -> 3,       AnimationRepetitions -> 1,       AnimationRunning -> False,       Paneled -> False],      {stimNo, Range[2]},      ControlType -> Setter,      Paneled -> False]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uKlub.png) QUESTIONS / PROBLEMS : -I am not sure of the best format for the iPad and how I could play those animations. -I have not been able to export the correct duration (3 seconds to see my 3000gazes}. -I could only achieve the above exporting the Animate[] object itself, leaving me with the controls on the .mov. My attempts to use ListManipulate [] have yet all failed. I must say I have looked at very bits of the help menu relating to exporting animations without success.
