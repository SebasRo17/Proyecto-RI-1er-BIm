I have a .NET web server application I'm building that I plan to host at a .NET cloud hosting platform, like AppHarbor with SQL server. It will be used by multiple small groups of people to record and processes votes at an election (the current system is called TallyJ). I also need my users to be able to set up a self-contained edition on a single PC, or as a server on a PC with an ad hoc LAN that is **not** connected to the internet when it is being used. My current plan would be to use IIS Express and SQL CE for a local setup. With that, the local and hosted versions of code and SQL would be the same. Does this sound viable, or am I missing something? Do you have any suggestions for a better set of tools (but limited to C# and a relational database on the server/cloud)?
