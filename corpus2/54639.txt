Is it possible to have in eclipse 2 "team providers" for same project. E.g. svn and mercurial? So svn will be used to commit to central repository, and mercurial only to work on my PC. E.g. when I get updates from SVN, I commit to mercurial, then I work with mercurial. When everything is ready to go to central place, i commit in SVN. There is no need to integrate change history. Yes, ideally it will be just mercurial, and most probably it will happened later. But for now I want to try some dirty and fast solution if it exist :)
