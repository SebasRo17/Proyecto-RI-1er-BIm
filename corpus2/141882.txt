Most Scrum teams lean toward 7-15 people ****** , though it's not clear how to scale Scrum among 100s of people, or how the effectiveness of a given team might be compared to another team within the group; meaning beyond just breaking the group into Scrum teams of 7-15 people, it's unclear how efforts between the teams are managed, compared, etc. **Any suggestions related to either of these topics, or additional related topics that might be of more importance to account for in planning a large scale SCRUM grouping?** ****** In reviewing research related to the suggested size of software development teams, which appears to be the basis for the suggested Scrum team size, I found what appears to be an error in the research which oddly appears to show that bigger teams (15+ ppl), not smaller teams (7 ppl) are better. * * * **UPDATE, "Re: Scrum doesn't scale":** Made huge amounts of progress personally researching the topic, but thought I'd respond to the general belief of some that Scrum doesn't scale by citing a quote from Succeeding with Agile by Mike Cohn : > **Scrum Does Scale:** You have to admire the intellectual honesty of the > earliest agile authors. They were all very careful to say that agile > methodolgies like Scrum were for small projects. This conservatism wasn’t > because agile or Scrum turned out to be unsuited for large projects but > because they hadn’t used these processes on large projects and so were > reluctant to advise their readers to do so. But, in the years since the > Agile Manifesto and the books that came shortly before and after it, we have > learned that the principles and practices of agile development can be scaled > up and applied on large projects, albeit it with a considerable amount of > overhead. Fortunately, if large organizations use the techniques described > regarding the role of the product owner, working with a shared product > backlog, being mindful of dependencies, coordinating work among teams, and > cultivating communities of practice, they can successfully scale a Scrum > project. > > **SOURCE:** (ran across the book thanks to Ladislav Mrnka answer)
