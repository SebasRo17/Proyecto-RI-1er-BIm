I am having problems understanding how this equation works in c:               char *sum(char *a, int b) {         return &a[b];     }          printf("%d", sum(5, 4));      I understand how arrays work, and I understand how to reference and de- reference a variable to a memory location, but I don't understand where the addition comes in to play here. It makes sense to me that `return &a[4]` for example would just return a de- referenced non-existent memory location and cause an error. Can someone explain this to me in easy terminology?
