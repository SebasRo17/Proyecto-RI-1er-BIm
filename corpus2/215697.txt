Need to access `HTTP` session for fetching as well storing some information.I am using `Spring-MVC` for my application and i have 2 options here.   1. User `Request/ Session` in my Controller method and do my work   2. Use `RequestContextHolde` to access Session information. I am separating some calculation logic from Controller and want to access Session information in this new layer and for that i have 2 options   1. Pass session or Request object to other method in other layer and perform my work.   2. use `RequestContextHolder.currentRequestAttributes()` to access `request/ session` and perform my work. I am not sure which is right way to go? with second approach, i can see that method calling will be more clean and i need not to pass `request/ session` each time.
