I am lost on how to plan the development of a iphone mobile app, when building a specific mobile app for a client, i need to make a questionnaire for that same client and i also need to have a document to accompany the project development, something like a bug report file, and a app features document. My question is, for the experienced developers, what do you guys use to plan your entire development process? do you have any doc templates that you use to address these issues?
