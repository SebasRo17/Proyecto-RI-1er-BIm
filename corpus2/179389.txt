Okay, say I have a point coordinate.               var coordinate = { x: 10, y: 20 };      Now I also have a distance and an angle.               var distance = 20;     var angle = 72;      The problem I am trying to solve is, if I want to travel 20 points in the direction of angle from the starting coordinate, how can I find what my new coordinates will be? I know the answer involves things like sine/cosine, because I used to know how to do this, but I have since forgotten the formula. Can anyone help?
