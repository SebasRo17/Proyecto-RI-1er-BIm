This is my code for making a label. I used a `Button` expression to build it. Is there a better way to make a label? My objection to doing it this way is that, when I set `Enabled -> True`, the button becomes clickable. For my application, I don't want anything clickable.               Button[StringJoin["Label", ToString[3]], Null,        Background -> Black, BaseStyle -> {White, 16, Bold}, Enabled -> False]
