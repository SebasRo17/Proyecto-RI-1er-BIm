I've worked in a few shops where management has passed the idea of pair programming either to me or another manager/developer, and I can't get behind it at all. From a developer stand-point I can't find a reason why moving to this coding style would be beneficial, nor as a manager of a small team have I seen any benefit. I understand that it helps on basic syntax errors and can be helpful if you need to hash something out, but managers that are out of the programming loop seem to keep seeing it as a way of keeping their designers from going to Facebook or Reddit than as a design tool. As someone close to the development floor that apparently can't quite understand from a book tossed my way or a wiki page on the subject... from a high level management position, what are the benefits of Pair Programming when dealing with Scrum or Agile environments?
