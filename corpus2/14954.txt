I know it is possible to create a filling in between two curves on a 2D plot, but is it possible to do the same in 3D? My attempt like this:               Z1 := E^(-x^2) Cos[x^2 + y^2]     Z2 := 2 - x^2 - y^2          Plot3D[{Z1, Z2}, {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1}, AspectRatio -> 1,      ViewPoint -> {4, 1, 1}, Filling -> Top, FillingStyle -> Opacity[0.9]]      yields the graph below: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FcHgF.png) Is there a way I can fill the graph between the two aforementioned 3D surfaces? Thank you for your time.
