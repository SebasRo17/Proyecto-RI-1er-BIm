I have a relatively simple bit of code that looks like the following:               ---some code here---     If[statement, Abort[]];     ---more code following---      However, while `$Aborted` appears as output, the evaluation of the rest of the cell does not abort, continuing execution of code beyond the `If` statement. How do I actually get the running cell to cease evaluating the rest of the cell? **Edit:** It seems that one way to accomplish this is to wrap the entire cell in parenthesis, e.g., but this is a fairly ugly solution, especially with auto-formatting turned on (my cell has many lines of code, and the parenthesis are huuuuuge). Anyone have a more elegant solution?               (     ---some code here---     If[statement, Abort[]];     ---more code following---     )
