I wonder if it's a good idea to be slightly funny during a job interview. I don't mean to try to tell a joke, but just to insert a humourous thought, related to the question or the theme we talk about. I often use humour when I feel that there is too much stress or when people are not "connected" and the ambiance is frozen. I don't know if I can use this trick to have the thing going smoothly. Is this something to avoid at all cost ? _PS / This is more a question asked to "heavy-duty" interviewers than to job seekers._
