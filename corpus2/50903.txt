I have developed my thesis codes by means of Mathematica software in a .nb file format. Despite using the available Parallel code capabilities and doing all the numerical integrations by means of parallel programming; the duration of programme run is so so much high; something like 2 to 3 weeks; which makes the debugging and verification part of the thesis almost unavailable. My question goes to two branches:   1. How can I make my programme more efficient and run faster.   2. I have heard that by applying the Cude or GPU programming; the duration of run will significantly be reduced. How is it possible to automatically change and turn my present codes to a Cude GPU code? As far as I am facing lack of time for my thesis; answers to my questions and helping me decrease the run duration will be so appreciated.
