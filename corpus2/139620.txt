I'm dealing with pretty stressful (in my opinion) situation in my current work place. We've started developing new project, get some requirements, implemented it and then show to someone you can call a 'business advisor' (person who knows business requirements but will not use the program). That person is supposed to evaluate application from customers point of view, test it etc. Here how the 'process' looks:   1. business advisor talks in the evening with my boss for hour or two on windows messenger   2. the next day I receive email with copy of that conversation. I am supposed to choose tasks from that, check reported bugs (which often aren't bugs, just poor testing and forgetting about past establishments)   3. I implement changes, implementation gets accepted and then in a week or two it turns out that isn't want they want (they talked with some potential client that have seen software for 5 minutes and he suggested changes) - I have to do new changes Don't get me wrong, I understand that sometimes requirements change. What upsets me is how often the change occur in my workplace and how easy for 'management' is two give new requirements or sometimes fundamental changes to existing features. At the same we working on tight deadlines and I have impression that instead of going forward with our software we're running circles. I seek advise from you how to deal with this situation? Is this normal situation and I'm just hypersensitive about it?
