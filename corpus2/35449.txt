I have several curves on the same parametric 3D plot and I would like to highlight some curves dynamically by choosing them from list.                sol = Solve[ 2 x + 2 x^2 - 3 x^3 + 26 x^4 + 32 x^5 + 21 x^6 - 18 x^7 == r, {x}];      lolAux[r_] = x /. sol;      ParametricPlot3D[         Table[{r, lolAux[r][[i]] // Re, lolAux[r][[i]] // Im}, {i, 1, Length[sol]}],       {r, -5, 5}, BoxRatios -> {1, 1, 1}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Jdcdn.png) How it is possible?
