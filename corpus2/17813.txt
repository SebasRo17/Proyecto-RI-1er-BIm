I am trying to write a part of my code. I am using NestWhileList. However, I couldn't find out the right syntax for testing. It should compare previous result and current result and continue if it is True. I want to do this, for instance :               NestWhileList[# + RandomInteger[{-5, 5}] &, 10, previousresult <= currentresult];      and If I have two test options for NestWhileList, for instance :                 NestWhileList[# + RandomInteger[{-5, 5}] &, 10, previousresult <= currentresult && previous result<0];      Is there a way to do it? **Second Question** (This question is not absolutely related to first question.) In addition, if I can't do that, i will try to create a list without testing. If I create list, how can I compare successive two component of list in a functional way? Any help is appreciated.
