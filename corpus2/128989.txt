From a security perspective, the special characters like '&' or `<b>` are a big no no in URLs and query strings. I could find the articles that explained the ways to bypass this restriction, but could find something that explained with example how can this be a security risk. Please explain the risks of these special characters. The question is simpler and I could google a bit more to find the answer. But the reason I am asking it here is that it will help someone in the future. Besides the level of detailing and specification one gets here, cannot be learned anywhere else.
