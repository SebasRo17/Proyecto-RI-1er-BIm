I have a simple 3d dataset (size 7035 x 3, I put it on my site if you want to check) which I want to plot with ListContourPlot:               x = Import["http://www.inrim.it/~magni/a.dat"];     ListContourPlot[x, PlotRange -> {All, {0, 6}}]      ... and so far so good. But the x scale must - for various reasons - be rescaled, so I did this:               ListContourPlot[x /. {H_, f_, s_} -> {H*80, f, s}, PlotRange -> {All, {0, 6}}]      and M is unable to complete: after some seconds it exits _without errors_ , and I discover the kernel has quit!
