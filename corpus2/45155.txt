HI, i want to buy a netbook for doing some stuff in the train. Can someone report how it is to code simple stuff on a netbook? 10/12". I wanted to buy a very cheap one. like 1gb ram 1,6ghz blabla. and run linux on it with apache. i will code with JS/PHP. and as IDE i'll be using notepad++. so nothing big like eclispe or something else. maybe later on eclipse for java, but that doesn't really matter. so first, would this setup work fine on such a netbook and, is it okay for coding? I don't style any homepages on the netbook, I just want to code. would be nice if someone can share his experience in that. thanks :)
