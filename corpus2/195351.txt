Unfortunately I have to work in a room full of talking colleagues. In order to concentrate, I wear headphones with music on at top volume, but this makes me sick at the end of the day. I would prefer silence, but there is no chance to get a private office. I could try and find some hidden place in the building and work on a laptop, but my boss wouldn't be happy with that. And I could leave the company, but I don't want to - I really like my job here. Industrial workers working in a noisy environment usually wear special earmuffs. I'm considering to get a pair of these, but I have two problems:   1. I don't know whether industrial earmuffs really filter out the noise of talking. Maybe these are designed to isolate _very_ loud noises. Talking is not loud here, it's just irritating.   2. These earmuffs usually have a weight of approx. 250 g. I don't know if this weight on the head is tolerable for, say, 8-10 hours of coding. Has anyone ever tried to wear industrial earmuffs during programming? Thank you in advance. **=== UPDATE ===** Instead of industrial earmuffs I chose to try custom-molded earplugs. My earplugs are made of medical silicone. They fill my ears completely and dampen the chatter well enough. It's relatively slow to remove them, which is an advantage: people who would like to bother me during programming have to wait. Maybe they will understand what I want and just leave me working. Anyway, I also tried SimplyNoise. The brown noise dampens chatter better than my earplugs, but it's really exhausting. The rain sound is much better in this respect. I also found it less tiresome than listening to music.
