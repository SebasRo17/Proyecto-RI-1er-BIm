I want to make a 3D plot of two variable i1 and b1. The dependent variable results from a pay-off function               payoff1 :=  q1*((1 + g1)*b1*10000 - i1*10000) - (1 - q1)*(1 - d)*i1*10000      The problem is that q1 is actually the result from an integral calculation:               q1 := NIntegrate[combo1, {x, 0, 2000000}]      where "combo1" is a function that is defined higher and that is also dependent on i1 and b1. I want to make this plot:               Plot3D[payoff1, {i1, 0, 20}, {b1, 0, 50}]      So for every value of i1 and b1, it should make the q1-calculation, but what _Mathematica_ does (because I think I have a bug in my code here) is to always take the initial q1 value. How could I solve this problem? Thank you! The entire code can be found here: First some parameters are introduced:               mue = 0.25     mui = 0.25     lambdae = 0.25     lambdai = 0.25     sigmap = 0.05     betae = 0.05     betai = 0.05     gammae = 0.10     gammai = 0.50     d = 0.8     experience1 = 7     experience2 = 6      Some functions are added:               g1 := betae*Exp[-mue*experience1] + betai*Exp[-mui*i1]     g2 := betae*Exp[-mue*experience2] + betai*Exp[-mui*i2]     sd1 := Sqrt[sigmap^2 + (gammae*Exp[-lambdae*experience1])^2 + (gammai*        Exp[-lambdai*i1])^2]*1000000     sd2 := Sqrt[sigmap^2 + (gammae*Exp[-lambdae*experience2])^2 + (gammai*        Exp[-lambdai*i2])^2]*1000000          bid1 := NormalDistribution[1000000*(1 + g1)*(1 + b1/100), sd1]     bid2 := NormalDistribution[1000000*(1 + b2/100) (1 + g2), sd2]          pbid1 := PDF[bid1, x]     pbid2 := PDF[bid2, x]     cbid1 := 1 - CDF[bid1, x]     cbid2 := 1 - CDF[bid2, x]     combo1 := pbid1*cbid2          q1 := NIntegrate[combo1, {x, 0, 2000000}]          combo2 := pbid2*cbid1          q2 := NIntegrate[combo2, {x, 0, 2000000}]               payoff1 := q1*((1 + g1)*b1*10000 - i1*10000) - (1 - q1)*(1 - d)*i1*10000     payoff2 := q2*((1 + g2)*b2*10000 - i2*10000) - (1 - q2)*(1 - d)*i2*10000      And now I want to make the plot for payoff1, given that (example):               i2 = 5     b2 = 10          Plot3D[payoff1, {i1, 0, 20}, {b1, 0, 50}]      If I make a plot for q1, I think I get the right one, but the one of the pay- off does not seem correct/logic. Afterwards I will need to solve the system of equations (given that now i1,i2,b1 and b2 are unknown) There is also still a problem, but that might be caused by the above stated problem.               eq1 := D[payoff1, i1]     eq2 := D[payoff1, b1]     eq3 := D[payoff2, i2]     eq4 := D[payoff2, b2]          FindRoot[{eq1 == 0, eq2 == 0, eq3 == 0, eq4 == 0}  , {{i1, 5}, {i2, 5}, {b1, 5}, {b2, 5}}]      I am very new to the world of Mathematica, so thank you for any help. Regards, ## Dennis New code: I implemented the new code now, but than a numerical integration error occurs and there is already a problem by making pbid1 (a normal probability distribution function). Here is the new code (so, i2 and b2 are given; i1 and b1 are unknown): The parameters that were introduced are still te same. The functions become:               g1[i1_] := betae*Exp[-mue*experience1] + betai*Exp[-mui*i1]     g2 := betae*Exp[-mue*experience2] + betai*Exp[-mui*i2]          sd1[i1_] := Sqrt[sigmap^2 + (gammae*Exp[-lambdae*experience1])^2 + (gammai*Exp[-lambdai*i1])^2]*1000000     sd2 := Sqrt[sigmap^2 + (gammae*Exp[-lambdae*experience2])^2 + (gammai*Exp[-lambdai*i2])^2]*1000000          bid1[b1_, g1_, sd1_] := NormalDistribution[1000000*(1 + g1[i1])*(1 + b1/100), sd1[i1]]     bid2 := NormalDistribution[1000000*(1 + b2/100) (1 + g2), sd2]      A problem occurs already in this statement:               pbid1[bid1_, x_] := PDF[bid1[b1, g1[i1], sd1[i1]], x]      The probability density function pbid2 causes no problems:               pbid2[x_] := PDF[bid2, x]      The remainder of the code:               cbid1[bid1_, x_] := 1 - CDF[bid1[b1, g1[i1], sd1[i1]], x]     cbid2[x_] := 1 - CDF[bid2, x]          combo1[pbid1_, cbid2_] := pbid1[bid1[b1, g1[i1], sd1[i1]], x]*cbid2[x]          q1[combo1_] := NIntegrate[combo1[pbid1[bid1[b1, g1[i1], sd1[i1]], x], cbid2[x]], {x, 0, 2000000}]      When Evaluating the integral, I get the non-numerical values error. And finally, for the pay-off, I was thinking of this formula:               payoff1[combo1_, g1_, b1_, i1_] := q1[combo1[pbid1[bid1[b1, g1[i1], sd1[i1]], x], cbid2[x]]]*((1 + g1[i1])*b1*10000 - i1*10000) - (1 - q1[combo1[pbid1[bid1[b1, g1[i1], sd1[i1]], x], cbid2[x]]])*(1 - d)*i1*10000      I have not really a clue where something is going wrong.
