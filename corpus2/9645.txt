So far I have been solving non-linear pdes with `NDSolve` and then plotting the result with the in-built `Plot3D` and `ContourPlots`. An example file can be found **here**. This is a two part question with part 1 leading in to part 2. ## Part 1 How do I interpret the interpolating function (how do I read it)? For instance, I can "expand" the `InterpolatingFunction` with > `InterpolatingFunctionGrid[hSol]` This obviously has all the points that `Plot3D` plots with. How do I read this, say, row-wise or column-wise to make more sense of whats going on? ## Part 2 How can I save this data to a `.csv` format or just some external file to use, say, gnuplot or some other plotting routine? I have trid `DumpSave` etc . but the resulting huge files are generally not cross platform compatible.
