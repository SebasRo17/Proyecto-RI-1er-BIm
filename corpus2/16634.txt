How can I make a simple 3D graphic as in the following image? ![Figure](http://s10.postimage.org/exfxxtgh5/3d_figure.jpg)   I know it is simply a sphere and a circle with several joining lines but I dont know how to make such simple one. I can use `ParametricPlot3D` to draw the sphere $(\cos[u]\cos[v],\cos[u]\sin[v],\sin[u])$ for $-\pi\leq u,v\leq\pi$ and the circular orbit which can be taken as the intersection of the sphere with a twice radius and the plane $y+z=0$ or $x-y+z=0$. But I can not simplify the figure, i.e., making the sphere transparent so that the data can be put inside it and etc.
