There are many ways how to exit program in C. Some of them are returning zero or error code, using exit function with EXIT_SUCCESS, EXIT_FAILURE, exit(0), exit(1) or some other error code, abort and probably few more I can't think of now. My question is which option is the best and why. I'm asking here because every time I asked more experienced programmers this question, it ended up as a holy war.
