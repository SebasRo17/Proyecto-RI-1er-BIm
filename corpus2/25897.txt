I want to minimize a quadratic equation, but Mathematica does not solve it and only rewrites the solution. I wonder if there exist any way I can skip the computation by hand (I can solve it using Lagrangian method, but it is too long).               y = {y1, y2, y3}     yp = {yp1, yp2, yp3}     ypp = {ypp1, ypp2, ypp3}     Minimize[{(ypp1 - yp1)^2 + (ypp2 - yp2)^2 + (ypp3 - yp3)^2,                  Mean[ypp] == 0 && Variance[ypp] == 1}, ypp]
