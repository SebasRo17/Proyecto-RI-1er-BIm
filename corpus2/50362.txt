I am trying to go through this Wolfram Blog example: http://blog.wolfram.com/2009/02/12/flag-analysis-with-mathematica/ on country flag analysis. I am having a problem understanding the following piece of code:               countryColors =       (# -> Catch[Intersection[               StringSplit[                If[Head[#] === Missing, Throw[""], #]& @                 CountryData[#, "FlagDescription"]],               colorNames]]) & /@ CountryData[];      where `colorNames` is just a list of colors. I do not understand `&@` in the above piece of code. What I know is that `&` is used to define a pure function, and `@` is used as a Prefix. If, for example, the `If` yields true, then it returns a country name. What does it mean to have `&@` after that?
