I have an idea at work for a new Product Manager position at our office. I work with several developers, and it would be helpful to have someone working in a type of "Scrum Master" capacity, dividing out assignments and making sure they get complete. This position does not currently exist, however I feel that I have enough evidence to indicate that it be very helpful for our business. What is the best way to present this proposal to my boss? Is there a specific template that you know of for new position? It should be able to describe the qualification for the position, their responsibilities, and what metrics we would use to measure them. **UPDATE** With Anna's suggestion, I gave more details about this specific position. However, I would ideally like the most generic way to present a new position to my boss.
