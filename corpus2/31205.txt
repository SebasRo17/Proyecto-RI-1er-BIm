Is there a way to set what symbols's definitions I do not want to store? Consider the following code:               f := $MachineID;     SetDirectory[NotebookDirectory[]];     Save["testm.m", f];          ClearAll@f          << "testm.m"     f      > >     Set::specset: Cannot change the value of special symbol $MachineID. >> >     0000-00000-00001 (*id of storing machine*) >     0000-00000-00002 (*id of getting machine*) >   This happens bacause `testm.m` contains: > >     f := $MachineID >     $MachineID = "0000-00000-00001" >   **Questions:**   * Is there nicer way to avoid this than my approach:              f:= Symbol["MachineID"]       ?   * Is it `Protected` attribute which decides what is going to be stored? Because there is no problem if `f:=SystemID` but:              Attributes[{$SystemID, $MachineID}]      > >     {{Locked, Protected}, {}} >   **Edit** :   * Why `MachineID` is not protected? - **The bounty is founded for this question.**
