I'm making a .NET application where I'll have a lot of data entries. This will not go to any server though, but needs to be stored and updated, frequently on the local machine. I would like something like an SQL database, that simply exists in a file, in my application's folder (or in %appdata% or whatever). But how do I go about this? What can I use? I'm a big fan of Linq2Sql, so if it supports that, it would be awesome. I've tried to use MSSQL Compact, but I couldn't really get it to work very well. It basically required me to install MSSQL as well. What options do I have, other than MSSQL Compact?
