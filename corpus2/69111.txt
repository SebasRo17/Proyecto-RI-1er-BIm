I'm having a discussion with someone quite older than me, so I have no place in telling him what is wise. He is in the computer field but resists change, and we're discussing how his co-workers are enjoying learning a new technology and he's just avoiding it like the plague. I'm looking for maybe some good reading or testimony to support following trends and learning new technologies, rather than falling behind and sticking with what you know even as it's outdated. The kind of stuff which you might have someone who's in love with BASIC or PASCAL or mainframes read, because they won't listen to you directly. Internet articles or convincing, well-written blog posts preferred, but any good books are welcome too.
