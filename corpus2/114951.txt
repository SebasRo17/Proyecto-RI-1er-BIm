In our startup, we've worked until now using the traditional waterfall model, but we want to try our next project using Agile Methodology. We are pretty much alien to the entire Agile process, so considering this, what is the best way to understand Agile (resources and a practical handbook can be of help), decide on a specific methodology (Scrum, etc), and start it in our next project?
