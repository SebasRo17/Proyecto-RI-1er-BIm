I have a system with 3 degrees of freedom that I want to know if it is possible to visualise with `Mathematica` in the two-dimensional $X-Y$ plane. I have a plane circular object rotating at its set speed say $10$ deg/s. This object is not rotating at the $(0, 0)$ origin point but is displaced from the origin $(0, 0)$ coordinates and its motion path is described by $x=x_0 + a \times \cos(\omega \: t)$ and $y=a \times \sin(\omega \: t)$ Some values: $x_0 = 1$ mm; $a=0.25$ mm, $\omega=10$ deg/s (same as the rotating speed of the circular object). The radius of the circular object can be taken to be a couple of cm say $2$ cm. The time parameter $t$ in the parametric equations can be discretised in $20$ steps as follows: $\mathrm{step}= \frac{360 \; \mathrm{deg}}{\omega \times 20} = \frac{360}{10 \times 20}=1.8$ s so that $\mathrm{step}$ will take values $0$, $1.8$, $3.6$, $\ldots$, $34.2$ s. Thus the product $\omega \: t$ as the cosine and sine arguments of the parametric path can be written as $\omega \: t = \omega \times \frac{\mathrm{step \times \pi}}{180}$ which in units gives $\frac{\mathrm{deg}}{\mathrm{seconds}} \times \frac{\mathrm{seconds} \times \mathrm{radians}}{\mathrm{deg}} = \mathrm{radians}$. Any help will be appreciated to this `Mathematica` newbie on how to go about to simulate this kind of motion. Desired animation fatures:   1. Perhaps the circular object can have **hatched shading** so that its rotating motion can be seen on top of its following the parametric circular path;   2. The $x-$ and $y-$axes should be visible;   3. The parametric path given by the parametric equations in $x$ and $y$ should be visible as a circle.
