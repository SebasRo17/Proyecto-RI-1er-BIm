I want to find the first 5 prime numbers of the form $n^6 + 1091$. I have used this code:                Timing[Select[Table[n^6 + 1091, {n, 10000}], PrimeQ, 5]]      Which gives the desired answer, and takes 0.0156 seconds. What if I didn't have a rough idea of what values of $n$ to check?               Timing[Select[Table[n^6 + 1091, {n, 100000}], PrimeQ, 5]]      Takes 10 times as long. So, my question is: Is there a simple(ish) way to make _Mathematica_ stop when the desired number of solutions are found?
