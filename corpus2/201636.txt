We are working on project where we have to manage these conditions. i.e.: A User can save an order under these conditions:   * User has permission "SaveOrder"   * Order is in state "shipped"   * Online Shop is opened. This condition is for example - I would like to point out, that we have three conditions from different areas(role and permissions, inner state of object order and state of another domain object). In a previous project we used this code:               public static bool CanSaveOrder(Order order)     {        return        CurrentPrincipal.HasPermission(Permissions.SaveOrder) &&        order.State == States.Shipped &&        OnlineShop.IsOpen();     }      But I feel that there can be a more elegant/dynamic solution. I have read something about a "business role engine". Is it a right way to manage this condition?
