I need to automate mouse clicks with _Mathematica_. However, a similiar question was closed on this forum, without any answer. Consider the following steps:                Dynamic[MousePosition[]]      In this first step I dynamically show the mouse position.                DynamicModule[{col = Green}, EventHandler[ Style["text", FontColor ->       Dynamic[col]], {"MouseClicked" :> (col = col /. {Red -> Green, Green -> Red})}]]      In this second step I create a "clickable" text: when you click it, it changes its color between green and red. My objective here is twofold: **1)** automatically move the cursor position - this has already been answered here. So, following the original answer I can write               Needs["JLink`"];     ReinstallJava[];     robotclass = JavaNew["java.awt.Robot"];     robotclass@mouseMove[90, 196];      **2)** automatically click on the clickable text (and, of course, I want to see its color changing). Here is the code I'm trying to use:               robotclass@mousePress[InputEvent.BUTTON1_MASK];     robotclass@mouseRelease[InputEvent.BUTTON1_MASK];      Although I believe I'm using the correct functions (which belong to the Java Robot Class), I'm getting the following error message: > Java::argx1: Method named mouseRelease defined in class java.awt.Robot was > called with an incorrect number or type of arguments. The argument was > InputEvent.BUTTON1_MASK. Can anybody give me a hint to solve this problem?
