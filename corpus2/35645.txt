I have some old notebook files in version 3 format from the book "Mathematica for Physicists". These files are blank except for the chapter header when opened in Mathematica 9. I have similar problems with other old notebooks. For example, there is an old notebook called Mir Space Station and it exhibits similar behavior, opening it shows only headers, no formulas or calcuable cells. How can I recover these notebooks and use them in Version 9?
