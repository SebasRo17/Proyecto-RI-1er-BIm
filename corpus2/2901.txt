In the following               HH = H /. {μ -> 1, Δ -> .3, L -> 11, ky -> 0};     Plot[Re[Sort[Eigenvalues[HH]]], {kx, -2 π/11, 2 π/11}, PlotPoints -> 10]      where `H` is a matrix expression that depends on `kx, ky, μ, L, Δ`. Is there a faster way to plot the numerical eigenvalues of this matrix as a function of `kx`, for example? Any help would be really appreciated. **Update** I'd like to state, I want to do this purely numerical. My issue is that I want to solve the eigenvalue problem for MANY values of `kx`. H can be large in this case, sometimes 400 by 400. I only used 10 `PlotPoints` just as an example. I found that `Table` is very quick and I can do a `ListLinePlot`. I just naively thought this same operation would be done in `Plot`. This is where my confusion still lies if someone wants to help :) **Second Update** Here is `H` as requested.               NN = 40;     MM = 2 NN + 1;     kM = Table[           Boole[m == n] (ky + I (kx + m 2 π/L)),            {m, -NN, NN, 1}, {n, -NN, NN, 1}];          kM2 = Table[            Boole[m == n] (ky - I (kx + m 2 π/L)),             {m, -NN, NN, 1}, {n, -NN, NN, 1}];          μM = IdentityMatrix[MM] μ;          ΔM = (Δ I/2 )                  * Table[ (KroneckerDelta[m, n - 1] - KroneckerDelta[m, n + 1]),                           {m, -NN, NN, 1}, {n, -NN, NN, 1}];          H = ArrayFlatten[{          {-μM, kM,0 μM, ΔM},           {kM2, -μM, -ΔM, 0 μM},           {0 μM, -ΔM, μM, kM2},           {ΔM, 0 μM, kM, μM}         }];      **Third update**   This is initially represented as $h= \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{k}-\mu$ $h_\tau= \vec{\sigma^{\ast}} \cdot \vec{k}+\mu$ $H=\left(\begin{array}{cc} h & i \Delta \sigma_y\\\ -i \Delta\sigma_y & h_\tau \end{array}\right)$ where $\sigma$ are the Pauli matrices. The individual values change do to some implications from a physical system. I didn't want to get too deep into the physics, as there is another stack for that. The block elements don't commute because the Pauli matrices don't commute, but if you see any symmetries that I don't see please do enlighten me. So far I've always done this numerically.
