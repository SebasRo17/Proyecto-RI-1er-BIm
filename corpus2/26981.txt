I am getting strange behavior when I try to calculate the inverse of an interpolating function for two similar data sets. My data sets are:               Array1 = {25, 425, 825, 1175, 1575, 1975, 2025, 2625, 3225, 3775, 4375, 4975, 5250, 9250,                13250, 16750, 20750, 24750, 27500, 47500, 67500, 82500, 102500}          Array2 = {13, 88, 188, 263, 338, 413, 513, 588, 613, 688, 788, 863, 938, 1013, 1113, 1188,               1250, 1950, 2650, 3350, 4050, 4750, 5450, 6150, 6700, 13700, 20700, 27700, 34700, 41700,               48700, 55700}      Let's define:               int1 = Interpolation[Array1];     int2 = Interpolation[Array2];          inv1 = InverseFunction[int1];     inv2 = InverseFunction[int2];      Now if these are behaving, then taking the inverse of the interpolating function's value for X should return X. Here's what happens when we try that for, say, 5:               N[inv1[int1[5]]]      > Out: 5.               N[inv2[int2[5]]      > Out: -1.73315 Err...this makes no sense. Is there any reason that the inverse of an interpolating function would behave as expected with one data set but not another? These data sets aren't very different so it isn't clear to me what about the second set could be causing the routine heartburn.
