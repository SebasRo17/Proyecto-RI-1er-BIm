I am working on a project (software) for an organization. Someone else from that organization asked If I could build something for the organization. I did so, for free in fact because I wanted to support this organization. Now heres the problem. This other person, has come back and asked me to polish up the titles/credits give to us in the about screen. But he want's to be called the lead Developer and call me lead Programmer. The thing is that, he has not contributed any code towards this application. Thing is, I feel that I developed/programmed/designed the entire thing. I did 100% of the actual product including design. His input was, can we have it have a specific color background (for design) or how soon "we" can incorporate another feature. Maybe I'm being one sided, but technical stuff wise, the other person has no "developmental" use. I'm still happy to have him, because he is my contact within the organization and he has brought some interest into the product but I don't know if the title is fitting. What do you think the best title/solution is here? Am I being narcissistic/worrying about things that don't matter? Let me be clearer 1. Dude asks me if I can make something 2. I say yes. I want to help the organization that he works for (the product is not for profit) 3. I build the thing with design and stuff 4. Initial launch. 5. He suggests some design changes, maybe a feature. 6. I change + add features 7. Pretty successful, generates interest in growing larger 8. And then, the tittle issue Would Lead Consultant be a nice way out of this?
