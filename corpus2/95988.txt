I've worked different kind of applications both having centralized and decentralized logging mechanisms. I feel centralized logging mechanism is good to see the proper flow of code and timing of executions while debugging problems. Most of the implementations will have small fixed file size for easily narrowing down the problem. But if the number of components is too high within the system I feel the log directory will get exhausted with huge number of files. Is it a good idea to employ decentralized (module-wise) logging mechanisms in such situations? What are the pros and cons of the same?
