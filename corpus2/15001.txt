I run mathematica on a remote server and run it in batch mode using /math -noprompt -script 'scriptname.m' & Now, I use ssh -X to connect to the server. The server is linux based and my computer is a mac. I use x11 forwarding. I would like to generate PDFs in the above mentioned 'script.m'. In my code, how should I incorporate UseFrontEnd? should I invoke it first using ConnectToFrontEnd[] ? Should I use UseFrontEnd[Export["blah.pdf",fig]] or is it a one time thing? Also, when using the UseFrontEnd command, is it required that I do ssh -X/Y or is it sufficient if I do ssh? I greatly appreciate your help. Thanks. P.S - I am using mathematica 8
