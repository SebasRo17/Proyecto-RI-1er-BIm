I'm working on some project where I have to make a database for data which is currently kept in excel files, so I have to do some changes before writing the data into the database. I'm going to read those files using Java, and write them from Java into the db. Should I use Hibernate for that job? Or how else can I connect to those Excel sheets, read data in Java, with database? I'm new in this, so I don't have any experience. Also english isn't my native language, so I'm sorry because of grammar errors.
