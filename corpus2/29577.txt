I have a list in which the first index is mostly increasing, but dips sometimes. I need to split this list in two or more lists in this way: when the first element of a pair is smaller than the preceding first element, I need to split the list and create new separate lists. This is an explanatory example:               list = {{1, 10}, {2, 20}, {3, 30}, {4, 40}, {5,50},             {2, 20}, {3, 30}, {4, 40}, {5, 50}, {1, 10}, {2, 20}, {4, 40}};          newlist1 = {{1, 10}, {2, 20}, {3, 30}, {4, 40}, {5, 50}};     newlist2 = {{2, 20} {3, 30} {4, 40} {5, 50}};     newlist3 = {{1, 10}, {2, 20}, {4, 40}};
