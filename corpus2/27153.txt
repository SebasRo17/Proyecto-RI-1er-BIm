I am using Mathematica 8 to do lengthy asymptotic expansions for use in statistics. In particular I have $\lambda=\beta+\epsilon+\delta+\gamma+O(n^{-5/2})$ where the first term is of order $O(n^{-1/2})$, the second one is $O(n^{-1})$, the third is $O(n^{-3/2})$ an the last one is $O(n^{-2})$ (where n is some asymptotic index). What I want to do is to expand               Series[Log[1 + A*x], {x, 0, 4}]      where $x=\lambda$ and A is of order $O(n^{-1/2})$, and I want Mathematica to be able to automatically retain all the terms up to $O(n^{-2})$. I have tried to expand and to use Simplify by telling the orders of the components in $\lambda$ through Assumptions, but I am not still able to get anywhere. Does anybody knows a way to do this or a good tutorial to learn from? Thank you in advance, Bstr
