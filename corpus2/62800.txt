Follow up to this question So a lot has changed in the smartphone market in the last year (Specifically Androids market share, OS updates and marketplace updates). Given these changes I think it is appropriate to ask this question again. I would love to quit my job and write Android apps fulltime. :-) Is this yet feasible for the average lone developer? What have volumes been like? (Happy to turn this into a community wiki before all the Grinch's start moaning but looks like I don't have the option)
