Consider the following system of equations, with 11 dependent variables:               seq={     f - h (1*^8 r + 200 + 10) - (25. g h)/(g + 244 h) == 0,     (25. g h)/(g + 244 h) - (3.7*^-5 gs)/(4.9*^-5 + gs) == 0,     g == 0.0032 - 2 gs,     rt == 701 r,     oht == 701 oh,     sst == 701 ss,     h r == 2.1*^-3 sst tr,     oht == 3.85*^8 h r,     701 (oh + r + ss) == 5.7*^-4,     sst tr == (0.41*^-6 to)/(1.48*^-6 + to),     to == 6*^-7 - tr     };      I am trying to find the numerical value of the derivative `(dh/df)*(f/h)` around a certain value of `f = 5*^-9`. To do so, I could first find the numerical solution to the equations using `FindRoot` (fairly easy to do), and then replacing the numerical value of variables `g` and `r` in equation > >     f - h (1*^8 r + 200 + 10) - (25. g h)/(g + 244 h) == 0 >   while leaving `h` and `f` unevaluated and then compute the derivative. Yet, because those other variables (`r` and `g`) also change with `f`, I can't compute this just numerically like this. Yet, finding the analytic solution to the equations above is not feasible as the system is too big for mathematica to find such solution (the sample above is just a small part of the real system). So, I was thinking, whether there would be a way for me to compute the derivative at the top numerically. I am probably just complicating things, and most likely there is a rather trivial way of solving this - yet, I am not seeing it. Could you guys help me out please?
