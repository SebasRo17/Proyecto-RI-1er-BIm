We have a bunch of data (several TB) in Hadoop HDFS and it's growing. We want to create a dashboard that reports on the contents in there e.g counts of different types of objects, trends over time etc. Our first thought was to use something like Oracle Tableau or d3.js and to use Hive queries. But Hive is just too darn slow for these "precanned" queries. Now we're thinking of using Hive to extract data regularly from HDFS and store the output in a "more real time" database e.g. HBase or an RDBMS (e.g. MySQL). That'll work but I'm worried we're missing a simpler / easier solution (if there is one) that requires less ETL / extracts and duplicate data storage mechanisms (HDFS + something else)
