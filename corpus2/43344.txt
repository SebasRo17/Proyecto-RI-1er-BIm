I am trying to figure out how to mathematically represent the MMA 9 Spikey in order to send to a 3D printer. According to this page, " _In particular, spikeys for version 2 and up are based on a hyperbolic dodecahedron with embellishments rather than a cumulated icosahedron."_ How might I represent these "embellishments?" An .stl file has been generated (and is here, for all interested) of a rhombic hexecontahedron. This, however, is the farthest I have progressed. Any help would be appreciated.
