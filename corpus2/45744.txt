I'd like to define a function that controls if a certain number is an integer, rational, algebraic and so far. First, I tried generating a list of those numbers:               ZL = {1, 3, Pi, E, Sqrt[2], Zeta[3]}       I then created my functions like so:               TestI[x_] := If[x âˆˆ Integers, x "is Integer", x "is no Integer"]      It works so far. I now tried to define a For-function like this:               For[i = 1, i <= Length[ZL], i++, Print[TestZ[Part[ZL, i]]]]      However, when I evaluate the above expression, the output is like               is integer     3 is integer     ...     is no integer E       How can I achieve an output that says:               1 is Integer     3 is Integer     ...     \e is no Integer      and so on?
