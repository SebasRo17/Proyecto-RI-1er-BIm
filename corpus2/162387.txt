I've read several articles on _SRP_ and _cohesion_ , and they seem to contradict each other as far as _low coupling_ is concerned. Articles on _cohesion_ argue that putting closely related responsibilities together in a class `Highly_Cohesive_Class` reduces coupling, while articles on _SRP_ would argue that we'd reduce coupling by removing these closely related responsibilities from class `Highly_Cohesive_Class` into separate classes ( such that each class only has single responsibility/reason to change ). Don't the two claims contradict each other? Namely, BTW - I'm aware of the fact that class adhering to SRP principle is also considered highly cohesive class, but in this post the term _highly cohesive_ refers to a class that has several closely related responsibilities thank you
