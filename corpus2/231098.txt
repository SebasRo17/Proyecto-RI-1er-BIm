I have tried looking for an answer to this question, but I couldn't find anything related. To put it in a nutshell, I want to fork the existing Komodo Edit project, which is licensed under MPL Version 1.1, and create a new derived project/software. I would like to remove certain features from the current project, including ActiveState's logo, but I do not understand the technical jargon on the license. Also, I plan to keep the derived project completely free and open-source. I'd be really grateful, if someone could explain it to me. Here is the link to the license : https://github.com/Komodo/KomodoEdit/blob/trunk/LICENSE.txt
