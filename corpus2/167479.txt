a) As far as I understand it, in most cases _Domain Model_ **DM** doesn't contain code for creating/deleting _domain entities_ , but instead it is the job of layers ( ie _service layer_ or _UI layer_ ) on top of **DM** to create/delete _domain entities_? b) _Domain entities_ are modelled after _real world entities_. Assuming particular _real world entity_ being abstracted does have the functionality of creating/deleting other _real world entities_ , then I assume the _domain entity_ abstracting this _real world entity_ could also contain logic for creating/deleting other entities?               class RobotDestroyerCreator     {              ...              void heavyThinking()              {                       ...                       if(...)                              unitOfWork.registerDelete(robot);                       ...                            if(...)                       {                              var robotNew = new Robot(...);                               unitOfWork.registerNew(robotNew);                         {                       ...               }     }      Thank you
