I need to implement SSO for four different domains, say               abc.com     pqr.com     sql.com     xyz.com      Now, I have already login system for two of my applications using Membership. But now requirement is changed, challenge is to make Single Sign On.               Me: Can we have subdomains?     client: no !!!          Me: Can we have single database and separate session management server?     client: NO !!!      After that I create a POC in which I am able to share a cookie across the multiple domains but issue is it need to ping and bounce back to all domains on user browser which led the larger login time. Can I have suggestion how to get it done?
