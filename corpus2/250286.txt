I'm really confused by all the open source licensing details like _"I wrote a web application, which should run on a computer not owned by me. My software uses the library/language xxx. Is this considered a software redistribution of xxx?"_. Looking at the first four pieces of used software reveals four different licenses (MIT, BSD, Apache, Apache/Eclipse dual). It looks like all of them require about the same, i.e., list them and link to their license. So I thought I could simplify my life by simply voluntarily listing _all_ the software used. The list is not that long and it'd call it fair. But there are obstacles like copyrighted names, trademarks and such stuff. I've tried to google for an example, but found nothing but the EPSON list (which is for a piece of hardware). Does anyone know an example of software list for a web application? I'm especially curious what's the best solution for Java (run on a computer not owned by me).
