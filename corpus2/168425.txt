I represent a software company that is in process of building a large software development team. We are picky in who we hire and have really good retention rate (most of the devs have been here for an average of 5-6 years). We've been spending a lot of developers' and HR time and have a low applications to hire ratio. Here's the process we use:   * HR Interview on phone - Involves asking basic behaviorial and tech questions   * Online test - Involves a 30 minute technical test   * Technical Phone interview - A 60 minute interview by a developer   * Onsite Interview - A 60-90 minute interview by several senior developers Although this process has been working, we've been spending way too much time on interviews. Any thoughts on how this can be done differently? Our goal is to automate any tasks if possible still retaining the quality of talent. * * * **UPDATE:** Thanks for the responses. Need to clarify a few things. Our aim is to reduce the number of applicants that go from one stage to the other. Here's our current numbers.   1. We receive 1000 resumes   2. 800 resumes pass the HR interview   3. 500 pass the online test   4. 100 pass the initial phone screen   5. 10 pass the onsite and get hired As you can see, we need to do a better job of weeding out the candidates earlier on in the process. Can we do a better job in the way the online test evaluates people? Here are more details on the process based on some responses:   * HR Interview on phone - They ask very basic technical questions (What is a CLR?) to weed out as many people as possible   * Online test - Have around 10 basic questions with 3 coding questions   * Tech phone screen - Covers a variety of technologies. We don't care if the applicant doesn't know everything as long as they can demonstrate they will be able to pick up new technologies and come up to speed quickly   * Onsite - Coding questions in front of the developers. More architectural level questions.
