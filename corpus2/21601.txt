Two of the functions our company provides our customers are:   * Our Development team of ~10 employees creates software products for businesses in a particular industry. The software is used on hundreds of our customers' computers. Although the product is, for most customers, off-the-shell, larger customers drive its development, so it's somewhere between shrinkwrap software and custom software.   * Our Support team of ~25 employees provides technical support for both our own software and a few other software products for which we are the vendor. Our Development team recently switched to Scrum for their development methodology, and while I support this change, I worry that our Support team is going to have more trouble in the future. With a quicker release cycle, our customers will have features and products in production which Support isn't even aware of until the customer calls. We've never been particularly good at getting documentation and information from Development to Support, but I fear Scrum will just exacerbate the problem. What are good references on how companies reconcile Development's desire to release frequently with Support's desire to have full documentation and support information before customers see the product? How should a company structure their release and change management when using agile methods? EDIT: What I'm interested are specifics on how companies structure themselves to deal with these issues. Does the scrum team push releases to customers? Does the software have to go through a release/change management team who will not deploy until Support has been given documentation and brought up to speed? How do you get releases to customers quickly yet still keep everyone informed of changes and new features?
