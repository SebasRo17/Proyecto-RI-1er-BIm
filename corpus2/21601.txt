I've been reading a number of questions and answers on this site that deal with the various capabilities of CDF (computable document format). It seems like sometimes the answer is to make sure to use Enterprise CDF, because only Enterprise CDF supports data import, certain input fields, etc. Another common answer is to use webMathematica. The tone of the answers seems to suggest that webMathematica is much more permissive than CDF. I am wondering what webMathematica can do (what is allowed) that cannot be done with CDF. Why would a person use one vs. the other? **Update** : Regarding FreeCDF, EnterpriseCDF, and Player Pro, this is the most useful break down of what each provides that I have seen so far.
