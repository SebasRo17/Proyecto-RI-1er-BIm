Let's say I have 100 polygons that are all different but most of them overlap. All I want to do is to draw/plot them in one single graphic with **linearly adding** gray values; i.e., a point with `n` overlapping polygons(or other graphics) should have a grayvalue of `n/100`. I wish               Graphics[{Opacity[1/10], Table[Disk[{i/10, 0}], {i, 10}]}]      would work, but `Opacity` doesn't add up linearly, and I don't find any easy way to do what I want. My current idea is to go via `Image[Graphics[...]]`, `ImageData` and `ArrayPlot`, but I might lose a lot of precision that way.
