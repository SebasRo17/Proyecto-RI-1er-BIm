How to display (in any graphic representation) the maximum and minimum temperatures for one city in one of these selected time periods over the 5-day period? The time periods are:   * Morning (06:00 to 12:00)   * Afternoon (12:00 to 16:00)   * Evening (16:00 to 20:00)   * Night (20:00 to 06:00 the next day).  I'd like the x-axis to show the date and the y-axis to show temperatures. I already wrote a small bit of code which can find the mean in a given time interval               Mean[Select[       Flatten[        WeatherData[         "Your_City_Name",          "Temperature", {{2012, 11, 5, 6, 0}, {2012, 11, 5, 12, 0}}]        , 1], NumberQ       ]      ]
