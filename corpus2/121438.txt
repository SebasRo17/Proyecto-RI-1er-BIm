I'm on the way developing an application which requires a kind of dynamic database, So this is what I want, ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0fxbc.png) This is the for reading the details of a class, the number of variables and methods will only be known at run-time, and I have to create a number of classes like this. In the above scenario,how can I design a database (MySql) to store all these datas and retrieve them later?
