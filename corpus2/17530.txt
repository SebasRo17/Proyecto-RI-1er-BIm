The new legending functionality in version 9 is much easier to use than the `PlotLegends` package and other bespoke ways of creating legends in earlier versions. However, the vertical spacing between items is larger than I would like. How can I reduce this spacing? Changing the `LegendMarkerSize` option to a smaller number without changing the size specified in the `LegendMarkers` option just ends up cutting off the graphic. `LegendMargins` doesn't affect the inter-item spacing, only the space between the whole legend and other items.               PointLegend[{RGBColor[1, 0, 0], RGBColor[0, 0, 1]}, {"Series 1", "Series 2"},       LegendMarkers -> {{"\[FilledCircle]", 20}, {"\[FilledCircle]", 20}},       LegendMarkerSize -> 19,       LabelStyle -> {FontFamily -> "Arial", FontSize -> 20}]       ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mWl0m.png)
