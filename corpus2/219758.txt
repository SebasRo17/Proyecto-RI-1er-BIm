I have a client server application. Assume I work as a Support executive, resolving customer tickets. We(our support team) have got two tickets to work on. Ticket 1: Client "Liver" raised a ticket to update his phone number.   Ticket 2: Same Client "Liver" raised a second ticket to update his email ID. I am working on ticket 1: Opened application, clicked edit Customer Info buttton, entered new phone number. I did not save the form(Edit form). In between, I left for CUPPA. My colleague is looking at ticket 2: He has edited the Customer information and updated with new email id: Its persisted in database. When, I come back and save my ticket with phone number update, it would overwrite his changes i.e.., his email ID change is lost or not updated for that Customer "Liver". Is there a way that when a get back to my work/page after CUPPA break, can I see the email ID with updated value? How to prevent this? What is the approach? Possible design ideas? How to ensure that there is no data loss?
