I'm pretty new at using TFS and I'd like to know how you or your team use the "shelve" function of tfs. We have the following guidelines in using TFS: \- perform a "Get Latest" before you check in and try to build/compile \- do not check in code that does not compile \- at the end of the day, if your work is not complete/partially done, you should "shelve" your pending changes The first two make sense but I don't really get the last one. I asked my mgr and he said that its so he knows that you actually did some work for that day, which does kind of makes sense but still, I'm wondering what other teams use the "shelve" function for?
