I just accepted a new job. Our application is in the 50,000 lines of code area. None of which is commented. I am finding it difficult to understand how the application works. Id like to prevent this for the next person that joins the project by getting the team to start to use comments. Forget about if you support comments or consider them code duplication. What are some of the benefits of using comments that I can use as reasons for the team to start using them. What arguments are there in favor of comments (Not looking for opposing arguments). Are there any publications or studies done that show that using comments improves code quality or something like that?
