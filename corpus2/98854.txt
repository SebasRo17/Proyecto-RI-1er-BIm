**In short** I am searching for an alternative to Java applets for making some interactive parts like minigames etc. on my website **Facts:**   I´m developing an e-learning website for children. This site has following main functions:   * practice part where children can do grammar test and receive points for good answers.   * tamagotchi like pet which moves around, has to be fed and so on   * shop in which gotchi stuff can be bought As a framework I'm using Ruby on Rails. At the moment I am using Java applets as a "quick and dirty solution" for nearly everything on the site as I totally freaked out over Flash after some years not using it and learning java in the meanwhile... (yes I also use applets for the practices which are not much more than some textfields an dropboxes in some text..) Now I'm searching for a cleaner solution as applets seam to me to be really slow. I already read some things in the internet but I'm searching for some opinions on my special problem. **My findings until now:**   1. JavaScript seems somehow nice, but many users deactivate it so would it be wise to use it?    2. Flash really drove me crazy, but if anyone can give me some reasons for it I will take it in mind again. Here is what happened when I tried to use it: I learned Flash some years ago and I liked it very much but now I am somehow lost as it seems to me to be not really good programming and I always mix it up with Java commands and I was missing code completion and this stuff. My main problem when I totally dropped the idea of Flash was that I wanted to read the practices out of some xml file or maybe a database (having in mind creating some programm in which teachers can produce their own practices in some later version) and it seemed somehow near to unsolveable to create some individual buttons in some sort of loop out of this extern data. also the community seemed to be more designer like than programmer like and wasn´t too helpfull on my questions (100 times yes I know I can drag it from the library but thats not at runtime possible)   3. Java applets are pretty slow I don't think I should use them in next versions I welcome all hints and ideas how to solve my task.
