This is a web project written in Java. So, I'm writing the build and the deploy scripts. To create the build, I used ant. The continuous build is done with Jenkins. The build generates 3 different artifacts:   1. The war file   2. A zip with layouts   3. A zip with images So far, so good, but now I need to write the deploy script, which should:   * Deploy the war (artifact 1) to the tomcat running at _server 1_   * Place the artifact **2** at _server 1_ in a specific directory   * Place the artifact **3** at _server 2_ in a specific directory So I was talking with my colleague and he said that we should also generate an artifact (maybe _deploy.xml_ ) that deploys these artifacts when placed at the correct server. So there would be another script, that would:   * Download the jenkins artifacts   * scp to each server and place the deploy.xml there   * remotely invoke the deploy.xml What makes me a little uncomfortable is the act of having the deploy.xml as a build artifact. The motivation behind this would be to be able to make a deploy without needing to have access to the VCS repositories, so a build would be self-contained, ie, any build could go into production only with what was generated by Jenkins. Where should the deploy scripts be placed? Should they be **only** at the VCS or should they be build artifacts too?
