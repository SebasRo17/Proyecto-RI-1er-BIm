I am playing around with the `Manipulate` sentence. I think the following code is right, and actually Mathematica 9.0 doesn't return any error message, but I am observing something strange:   * when I execute the `Manipulate` sentence, the fan of my laptop starts _overworking_ (I do not know if this expression is right) making lot of noise, which usually means that there is a heavy process running, and if I delete the result of the code, the fan returns to its normal state; and   * the vertical line at the right of the result of the code is highlighted in black and slightly _twinkling_. This is the code:               Manipulate[f[x_] := Sin[x]; {Plot[f[x], {x, 0, a}], f[a]}, {a, 1, 50}]      And this is the image of what I get, where you can see the black vertical line: ![Manipulate causing computer strange behaviour](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3QfQX.png) So, my question is: do you get the same computer behaviour, or is it just me? And, is there something wrong with this piece of code?
