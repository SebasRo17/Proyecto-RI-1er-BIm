How would you organise a backlog item that is planned to change in future releases? I've got a requirement that states that: In release 1 users can open content from local machines. In future releases users can open content from remote servers, FTP and web streams. Is it typical to just create 2 backlog items to describe that requirement. Then just assign the enhancement to a future release? (Using TFS for any contextual answers)
