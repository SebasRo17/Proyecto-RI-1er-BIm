I have the following program at home, which draws on a batch of pre-processed files (that are word frequency text files, compiled using `ToLowerCase`, `Tally` and `Sort`. Here is an example of the file that it draws on: `{{"i", 3073}, {"you", 2860}, {"the", 1741}, {"and", 1518}, {"a", 1218}, {"me", 1209}, {"to", 1153}, {"my", 913}, {"t", 855}, {"that", 843}...` and so on. Each file is about ~ 50KB, and it's been generated using `Put` and is thus grabbed using `Get`. I use them for the following program, which essentially plots word frequency for a given year (each year has its own file). It's along a similar lines as the Google ngram viewer, but on a very specific historical dataset.               Manipulate[viewerCount1 = {};      viewerCount2 = {};      SetDirectory["/users/myNAME/desktop/DB/Put/"];      filenames = FileNames["*.txt"];      Do[       input = Get[file];       yearLength = Length[input];       AppendTo[viewerCount1,         If[Length[Flatten[Cases[input, {word1, _}]]] == 0, 0,           Flatten[Cases[input, {word1, _}]][[2]]]/yearLength];       AppendTo[viewerCount2,         If[Length[Flatten[Cases[input, {word2, _}]]] == 0, 0,           Flatten[Cases[input, {word2, _}]][[2]]]/yearLength];       , {file, filenames}];      DateListPlot[{Tooltip[viewerCount1, word1],         Tooltip[viewerCount2, word2]}, {1964}, Joined -> True,        PlotLabel -> "Number of Total Word Appearances by % of All Words",        PlotStyle -> {{Red}, {Blue}}], {{word1, "war",         "First Word (Red)"}}, {{word2, "peace", "Second Word (Blue)"}}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/LDvKW.png) Here's the crux of the question, however. **Is there a good way to deploy this online so other people can access it?** I assume this is too big for the CDF format? Alternatively, _WebMathematica_ sounds promising, but before I upgrade my _Mathematica_ purchase I would love to hear if the community thinks that would be useful. I know that there have been discussions elsewhere about sharing dynamic content with non-Mathematica users, but these seem to not rely on specific external files. Or, am I using the wrong language to deploy the final version of this?
