...or are things getting more complicated? It seems to me that you need to know a lot of stuff to 'properly' develop an MS web app these days. In the bad old days when we didn't know any better we had database tables, ASP.NET, ADO.NET and you constructed a web app using relatively simple concepts. These days there seems to be a lot of framework around to 'help' you do it 'right', but I'm not convinced this makes it all easier and better. I've got a feeling I'll be in a pretty small minority with this sentiment, but is there anyone else out there who thinks that things have gone a bit mad?
