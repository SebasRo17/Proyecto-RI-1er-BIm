Is it perhaps time for enterprise systems to be developed to strict enforced standards? Many books list optional 'standards' and best practices, but these are purely suggested practices. Still, every time I look at the code for an enterprise system I have not been a part of, I spend a lot of time trying to work out the architecture. Should we not have some form of ISO accreditation for our systems? We could have a selection of standard architectures such as Domain Model, Transaction Script etc, but once we choose one of these, we have to follow a strict architectural template. Systems could be audited to ensure we are working to these standards, and our companies would carry this accreditation. This would be better for developers because when we take on legacy work that was written by another company, we will not have to spend time deciphering the architecture. It would benefit clients because they would know that if they used the services of an accredited development company, they could used another company to maintain/amend it, and not be tied to the original developers.
