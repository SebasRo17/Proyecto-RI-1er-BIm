I'm trying to write a program in c for Huffman coding, but I am stuck. For input I have:               Sample input:     4      // here I scan how many letters I have     A 00   // and for everyone I scan how they are coded in string down     B 10          C 01     D 11     001010010101001011010101010110011000 //this is a suboptimal huffman code      So first I have to decode this string, and to find out how many times every letter appear. And I already do that. But now I have to find out how many bits have every letter using huffman tree, and in the output I have to print the average bit per symbol. The output for this example here have to be:               Sample output     1.722      So now, how to find out how many bits have every letter with huffman coding?
