As a complete newbie, I am curious as to what I should undertake after finishing _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_ (along with the MIT course). I am primarily interested in building desktop applications, and secondarily interested in web development. How do I grasp the essence of desktop programming? And web? Are there any particular books or courses that survey the various areas of programming and the tools I need to build something solid?
