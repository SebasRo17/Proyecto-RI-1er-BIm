What knowledge does it take to develop an Android app? How easy is it to publish one in the app market? I was thinking of trying one once I have a more firm grasp on Java. What skills should I focus on to meet that goal? Is it a long-shot to think I could develop an app like a photo editor (which I already can in Java) in the near future with intermediate Java experience, or are apps more for small teams or commercial software firms? This question serves as a personal to-do list on what to learn. I would like to develop an Android app in the near future from which I could make money.
