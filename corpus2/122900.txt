It's not a secret to anyone that managers can and often will impose the programming language that will be used for a project. Being a programmer myself, I have never been able to understand this. But now I think I do: I've just had a revelation when Joel Spolsky said on the podcast that they should use QuickBooks because "every accountant in the world knows it". This struck me as being very similar to "chose Java because every programmer in the world knows it". Now that I've seen the same issue from another perspective,I don't know much about accounting, but I do know something about programming, I'm wondering how a programmer can help make sure the right programming language is chosen for a project?
