I'm no computer scientist so please bear with me. Lately I wrote a python program that has to perform some expensive spatial searches while holding lot's of data in memory. I tried to improve the performance, that is tried different approaches (see my question here for example). First, and maybe not so surprisingly, I found great performance differences when running the same code on two different machines (up to 6 x faster on one machine). Then however and very much to my own surprise, running the exactly same code on the same machine on two different days showed great performance differences. To give you a rough idea what I mean by great. Machine 1, day 1: 11 minutes Machine 1, day 2: 2 minutes There was no reboot in the meantime by the way. So my question really is: what could be possible reasons for this difference? How can I can I make sure my system is ready for high performance when I start running my program?
