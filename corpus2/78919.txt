I am a PHP 'developer' who codes for fun. My problem is I have never completed my large projects. Please I would like to know how experienced programmers like you are able to complete projects single-handedly. My problem is I tend to allow frustration get me. I think this is because I do all of the coding and the graphics alone and this is really challenging for me coming from a country where electricity is epileptic(In Nigeria - You would have to do things quickly, because power will be cut short after certain times that are sometimes unpredictable). So a very picky person like me finds it hard to immediately make design(graphics) decisions. What am asking from you is a formula that works for you. A formula that gets the work done. Right now, I am thinking of a formula that involves the coding of a 'dirty' prototype of my idea. Then, when am done, I'll just focus on the graphics aspect. Is this really a good idea? Please I need your advice because I may never get to complete any project of my own. Note: I have no problem coding with PHP. Thanks
