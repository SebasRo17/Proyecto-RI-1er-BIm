I'm writing a class that draws a very complex image, with multiple parts. I also plan on adding to the class to add more functionality. Would it be right to make a function for each part, even if that function will only EVER be called in the render function? I see an upside to this since it will be easier to read the code, and easier to add parts. A downside however, would be that it would increase complexity and quite possibly make it harder to maintain. Should I keep all the code in the render function, or break apart the different steps?
