Java's checked exceptions have gotten some bad press over the years. A telling sign is that it's literally the only language in the world that has them (not even other JVM languages like Groovy and Scala). Prominent Java libraries like Spring and Hibernate also don't use them. I personally have found one use for them (in business logic between layers), but otherwise I'm pretty anti-checked exceptions. Are there any other uses that I don't realize?
