How do I `InstallR` on OS X to use my already installed and configured R? Simply using               InstallR["RHomeLocation" -> "/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources"]      results in               $Failed     InstallR::nopaclet: Could not find RLink runtime installed. Please use RLinkResourcesInstall to install it      How do I connect _Mathematica_ to my installed R? Do I have to install a separate R for _Mathematica_?
