I try to construct patterns using Riffle and Except               StringExpression@Riffle[{"a", "b", "c"}, Except[{"=", ","}] ..]      and expect it to match "a_b_c", but not "a_bc" because Except is repeated .. one or more times. However,               StringMatchQ["a_bc", StringExpression@Riffle[{"a", "b", "c"}, Except[{"=", ","}] ..]]      returns True. Could anyone explain why is it so?
