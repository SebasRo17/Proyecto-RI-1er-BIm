Graphics3D[       Table[         GeometricTransformation[           Cuboid[{1, 0, 0}, {.01, .2, .1}],            {RotationMatrix[a, {0, 0, .05}], {.001 Cos[a], .001 Sin[a], a}}],          {a, -Pi, 2 Pi, .2}],        Boxed -> False]      I followed this Documentation Center page about rotating cuboids along a space curve to make the above code (which creates the stairs for spiral staircase). I don't want to just follow it, though, I would like to understand everything I am typing in. After researching the primitives, I know that `Cuboid[{a,b,c},{d,e,f}]` creates a cuboid with corner `{a, b, c}` and opposing corner `{d, e, f}`. But other than that, I'm not all sure what else is going on. I can _guess_ at what is going on, but that does not make me feel confident in my Mathematica usage. Specific questions:   * What does `Table` do? When reading about it, I cannot make sense of why I need it in my code.   * `Graphics3D` creates a 3D image based upon the primitives and directives entered. Is this correct? What else should I know about this?   * To make sure I understand primitives and directives clearly: `Table` is a primitive for `Graphics3D`. `GeometricTransformation` is a primitive for `Table`. `Cuboid` and `RotationMatrix` are primitives for `GeometricTransformation`. `Boxed` is a directive for `Graphics3D`. And things like `{a, b, c}` are parameters for equations or primitives. Is this correct? Sorry, this may read like a riddle.   * Final questions: What exactly does `GeometricTransformation` do? Is it basically saying "I'd like to rotate something (a cuboid) about an axis and in the shape of a helix?" Where are the vectors/matrices coming to play in this? This is where I read about it, but it does not help me much in understanding what I am doing.
