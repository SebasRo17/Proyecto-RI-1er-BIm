It's not entirely uncommon in IT that programmers are added to an existing project somewhere in the middle, or closer to finish. Unfortunately, I've seen that people quickly get disillusioned and leave the job. So, is there an actual problem? If there is a problem, is there some research in or are there best practices for avoiding this mid-project-join syndrome? Is this common in industry?
