I am trying to export a slideshow presentation that I have created in Mathematica 8 to PDF in case I have trouble connecting my laptop to a projector for a talk I am giving. I have tried Save As, Save Selection As and Print to File after setting the print setting to landscape. The latter produces the enormous file even though I am rasterizing the plots, and the former save my file normally but in portrait and also lose the `Scaled` option of plots. Does anyone have a good workflow for this or know a good reference?
