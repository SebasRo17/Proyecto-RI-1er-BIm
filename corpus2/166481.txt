I have an interview coming up soon for a Business Analyst position and the recruiter mentioned some feedback from a prior candidate that was interviewed who said the interviewers asked him what the difference between a Windows and Linux development environment was. Are there some high level things I need to be aware of from a business point of view when working with a development team or designing an application on Windows vs Linux?
