I'm a real estate professional and part of my job is to scan a database day in and day out searching for properties for a prospective investor buyer to purchase. I am pretty sure a program can be made that will scan this database for me, and alert me when one pops up that I should look at. I make the decision on what they buy based on a few pieces of data. Things like square footage, beds baths etc. Basically what I do is compare a prospective distressed property to properties that match criteria to determine how close they are, and then come up with a likely after repair value based on the other sold nearby houses. I theorize that my program should be able to scan the DB, gather all new properties added. Take each property. determine which other sold properties are most comparable and come up with a likely after ARV. Then compare that ARV to the list price, if it is within a certain range, alert me. So far I've gone and confirmed that I can get a feed for this data. I think it will be in xml but won't know the structure of the data until i apply for a feed license. My problem is I have no idea where to start on this. I've been tinkering around with little website building and very basic html and php for about 10 years but never really became a master of it. Is this too much for a newb to build? should I pay? or suck it up and learn?
