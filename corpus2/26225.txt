I am quite puzzled to solve the coupled ode's numerically. Please tell me why it runs for a long time and not giving any output in mathematica. I am using NDsolve. please have a look               NDSolve[{ x'[t] == x[t]/y[t] + x[t]/z[t] - x[t]/z[t]^2,                y'[t] == 1 + y[t]/z[t] - (2 y[t])/z[t]^2,                z'[t] == -z[t] - z[t]/y[t] - (2 z[t])/y[t]^2,               x[0] == 2,               y[0] == 5,                z[0] == 7},             {x, y, z},             {t, -10, 10},             MaxSteps -> Infinity]
