So, we are starting a new project soon, and there are a lot of decisions that must be made. The one I am most interested in is: **What all do you have to take into consideration when deciding what technologies to use?** There is always something that you miss and only half-way through the project do you realise, _"O yeah... I should have thought about that..."_ , and usually it's something that would have made you go with a different technology. I would like to hear what you guys think. Maybe get a nice comprehensive list up to help the architects everywhere to make more informed decisions.
