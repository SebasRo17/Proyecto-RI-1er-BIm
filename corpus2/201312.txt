I am working on a project , a mobile hybrid application , that combines native code , html5 - jquery mobile (for the frond end) and php - mysql (for the back end). The server side , is responsible for things like registering new users to a database , updating users , subscribing users to events etc. Basically is simple php code with mysql queries. Lately i started to read a lot about php frameworks. I started to wonder when is really time to use any and basically why? From my understanding the framework only helps in the back end of a service and usually all the back end i ve build till now is described roughly above. In general i am interested a lot on building mobile services which include both back end and frond end development. By learning/using a framework do i earn something special in my case? I dont understand how my 100line php scripts could get any easier if they were written with a framework. Yes i ve read a 100 times that is better to use something tested and bug free than use your own things but i dont understand what exactly they are talking about. What could go wrong by quering a database and fetching/saving/editing data that a framework would solve it? What i am asking here is maybe for some examples when a php framework should be preferred.
