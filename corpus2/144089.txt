We (and the JS SO chat room) had a talk with @rlemon some days ago about his Little-XHR library about error handling. Basically, we wanted to decide which error handling pattern should be used:               xhr.get({         // Some parameters, and then         success: function(data) {},         failure: function(data) {}     })      Or:               xhr.get({         // Some parameters, and then         callback: function(err, data) {}     })      One is more jQuery-like, while the other is more Node-like. Some say that the first pattern makes you think more about handling error. I think the opposite, since you may forget the other callback function, while the argument is always there on the second pattern. Any opinion/advantage/drawback about both these patterns?
