I was asked this question in an interview and it has been bugging me ever since. > You have two projects, both with the same specification but only one of > these projects was developed using Test Driven Development. You are given > the source for both but with the tests removed from the TDD project. How can > you tell which was developed using TDD? All I was able to muster up was something about the classes being more “broken up” into smaller chunks and having more visible APIs, not my proudest moment. I would be very interested to hear a _good_ answer to this question.
