I encountered an unexpected behaviour in my mathematica-code, and want to understand whether that's a mathematica bug, or a misinterpretation on my side.               MainVar = 1;     Carrier = "MainVar";     f[] := (       Module[{MainVar},          MainVar = 3;         Print[MainVar];         Print[Carrier];         Print[ToExpression[Carrier]]     ])     f[] (* 3, MainVar, 1 *)      I would have expected that `Print[ToExpression[Carrier]]` gives me `3`, because `Carrier` points to `MainVar`, which has the value `3`. When I use `MainVar` as global variable (as Eldo suggested below), I get the expected `3`. So my question is: > Why does `ToExpression[Carrier]` give me `1` when I use `MainVar` as a local > variable, even if both `MainVar` and `Carrier` have the correct values?
