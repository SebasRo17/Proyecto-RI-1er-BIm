I heard that my co-worker want to get ISTQB certification. But I heard it first time. So it's hard to trust it. In fact I can't understanding the concept of qualification for testing software.   1. What is the organization. What's the value of the certification?   2. How do you think about it? Is it trustable publicly?   3. How many company recognize the certification?
