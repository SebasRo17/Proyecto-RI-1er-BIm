I am trying to solve these equations                   Assuming[{x1 âˆˆ Reals && x1 > 0 && x1 < 1},       Solve[{(a3 - r2)^2 + (b3 + r2 - 1)^2 ==          r2^2, (a6 - r2)^2 + (b6 + r2 - 1)^2 == r2^2,         b5 == k1*(a5 - 1) + 1, b3 == k1*(a3 - 1) + 1,         b2 == k1*(a2 - 1) + 1, b6 == k2*(a6 - a1) + b1,         b4 == k2*(a4 - a1) + b1, (a2 - 1/2)^2 + (b2)^2 ==          1/4, (a1 - 1/2)^2 + (b1)^2 == 1/4, (a4 - x1)^2 + (b4 - y1)^2 ==          r1^2, x1 + r1 == 1, (a5 - x1)^2 + (b5 - y1)^2 ==          r1^2, (y1 - b4)*k2 == -(x1 - a4), (b1)*k2 == -(a1 - 1/2), (b2)*          k1 == -(a2 - 1/2), (1 - r2 - b3)*k1 == -(r2 - a3), (1 - r2 - b6)*          k2 == -(r2 - a6), (b5 - y1)*k1 == -(a5 - x1)}, {x1, y1, r1, r2,         k1, k2, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6}]]      And it does output a valid solution > >     x1 -> 5/6, y1 -> 2/3, r1 -> 1/6, r2 -> 1/4, k1 -> 3/4, k2 -> -(4/3), >     a1 -> 9/10, a2 -> 1/5, a3 -> 2/5, a4 -> 7/10, a5 -> 11/15, a6 -> 9/20, >     b1 -> 3/10, b2 -> 2/5, b3 -> 11/20, b4 -> 17/30, b5 -> 4/5, b6 -> 9/10 >   But it also outputs a bunch of other invalid/undesired "solutions". I was trying to limit the output by using `Assuming`, apparently it does not work though. Also, the console outputs > >     Solve::svars: Equations may not give solutions for all "solve" > variables. >   However, I clearly gave 18 variables with 18 equations. Why so?
