OK guys, here's the thing, Mathematica **does not return a solution** for this system of differential equations:               DSolve[{p11'[t] == 2*p12[t] - (1/r)*p12[t]^2,      p12'[t] ==      p22[t] - (w^2)*p11[t] - 2*z*w*p12[t] - (1/r)*p12[t]*p22[t],      p22'[t] == -2*(w^2)*p12[t] -      4*z*w*p22[t] - (1/r)*p22[t]^2 + (w^4)*q, p11[0] == 0, p12[0] == 0,     p22[0] == 0}, {p11[t], p12[t], p22[t]}, t]      Where `z,w,r,q` are parameters. Can anyone please try it on your system and tell me if you have the same problem? I also tried with the `NDSolve` function               NDSolve[{p11'[t] == 2*p12[t] - (1/r)*p12[t]^2,      p12'[t] ==      p22[t] - (w^2)*p11[t] - 2*z*w*p12[t] - (1/r)*p12[t]*p22[t],      p22'[t] == -2*(w^2)*p12[t] -      4*z*w*p22[t] - (1/r)*p22[t]^2 + (w^4)*q, p11[0] == 0, p12[0] == 0,     p22[0] == 0}, {p11[t], p12[t], p22[t]}, {t, 0, 10}]      but I get the error `message:NDSolve::ndnum: Encountered non-numerical value for a derivative at t == 0.` I greatly appreciate your help (I use mathematica 8.0 and of course `VariationalMethods` is turned on)
