When a list of functions is passed to `Plot` in an unevaluated form (e.g. with `Through`), the result is a plot with single color.               Plot[Through[{Sin, Cos, Tan}[t]], {t, 0.01, 10.5}, PlotStyle -> {Red, Blue, Green}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FR11H.png) However, the same list of functions, listed explicitly, gives color as expected.               Plot[{Sin[t], Cos[t], Tan[t]}, {t, 0.01, 10.5}, PlotStyle -> {Red, Blue, Green}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/96IGD.png)
