I am aware of several tools/services that provide DVCS browsing and management such as Bitbucket, Github, Kiln, SCM-Manager and Rhodecode. However, the use case I am considering is one such that:   1. Any source code must reside on an employers internal servers.   2. The solution must be open source.   3. It should provide a Bitbucket or Github like experience, including a project wiki, repository browsing and management, and social coding aspects such as code review.   4. The solution should have mercurial support (if not support for other DVCSs). Of these, only SCM-Manager and RhodeCode come close as they can be installed on your own servers and are open source. However they do not have the Bitbucket or Github experience. There is no issue tracker or wiki and the UI, while functional, is not up to par with Github or Bitbucket. I can get close with Trac or Redmine with their repository browsers but unfortunately they do not have any repository management capabilities. Are there other open source tools out there that would provide a similar experience to Bitbucket, Github or Kiln?
