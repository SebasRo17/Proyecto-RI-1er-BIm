Anyone knows a solution that works something like this:               #include <stdio.h>     #include <gcc.h> /* This .h is what I'm looking for. */          int main (void) {         /* variables declaration (...) */              /* The following line is supposed to be equivalent to:          *     $ gcc main.c -o main */         results = gcc_compile_and_link("main.c", "main");              /* Now I want to use the warnings and errors to do something.          * For instance, I'll print them to the console: */         printf("warnings:\n");         for (i=0; i<results.warns_len; i++)             printf("%s\n", results.warings[i].msg);         printf("errors\n");         for (i=0; i<results.errs_len; i++)             printf("%s\n", results.errors[i].msg);              /* free memory and finalize (...) */         return 0;     }      I know I can run the command "gcc main.c -o main" in a fork and parse the output... but I was looking for something more ' _reliable_ ' like the example above.
