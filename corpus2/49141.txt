I read Pro ASP .NET MVC 2 Framework to try and learn the ASP .NET MVC Framework, but I'm really struggling with Ajax in MVC even after going over that chapter again and again. I seem to have a decent grasp on MVC 2 without Ajax. I used the Ajax controls from ASP .NET (non-MVC) and am used to user controls in update panels. I have somewhat complicated objects with nested sets of objects on my website, and trying to update them from the client side and keep their nested array indexes ordered is killing my brain. Having little familiarity with web scripting in general and Javascript / jQuery / JSON in specific isn't helping. Is there anything else I could read that might help me get a better grasp of Ajax in MVC? Is Ajax poorly supported in MVC 2, or am I just struggling because I have huge holes in my understanding of the web due to the WebForms- ish style of the old ASP .NET? Hoping for the latter . . . my own ignorance can be fixed.
