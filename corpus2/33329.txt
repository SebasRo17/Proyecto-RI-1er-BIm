Is there a way that I can have Mathematica give me the solution of a problem it has solved in terms of functions that I have predefined? The specific problem I'm trying to solve is:               s = alp^2 (E0*mu1 + N01);     k = 1 - E^(-Pmax/s^2) + Sqrt[Ï€*Pmax]/(2*s)*Erfc[Sqrt[Pmax]/s];          E1 = s^2 (1 - E^(-Pmax/s^2));          epsd = E1 - (s*k)^2;          A = 1 + epsd/((k*alp)^2 N01);          c = E1/(N01*(k*alp)^2);          SIG1 = (E0*mu1)/N01; SIG2 = (E1*mu2)/N02;          D[1 - 2 E^(-((A SNRth)/SIG1)) Sqrt[(c SNRth)/(SIG1 SIG2)]          BesselK[1, 2 Sqrt[(c SNRth)/(SIG1 SIG2)]], {alp}]      The solution given by _Mathematica_ is extremely lengthy. However, by observation it can be seen that many of the functions that I have defined above the differentiation operator are contained within the solution.
