This question follows on from my earlier one, Seeking strategies to deploy a function securely without a front end. As it pursues a different track to solve the same problem it seemed distinct enough and perhaps interesting enough to others to merit its own question. I need to deploy a single function into a Windows based technology environment so that the users can call the function from some of their process workflows. The users don't need a front end or user interface of any kind. In fact a front end would cause problems. I have some additional code security concerns, but approaches to that have begun to emerge (see the earlier question referenced above). Running without a front end would also keep code from prying eyes. **Question:** Can one launch a Player Pro kernel independently of the front end via something like a Mathematica Script to run the contents of the computable document without displaying the document itself? References or examples of how to do this appreciated.
