This is my code so far:               k = Import["all.txt.", "Table"]          Cases[k, {name_, G_, H_, S_, Cp_, V_, a1a_, a2b_, a3c_,a4d_, c1e_, c2f_, omegalan_, cT_}           /; name == "compoundname" -> {Cp, G, S}]      (The contents of `all.txt` can be found here.) This imports a table of 2000 different compounds, each having 12 different numerical values. Right now when I alter `"compoundname"` to for instance `"water"` the values I desire (here `Cp`, `G` and `S`) will appear for water. I am trying to alter this to make it so I can type the desired name into a simple function instead by attempting something like this:               HKFparameters[compoundname_] :=        Cases[k, {name_, G_, H_, S_, Cp_, V_, a1a_, a2b_, a3c_, a4d_, c1e_, c2f_, omegalan_, cT_} /;              name == "compoundname" -> {Cp, G, S}]      I have tried modifying this line in multiple ways but I cannot figure out how to do it.
