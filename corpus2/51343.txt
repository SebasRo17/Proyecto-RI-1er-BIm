Looking at the demographics of sites like this one, there seems to be a very heavy US weighing of users. I know there have been discussions about using English as a programmer, but the are some large countries with large programmer bases that must be using localized sites. Countries like Brazil and China, in particular, what sites do programmers go for discussions? Do a lot of the threads link up to English speaking sites like these? In France they obviously prefer their own language, what do the equivalent sites look like? I don't want to turn this into an English language speaking discussion like this one, it's more a general trans-cultural programming curiosity.
