Say I've got two 1-dimensional lists               A = {1,2,3}     B = {a,b,c}      How do I   1. create a list of all pairs from list `A` such that the result looks like `{{1,2},{1,3},{2,3}}`?   2. create a list of all pairs from lists `A` and `B` such that the result looks like `{{1,a},{1,b},{1,c},{2,a},{2,b},{2,c},{3,a},{3,b},{3,c}}`? I would also need both options, one with no duplicates as above and one with duplicates, e.g. one where the result from case 1 also includes `{{2,1},{3,1},{3,2}}`.
