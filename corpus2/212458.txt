I'm a Java programmer, but I want to program in Jython. I've never coded in Python before, but have been looking through some tutorials and I'm fairly confident I can grasp it. My question is clarity over Jython. I understand with Jython you have the joys of writing Python code with the added bonus of accessing Java libraries. Does this mean, all aspects and coding practices of Python can be applied, such as creating animation, input out structures, or is there a whole new structure which needs to be learned to code Jython?
