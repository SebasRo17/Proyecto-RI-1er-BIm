Just wondered what are the features of the three main programming languages which show you are an 'expert'? Please exclude 'practical' skills such as indenting. Am I right in saying for C++ the most difficult aspect to master is STL/generics? Java seems much easier as memory is handled for you. I'm not entirely sure on C# either? I'm trying to use this to guage my current level of ability and what i wish to aim for. ps this was posted on stackoverflow but got binned due to arguing, please do try to keep it civil as I am really interested in the answers from everyone :)
