There are a couple of apps on the App Store that use external map sources, for various reasons, to display map data. Some even have multiple sources for bike traffic and so on. However some of them are quite cumbersome to use, when panning and zooming they have a jerky motion while they keep loading and they are not as fluid as Apple's Maps app. However I did encounter some that are quite fluid and they app seem to wrap the actual "map" in a 3D sphere object that goes flat as you zoom in closer and closer. **How is this behavior achieved? Does apple provide a special class to get this kind of interaction?** I've also seen a similar solution in a Mac App Store app called Planito, the motion is very fluid and they can even display Bing Maps that way.
