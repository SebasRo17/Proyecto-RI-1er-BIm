Recently (I believe some weeks ago) with the latest update of the Twitter app for iOS, all links found inside tweets are opened in Twitter's build-in browser. My question is how to find Twitter's browser agent so I can display custom messages. For example: If browser is Twitter's in-app browser then display a custom message via HTML+PHP. It seems that there is no known agent available. Any help would be appreciate.
