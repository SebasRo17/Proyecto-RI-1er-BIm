How might I force the following Graphics element to expand to contain the Inset text? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zcUSK.png)               Graphics[{White, Rectangle[{0., 0.0}, {1, 1}],       Yellow, Rectangle[{0., 0.0}, {.2, 1}],       Black,       Inset[        Style[ToString[Unevaluated@abcdefghijklmnopqr],         FontSize -> Scaled[.4]]        , ImageScaled[{0.2753623188405797,                0.48550724637681175}], {Left, Center}]       },  ImagePadding -> 0, PlotRangePadding -> 0,      PlotRangeClipping -> True]      The following gives the desired output although it doesn't solve the issue because ultimately I am trying to nest the text inside another Graphics element: `Row[{Graphics[{}, ImageSize -> {10, 23}, Background -> Yellow],Text["abcedefghijklmnopqr"]}]`. Ultimately I have several nested Insets but unfortunately I can't seem to force the Insets to nest inside of each other and therefore show entirely on the screen. These plot range questions seems to be related. The first question titled "How to determine PlotRange to include all Graphics" is likely a duplicate, although I believe you must ImageSize and PlotRange to get correct values.
