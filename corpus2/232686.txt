I work for a university Digital Services team. Our university's main website uses the Ektron CMS (I have my own thoughts about this, but that's irrelevant). Because we maintain a university website, we need to make sure our website is extremely backwards compatible. We are trying to make a decision as to whether Twitter Bootstrap is conducive to what we're trying to do. Upon review, I've found that Bootstrap uses the CSS preprocessor "*Less Css*". We're currently using *SASS*, which we compile via terminal using Ruby Compass. The downside I'm wondering about while using *Less Css* would be that it compiles using Rhino and Node.js. Would this create issues because   1. Less CSS uses Node.js to compile; if someone does not have js enabled in their browser, will it not display the CSS?    2. the CSS has to compile each time a page is rendered, will it slow down a pages load time? What is most appealing to use is the grid system/glyphs/ and js plugins that comes with Bootstrap, which is good because we often have to create new content for events and other things happening in the university. However, it's extremely hard for us to give up cross compatibility. What are benefits of Bootstrap?   What are draw backs of Bootstrap?
