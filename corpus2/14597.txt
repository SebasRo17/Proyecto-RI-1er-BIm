I have a function that takes a numeric argument and returns a list of numbers. I want to plot each element of the list in a different color. If I use this command,               Plot[f[x],{x,-1,1}]      all the elements are plotted in the same color. The function takes only a numeric argument (its definition is `f[x_?NumericQ]:=...`) so I can't use `Evaluate` like in this question. So far I've been using this command:               Plot[{f[x][[1]],f[x][[2]],f[x][[3]],f[x][[4]]},{x,-1,1}]      Which works fine (since the function evaluates very fast, I don't mind there are redundant evaluations here, see this question). However this is not very elegant, and considering I have 16 elements to plot, it gets downright ugly. **Is there a more elegant way to plot each element in a different color?**
