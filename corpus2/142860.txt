Say a company wants to keep development of new features of a piece of software internal, but wants to make the source code for previous versions public, up to and including existing public features, so that other people can benefit from using and modifying the software themselves, and even possibly contribute changes that can be applied to the development branch. Is there a term for this sort of arrangement, and what is the best way of accomplishing it using existing version control tools and platforms?
