Is there any reason the PHP language could not be updated in a future version to make the $ prefix on variable names optional? Reasons that would break existing code? I'm thinking it would still be required for string interpolation, like "Hello $name", but most of the time it would be optional. For example,               $name = 'Bob';     echo "Hello $name";      would still be valid, but so would               name = 'Bob';     echo "Hello $name";
