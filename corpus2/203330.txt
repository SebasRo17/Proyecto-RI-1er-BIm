For testing, I am planning to run a continuous integration testing. There are mainly two options: hosted, or own desktop/server. I will break it into 3 options I have:   1. Hosted:     * Economical, $10-20/month for a small app     * Less setup, the CI company manage all hardware and software   2. Desktop:     * I could just buy a simple, cheap desktop as a test server (about $500).   3. Used server:     * My current office is offloading some old Dell rack server (Probably dual core Xeon, which I can purchase for $50 or less Please advise me which best serves me for a small team of 2-3 developers. Thanks.
