I have functions of `x`, where `x` is the polar angle of spherical coordinates, i.e. `0 < x < Pi`. Some of the functions are of even symmetry about the equator `x = Pi/2` (such as `Sin[x]`), and other functions are of odd symmetry about `x = Pi/2` (such as `Sin[x]Cos[x]` ) (Just `Plot` them to see.) Can one use Mathematica to eliminate odd functions from a sum of even and odd functions? For example, as a test, can one eliminate the odd function from the sum `Sin[x] + Sin[x]Cos[x]`?
