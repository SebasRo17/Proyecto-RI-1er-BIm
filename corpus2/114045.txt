My company is reevaluating what kind of web framework we want to use. We are currently using the Ext 4.0 framework but there are questions being raised that it may not be the right framework to use. I like what Ext has to offer (rich GUIs, data package and class system) are there other frameworks out there that are similar? Are there frameworks out there tailored to medium/large software companies? Info: Potentially 100's of developers converting thick client screens to the web. Data modeling is important and well as rich GUI support. Maintainability and uniformity across multiple products important as well. Any info is greatly appreciated.
