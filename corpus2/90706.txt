I am currently using TortoiseHg on windows. I want my server to be available automatically as it is switched on. But I need to do these:   1. when I set up a new project, I need to enter the localdir=URL pairs under the [web] each time I set up a project.   2. I need to run the hg serve or the Tortoise frontend each time to get it 'up'. I saw many tutorials for setting up Apache as the server. I want something that can be deployed faster. I also saw some web frontends of questionable stability. Is there **mature and easy-to-use software** with push and pull capability, which serves all repos in a given folder? Something that starts/stops without user intervention and can be **easily set up**? Or should I stick with setting up Apache to do it?
