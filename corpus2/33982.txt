I would like to make a button that opens a notebook upon pressing. The point is that I would like the notebook to be made according to a specified StyleSheet. To be more specific, here is a simple example of such a button:                   Button["Show",      CreateDocument[       Column[{         TextCell["Some text" , "Text", FontSize -> 20],         ExpressionCell[Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 2 \[Pi]}]]         }],       WindowTitle -> "Some title", WindowSize -> {450, 300}],       ImageSize -> {50, 18}, BaseStyle -> {"GenericButton", Bold}]      The button is then copy-pasted into any line of any TextCell of the main notebook and serves for the referencing purposes: when the reader meets the text discussing this plot this button in embedded in such a text, and he may press the button. This will generate the notebook with the plot, and the reader may see the plot in question on the spot. Now, I would like the notebook that will be open that way to be created according to the JournalArticle StyleSheet. Is it possible to specify? This edit I am making after having received the answers of Mike Honeychurch and m_goldberg. After all corrections here is the code I had in mind:                   Clear[x, y, z];     Button["Show a JournalArticle Notebook",      CreateDocument[{        (* This makes a Section title *)        TextCell["A section", "Section", FontSize -> 40],        (* This makes a text *)        TextCell["Some text", "Text", FontSize -> 20],        (* This makes a numbered formula *)        TextCell[y == Sin[x^2] // TraditionalForm,          "DisplayFormulaNumbered", FontSize -> 20, TextAlignment -> Center],        (* This makes a plot *)        ExpressionCell[Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 2 \[Pi]}], "Figure"],        (* This makes a caption for illustration *)        TextCell["Some caption", "FigureCaption", FontSize -> 14],        (* This makes another numbered formula *)        TextCell[z == Exp[-x^2] // TraditionalForm,          "DisplayFormulaNumbered", FontSize -> 20, TextAlignment -> Center]        },       StyleDefinitions ->         FrontEnd`FileName[{"Article"}, "JournalArticle.nb",          CharacterEncoding -> "UTF-8"], WindowTitle -> "Some title",        WindowSize -> {750, 500}, Background -> LightYellow],       ImageSize -> {200, 18}, BaseStyle -> {"GenericButton", Bold}]      It creates a button. The latter opens the notbook. That's how it looks like: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Wx1gb.jpg)
