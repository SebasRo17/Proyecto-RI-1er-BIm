I would like to solve the equation $$\frac{2}{p}\int_0^1((1-u)^{1-p}+u^{1-p})^{\frac{1}{p}}\text{d}u=42$$ for p numerically. I tried               NSolve[2/p*Integrate[(u^(1 - p) + (1 - u)^(1 - p))^(1/p), {u, 0, 1}] == 42, p]      and               FindRoot[2/p*Integrate[(u^(1 - p) + (1 - u)^(1 - p))^(1/p), {u, 0, 1}] == 42, {p, 0.08}]      and               h[p_?NumericQ] := 2/p*NIntegrate[((1 - u)^(1 - p) + u^(1 - p))^(1/p), {u, 0, 1}]     FindRoot[h[p] == 42, {p, 0, 1}]      (I know the answer is approximately 0.0804670), however I still would like to know how it is computed. In both cases, I received errors:               NSolve::nsmet: This system cannot be solved with the methods available to NSolve      and               GCD::exact: "Argument 0.92` in GCD[0,0.92] is not an exact number.     FactorSquareFree::lrgexp: Exponent is out of bounds for function FactorSquareFree.     GCD::exact: "Argument 0.9195355178111501` in GCD[0,0.919536] is not an exact number.      How do I solve this equation? Preferably with as little Integral evaluations, because they are horribly slow. **EDIT** nevermind, sorry. There was a typo in the third try. Thank you for your time >_<
