A common complaint I hear about Facebook, Twitter, Ning and other social sites is that once a comment or post is made, it can't be edited. I think this goes against one of the key goals of user experience: giving the user **agency** , or the ability to control what he does in the software. Even on Stackexchange sites, you can only edit the comments for a certain amount of time. **Is the inability for so many web apps to not allow users to edit their writing a technical shortcoming or a "feature by design"?**
