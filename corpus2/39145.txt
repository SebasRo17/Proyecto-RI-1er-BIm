My Default Stylesheet was broken by one of my personal stylesheet? I've added one shortcut to one of my stylesheet, Ctrl+Shift+I, to change a style of cell into style named `Image`. For example, it looks like the following output cell.               cellExpression=Cell[i,"Image"];CellPrint@cellExpression      However, now my default stylesheet also has this shortcut. ### question1 * * * why? how to remove it in my default stylesheet? ### question2 * * * Is it possible make only Alt+Shift+I take effect to change cell style, Alt+I to `Insert` a picture, still work for menu bar. ### question3 * * * one aside: My shortcut of Alt+Shift+... to change style type works well under windows, but doesn't work well under Ubuntu in VMWare, what's your cases and how to fix it.
