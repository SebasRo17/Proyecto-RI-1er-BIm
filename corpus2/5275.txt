Background: I want to develop a custom control, based on a 2D slider. I currently have this ( working ) example.                 Manipulate[        If[(iOld != i || jOld != j),         lata[[1]] = i; lata[[2]] = j];         i = lata[[1]];         j = lata[[2]];         iOld = i;         jOld = j;         lata,         Row[{            Column[{            Control[{{i, i, "i"}, -5, 5, 0.25}],            Control[{{j, j, "j"}, -5, 5, 0.25}]}]            ,            Control[{{lata, lata, "lata"}, {-5, -5}, {5, 5}, {0.25, 0.25}}]         }],         Initialization -> {           lata = {1, 0},           i = lata[[1]],           j = lata[[2]],           jOld = j,           iOld = i         }]      This control is a 2D Slider and two normal sliders in sync. Clearly the two sliders are not necessary but I like the built-in functionality of the slider's drop down precision- entry ( and auto play ). **Question: Is there an easy way to build a 2D Slider with the drop down precision provided for a normal slider, thus in x and y direction? Or do I have to build it from scratch?** ( Update: Basically remove the two sliders =itself= but remain all other functionality in the example. )
