I would like to make a Table whose iterator has a dynamically updated endpoint, i.e.               Table[i,{i,1,Dynamic[n]}]      Is this possible? Here is the context:               n=1     SetterBar[Dynamic@n, Range[1, 10, 1]]     f[x_]:=Module[{y},             y=Table[0,{i,1,Dynamic[n]+4}]             For[i=3,i<=Dynamic[n]+4,i++,                  y[[i]]=y[[i-1]]+2y[[i-2]]               ]            ]     y=f[Dynamic[x]]      I get the error               Iterator {i,1,4+1} does not have appropriate bounds.      As another example of how I'd like to use this, here is fully functional code:               n=1;     Manipulate[Table[ToExpression["x" <> ToString@i], {i, 1,Dynamic@n + 1}], {x1, 1, 10}, {x2, 1, 10}]
