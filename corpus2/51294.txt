I'm using the Compile function in Mathematica to compute say the following :               f=Compile[{x,_Real},Cos[x]]      Then I can compute f[x] for x taking any real value. Ok, let's say now that I have an expression like `tmp=Cos[x]`. My question is the following: Is there a way that I can compile the expression assigned to `tmp` without explicitly typing "Cos[x]" in the `Compile` function ? I.e. I want to do something like :               f=Compile[{x,_Real},tmp]      But that won't work it seems. In principle I'd like the value assigned to tmp to be a somewhat huge and complicated symbolic function of `x` that I would like to compile for numerical efficiency.
