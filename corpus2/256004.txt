I have the following coding environment:   * Three Developers   * Source code resides in Team Foundation Server (2010)   * Development Environment   * Stage Environment   * Production Environment As the Senior Developer, I need to review code before its pushed to the Staging Environment. Once I review the code, it is pushed to Stage where it gets tested by our (small) test team. Once changes are tested and accepted, I move to production. Suppose the following: `Developer A` submits a change, I review it and push to stage. `Developer B` submits a change, I review it and push to stage. During the testing, a user says the change `Developer A` made has bugs and needs to be fixed. But the changes `Developer B` made need to go to production. This happens more than not. Currently, I need to wait for `Developer A` to fix the bugs and test again or have `Developer A` disable their changes. How to solve this dilemma?
