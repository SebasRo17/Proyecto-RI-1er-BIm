As my experience in programming increases with each project, I look back at earlier projects and cringe at some of the ways the code is structured or how well i have implemented a design pattern. These projects are still utilized in production environments (without issue) and have new features implemented on a yearly cycle. Updating the entire structure is not feasible. When implementing new features should I structure the updates with best practices in mind, or should I keep to existing (inferior) structure to maintain consistency with the rest of the project?
