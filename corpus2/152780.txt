I feel that often you don't really choose what format your code is in. I mean most of my tools in the past have decided for me. Or I haven't really even thought about it. I was using TextPad on windows the other day and as I was saving a file, it prompted me about ASCII, UTF-8/16, Unicode etc etc... I am assuming that almost all code written is ASCII, but why should it be ASCII? Should we actually be using UTF-8 files now for source code, and why? I'd imagine this might be useful on multi-lingual teams. Are there standards associated with how multilingual teams name variables/functions/etc?
