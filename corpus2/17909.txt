I can't figure out what's wrong with this piece of code. I'm trying to define a function that counts the occurrences of `x`, `y` and `l` or `lc` in expressions like `x[x[y[l]]`, where `x` will add 1 to an "eigenvalue", `y` will subtract 1 and likewise for `l` and `lc`. Then for example I would get `H[x[x[y[l]]] = 2`. Now I'm stuck at the first phase with the function defined below:               H[z_] := Module[{list1 = Join[Level[z, Infinity], {z}], lam = 0},       Which[list1[[1]] == l, lam = lam + 1,              list1[[1]] == lc, lam = lam - 1       ];       lam     ]      This should give `H[l] = 1` and `H[lc] = -1`, but instead I get just the initial value `lam = 0` for the "lc" case... When I discard the last line and use instead               H[z_] := Module[{list1 = Join[Level[z, Infinity], {z}], lam = 0},       Which[list1[[1]] == l, lam = lam + 1,              list1[[1]] == lc, lam = lam - 1       ]     ]      I get               Which[lc == l, lam$538474 = lam$538474 + 1,            list1$538474[[1]] == lc, lam$538474 = lam$538474 - 1     ]      Clearly something's wrong with the `list1$538474[[1]]` above. What am I missing?
