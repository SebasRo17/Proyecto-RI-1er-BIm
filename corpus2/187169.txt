On my filesystem (Windows 7) I have some text files (These are SQL script files, if that matters). When opened with Notepad++, in the "Encoding" menu some of them are reported to have an encoding of "UCS-2 Little Endian" and some of "UTF-8 without BOM". What is the difference here? They all seem to be perfectly valid scripts. How could I tell what encodings the file have without Notepad++?
