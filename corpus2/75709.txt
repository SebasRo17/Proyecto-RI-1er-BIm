At my office, we are about to embark on an epic journey of converting an old Delphi 5 application to something more modern. One of our options is to convert to Delphi Prism, but we want to see what options are available to help us. So far, all I've found is Oxidizer (last worked on 2 years ago). Are there any other options for helping us convert reasonably quickly to Prism? Thanks.
