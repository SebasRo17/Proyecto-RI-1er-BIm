I'm creating a website where trust is a big issue, I want to prove by making it open source I actually do what I claim. Question 1. If I make my source code open, how can I prove the actual website runs on this code? But I also have a dilemma, it is a commercial project and I don't want others to run off with it and claim it theirs. So I think I need a correct license. Question 2. What license is best for me? Currently I'm thinking about GPL v3.
