I have a series of PDE equations that are solved with NDSolve for certain variables $a$ and $b$ - Now, I want to see the output at a time $t$ as $a$ and $b$ change; so I was thinking of a loop formulation, where both variables increment , the PDEs are solved and the output for time $t$ saved. I am not sure how to implement this in mathematica, or whether it's even the best way to do it - I will eventually want to use the outputs for curve fitting to some data. Any suggestions would be appreciated!
