It often happens that I develop multiple different projects at once, so I need a solution to switch from one environment to another. I have created batch files to do the job but as this thing grows, I'll soon need something better. Some things I do are:   * Map drives   * Launch applications   * Load test databases   * Set environment variables   * etc. Any suggestions on that? **Edited:** I want to unify the development process in some way. We use VS, Eclipse, Notepad++ or what ever the developer needs. The goal is to be able to load a project in any windows machine without having compiling or other issues. Example:   * The solution might need to reference files, sdk folders, test data paths or other stuff. To solve this: I have mapped the code to a drive. The project doesn't need to know whether the dev is using c:\dev or c:\programming folders (user choice). They only need to map their coding folder to a drive (lets say W:) every file of the solution is under W:   * Another problem is the SDKs. An sdk can be in c:\programfiles\Microsoft sdks\etc.. or in c:\programfiles **x86** \Microsoft sdks\etc.. Those Sdks should also need mapping to a standard folder that the solution knows. Another thing is that we want services running (apache lets say) if we develop a website. We don't want this to run all the time. The solution so far is to distribute batch files that the developer edits once in order to match their paths to the solutions and they run the batch before they start their new task. I am thinking on developing a app that will set the environment as desired. Preconfigured sets that are distributed. The developer executes them in order to set the enviromnent as desired. I hope to be clear now on the problem. Any suggestions on doing that in a better way?
