I'm sorry if this has been asked before, but it is a very simple question and I would imagine it shouldn't be terribly hard for someone that knows to answer. I'm essentially trying to tell mathematica to _not_ simplify               Exp[x] Exp[y] -> Exp[x+y]      I am using an add on package which is having a hard time with some replacement rules. So, the question is, is it possible to force mathematica to express `Exp[x] Exp[y]` as is and not simplify it? A secondary question, which should just be an extension of the first, I would like `(Exp[x] Exp[y] )^2` to be replaced as `Exp[x]^2 Exp[y]^2` not `Exp[2x+2y]`! Or even being left as is is ok.
