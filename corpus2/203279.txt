Start with an array of arrays; in this case, they are different lengths in order to demonstrate the technique, but they do not have to be.               [[1,2,3,4], [5,6,7], [8,9,10], [11,12,13,14,15]]      At the other end of the transformation, you have an array of arrays where the first array contains the first element from each of the original arrays, the second array contains the second element from each of the original arrays, and so on.               [[1,5,8,11], [2,6,9,12], [3,7,10,13], [4,14], [15]]      Is there a mathematical or CS term for this operation?
