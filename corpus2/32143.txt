I have a set $S=\\{s_1,\ldots,s_k\\}$ and would like to maximize a fixed expression over permutations of $S$: $\max f(x_1,\ldots,x_k)$ with $x_i\in S$ and $x_i=x_j\Rightarrow i=j$. Is there a convenient way to do this? As an example, with $S=\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ I can write               Maximize[      {f[a,b,c,d],       a != b && a != c && a != d && b != c && b != d && c != d &&       0 < a < 5 && 0 < b < 5 && 0 < c < 5 && 0 < d < 5},     {a, b, c, d}, Integers]      but obvious this scales poorly. You can assume $S\subset\mathbb{Z}$ if it helps. Most of the time I'm just using initial segments of the positive integers, as in my example.
