It appears that many interview related questions on this site are focused on testing traditional CS knowledge, such as:   * Algorithms   * Data structures   * Programming language/environments Obviously the site is called "programmers", so that is to be expected. However, I'd also argue that there are many other aspects that may be better predictors of a candidate's success (assuming that the candidate has a degree in CS from a good school and got good grades):   * Do they have a general love for programming and a continual interest in improving their skills?   * Are they willing to learn new skills?   * Are they willing to take the time to share their knowledge with and help others?   * Do they have a track record of success?   * Will the interviewee enjoy the type of work the company is doing and be dedicated to it?   * Did they work on similar projects or for similar companies before and enjoy them?   * Will they like the company's culture?   * Are they committed to seeing projects succeed? Is there more benefit in testing CS knowledge or behavioral aspects, or a combination?
