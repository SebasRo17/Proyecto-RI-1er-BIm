I'm trying to find more resources regarding Brodal heap. All I found is a haskell implementation of Brodal-Okasaki heap, but I _think_ that they are skew heaps, is this correct? Furthermore, I'm illiterate in Haskell so that does not help much. Does anyone have (or know of) an Brodal queue implementation in pseudocode, C, C++, Python? Also please correct if my assumptions above are wrong.
