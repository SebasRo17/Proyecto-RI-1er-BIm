Ignoring the different column details like colors, shapes, and sizes, I already have an idea of dealing with that, I'm more interested in dealing with retail pricing, whole pricing (with or without a table), and possibly discount. If anything, I want to know what I should also take account for. Will it just be adding a quantity column, two pricing cols, and two discount columns, and a quantity limit? If I were to add a pricing table it would be inserted as a json file, would this be a bad idea? Please give any insight about this.
