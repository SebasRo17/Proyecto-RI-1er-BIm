The exercise is: define the trajectory function `y(x)` in _Mathematica_. Pick the initial speed (in meters per second) equal to `2` and the angle equal to `30 degrees`. Plot this function from `x=0` to `x=0.5`. I approached this problem by typing               y[x_] := x*Tan[θ] - ((9.8*x^2)/(2*v^2*(.5 + (.5*Cos[2 θ]))))      I then assigned θ and initial speed:                θ==30          v==2      and then wrote the plot function:               Plot[y, {x,0,0/5}]      AND THEN GOT AN EMPTY GRAPH! HELP!
