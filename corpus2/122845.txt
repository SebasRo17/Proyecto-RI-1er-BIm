Microsoft technologies keep getting better but they do so on the expense of adding one more abstraction layer every time. In the early stages we used to play with C# code and SQL procedures to perform CRUD operations. Then generics came along with ADO.NET, DataSets, Entities. Next, LINQ came offering LINQ to SQL, to XML, to Entities, to Objects. To get more easier and more confusing, EF 4.1 came. C# just kept evolving and adding new abstractions layers again and again. The end result is that I am so confused that I don't know which one is which and when to use which one. When I try to follow books, some teach EF while some are stuck with ADO.NET. Seriously I have no clue whatsoever why we have evolved so much for data manipulation To be honest, all I know is the C# syntax and some basic stuff. Data manipulation is out of the window and so are the advanced features.   * Is there a unified manner to learn C# ? I don't want to use Entity Framework and LINQ when I don't understand them or what they offer. I just want to have a thorough understanding from Level 0 to Level 10.    * Also, I am thinking of learning PHP simultaneously because I feel learning some other language will might help me understand C# better. Is this the right thing?
