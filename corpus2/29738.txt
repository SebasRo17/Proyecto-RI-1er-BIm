I am a .NET developer using WPF and ASP.NET MVC and I was hoping to pass some kind of certification exam. There seems to be four exams but I am unable to understand what the differences are even with Microsoft's definitions:   * MCPD   * MCAD   * MCSD   * MTA How do they relate to each other? Is there a natural progression path through the certification exams? What version of .NET are they suited for?
