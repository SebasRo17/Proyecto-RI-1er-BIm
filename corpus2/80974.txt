I'm taking on my first enterprise-level application ~~and I want my team to model the entire ASP.NET MVC C# application before we even tap out one line of code.~~ UPDATE: This was not intended to be a philosophical discussion about when to document/model an application. Please only provide answers for "how" to document/model. The truth is that I've always skimped in this department and I've never really modeled an application before. What is the standard way to do this? What type of diagrams should be used and what would the documentation look like? Links to sample diagrams and documentation is appreciated. When searching I can find numerous things around the net but I wanted to see if there is a current modern consensus on how to go about doing this. Thanks in advance! ### Closing Statement I had no idea this was such a sticky subject. Thank you to all of you that could set aside the obvious controversy and provide useful answers. It was an interesting discussion to say the least :) Another useful link I discovered is this: Do you use UML in Agile development practices?
