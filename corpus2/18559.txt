`FullSimplify` does not get rid of the `z` factor in the following expression:               FullSimplify[(E^(-I x) y z + (1 + E^(I y)) (x + y) z)/z, z != 0]      Upon removing a single piece of the expression, such as the first `y` factor or the `1+` in the brackets, the simplification suddenly succeeds. As far as I can tell it is only this special combination of variables that fails. Is there any obvious problem with simplifying this?   Is there a way to tweak the `FullSimplify` function to make it succeed? (this is just a part of a longer expression - and I want to avoid looking for such problems manually). I'm using _Mathematica_ version 9.0.0.0 on Win7 64 bit.
