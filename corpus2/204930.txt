I've run into this challenge a couple of times and I'm hoping someone can provide some references, training or advice on how to explain the difference between a Product Backlog Item and a Task in TFS. I understand and have explained that a Product Backlog Item is the "What" and the Task is the "How". I have also explained that the PBI is the requirement and the Task is how the requirement is met. I'm repeatedly met with blank stares and head scratching when I explain this. It seems that the Software Engineers I explain this to can not make the distinction. It is all the same to them. I believe my other challenge is that I am not able to effectively illustrate why it is important to make the distinction.
