I'm currently trying to design a little application using Domain Driven Design but I'm afraid I don't really get the concept yet. Let me try to explain this as clearly as possible.               public interface IMyDomainRepository     {         void Add(IAnInterfaceFromAThirdParty element);     }      The interface above is defined in my domain model and this will be used in a different project called `ThirdPartyImplementionVersionX`. Now `IAnInterfaceFromAThirdParty` is not defined in my domain model but comes from my third party library. I could create a class/interface in my domain model which implements the same properties and methods as the interface `IAnInterfaceFromAThirdParty` but this interface has 20 methods defined thus making it a difficult task to implement the same logic. Is this the way to go or am I missing something?
