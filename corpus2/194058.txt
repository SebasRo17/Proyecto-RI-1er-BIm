I'm designing an XML response for a consuming application to take in, and I'm weighing two different designs. Currently I have a design as follows (where the Product element can repeat):               <Response>         <AccountType>         <ProductType>         <Products>            <Product>                <ProductID />                <ProductStatus />                <ProductName />            </Product>            <Product>                <ProductID />                <ProductStatus />                <ProductName />            </Product>         </Products>     </Response>      An alternate design is:               <Response>         <AccountType>         <ProductType>         <Product>             <ProductID />             <ProductStatus />             <ProductName />         </Product>         <Product>             <ProductID />             <ProductStatus />             <ProductName />         </Product>     </Response>      In the first design I have a master element called Products, under which each Product element exists and can repeat within Products. The second design is a little flatter - where Product exists under the main Response node. Which one of the two is more optimal for a consuming application to read from and process?
