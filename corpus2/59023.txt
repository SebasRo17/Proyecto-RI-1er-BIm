I would like to compare variables `t` and `u` and print either `Yes` or `No` depending one which is larger. My code is simply the following:               Assuming[t < u, If[t - u < 0, Print[Yes], Print[No]]]      Since `t < u` is assumed, `t - u < 0` holds. So I should get `Yes`. But what I get is a repetition of `If` term. That is,               If[t - u < 0, Print[Yes], Print[No]]      Am I missing something?
