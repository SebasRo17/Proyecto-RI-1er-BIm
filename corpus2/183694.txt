I have a function containing other functions. These function are called based on value of variable `action`. These sub functions are logically grouped - i.e., they all deal with file manipulation. Each function has 2 to 5 lines. I would like to improve the style. Is there a more concise way of achieving this end than what I have below? I feed there is a log of defining functions that contain not many LOC.               def my_function(action):              return { '1': func_a, '2': func_b, '3': func_c, '4': func_d}.get(action, err)()              def func_a():             ...             ...             return ...         def func_b():             ...             ...             ...             return ...         def func_c():             ...             ...             return ...         def func_d():             ...             ...             return ...         def err():             return      *discaimer: actual functions have logical names. My issue is with the proliferation of functions to define
