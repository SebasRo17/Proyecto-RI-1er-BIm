Basically I have a two dimensional list plot with a bunch of points between the square of (0,0) and (1,1). The y-values of these points are drawn from a uniform probability distribution between 0 and 1, and the x-values are drawn from a semi-uniform distribution, except it jumps up at x=.5. So in the plot the density of points jumps up at x=0.5. I need a statistical technique that will determine where this jump occurs and will draw a line there, even if we didn't know the jump was at 0.5 or if the initial conditions were changed and it wasn't at 0.5 or even a straight line. ![List Plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uAnEk.png)
