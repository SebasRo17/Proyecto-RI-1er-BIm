I am using 3 checkboxes as desktops, portables and ipods in such a way that when I click to desktops it should shows `ListLinePlot` of `p1`, when I click to portables, it should show `ListLinePlot` of `p2` and in the same way, when I click to ipods, it shows `ListLinePlot` of `p3`.               p1 = {.955, .914, .956, 1.516, 1.355};      p2 = {1.462, 1.357, 1.577, 1.917, 2.054};     p3 = {0,0, 1.57, 1.619, 3.997};          Column[{CheckboxBar[        Dynamic[z], {ListLinePlot[p1, Filling -> Axis,            FillingStyle -> Blue] -> Desktop,          ListLinePlot[p2, Filling -> Axis, FillingStyle -> LightBlue] ->           Portables,          ListLinePlot[p3, Filling -> Axis, FillingStyle -> Green] -> Ipods}], Spacer[5], Dynamic[z]}]      This is working correctly. But I want when I click both desktops and portables on, it should show the plots of `p1` and `p2` in a stacked way. Here I am explaining it with the help of `BarChart` because I have no idea whether 'ListLinePlot`can do this .               BarChart[Table[{p1[[i]], p2[[i]]}, {i, 1, 5, 1}], ChartLayout -> "Stacked"]      If I click Desktops, Portables and ipods, then it should dynamically take data of p1, p2 and p3 in stacked order as               BarChart[Table[{p1[[i]],p2[[i]], p3[[i]]}, {i, 1, 5, 1}], ChartLayout -> "Stacked"]      and so on. But I want stacked `ListLinePlot` and I don't know any function like `ChartLayout` in `BarChart`. I have seen the `Accumulate` function but it does not work as I wanted. For more clarification, just have a look at http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/12/01/US_APPLEBREAK0112_VT.html I want to do as it is, as in the product button of this link. Please help me.
