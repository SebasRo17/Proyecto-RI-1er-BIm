I should define a testing strategy and environments and I have encountered rather terminology issue (but might well be my fault) so I hope someone will correct me here. We are using INT environment where the application is deployed at first and then SIT environment, where is the app passed if it is fine on INT. So, testers do all system tests on SIT. But according to all definitons, SIT is system integration testing which is done after the system tests and validates cooperation of more systems. So why SIT serves actually for system testing, yet it is said to be a phase which actually follows the system testing? EDIT: According to common knowledge-books:   1. Unit   2. Integration (modules to larger pieces)   3. System test   4. ().. System Integration Test --if there are more system to integrate Our apps consist of db, services, frontend. So to make a system test, they must be integrated, otherwise testers cannot do anything. So SIT precedes actual system testing (both funtional and non functional) which does not match with described processes. And environment for testers is also called SIT..
