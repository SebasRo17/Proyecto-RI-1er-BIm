I want to compute the mean of a list while ignoring missing values, but I don't find a lot of information on how to deal with Missing data in Mathematica. I have a list like :               a = {{{0, 1}, {2, Na}} , {{0, 3}, {2, 5}}}       and I want to compute the mean but ignoring the Na values. So my output would be:               a = {{0, 2}, {2, 5}}       How can I do that? Thanks.
