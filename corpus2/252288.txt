I am about to start implementing a change request on my companies internal website, that will check a bunch of fields and highlight them if they match certain guidelines. For example, if the date of birth is today, that field will be outlined and the tooltip will say "Wish them a happy birthday!". The specs ask for this to be loaded after the rest of the page is done rendering, so it won't increase the load time. Since I am new to angularJS, I'm not sure of the 'proper' ways this should be done. Issues: Since this includes adding borders and images and title attributes (DOM manipulation), it seems I should be using a directive. However, this won't be reusable or 'short' like most directives seem to be. Half of the data I need to check will be returned in the original call on page load, so I would like to save that and not waste another call getting it again, which makes me think a service would be nice for storing all that data. I do know how to do this all in the controller, but that is bad bad code :P Any ideas on the best way this could be done? Basically, I will need an http call to check all the data, which will return an object with bool values for each type of 'Call Out' I need to do. Then I'll run through this list and if the value is true, add a border, image, and tooltip text. I'm not sure if this question is clear enough, so if you want me to add some details, please ask. Thank you!
