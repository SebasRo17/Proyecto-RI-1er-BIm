I want to be able to select elements from a list that only appear once. I originally had this:               Select[Table[Count[list, i], {i, list}], # == 1]      But the issue is that my list has about 60,000 elements, and it takes way too long. The only way I could think of speeding it up would be to make a function like Count, but that would return after seeing the same element twice, and I have no idea how to do that in Mathematica. Also, I'm not sure if it's important, but the list is actually a list of lines (with a line defined by two 2D points). The goal is to find the edges that are only used by one triangle, hence making them a perimeter edge. Thanks!
