According to a popular SO post is it considered a bad practice to prefix table names. At my company **every column** is prefixed by a table name. This is difficult for me to read. I'm not sure the reason, but this naming is actually the company standard. I can't stand the naming convention, but I have no documentation to back up my reasoning. All I know is that reading AdventureWorks is much simpler. In ~~this~~ our company DB you will see a table, Person and it might have column name: Person_First_Name   or maybe even   Person_Person_First_Name (don't ask me why you see person 2x) Why is it considered a bad practice to pre-fix column names? Are underscores considered evil in SQL as well? * * * Note: I own Pro SQL Server 2008 - Relation Database design and implementation. References to that book are welcome.
