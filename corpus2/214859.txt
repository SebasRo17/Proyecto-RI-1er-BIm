I have `TopicBusiness.class` and `PostBusiness.class`. I have no problem with deciding into which class methods such as `addPostToDatabase()` or `getAllPostsFromDatabase()` should go. But what about `getAllPostsFromTopic(TopicEntity topic)` or `getNumberOfPostsInTopic(TopicEntity topic)`? Should the parameter be the deciding factor? So when the method takes TopicEntity as parameter it should belong to `TopicBusiness.class`? I am quite puzzled by this. EDIT: Some more info as requested. `TopicBusiness.class` and `PostBusiness.class` are classes holding all the business logic of the application concerning topics and posts respectively - that is fetching the data from database and/or performing some operations on them. `TopicEntity` is data (in this case representing single topic) fetched from database. `getAllPostFromTopic(TopicEntity topic)` gets all posts from database that belong to particular topic, while `getNumberOfPostsInTopic(TopicEntity topic)` performs database query and returns the number of posts that topic passed as parameter consists of.
