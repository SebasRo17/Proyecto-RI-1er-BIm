I am trying to solve this identity using _Mathematica_ : $$3 \sqrt{5 \sqrt[3]{37}-16}=\sqrt[3]{a}-\sqrt[3]{b}-c $$ I know that `a`, `b` and `c` are positive integers. I want to find what `a`, `b` and `c` are. I tried               FindInstance[{a >= 1, b >= 1, c >= 1,      3*Sqrt[5*(37)^(1/3) - 16] == (a^(1/3) - b^(1/3) -  c)}, {a, b, c}, Integers]      That did not work. I tried a few more approaches using `FindInstance` but with no luck. Did I miss something or am I using the wrong function? The answer is `a = 1369`, `b = 296` and `c = 2`.
