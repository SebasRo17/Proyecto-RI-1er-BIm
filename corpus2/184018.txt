I am looking to quantify the cost or problems of bad software development practices. Specifically can software that has been developed resulting in an anemic domain model be quantifiable in terms of business cost or risk? My initial thoughts (which are all nearly impossible to generically quantify) are: -   * Reduced flexibility.   * Potential for increased support costs. Any assistance you can offer would be greatly appreciated.
