I have a figure (which is by combining different plots) that I generated using `Grid[]`. The problem is, I want to specify the `ImageSize` of this final figure. I am unable to do it in `Grid[]`. Therefore, I wanted to convert this `Grid[]` object to `Graphics[]` object so that I can save it as a `PDF` of desired `ImageSize`. **Note** : I tried to save the output of `Grid[]` as `PDF` using `Export[]`. It works fine. However, when I set `ImageSize` in `Export[]`, it seems to be ignored. I tried               i=First@ImportString[ExportString[figure, "PDF"]];      But even this seems to lose clarity but this gives crispier image than `Rasterize` `Magnify[]` seems to do what I want even if It doesn't convert the figure to graphics, I can change the resolution by trial and error. Not the best way to do it but gets the job done.
