As a learning C++ programmer, I am trying to select a GUI framework or library for my own projects. I have some experience with Qt: it's very straightforward, it has a very good documentation, and provides a lot of tools, but it seems to duplicate a lot of the standard library. Are all C++ GUI libraries like this? What should I be looking for in a GUI library? How do I determine which one would be best given a particular problem? Should I focus on one specific library, or is it worth it to know several of them as they might serve different purposes?
