Consider the following               testadj = RandomVariate[BernoulliDistribution[0.15], {50, 50}];     AdjacencyGraph[testadj, VertexSize -> Large]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/I5Tc1.png) The nodes are almost completely hidden in the mess of edges. They can be made easier to see by making the edges fade into the background a little.               AdjacencyGraph[testadj, EdgeStyle -> Directive[Opacity[0.4], Gray],       VertexSize -> Large]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OT77n.png) But we still have the problem that the lines draw over the top of the nodes. Is there a way to force the nodes to draw on top of the lines?
