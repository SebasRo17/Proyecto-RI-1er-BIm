I have a service where users can upload/download/replace/delete files. These files have about a dozen attributes that are saved to a SQL Database. Periodicaly throughout their session they will have to download a summary (FileName, size0in-KB, and ID) of a subset of files. When working in the service it creates an object of these attributes (FooObject) in the DB. But, when the info is sent to the User, a summary object (FooObjectSummary) is created. FooObjectSummary has 3 attributes, FooObject has 12 or so (none of the attributes are anything but strings or primitive types). I originaliy did this so that as little extra info would be transferred across. None of this extra data in FooObject would be dangerous for the user to have, but it wouldn't be exposed to them anyways? Am I just writing extra code? Or is it good practice to only expose the user to as much info as they need and not a bit more?
