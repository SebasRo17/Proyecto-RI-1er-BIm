I'm trying to advocate unit testing in my workgroup, but an objection I often get is that it should be used only for externally exported API (which is only a minimal and non critical part of our system), and not on internal and private code (which now has only functional testing). While I think that unit test can and should be applied to all the code, how can I persuade my coworkers?
