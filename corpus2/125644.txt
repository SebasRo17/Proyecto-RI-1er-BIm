I am trying to solve an issue with reusing components. I have some UI components (a mix of JS, CSS, and HTML) that are not specific to any application. These UI components need to be able to be used in multiple applications. One is a RoR application, the other is an ASP.NET MVC application. How can I maintain these components (e.g. with version control, distribution) and still make them accessible to the different platforms that need to consume them? For example, ApplicationA and ApplicationB use UIComponentA, which is not natively a part of their projects or repositories, because UIComponentA lives in its own repository. How can these projects get the dependencies they need while keeping the components reusable and hosted in their own location? Does anyone have experience with a similar situation, and if so, how did you tackle it? If you need further information, don't hesitate to ask, I will update this question.
