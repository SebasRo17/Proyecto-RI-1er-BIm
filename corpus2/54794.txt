I have this BarChart: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/reLXZ.png) created with this code:               sizes = {10718, 881, 395, 387, 375, 309, 297};     BarChart[sizes, ChartStyle -> 33, ImageSize -> 480, BarOrigin -> Left, ChartLabels ->        Placed[sizes, {{1, 0.25}, {0, 0}}, "  " <> ToString[#] <> " kB" &],      ChartLegends -> {"DelphiXE3", "Delphi2010", "Delphi2005", "Delphi7",        "Delphi6", "Delphi5", "Delphi4"}]      Now I want all of the text: ChartLabels, ChartLegends and tick labels in Helvetica. Can I do this with a single property, or do I have to add the property for each of the three elements separately? And how do I either?
