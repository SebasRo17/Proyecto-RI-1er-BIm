This is probably going to sound messed up, but here it goes. I've been working on a project for a client for a while now. I wasn't given any details except for "It has to be an XYZ plugin and interface with ABC product". Which was fine, but now we're towards the end (I think) and it's just dragging out. I don't have any time to spend on it and I'm already over schedule by 3 months. Trying to get the client to describe to me how he would like to be able to navigate the data (a UI issue) is just difficult. I've submitted mock ups on what I think he wants but his latest response is "you should look at XXX product", it has similar functionality. Of course, I looked at it and it looks similar to what I submitted, but I don't think that the way I've built the framework is going to support what he is now describing to me. We've had good communication throguh out the process but he doesn't know what he wants. I explained how I was going to build the framework and he agreed, so it isn't a bad choice on my part about design. When I go over what I think are finalized modules, he says, "You should have done it this way" which requires me to go back and rework code and UI. Some smaller items could have been better thought out by me, but the big things are how I interpreted his requirements and I've gone over this module several times during development. I've already received final funds last month so i'm working for free at this point. I no longer want to deal with this project. I've already received payment. I've done other successful projects with this client before and he has a lot of other projects he wants to do. What the heck should I do? I don't want to work on this project anymore. I don't want to ask for any more money (money isn't really the issue). I don't want to make him mad either. I know it looks like I want to have my cake and eat it too. If you think I should call it quits, how should I do it given the circumstances?
