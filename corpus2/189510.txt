I was wondering how the cover flow effect is coded. I used this link which gave me the code on how it all worked out : http://luwes.co/labs/js-cover- flow/. I am completely new to complex programs so I had a hard time in understanding how it all works out. Why do we program each file separately and place them in separate folders and how do all these file come together? Why is there build files, what do they do?
