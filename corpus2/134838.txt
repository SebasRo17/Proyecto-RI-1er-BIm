I'm trying to build a site which user can add their websites which should be monitored and can view a detailed report and statistics of it. And also it should be able to monitor local webservices (mainly), 1) is there any popular java library to use for monitoring a website? (in sense to ping a website and load some content etc., or to show whether site is up or not kinda) 2) Also to validate a flow of website (if possible)?   Example: Go to login page, find fields , fill fields and submit form and validate for successful login or not. I know this kinda looks big but any small part done can be helpful, I've found several of monitoring projects, but they only do normal websites but not local/other webservices and also they can't validate flow of website.
