I have downloaded the Workbench 2.0.0 zip file and followed the install new software -> add -> archive steps to install the workbench plugin. After that, the Workbench core and webMathematica tools are listed as already installed. I installed the plugin into a 3.8 vintage eclipse. When I try to "Run" a notebook in a _Mathematica_ projects (basic or application) I get the following error message: > FrontEnd Job:: Open Notebook has enountered a problem. An internal error > occurred during::FrontEnd Job::Open Notebook. > > Details: an internal error occurred during: "FrontEnd Job::Open Notebook". > com.wolfram.jlink.NativeLink.MLOpenString(Ljava/lang/String;[Ljava/lang/String;)J I believe I have the right path to the _Mathematica_ executable (when I change the path to point to a non existing file, I get a message that says to adjust the path). Most postings on this site suggest that 32-bit is the only workable solution while at least one post indicated that there is a workaround for 64-bit machines. I'd rather use 64-bit kepler (4.2 vintage eclipse). Is that possible? I couldn't find the details from the one posting that indicated 64-bit is possible. Can someone provide the details?
