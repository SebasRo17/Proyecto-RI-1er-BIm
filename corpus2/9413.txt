I defined a function that I call `disc` which I want to minimize later. The function is defined as               disc[dt_]:=Total[(Log[vDat] - Log[(x'[tDat -dt] /. nsol)])^2]      and it quantifies the discrepancy between measured data (the time series `{tDat,vDat}`) and the solution to a differential equation that was obtained with `NDSolve`. My problem is that this function works great sometimes: ![graph](http://i.stack.imgur.com/21zCa.png) but fails in other applications: ![Another graph](http://i.stack.imgur.com/JKAx7.png) I tried hard to get to the bottom of this, but I just can't understand what's wrong. Suggestions? Clarification: `disc[1]` returns a number and not a `{number}`.
