While researching this question, I encountered an issue with Mathematicaâ€™s font selection mechanism when rich families of pro fonts are used. I can plot text in a given font with:               Graphics[Style[Text["iPhone"], FontFamily -> "Myriad Pro", 50]]      However, while I can use `FontFamily` to select various weight ("Light", "Semibold", "Bold" and "Black"), I cannot use it to select condensed fonts: for example, while `Myriad Pro Semibold Semicondensed` is a valid combination, Mathematica refuses to use it and simply fall back to its default font.   1. Is this a known limitation? Is it OS-specific? (I'm on Mac OS 10.7)   2. Also, how can I get Mathematica to issue an error when it cannot pick up the font requested, instead of falling back to a default font?
