I know in _Mathematica_ , I can do               A = Range[100];     B = A[[50 ;; 60]]      B will then contain the 50th through 60th elements of A. Now, what if I wanted B to take 10th through 40th plus 60th through 80th. Can I do so in one expression such as               B = A[[10 ;; 40 + 60 ;; 80]]      Apparently the above code doesn't work. But I don't want to generate a separate list to do so. Is there a short-cut or elegant way of combining two or more spans in one `Part` expression? I hope ;; is treated as range. Also, typeing `Part`, i.e., [[]], really takes a lot of time to type. I wish _Mathematica_ 10 will shorten it to `< >` or `( )`.
