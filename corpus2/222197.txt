Question title can be a little confusing but I didn't have a better way to put to put it. In Java you can have this:               JLabel HoHoHo = new JLabel();     ...     HoHoHo.setText("Ho Ho Ho");      And this:               JLabel HoHoHo = new JLabel("Ho Ho Ho");      In both cases, it gives a label with `Ho Ho Ho` on it. **Question** How is that possible? I mean, are there to JLabel classes, one with a `String` parameter and one without?
