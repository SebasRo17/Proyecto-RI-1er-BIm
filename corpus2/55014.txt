I am writing the following code:               points = {{6, 2.12, .4738}, {8, 2.05, .5254}, {10, 1.99, .5520}, {12,          1.73, .5595}};     faces = {{1, 2, 4}, {2, 3, 4}};     colors = {32.4, 24.3, 19.2, 16.5};     color1 = (colors[[1]] - Min[colors])/(Max[colors] - Min[colors]);     color2 = (colors[[2]] - Min[colors])/(Max[colors] - Min[colors]);     color3 = (colors[[3]] - Min[colors])/(Max[colors] - Min[colors]);     color4 = (colors[[4]] - Min[colors])/(Max[colors] - Min[colors]);     pts = Map[toPoint, points];     Graphics3D[{GraphicsComplex[ points, Polygon[faces],         VertexColors -> {RGBColor[color1, 0, 1], RGBColor[color2, 0, 1],           RGBColor[color3, 0, 1], RGBColor[color4, 0, 1]}]},       BoxRatios -> {1, 1, 1/2}, Axes -> True, Lighting -> Automatic]      The result is successful, but lacks contour lines for a 3D effect. How can I add that feature? ![My image:](http://i.stack.imgur.com/kJj3n.jpg) Edit: pts is leftover code from something else. It does nothing. I am trying to get continuous mesh over the surface of both triangles to make them look more 3-dimensional. The two surfaces in the attached image are in different planes, but they share a common edge. I need contour lines or mesh to emphasize that these two surfaces are not in the same 2-dimensional plane.
