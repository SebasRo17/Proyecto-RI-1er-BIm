I’m curious to know how folks deal with comparative code reviews (version x against y of a file) in the presence of strong type inference, that is when ‘var’ (in C#) or ‘auto’ (in C++ 0x) is used in place of the older more verbose (explicit) type declaration. When IntelliSense is available one can just float the mouse over the keyword to determine (if necessary) the inferred type – but what do folks do when viewing such sources in Notepad or Code Collaborator etc. Of course strong type inference predates C# and C++ by decades, so how do folks in other languages that have had the feature for years cope? I’m inclined to think that the right hand side of the assignment expression is where most bugs are to be found.
