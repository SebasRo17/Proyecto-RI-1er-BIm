The contrast in behavior between, say,               f[x_] = Sin[x^2];     f'[2]      vs.               u[x_, y_] = Cos[x + y^2];      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1uqai.png) has always bothered my students---and me! (Why _does_ it do it this way?) Anyway, I tell them to handle ${\partial u\over \partial x}\Big|_{x=2}$ via ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/V1BAQ.png) Is this the "simplest" way? How else might we accomplish this? I realize that this is a subjective question, but our context is this is a class where we use _Mathematica_ as a tool rather than a class centered on _Mathematica_ itself. Thus, I want to keep the commands and code required as reasonably elementary as possible (and preferably resembling their paper-and- pencil mathematical work).
