Our team is working on a market place web application where the application will collect payments from individual users then deduct a small percentage fee before paying the balance to the users chosen service vendor. We've encountered problems finding a service provider that will allow outgoing ACH. We've asked both several merchant accounts and banks looking for a solution. Although out going ACH is possible through some banks, we are so far unable to find a bank that exposes an API for automating the process. We're hoping the community has found a viable solution for the redistribution of funds as described. We're certainly not stuck on any particular technology or method such as ACH. Your thoughts, idea or solutions are greatly appreciated.
