We are a group that started working on a fairly big website with an existing codebase. We have a test and a production server. Our idea is to have a test repository with a number of devs having push access to; and a blessed repository that only a few can push to. The blessed repo is supposed to be always stable and represent the latest production version. How can I automate the process of transferring the files into production? Is it bad to have the production files under version control? That way, pushing to the blessed repository would mean deployment. But, what happens when there are merge conflicts? Will the production server break until it is resolved?
