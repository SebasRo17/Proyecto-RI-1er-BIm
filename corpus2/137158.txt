In Java, which is more highly recommended, and why? Both types will throw exceptions, so in that regard handling them is the same. `assert` is slightly shorter, but I'm not sure how much that matters.               public void doStuff(Object obj) {         assert obj != null;         ...     }      vs               public void doStuff(Object obj) {         if (obj == null) {             throw new IllegalArgumentException("object was null");         }         ...     }
