I've recently applied for a position as C# developer, and during the interview, the interviewers asked me many times if I contribute to develop one or more open source project. Since they let me write a lot of code (from basics to TDD,MVVM,MVP), I didn't get the meaning of such a question, especially cause they insisted a lot on the topic and the thing started to bother me. I wish I could have time enough to develop open source software, but I don't get why a company that sells software pretend that their employees work for free in their spare time. What's the real reason of this question (apart from checking your code)?
