> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Colleague unwilling to use unit tests "as it's more to code" I've been trying in the last couple of months to convince one of my colleagues to start unit testing his code and drop the old "print, run, debug" way of doing things. I need clear and elaborated proofs that unit testing increases your productivity - this guy has a decent amount of experience and can give a counter-argument for all of the arguments I gave him until now. Unit testing is not a policy that's being enforced in the team, but is something that most of us do and it definitely worked for us, and we can see how print, run and debug isn't working for him - it's taking way too long to implement something and it's taking even longer to manually test his code.
