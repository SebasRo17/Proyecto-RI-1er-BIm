My code:               data = {MapIndexed[{First[#2], #1} &,          Accumulate[RandomInteger[{-1, 1}, {54}]]],         MapIndexed[{First[#2], #1} &,          Accumulate[RandomInteger[{-1, 1}, {34}]]]};          ListPlot[data,      Axes -> False,      AspectRatio -> 0.75,      Frame -> True,      InterpolationOrder -> {0, 0},      ImageSize -> {400, 300},      ImageMargins -> 0,      Joined -> True,      PlotMarkers -> {{"\[FilledCircle]", 11}, {"", 11}}      ]      On OS X 10.6.8 V8.0.4 I get this output: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wY9QM.png) You will note that the filled circle plot markers have been "distributed" across both sets of data. However if I change the `InterpolationOrder` setting to say:               InterpolationOrder -> {0, None}      ...then no markers appear for the second set of data (due to the markers being an empty string). ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nMOMP.png) Could someone please advise me if the cause of this behaviour is due to me setting these options incorrectly? Any ideas?
