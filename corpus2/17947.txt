I want to set color to a rectangle (in fact a line) that lies on (0,0) and (1,0), and the color function is given by $u(x,t)=t(x-x^2), 0\leq t\leq1$. Since, this $u(x,t)$ act as temperature at the point $(x,0)$ at time $t$, I want to use the colordata with "TemperatureMap", the following is what I have tried:               u[x_, t_] := t (x - x^2)     Animate[Plot[0, {x, 0, 1},       AxesOrigin -> {0, 0},       PlotRange -> {{0, 1}, {-0.02, 0.25}},       PlotStyle -> {Thick},       ColorFunction -> (ColorData["TemperatureMap"][u[#, t]]) &],     {t, 0, 1}]      I find that it must be some problem in the ColorFunction, but I can't fix it, any suggestion? * * * I have tried your code, and find it shall works as the first answer, but since my original question (not posted here) is tried to solving the following question,               f[x_] := -x^2 + x     equ = {D[u[t, x], t] == D[u[t, x], x, x],     u[0, x] == f[x],     u[t, 0] == f[0],     u[t, 1] == f[1]};     sol = NDSolve[equ, u, {t, 0, 1}, {x, 0, 1}]     HeatConda = Animate[Show[{     Plot[Evaluate[u[t, x] /. sol], {x, 0, 1},       PlotRange -> {-0.1, 0.25}, AxesOrigin -> {0, 0},       Filling -> Axis,       ColorFunction -> (ColorData["TemperatureMap"][#2] &)],     Plot[-0.04, {x, 0, 1}, PlotStyle -> {Thick},      ColorFunction ->       Function[{x, y},         ColorData["TemperatureMap"][Evaluate[u[t, x] /. sol]]]]}],      {t, 0, 0.4}]      I want to color the **bottom line** as the same as the filling color. I first tried to simplify the question to the one post here, but the solution here still can work for my (original) question, so please help me again? ![The Figure](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8AEbs.png)
