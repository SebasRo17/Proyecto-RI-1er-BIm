I'm your standard Java/Oracle developer at a large software firm and Eclipse 3.6 is what I spend most of day in. Java is incredibly verbose and that can be painful (but we don't need another blog post explaining this), but Eclipse eases a lot of that pain with one-click renaming, auto-completion, dynamically adjusting your classpath, etc. I cannot imagine trying to do my job without a tool like Eclipse at my disposal. So for those of you who were around before my time, what was it like? The disadvantages are obvious, but were there any advantages?
