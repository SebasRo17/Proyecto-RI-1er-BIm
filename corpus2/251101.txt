So I'm currently on a hunt for a new position as a Front-End Developer. I know JavaScript very well and can wax poetically about Closures, Currying, Prototypal Inheritance, Design Patterns, App performance and overall Front-End Architecture. But yet I still end up bombing job interviews. (FYI most of the jobs I'm interviewing for are for building SPA's with some sort of MVC framework) Usually the coding tests are small code snippets of things I never come across professionally. Like write a function to solve some sort of math problem. Aside from the inherit awkwardness of trying to code while holding the phone in one hand and having a stranger see your screen and watch every character you type, I just don't usually see this kinda stuff in the real world. Is this a serious skill set I'm lacking or are the interviewers asking me irrelevant questions. I guess I should work on my functional programming and algorithm chops but I haven't found many good resources on the web (or in print) any suggestions?
