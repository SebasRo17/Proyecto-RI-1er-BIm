For various reasons I need to supply "proof" my company's lawyer that I implemented a feature by a certain date. I have used source control since the late 90s and even the oldest databases are still working. I also have the all the old setups. Our release notes are not always as clear as they could be and most of them are not dated but organized by revision number. I figure rather than guessing I as other software developer if they know what is typically provided in this situation given what I have. I am particularly confused when a feature is spread among several source files. One feature we need to document is not just dependent on an algorithm but the UI as well and there a half-dozen files that were modified to this. **Update** By Completed, the feature was tested and released to the customer and it worked. And listed in the release notes. Also I already handed the lawyer the release dates, and the release notes (when they existed). However that was not sufficient. I need to show how I got dates. I got them out of my source control databases (Sourceforge, Subversion, Mercurical) so how to I put data that in my source control in a form that a non-technical layman can understand. Note: If you wondering why we have multiple database it is because the software in question been in continuous development since the late eighties.
