I am tired of the question from interviewers - Why have you selected 'XYZ' (the interviewer's organization). In today's IT world, does anybody go looking for a COMPANY. I mean what the interviewers are thinking? that somebody from the sky will come searching for their company and desperate to work with them.. I faced the same question multiple times. I dont understand what to answer this. Can anybody help here...
