It seems to be a stupid question but I wonder how to get an interval of a series expansion. The current series command               Series[f, {x, x0, n}]      only give series expansion up to $x^n$, where I want something like               Series[f, {x, x0, h, t}]      which gives me the series expansion from $x^h$ to $x^t$. Obviously I can get it by doing               Series[f, {x, x0, t}] - Series[f, {x, x0, h-1}]      However, I believe that it takes longer time than it should take.
