I typed the Householder code in _this paper_, which starts on page 7. The code is:                A = {{4., 1., -2., 2.}, {1., 2., 0, 1.}, {-2., 0, 3., -2.}, {2.,             1., -2., -1.}}; (* Made A numeric for speed-up purposes *)      n = Length[A[[1]]];      zeroVector = {};      For[i = 1, i <= n,           zeroVector = Append[zeroVector, {0}];          i++         ];      Alist = {A};      Hlist = {};           For[j = 1, j <= n - 2,           If[A[[j + 1, j]] >= 0, c = 1, c = 2];           alpha = (-1)^c (Sum[A[[k, j]]^2, {k = j + 1, n}])^(1/2);           r = ((1/2) alpha^2 - (1/2) alpha A[[j + 1, j]])^(1/2);           x = zeroVector;           x[[j + 1, 1]] = (A[[j + 1, j]] - alpha)/(2 r);           For[k = j + 2, k <= n,               x[[k, 1]] = A[[k, j]]/(2 r);               k++];           H = IdentityMatrix[n] - 2 x.Transpose[x];           A = H.A.H;          Hlist = Append[Hlist, H]; Print[Hlist];          Alist = Append[Alist, A]; Print[Hlist];          j++];      Of course, the program is complaining with such things as "Sum::write: Tag Set in k=j+1 is Protected." I am just not seeing what is wrong. I added the prints as I want to see intermediate results. Can anyone spot the issue? Is there a better solution or code for this? **Aside:** I wish I could find a nice implementation of this somewhere, but unfortunately I have not been able to find in MMA or the web. I found the following snippet on _Wolfram_, but I cannot make use of it (maybe I am missing something).                HouseholderMatrix[v_?VectorQ] :=     IdentityMatrix[Length[v]]       - 2 Transpose[{v}] . {v} / (v.v)      **End Aside**
