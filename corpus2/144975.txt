I have various windows forms applications that contain various controls that build up custom "group by" and "where" clauses for my class methods. I am thinking to pass a collection structure of some kind in order for the methods to be able to build the group by's and the where clauses. Let's say a list containing the field and the value for the group by or where. Am I going to the right direction? Update: I dont have code yet but let me try to explain better:   1. We have a form with 10 dropdownlists and a checkmark beside them.   2. Also we have adatagrid on the form.   3. Every dropdownlist corresponds to a field in a table.     * If a dropdownlist has its checkbox checked means that it must be part of the group by clause in the select statement.     * The value of the dropdownlist must be part of the where clause. * **note: *** Another application could have different numbers of dropdownboxes and different corresponding fields. I want to create a common method that will retrieve data with user selectable group by and where clauses. So what i think is to pass to the method 2 lists.   * One with (fieldname, value) for the where clauses   * And one with (fieldname) for the group by depending on the logic above... I hope this is more clear.
