I've come up with 4 different ways to fit an image inside a viewing region, but I'm trouble coming up with names for them. Perhaps someone can suggest some?   1. Fit image in viewing region, do not enlarge if image is smaller   2. Size image so it fits snuggly inside the viewing region (enlarge if necessary) -- the image is as large as possible while still fitting within the viewing region   3. Size image so that it fills the entire viewing region -- the image will be the same size or _bigger_ than the viewing region   4. 1:1 ratio; 1 pixel in the image corresponds to 1 pixel on screen All zooming options maintain aspect ratio. Stretching is just ugly, so it's not an option :)
