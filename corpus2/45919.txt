I was wondering if you can help. I have a set of equations I need to solve for a list of parameters; entering each parameter value and solving anew each time is simply not economical. I found a way to vary the parameter and have Mathematica solve the equation, but the calculation now takes extremely long and does not even return a solution. Here is my code below (very simple): ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/oB4pu.png) What am I doing wrong? What can be done to make the calculation faster? Thank you in advance!
