At the risk of being downvoted, I really need the community's input - I am helping put together a post-secondary quality curriculum (vocational school, not university) around open-source languages, specifically JavaScript and maybe some Ruby or PHP. There are some great trade books out there, but things get a little more limited when you need a text book with quizzes and an answer key, for example. I believe this material exists somewhere - is there an online resource or any sort of accreditation body around JavaScript? I realize this may be considered too 'subjective', but I am having a hard time sifting through the mountains of online JavaScript tutorials and trade books.
