I would like to implement an algorithm I have created using a ( _free_ ) CDF document as interface. The idea is:   * The user has to give some input values (maybe through a sort of text box, if possible —a slider would also apply).   * When the user has finished to inform those input values, he/she _starts_ the algorithm (by pressing a sort of button, if that is possible).   * That action makes the algorithm to start computing.   * When the algorithm has finished (that would be a few seconds later), the user can see in the CDF document some numerical results and some plots (that could be interactive, but no matter if they are not). The process is supposed to be transparent and black-boxed to the user. Specifically, _I do not want the user to see the code of the algorithm_ (this is an important point), but only the input boxes and the results. I have been looking into the Internet but I have not been able to find any "getting started" CDF tutorial or something similar. My questions are: (1) Is it possible to build such an app in ( _free_ ) CDF format (provided that the algorithm is already programmed in Mathematica as a series of steps)? (2) Which are some basic places to start learning to create CDF documents, step by step??? **[EDITED 5 aug 2014]** As far as I understand, the most reliable way to create a working free CDF document is embedding all the code within a `Manipulate` interactive command. I wonder if I can sort of _embed_ a quite simple algorithm (several steps starting from some input info and finishing with a numerical and graphical output) within a `Manipulate` sentence. **[EDITED 6 aug 2014]** I've been playing around, and I found that things like this are allowed:               Manipulate[f[x_] := Sin[x]; {Plot[f[x], {x, 0, a}], f[a]}, {a, 1, 50}]      I mean, it works —I can connect several expressions with `;`, and also I can show both graphical and numerical results. I am going to continue trying things, and if I manage to get the results I want, I'll post it as an answer to this question. Of course, any suggestions, help, comments... are still welcomed.
