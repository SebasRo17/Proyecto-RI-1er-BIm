I have quite some experience in software development.   In the initial stages I worked on a really large project, with dozens of projects involved in it, hundreds of large files each with 10s of thousands of lines which has been under development from 2 decades. It was so complex that rather than understanding all the architecture, OO implementation, I just followed my line managers orders. (My first big mistake) And then a year back I joined a rather small company where I have major chunk of development responsibility where I have to do the design and development.   Thru my experience, I am in a position to write code to accomplish any business logic. But I cant make use of all goodies of Object Orientation. Is there a book that is practical oriented with real world examples which helps me understand why and where to use interfaces, polymorphism, inheritance or one that gives good examples on SOLID? Or, since I know how to cut code, is it the design patterns I should be looking for?
