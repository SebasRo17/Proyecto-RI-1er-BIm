I want to find the numbers $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ of the function $y = \dfrac{a x + b}{c x + d}$ so that the triangle $ABC$ with three points $A$, $B$, $C$ have integer coordinates and lies on the graph of the given function, then the centroid of the triangle $ABC$ (have also integer coordinates) is also lies on the graph. I tried               Clear[f, m, n, p];     f[x_] := (a x + b)/(c x + d);     m = {h, k};     n = {e, f};     p = {(m[[1]] + n[[1]] + x)/3, (f[m[[1]]] + f[n[[1]]] + f[x])/3}     Reduce[{p[[2]] == f[p[[1]]], f[h] == k, f[e] == f,      Sequence @@ Thread[0 < {a, b, c, d, e, f, h, k, x} < 10],      a < b < c < d}, {a, b, c, d, e, f, h, k, x}, Integers]      With my code, I get the answer is _False_. Is there a triangle like this?
