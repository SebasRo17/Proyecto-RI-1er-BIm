I had this doubt since a long time , having enclosed in CV the experience or knowledge of technologies that are 'anti' to each other or rivals in real world. For e.g. - A guy having RHCE certification **and** MCSE certification will be preferred or rejected at sight ? In my view - he is having experience of both technologies so I'd prefer this guy `but I've heard that` people with this kind of CV are considered like- they didnt had it in their mind " What they want to do in future, What are their interests " etc etc ...
