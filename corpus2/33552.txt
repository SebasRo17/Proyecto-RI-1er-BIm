It takes a long time to compute the summation below, and I'd like to know if there are alternative ways   to compute things faster. When replacing $15$ by $\infty$, then I should get $3^{1/3}$. I need Mathematica solution   not mathematical solutions (since here I can handle things on my own).               Clear[b, k]     b[0] := 1;     b[k_] := b[k - 1] + 1/(b[k - 1]^2 + b[k - 1] + 1)     N[1/(15)^(1/3) Sum[1/(b[k]^2 + b[k] + 1), {k, 0, 15}]]
