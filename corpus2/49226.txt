I tried to write a bat file which helped me rename files. Command to do this in that file is "ren file1 file2" which is equivalent to RenameFile[file1,file2].               renameFiles[directory_, files_, rename_] :=      Module[{list, i = 1, newfiles},       SetDirectory[directory];       newfiles = ("ren " <> #) & /@ FileNames[files];       list = Table[         " " <> rename <> ToString[i] <> ".png", {i, 1, Length[newfiles]}];       While[i <= Length[newfiles],         newfiles[[i]] = newfiles[[i]] <> list[[i]]; i++];       Return[newfiles]       ]     a = renameFiles["E:\\Download Pictures", ___, "save"]     Export["E:\\Download Pictures\rename.txt", a]      The renameFiles[] has three arguments which take the path, files in that path and name I want to change to respectively, and then convert them into a list "ren file1 file2". Afterwards, I output it as a txt file. I tried to output it as a bat file, however it displays error after I do: `Export["E:\\Download Pictures\rename.bat", a]` Therefore, I attempt to do that in a different way, which renames "rename.txt" afterwards by doing: `RenameFiles["E:\\Download Pictures\rename.txt","E:\\Download Pictures\rename.bat"]` So, now, I have my "rename.bat" file. I try to use `SystemOpen["E:\\Download Pictures\rename.bat"]` to execute it. However, it cannot work well, and I have to do it by clicking the file. My questions are: 1. Sometimes I get the syntax: `OpenWrite::noopen: "Cannot open \!\(\"E:\\\\Download Pictures\\\\nename.txt\"\). "` , how can I fix this? 2\. Is this the only way I can output a bat file. 3\. and, how can I execute via MMA. Thanks a lot!
