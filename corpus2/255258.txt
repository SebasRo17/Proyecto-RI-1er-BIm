I'm trying to build an intelligent action bar _similar_ to the command palette of Sublime Text: ![Sublime Text Command Palette](http://i.stack.imgur.com/yuWSi.png) The Sublime Text command palette allows fuzzy matching of commands in the list (e.g. "ancd vin" will match "Anaconda: Vagrant Init"). That way, it is very easy and very quick to find the wanted action. I'm trying to achieve something similar for the web, the difference is that I have a nested tree of actions available (and some other options), like so (yaml):               new:       name: "New"       choices:         document:           name: "Document"           show_editing_menu: True         template:           name: "Template"           choices:             letter:               name: "Letter"               schema: "template-letter"             spreadsheet:               name: "Spreadsheet"     open:       name: "Open"       choices:         explore:           name: "Explore"         recent:           name: "Recent"      As you can see, I have nested actions available but the final list should look like this for the intelligent-action-bar form to work (this is what I am doing for the moment):               item001:       name: "New"       path: "new"     item002:       name: "New - Document"       show_editing_menu: True       path: "new/document"     item003:       name: "New - Template"       path: "new/template"     item004:       name: "New - Template - Letter"       schema: "template-letter"       path: "new/template/letter"     item005:       name: "New - Template - Spreadsheet"       path: "new/template/spreadsheet"     item006:       name: "Open"       path: "open"     item007:       name: "Open - Explore"       path: "open/explore"     item008       name: "Open - Recent"       path: "open/recent"      For the moment, I'm able to generate a flat list from the original tree but the names are not concatenated:               item001:       name: "New"       path: "new"     item002:       name: "Document"       show_editing_menu: True       path: "new/document"     item003:       name: "Template"       path: "new/template"     item004:       name: "Letter"       schema: "template-letter"       path: "new/template/letter"     item005:       name: "Spreadsheet"       path: "new/template/spreadsheet"     item006:       name: "Open"       path: "open"     item007:       name: "Explore"       path: "open/explore"     item008       name: "Recent"       path: "open/recent"      I will probably manage to concatenate the names into the wanted format in a few more hours. But before fixing this design, I would like to have some external opinions. Having the actions in a tree-like format is very useful for further programming decision making (suggestions depending on parent node, different interface depending on which action/node is selected, settings available inside the decision tree etc.). But is this design maintainable/practical for what I want to achieve ? Do you have other suggestions to have the advantages of the "decision tree" structure and have an easy way to flatten it ? It's my first try at something like this so design suggestions are very welcome. I'm not asking for a library or off-site resource but for design advice. If you have any additional questions, I'll be happy to provide. Thank you very much ! **UPDATE-1** : I've read about action tables but I find it harder to extract the "decision tree" and to maintain. Then, maybe it's best for what I want to achieve but I'm not sure.
