I need to create some surface plots, based on a function that is computationally expensive (a few minutes per point). The function has some branch cuts. The command `Plot3D` does not work because it just takes too long -- never finishes at any acceptable resolution. I can get enough data points (over a day or three), put them in a matrix, and use `ListPlot3D` to produce a plot. But I don't see how to make _Mathematica_ recognize the branch cut and not connect the two sides at the discontinuity.
