I have seen animation, and i can't figure out how to do something like in this video(youtube). I want to discuss how it's made. I don't think that they're using sprites. I have one idea how to do this: for example i want to create animation of "walking" animal (when animal moves, he's legs "runs" moving animation), i should create customView with imageView of animalBody 3 and two imageViews of animal legs 2. Then i make hard coded animation of moving legs and voila, i have custom animation. When i move customView, then i should start animation of legs. But is there better approach to do this?
