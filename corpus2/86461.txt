### TL;DR What are the prospects of writing applications which are completely based on a **REST** database server (CouchDB) and web applications which directly access the DB instead of having a web server in between? * * * I recently started looking up some NoSQL databases. MongoDB seems to be a popular choices. I also liked the project. But I personally liked the REST interface of **CouchDB**. So what I wanted to know is if there was the possibility of applications (maybe cached apps in web browser, a chrome extension etc.) which could just just query the database directly with no requirement of a webserver in between. All the computational logic would reside in the client application and the database will do what it does, **CRUD**. Since mostly (I don't know which doesn't) client frameworks support REST quaries, it could be a good way writing applications well optimized for respective framework. These applications though won't be doing complicated computation, but still provide enough functionality which could replace lots of conventional applications. _Are existing resources and projects which would help me move towards writing such applications and also the scope and moving towards developing in this way?_ _Are their any technical/security issues with this?_ * * * This post will help me decide to look into project like CouchDB (and maybe Dive into Erlang later) or stay with the conventional frameworks (like django) and SQL databases. ### Update A specific point of such apps I had in mind is creation of _offline applications_ just by replicating couchdb data on client.
