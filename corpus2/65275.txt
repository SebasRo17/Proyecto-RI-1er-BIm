I'm searching for an app that is cloning all my commands(mouse and keyboard) to a second window. Especially for Browsers. I'd like to test a web page and want to see the different behavior in two windows(different revisions of the page) directly. For example, in window 1 i click link3 and an a specific url opens. This should be done automatically in the second window. If i enter some formula data this should be cloned either. Is there any application for windows oder linux which serves this desire? i know that there are command line tools which clone commands in one terminal to several others.
