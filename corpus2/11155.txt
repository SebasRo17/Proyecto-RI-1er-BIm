> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Determine whether some expression contains a given symbol Let's say I have some expression:               sample = {1, 1/q, f[m]}      And I want to check it if it has the symbol `m` in it. My question: Is there a clean or fast way of checking if `m` is in the equation? * * * What I came up with so far:               Do[StringFreeQ[ToString[sample], "m"], {i, 300}] // AbsoluteTiming     (* {0.0120007, Null} *)      and               Do[(sample /. m -> Unique[]) === (sample /. m -> Unique[]), {i, 300}] // AbsoluteTiming     (* {0.0100005, Null} *)      These solutions work, but I feel like there might be a faster, functional way of doing this.
