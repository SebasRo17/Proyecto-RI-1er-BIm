Whenever I fill out a survey (especially, but not limited to trade- papers/mags/sites), there’s one question (or any derivation thereof) that always trips me up: > Which industry classification best describes your line of work This is usually followed by a list of things like _Retail_ , _Health_ , _Education_ , _Construction_ , _Manufacturing_ , etc. I can never figure out exactly what industry computer programming falls in. I usually just end up picking either _Manufacturing_ because I suppose in a way, I’m manufacturing something, _Retail_ since in a way, I am producing goods, or else whatever option happens to mention either “computers” or “electronics” (if any). I tried Googling it but came up empty. Does anyone know what the “correct” answer is? What do other programmers enter in these surveys?    * * *    ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YOTmp.png)
