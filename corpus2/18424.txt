Back in 2006, one Joel Spolsky made the following comment: > Watching non-programmers trying to run software companies is like watching > someone who doesn't know how to surf trying to surf. Overall the article is a great read (definitely take the time to read through it). Out of curiosity, **I would like to hear the experiences of folks here** who have seen programmers adopt the mantle and do a great (or rubbish) job, and the same for non-programmers who find themselves herding programmers (worse than herding cats I've heard). In short, what is the concensus of opinion on this matter?
