I was recently rejected for a Junior Web Developer role after a first interview with two members of HR staff. Personally, I think it's crazy that someone who hasn't written a single line of code in their life can make hiring decisions about programmers - the interview was an hour and a half long and they didn't ask a single technical question! However, this is not about opinions. So leaving opinion aside, my questions are:   1. How common is it for hiring decisions to be made by non-technical staff?   2. And more importantly...what can a programmer do to emphasise their skills and make a positive impact in an HR interview?
