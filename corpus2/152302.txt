I am developing instrument driver and I want to know how to calculate checksum of frame. Explanation: > Expressed by characters [0-9] and [A-F]. > > Characters beginning from the character after [STX] and until [ETB] or [ETX] > (including [ETB] or [ETX]) are added in binary. > > The 2-digit numbers, which represent the least significant 8 bits in > hexadecimal code, are converted to ASCII characters [0-9] and [A-F]. > > The most significant digit is stored in CHK1 and the least significant digit > in CHK2. This is sample frame :               <STX>2Q|1|2^1||||20011001153000<CR><ETX><CHK1><CHK2><CR><LF>      and I want to know what is value of chk1 and chk2 and I am new in this so I am totally blank about how to calculate checksum I am not getting above 3rd and 4th point. Can anyone provide sample code for c#?
