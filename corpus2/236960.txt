Is it any good to combine two MVC frameworks together in a project? Is it a fairly common approach? I am thinking about using a serverside framework like **CodeIgniter/Laravel** and client side framework **AngularJS** in a predominantly CRUD based web project. I am a bit apprehensive about this idea. I think this approach does not get the best out of both frameworks and can kind of get in way of each other making the application needlessly complicated. Are there some good approaches/practices if one wants to combine these frameworks together?
