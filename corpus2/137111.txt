Not a job/task schedule, but actual appointment system people can use to create recurring events. It should support many recurrence patterns such as 1st Monday of each month, every Tues/Thurs, a specific date, etc. Everywhere I search I find many example of C# job schedulers but not any appointment systems. I've been programming as a hobby for quite some time but have never tackled an appointment system before (I have attempted a couple times, but gave up and moved on to other things). What are some good websites to find tutorials covering this? Or, are there any good books on the subject?
