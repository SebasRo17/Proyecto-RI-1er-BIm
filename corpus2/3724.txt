I'm currently in a situation where many people on here likely find themselves: I love to program, I do a lot of fun side projects, but it is not my profession. I work as an Electrical Engineering project manager, but at one point I wrote a software application that solved a tricky signal processing problem early in my career. Now the company is creating a product which will include the same functionality I created a while ago. They have asked for my assistance in designing it into the system, and to potentially help program it. My question for the community is: how have you dealt with this type of situation in the past with regards to pay and responsibility? While I would love to program as a full-time job, I am not ready to make a switch into that role. I would be happy to work on this in addition to my job, but I feel this type of specialized work would merit some form of bonus or side contract. I imagine it could also lead to an ongoing support responsibility, but I figure this could be handed off to the normal development team once the design and initial implementation is complete. Would this be an unreasonable request in a typical Fortune500?
