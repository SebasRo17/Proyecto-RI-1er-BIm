I am dealing with a problem that requires the use of both FindInstance and FindRoot nested in a non-trivial way. The result is dependent on some parameter value $t \in [0,1)$, therefore I use               sol[t_]:=FindRoot[...]      For each t, the calculation of the result takes about 2 minutes (for some values of t it's faster, for others slower), resulting in               Plot[sol[t], {t,0,1}]      to take several hours. As I want to do further calculations/plots with $sol$, I learned from a previous question that i can "save" the results obtained by using               sol[t_]:=sol[t]=FindRoot[...]      However, this still requires me to redo the calculations every time I start Mathematica or the kernel dies for some unexpected reason. Is there a way to save/export the results obtained "within" $sol$, such that I can "load" them at the beginning of a session? (I apologize for the vague terms, please let me know if I need to clearify my question).
