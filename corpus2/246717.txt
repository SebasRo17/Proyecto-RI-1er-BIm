I am bidding on a government contract (my first) and there is a section requesting that I provide a high-level outline of a quality control plan that would ensure that the end product is ISO-9001 compliant. I don't know much about ISO 9001 so I am certainly doing my own homework and research on this, but thought I would ask the question here in case there happens to be someone very knowledgeable in the area who could provide 5-10 broad bullet points on which I should focus.
