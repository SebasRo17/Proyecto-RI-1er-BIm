I am in the process of starting a new project with python and Qt. The project starts from zero, and it may become a commercial application. While the programming of the code in itself is a task, another task I have to handle first is how to deploy a proper development layout (makefiles, packaging for release on multiple platforms, and so on). I am looking for an already deployed open-source software with commercial quality from which I can learn the best practices in order to organize a commercial application, or alternatively, a suggestion on good practices on this regard. I did my research and I am still open on this question. I want a decent example to know how this is done in an appropriate way. All the repos I found generally are either made by people who do not care about quality (it's just a bunch of really hacked up scripts) nor platform transferability, nor addressing the different phases (development, testing, deployment, installing). In alternative, they give you fully CI/IDE solutions that are unreachable by a single developer.
