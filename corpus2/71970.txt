I am learning C/C++/Oracle/Unix. I am thinking of developing some application on my own, but I have no Idea what else is required. If you take an example of C++. I have very basic knowledge of it (data types, OOP concepts, vectors, file handling, exception handling, etc). I am not an expert though. I have just read one book about C++ and don't know much about graphics in C++. I went to codeplex.com (an open source website for programming and development) they had some projects in C++ that are looking for developers. Now this looks way beyond my knowledge but I want to buld something. If not, I want to learn more to do it but I have no clue where to begin and what material topics, books to read. There so many things involved with an application: .exe files, .dll files and many more 1) Am I thinking in the right direction? 2) Is it possible to do it alone or be a part of such big open source projects online? What are the things that I need to collect online and study? Please help, if possible please provide the topics, books, websites that might help me to study and proceed to achieve my goal.
