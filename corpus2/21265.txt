Say you need to hire a programmer. You have two candidates at your table: one has studied 5 years at uni (and holds a Master's degree, of course), but has no work experience; and the other holds no university degree but has worked for 5 years. Also assume that they both know the same programming languages, have about the same personality and spend equal amount of time programming on their spare time. If you only had this information to go on, which would you pick?
