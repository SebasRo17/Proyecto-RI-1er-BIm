Is an automation tester supposed to know concepts of OOPS and design patterns to write Tests in a way where changes & code re-use are possible? For example, I pick up Java to write cucumber step definitions that instruct a selenium webdriver. Should I be using a lot of inheritance, interfaces, delegation etc. to make life easier or would that be overly complicated for something that should just line by line instructions?
