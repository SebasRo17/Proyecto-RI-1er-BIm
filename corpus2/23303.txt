I have some data corresponding to real number distances: `{200.04053, 200.232123, 156.3242,...}`, and I would like to bin these values and display them as a histogram where the heights of each bar in the histogram are normalized so that the sum of all the bin heights is equal to one. The objective here is for me to be able to use `FindDistributionParameters` to determine, well, appropriate distribution parameters, and then to overlay the PDF of this suggested distribution on my actual data. Is there an easy way to do this?
