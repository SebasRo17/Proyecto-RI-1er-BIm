I have a multidimensional integration of the form:                 somefunc[t] = NIntegrate[ otherfunc[x, y, z, t ],       {z, z1[t], z2[t]}, {y, y1[t, z], y2[t, z]}, {x, x1[t, z, y], x2[t, z, y]}];      This needs to be evaluated only when $z2 > z1$, $y2 > y1$ and $x2 > x1$. However mathematica still evaluates the integrand backwards even if $y2 < y1$. My question is how to tell `NIntegrate` to simply give 0 in such cases and move on the next integration step. I tried to modify the upper integration boundary as follows:                y2p[t, z] = Max[y1[t, z], y2[t, z]]      But this is not accepted by Mathematica as an integration boundary. How can I fix this?
