I've got this picture: ![JuliaSet](http://i.stack.imgur.com/NLMXG.png) The image has a resolution of 2001x2001. The left most pixel has an x-value of -2, and the right most pixel has an x-value of 2. Same goes for the y-values. Now I am trying to load this image into _Mathematica_ and get it on the right scale inside a graphics environment. I've tried using inset like this:               julia = Import["http://i.stack.imgur.com/NLMXG.png"];     Graphics[{Blue, Rectangle[{-2, -2}, {2, 2}],          Inset[julia, Center, Center, 4]}, PlotRange -> {{-3, 3}, {-3, 3}},        Axes -> True, AxesStyle -> Orange]      ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/m2rhH.png) This still gives a little blue border around some sides, giving me the impression that it is not centered properly. Is there a better way to do this?
