I want to design a software for my musical instrument which is a rhythmic one (there is no melody). All I want these software to do is :   1. make the user able to compose music    2. play what user has composed  for that purpose I need to record diffrent sounds of that instrument and match each sign with the appropriate sound . Which programming language is adequate for this purpose ?
