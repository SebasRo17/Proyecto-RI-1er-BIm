Recently, I've stumbled across question about predicting the output of code which heavily uses post/pre increment operators on integers. I am experienced C programmer, so I felt like at home, but people made statements that Java just blindly copied that from C (or C++), and that this is an useless feature in Java. That being said, I am not able to find good reason for that (especially with keeping in mind the difference betwen post/pre forms) in Java (or C#), because it's not like you will manipulate arrays and use them as strings in Java. Also, it was long ago when I last looked into bytecode, so I don't know if there's a `INC` operation, but I don't see any reason why this               for(int i = 0; i < n; i += 1)      could be less effective than               for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)      Is there any particular part of the language where this is really useful, or is this just a feature to bring C programmers in town?
