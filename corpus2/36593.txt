I am PHP MySQL developer and I am interested in the way television and radio are broadcasted over Internet live. I want to know how it works and and what are its requirements (which package of which programming language offers the best). And please clarify me: Websites are stored in servers. From my desktop, if I want to broadcast some video, then I need to connect to webserver (to upstream the video). Is there an application to do that (or do I have to code that or embed in my web application and which programming language would be suitable (does Python support that))? And I also need a script to handle the upstreamed video or audio (can I do that with PHP)?
