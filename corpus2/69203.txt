I am an ABAP programmer with a knowledge of basic ABAP programming and concepts necessary for a beginer. I want to have a deeper understandings of the subject including the small tips and tricks which will be helpful in times of need; I want to have a systematic structure of the concepts which I can search and learn easily. Is there a book out there that's the de-facto standard for describing best practices, design methodologies, and other helpful information about ABAP programming? What about that book makes it special?
