I have figured out that in a basic project I simply have to call the main package (m file) from the notebook using               <<nameofmfile`       and then the notebook recognizes the functions I defined in the m file and I can use these function in the notebook. Unfortunately when I do the exact same thing in an application project the notebook doesn't recognize the main package (m file). I can't find proper help with this - the Workbench help doesn't seem too useful to me. I have a feeling that this problem occurs because the main package is not in the same folder as the notebook in the case of application projects. Please help!
