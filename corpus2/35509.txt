I have a list of (x,y) values in Mathematica for various discrete x values, as in               intensities={{26, 10}, {27, 289}, {28, 90}, {29, 1079}, {30, 30}, {33, 10}, {39,        179}, {40, 40}, {41, 2269}}      I would now like to insert into this list explicit zeros for each discrete value of x that has a nonexisting y value, as in               intensities2={{0,0},{1,0},{2,0},....,{26,10},{27,289},{28,90},...,{41,2269}}      Out of these I would then like to extract just the y values to be able to do a discrete Forier transform on them. Any thoughts how I could do this most efficiently? cheers & many thanks for any advice! Tom
