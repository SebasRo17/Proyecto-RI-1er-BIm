Question summary: I would like to learn some tips and tricks on how to **prove** inequalities with _Mathematica_. I'm studying various inequalities in triangle that have the form $R+ar + bs\geq 0$, where $R$ is a circumcircle radius, $r$ is an incircle radius and $s$ is a semiperimeter of a triangle.               ClearAll[R, r, s, isTriangle];     R[x_, y_, z_] := (      x y z)/Sqrt[(x + y - z) (x - y + z) (-x + y + z) (x + y + z)];     r[x_, y_, z_] :=        1/2 Sqrt[((x + y - z) (x - y + z) (-x + y + z))/(x + y + z)];     s[x_, y_, z_] := (x + y + z)/2;     isTriangle := 1 >= x > 0 && 1 >= y > 0 && x + y > 1;      I normalize the longest side $z=1$ to simplify the calculation. `isTriangle` is a condition that there is a triangle with sides $1,x,y$. I want to prove the following inequalities: $s-3\sqrt{3}r\geq0$ and $-\frac s2+(-2+3\sqrt{3}/2)r+R\geq 0$ for all triangles. I can easily _check_ that both inequalities are true with the following code:               FindMinimum[{s[1, x, y] - 3 Sqrt[3] r[1, x, y], isTriangle}, {x, y}]      (returns `{1.26714*10^-6, {x -> 0.998875, y -> 0.998875}}`), i.e. the minimum is $0$);               Resolve[ForAll[{x, y}, isTriangle,        s[1, x, y] - 3 Sqrt[3] r[1, x, y] >= 0]]     (* True *)      (checks that inequality holds for all triangles);               FindMinimum[{-s[1, x, y]/2 + (-2 + 3 Sqrt[3]/2) r[1, x, y] +         R[1, x, y], isTriangle}, {x, y}]      (returns `{9.01882*10^-7, {x -> 0.996601, y -> 0.996601}}`, i.e. the minimum is $0$);               Resolve[ForAll[{x, y},        isTriangle, -s[1, x, y]/2 + (-2 + 3 Sqrt[3]/2) r[1, x, y] +          R[1, x, y] >= 0]]     (* True *)      (checks that inequality holds for all triangles, but takes some time). However, I want to find a way to **prove** them, e.g. so that a human who doesn't trust _Mathematica_ can check that they are always true. I would appreciate some _general_ tips and tricks; e.g. it may be possible to find proves for these particular examples, but I would like to know some (heuristic) methods that could work for some other inequalities, too. Thanks you very much for your time!
