I am looking for a free (as in beer) combination of services, for **learning** "cloud SW development" and very small scale private use (say, a private streamlined web shopping&todo list with simple auth). The combination should include the full set of needed services:   * DVCS service (like github)   * A cloud service to run the backend code   * A suitable data storage service (preferably not SQL), accessed by the backend (if not included in the backend service)   * A web service, serving the web pages seen by user, to access the backend functionality   * A "cloud IDE" (ideally one, two is ok too) for both backend and HTML/javascript coding   * If (backend) deployment uses some CI, then that Other points:   * Backend programming language can be anything, except VB or PHP   * Everything has to be in the cloud, nothing permanent on a local PC (graphics is not part of the question)   * Looking for ready-to-use service combination, not a virtual server where I can set anything up myself   * I don't care if service insists on displaying ads in the user web UI   * "Cheap" and "free trial" are ok too, if "free" does not exist   * As per example use case, storage, CPU and bandwidth quota requirements are negligible Google finds several services of course, all requiring at least registration before testing, so I'm looking for a known-good _combination_ , so ideal answer starts with "I use this service combo: ...", contains links to services and brief description and personal experiences.
