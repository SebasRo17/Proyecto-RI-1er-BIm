I do not understand this sentence from the Wikipedia article on the Dangling Else problem: > [The Dangling Else problem] is a problem that often comes up in compiler > construction, especially scannerless parsing. Can someone explain to me how scannerless parsing techniques might exacerbate this problem? It seems to me that the problem is with the grammar -- since it's ambiguous -- not with the choice of parsing technique. What am I missing?
