I have this line of code (a one-liner to import the Abaqus dispalcements!)               displacements =       DeleteCases[        ImportString[         StringCases[fileStr,            RegularExpression[             "------------------------------\n([.\\s\\S]*)Minimum"] -> \     {"$1"}][[1, 1]], "Table"], {}][[       All, {1, 3, 4}]];(* drop the 2nd column = U.Magnitude *)      This line gives a trouble in the auto-intendation when sometimes the * ) in the RegularExpression matches with an opening (* somewhere earlier. One solution to correct the wrong formatting (I know) is to delete the *) and retype it. Anyone else faces such trouble in the front-end? Any way to avoid it? I am on M8
