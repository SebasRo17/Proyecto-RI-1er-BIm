I started my first professional project recently and have hired a web designer to do the layout. My question is how can I sync the work with the designer? Currently our process goes like this:   1. the designer creates a template   2. sends it to me by mail   3. I view, edit & agree   4. the designer codes the html and sends it to me back by mail and so on for each page The problem is, sometimes I get very disappointing html and am forced to have the designer redo alot of work. Is there a way to create a network so that I can monitor his work and provide comments while the work is on-going? I know this is a silly question but I am sure a mechanism for this must exist. :D
