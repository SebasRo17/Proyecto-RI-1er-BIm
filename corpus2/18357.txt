This is a specific question relating to C#. However, it can be extrapolated to other languages too. While one is preparing for an interview of a C# Developer (ASP.NET or WinForms or ), what would be the typical reference material that one should look at? Are there any good books/interview question collections that one should look at so that they can be better prepared? This is just to know the different scenarios. For example, I might be writing SQL Stored Procedures and Queries, but I might stumble when asked suddenly Given an Employee Table with the following column(s). EmployeeId, EmployeeName, ManagerId Write a SQL Query which will get me the Name of Employee and Manager Name? NOTE: I am not asking for a Question Bank so that I can learn by rote what the questions are and reproduce them (which, obviously will NOT work!)
