New to C++! So I was reading this: http://www.learncpp.com/cpp- tutorial/110-a-first-look-at-the-preprocessor/ > **Header guards** > > Because header files can include other header files, it is possible to end > up in the situation where a header file gets included multiple times. So we make preprocessor directives to avoid this. But I'm not sure - why can't the compiler just... **not** import the same thing twice? Given that header guards are optional (but apparently a good practice), it almost makes me think that there are scenarios when you do want to import something twice. Although I can't think of any such scenario at all. Any ideas?
