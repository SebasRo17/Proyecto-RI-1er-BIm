Consider the situation with this functions,                F[mm_, q_] :=  NIntegrate[(q/2) * (x Tanh[π x]) *( ( (Coth[π q Sqrt[x^2 + mm] ]                                 )/Sqrt[ x^2 + mm] - Coth[π x])/x,                     {x, 0, ∞}] + (1/2) Tan[Sqrt[mm] π ]   ;          Plot[ F[mm, 2], {mm, 0, 1}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mGvpo.png) Looking at the graph it is clear that the function has roots in the range of $mm \in [0,1]$. But I am unable to use any of the root finding commands to get those numbers! Why are they not working here? * * * Also what are those vertical lines that the Mathematica is plotting here?
