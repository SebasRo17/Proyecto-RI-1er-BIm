While many higher level languages have bitwise (exclusive or) and bitwise (exclusive and), for instance C, C++, Java, etc. I'm curious why the ( _vastly more useful_ ) logical short-circuit operators don't have this functionality? Is it simply due to the capacity of being able to concatenate logic through use of "not"? This question is mainly to do with the language design considerations....
