So I was reading about Java Convolve and someone said that it may be faster than the MMX / SSE implementation. In it one of the comments had a kernal array and said it was seperable.   1. What is a seperable kernel? How is this useful for image processing?   2. What is MMX/SSE? The wikipedia page lists them as instruction sets. Are they specificially designed for image processing?   3. How would you transmit a MMX/SSE format (I assume) data set through TCP? Thanks.
