We have written an application that spawns at least 9 parallel processes. All processes generate a lot of logging information. Currently we are using Pythons QueueHandler to consolidate all logs into one file. Unfortunately this sometimes results in very messy files which make them hard to read (e.g. Track what exactly is going on in one thread). Do you think it is a viable option to separate all messages into dedicated files, or is this going to make things even more messy due to the high number of files? What are your general experiences when writing log files for multiprocessed/multithreaded applications?
