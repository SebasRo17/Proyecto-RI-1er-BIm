I'm building a simple RESTful API for a web-based application I'm working on, and I'm wondering about the best way to go about exposing my domain models. Let's say I have a User class and I want to provide a JSON response with the various user properties. I obviously don't want to publicly expose every property of my model (things such as DateCreated, PasswordHash etc) due to security and bandwidth issues. I've read into Data Transfer Objects and I'm wondering if this is the way to go. If I'm right I could pass, for example, a User model to my User DTO and ensure said DTO only allows exposure of the User properties I choose (which would also help decouple my models from my public API). Is this solution appropriate or are there better ways to go about this? Thanks.
