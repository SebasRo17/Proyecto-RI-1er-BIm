I wrote a comparator for a custom class of mine and when I ran my code I realised the output of my list of these objects was in the reverse order as to what I wanted. It was "ascending" as opposed to "descending". This was because I stuck to the spec of compare where a return value of less than 0 means the other object is less than this and so on. To fix this I called the reverse method on my list, but I could've also changed the compare method so that it returns greater than 0 where the other object is less than this. What is seen as the standard for this case and why?
