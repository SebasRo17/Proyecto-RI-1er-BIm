I am considering a project using _Mathematica_ and openCL. I know that the openCL C source code can be tracked. Has anyone used a versioning site or software so multiple developers can modify a common notebook? Is it possible to:   * check out a notebook non-exclusively?   * check out a notebook exclusively?   * change the notebook?   * merge a notebook locally?   * check in a notebook?
