I have a model which accepts several input parameters and now I want to study the sensitivity to certain parameters as described in here: Cross Validated Answer and in Wikipedia. There is also a link to Matlab routines. Now I'm looking for something like this for Mathematica but only found something for the SystemModeler. Is there a package or build-in function for   * Global Sensitivity Analysis    * Local Sensitivity Analysis    * Screening (Morris)
