I am using redmine for project management and issue tracking. I was looking at the database tables and the underlying structure and was wondering if anyone who is experienced with database architecture can comment on the structure. I am concerned that once there are many users and hundreds (or thousands) of projects (each project containing many issues, with each issue containing many messages, etc.), the database structure could possibly turn out to be a weak point. How is the performance impacted by this design? I would like to hear about the Pros/cons of how the tables are laid out and how the data is separated or normalized, and whether or not it might be worth re-structuring. What would be the benefits of separating the data out to more tables (with less columns per table)
