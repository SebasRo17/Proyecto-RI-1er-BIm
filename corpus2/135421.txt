I have programmed for a few years in php and now I'm going to learn zend framwork. Zend is very popular and there are a lot of tutorials, books and documentation out there. But I saw in the last months that there is a second version of Zend, but it's not so used and popular, not yet. I think it is better to start with a new version, but I don't know what to do now, as when I see job offers many people require the first version. Which version do you suggest me?
