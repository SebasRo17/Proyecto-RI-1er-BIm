I'm developing a telecom messaging platform in C, and I'm going to need multiple processes to be working with MySQL DB. How can I make two processes read/write to/from a Mysql DB and, if/when one of them goes down, get the other to seamlessly take over the work until the dead process gets back to work? I was thinking/googling some options and am stuck in place where I don't know which one to choose. What I think so far is that table lock is not the best option to go for, as it will stall the other process until the table is unlocked. The other option is to use row-level locks or manual locks, but I can't find the best way to do it.
