I'm trying to understand constructor chaining better. I understand that this technique can be used to reduce code duplication for initialization of a class object and I also understand the order in which they're executed. I found the following example and I cannot see clearly what the benefits are in the code? And whether it's necessary? I don't understand why both constructors have '`this`' keyword in them, would calling either constructor (and passing in relevant parameters) have the same result?               //Constructors     public MyClass(double distance, double angle) : this(distance, angle, 0)      {     }          public MyClass(double distance, double angle, double altitude) : this()     {     Distance = distance;     Angle = angle;     Altitude = altitude;     }
