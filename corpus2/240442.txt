I'm currently making a game and want to use some textfiles (lists of names) that are covered under the GNU General Public License (or the Attribution- ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License). Do I have to release my whole game under one of these licenses if I only used these (relatively small) files in my game or is it just these files I have to keep licensed like that? If this is not permitted am I allowed to do this anyway if I choose not to actually release my code and only "hosted" this game, since it's a web game.
