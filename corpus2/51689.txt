I am given a system first order differential equations: $x'=y$ and $y'=6x^2-a/2$, where $a$ is a constant and $'$ denotes $t$-derivatives. I then make the substitution $(x,y)=(x_1y_1,y_1)$. This implies that $x_1=\frac{x}{y}$ and $y_1=y$. The $t$-derivatives are $$x_{1}'=\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)'=\frac{yx'-xy'}{y^2}=1-x_{1}y_{1}^{-1}(6x_{1}^2y_{1}^2-a/2)$$ and $$y_{1}'=6x_{1}^2y_{1}^2-a/2.$$ I need to continue in this fashion, that is, in the next step, for example, we let $(x_{1},y_{1})=(x_{2}y_{2},y_{2})$ and then find $x_{2}'$, $y_{2}'$, etc. Is there a way I can compute the derivatives in Mathematica? For instance, how would I find $x_{1}'$ in Mathematica. Thanks, Radz.
