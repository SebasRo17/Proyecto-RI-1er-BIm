I'm a beginner programmer and all I've worked with so far are console applications in C++. Coding wise, how is the graphical side of programs created? I understand the logic that I am using from console apps will be the same, but how do programmers create the graphics that this logic is then used in? I know this is sort of an ambiguous question but basically I am trying to understand how I would go about creating a program that is not a console application, such as a video game or an iPhone application.
