In my PHP web page (index.php), I have a simple script that calls a "page" class, and then builds the page from it. Index.php executes methods within an instance of the 'page' class, such as "add_to_body("bla bla bla")". It can then call a "build()" method, where the page class will return a string with the user input and some other HTML elements pre-added in, that index.php can echo. Essentially the page class is a template of sorts. I'm trying to have some kind of MVC hierarchy here (I'm a student learning about programming 'best practices' in my own time), my question is: would 'index.php' be a view? Or, would the instance of the page class be the view (as it constructs the page, but it doesn't actually show it, it returns a string), or: would the 'page' class be a controller? Also, is a view 'allowed' to talk to (eg: get data from) a controller (for example: by calling a method that controller owns)? Many thanks for your help!
