The web world is flooded with CMSes. Some tout their CMS as Web Development Framework. Some say it as Content Management Solution and nowadays i m hearing Content Management Framerowk. When we hear "Framework", it sort of sounds like more complex and sophisticated. Is there any specific difference between these two i.e. CMS and Web Development Framework? Or Is it that a Web Development Framework can be a CMS and vice versa? Thanks
