I saw this question posted on Slashdot and thought it would make a great question here on Programmers.SE. _It's not my question, nor my situation._ Here goes: > "As a senior developer for a small IT company based in the UK that is about > to release their flagship project, I know that if I were to leave the > company now, it would cause them some very big problems. I'm currently > training the other two 'junior' developers, trying to bring them up to speed > with our products.

Usually, I would never have > considered leaving at such a crucial time; I've been at the company for > several years and consider many of my colleagues, including higher > management, to be friends.

This would make a massive > difference to my life. That said, I can't help but feel that to leave now > would be betraying my friends and colleagues. Some friends have told me that > I'm just being 'soft' – however I think I'm being loyal. Any advice?" What are your thoughts on this Anonymous Slashdotter's situation?
