When doing a `RegionPlot`and then exporting (or saving from the front end) as PDF or EPS, there are small white lines in the filling of the region. Here's an example created with `RegionPlot[x^2+y^2<1,{x,-1,1},{y,-1,1},PlotStyle->Black]`:   ![output of RegionPlot after saving as EPS](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FBLyv.png) Is there any way to prevent those white lines while keeping it vector graphics? Note that those lines do _not_ appear on screen, only in the exported file. Also note that my actual graphics is more complex and especially has several different-coloured regions.
