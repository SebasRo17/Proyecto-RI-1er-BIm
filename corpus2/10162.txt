I am wondering if there is a way to restrict the motion of the rotate mouse cursor in when moving around a 3d plot. For example, I want the y direction of the cursor to correspond to pulling the z axis toward or away from me (the camera), and the x direction to rotate the graphic around the z axis. I can do something similar using,               Manipulate[      Graphics3D[{Sphere[{1, 0, 0}, 0.05], Sphere[{0, 0, 0}, 0.2],      {Arrow[{{0, 0, 0}, {1.1, 0, 0}}], Text["x", {1.2, 0, 0}],        Arrow[{{0, 0, 0}, {0, 1.1, 0}}], Text["y", {0, 1.2, 0}],       Arrow[{{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 1.1}}], Text["z", {0, 0, 1.2}]}},      ViewVector -> {40 {Cos[a] Sin[b], Sin[a] Sin[b], Cos[b]}, {0, 0, 0}},      ViewAngle -> 4 Degree ,     SphericalRegion -> True,     Boxed -> False     ],     {{a, 0.3}, -2 \[Pi], 2 \[Pi]},     {{b, 1.347}, -2 \[Pi], 2 \[Pi]}     ]      where sliding $a$ rotates the graphic around the z axis (or rather the viewpoint) and sliding $b$ pulls the z axis in or out. # Edit to make description clearer The 3 dimensional ViewVector seems to be changed somehow by the 2 dimensional "double arrow Rotation" cursor when clicking and dragging on the plot. I am not even sure how this is possible, but is it possible to restrict it so that only 2 of the 3 Euler angles (e.g. rotation about the z axis and inclination of the x-y plane) are changed? The third Euler angle is natively controlled by the "additional rotation" cursor, which is available when you put the cursor in the corner.
