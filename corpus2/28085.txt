Based on this description of 3D graphics and the associated Wolfram Training video, I anticipated that using the mouse to rotate the graphic below would rotate around the point where the three cylinders intersect:               axis = {EdgeForm[], Specularity[White, 10],        FaceForm[Red], Cylinder[{{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, .5}}, 0.01],        FaceForm[Blue], Cylinder[{{0, 0, 0}, {0, .5, 0}}, 0.01],        FaceForm[Green], Cylinder[{{0, 0, 0}, {.5, 0, 0}}, 0.01]        };     Graphics3D[axis, Boxed -> True, ViewCenter -> {0, 0, 0},       RotationAction -> "Clip", ViewAngle -> 65 Degree]      So far so good. When I make a slight adjustment to the graphic, though, the (for lack of a better term) swivel point has moved to what appears to be {-0.5,-0.5,-0.5}.               Graphics3D[{axis, Opacity[0.5], Sphere[{0, 0, 0}, 0.5]},       ViewCenter -> {0, 0, 0}, RotationAction -> "Clip",       ViewAngle -> 65 Degree]      Can someone enlighten me as to my misinterpretation of `ViewCenter` and how I can get the second object to rotate around {0,0,0} when using the mouse?
