When exporting a 3D plot to PDF my viewer takes quite long to render the PDF, which especially makes for a very bad scrolling experience. I've also tried exporting as EPS, but that seems to be much worse, especially when trying to load the generated files in Illustrator (a simple graph took a minute to load and Illustrator needed 5Gb of memory for it...). I don't really want to include the graphics as rasterized images in my thesis :(
