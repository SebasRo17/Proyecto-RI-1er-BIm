Just like the question asks, is there a need to add Debug.Assert into your code if you are writing unit tests (which has its own assertions)? I could see that this might make the code more obvious without having to go into the tests, however it just seems that you might end up with duplicated asserts. It seems to me that `Debug.Assert` was helpful before unit-testing became more prevalent, but is now unnecessary. Or, am I not thinking of some use case?
