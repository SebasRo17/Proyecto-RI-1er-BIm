I have some problems in my hand and would like to resolve them by myself (rather than hiring some professional, obviously due to cash problem!):   1. build a really good website (planning to set-up my own start-up).   2. build some good software (preferrably with exe installation files) on many mathematical and statistical techniques. To accomplish those tasks, is it worth to learn Python in advance level? I have advanced programming experiences with R and Matlab and VBA (and some sort of C), however not anything on Python. Be very grateful if experts put some guidance here. Thanks for your time.
