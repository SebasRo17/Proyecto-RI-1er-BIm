I understand that the hierarchy, in cppcms for templates, goes skin (topmost, representing a namespace), then view (representing a class) and finally template (representing a function). I want to know when I should use a skin and when I should use a view; would each page be a skin or would it be a skin per application, etc. Could you explain when each should be used and could you give some examples?
