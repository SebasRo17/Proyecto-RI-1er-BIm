I am developing a game in JavaScript where you start with a user input, stored in the variable "controller". The options for the user consists of start to start the game or about to learn about the game. I was going to use the following code               if(controller === "start"){         // Game code sitting here     }     else if(controller === "about"){         // All about the Game     }     else{         // Tells the user again to type start to start or about to learn about the game     }      when I realized that I should maybe use switch cases instead... So, my question is when to use switch cases instead of if statements and which I should use in this case. I would also like to know if you think I should store my game code in a function and call it if controller is equal to "start" or just have it sitting inside the if statement/switch case as it is atm?
