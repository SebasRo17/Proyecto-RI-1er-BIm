I am an iOS developer. I love objective-c and the cocoa/cocoa-touch framework. I was wondering what's a programming language/ framework for server side programming that best mimics or closely resembles objective-c and the cocoa framework? I have never programmed server side apps before so that's why I am asking. Here's a list of languages/frameworks that I have heard about that might be close to cocoa.               Ruby - Ruby on Rails     PHP - not sure which fw     Python - Djano      Thanks
