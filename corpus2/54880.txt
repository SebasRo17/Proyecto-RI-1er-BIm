It seems that the keyboard shortcuts for enlarging/reducing the font size (ALT+= / ALT+-) don't work anymore in M10 as it did in M9. If I select the text (or code) **inside** a cell they work. But if I select **a cell or more cells** they don't do nothing anymore. The only way to change the font size of some cells is now to go through the _Format-Size_ menu. With M9 I used these shortcuts very often to gradually adjust the font size of one or more cells. Maybe there is some setting in the Option Inspector that I must change? (I'm on windows 8.1 64bit)
