Evaluating this expression seems to cause Mathematica to beep and quit the kernel:               Plot3D[Exp[Sqrt[x^2]] - Exp[-Sqrt[x^2]], {x, y} \[Element] ImplicitRegion[-5 <= x <= 5 && -5 <= y <= 5 , {x, y}]]      I am running Mathematica 10.0.0 on MacOS 10.9.4. Is this a known issue? Interestingly, plotting only one of the exponentials rather than their difference does not produce any problems.
