This might not be _Mathematica_ specific question but if there is anyone who can use Emacs keybind on Ubuntu Linux, would you share how you realize it? I'm using _Mathematica_ student edition both on Mac OS X (10.7.3) and Ubuntu (11.10), and Mac version allows basic Emacs keybind (`Ctrl`+`a`, `Ctrl`+`e`, `Ctrl`+`d`, `Ctrl`+`f`, `Ctrl`+`b`, etc.) In general, GUI programs on my Ubuntu doesn't allow Emacs keybind unless explicitly configured per program, so as I said I might have to look for general solution for Ubuntu/Linux. But I welcome whatever the solution to realise the keybind. * * * _Update:_ Thanks to @sebhofer's answer, I manage to comfortably use Emacs keybind on Ubuntu. I had to modify both `MenuSetup.tr` and `KeyEventTranslations.tr` to enable my preferred keybind. As a reference for other people who may want to enable Emacs keybind, I'm sharing those 2 files here: http://goo.gl/nJaXD and http://goo.gl/gZWS5, which allow following keybinds:               C-v "ScrollPageDown"     C-d "DeleteNext"     C-h "DeletePrevious"     C-p "MovePreviousLine"     C-n "MoveNextLine     C-b "MovePrevious"     C-f "MoveNext"     C-t "MoveNextWord"     C-i "MovePreviousWord"     C-e "MoveLineEnd"     C-a "MoveLineBeginning"      Some of the above might not be the standard Emacs keys. Also, more importantly, some default keybinds that use `alt` might not work due to the change (I haven't tested thoroughly). You can customize by modifying those `.tr` files.
