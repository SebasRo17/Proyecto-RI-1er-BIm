So I have installed all FeynArts folders (from 3.5 to 3.7) with FeynCalc 8.0.1., and none of it is working properly :\ First I load the path to specific FeynArts package (3.5 for instance), then, by:               << HighEnergyPhysics`FeynCalc`;      I load FeynCalc, and he says               Loading FeynCalc from C:\Users\*****\AppData\Roaming\Mathematica\Applications\HighEnergyPhysics     FeynCalc 8.1.0 For help, type ?FeynCalc, open FeynCalcRef8.nb or visit www.feyncalc.org     Loading FeynArts, see www.feynarts.de for documentation     FeynArts 3.5 patched for use with FeynCalc      So everything seems nice, right? Wrong! I even load FeynArts package, and no errors. But when I want to initialize the proper model I get:               In[9]:= InitializeModel[SM]          During evaluation of In[9]:=           During evaluation of In[9]:= loading generic model file C:\Users\*****\AppData\Roaming\Mathematica\Applications\HighEnergyPhysics\FeynArts-3.5\Models\Lorentz.gen          During evaluation of In[9]:= TagSetDelayed::tagnf: Tag FourVector not found in \!     \(TraditionalForm\`\(-\(TraditionalForm\`mom_\)\^\(TraditionalForm\`\(TraditionalForm\`\(Pattern[\(\(mu___, _\)\)]\)\)\)\)\)     . >>          During evaluation of In[9]:= Pattern::patvar: First element in pattern Pattern[b_,_] is not a valid pattern name. >>          During evaluation of In[9]:= Pattern::patvar: First element in pattern Pattern[b_,_] is not a valid pattern name. >>          Out[9]= $Aborted      And I can't do anything! I can plot topology, but I can't insert fields. I've been doing everything by the book :\ What seems to be wrong? :\
