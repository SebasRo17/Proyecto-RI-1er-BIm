I have been listening to Scott Hanselman and Rob Conery's podcast, This Developer's Life. In the latest episode, they discuss personality traits: > 1.0.4 - Being Mean. > > What makes people mean in our industry? What about aggressive? Confident? > What's the difference? Would you rather have a drill sergeant for a boss, or > a zen master? We talk to Cyra Richardson and Giles Bowkett. It got me thinking, what traits did the best managers _you've_ worked for have in common? EDIT: Just to clarify, as there have been a few close votes, I'm interested in whether there are traits common to managers of developers that are not necessarily those traits that a manager of some other profession requires. As for whether this is programming related or not, well I don't want to ask this question on a site that isn't about programming because, frankly, I'm not as interested in what people who make cans of soup for a living want from their managers as I am interested in what _developers_ want from their managers.
