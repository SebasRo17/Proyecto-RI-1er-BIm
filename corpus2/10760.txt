I have a set of 1500 data points (which are some energy eigenvalues) corresponding to a parameter H0 (which represents magnetic field. H0 values are equispaced going from $-3.0$ to $3.0$ in steps of $0.005$. Please note that the energy eigenvalues are not exact and they have experimental error in them. What I am trying to do is first plot those data points in _Mathematica_. I have found the command `ListLinePlot[{{x1, y1}, {x2, y2}, ...}]`. However, feeding such a huge set of data points consumes a lot of time. So is there any other way out? For example, importing the data file from Fortran. I have used the command `Import["file", "table"]` where "file" is a Fortran data file. But it is giving the error message "File not found during import". Then I would like to find the second derivative of the plot. Accurate evaluation of second derivative is very crucial for my purpose. I have done the plot using "gnuplot" and then found the first derivative of the plot using the central difference formula: $\frac{f(x+h)-f(x-h)}{2h}$. Here $h = 0.005$. Then I evaluated the first derivative of the latter plot using the same formula to get the second derivative plot. I am getting the plot but not the desired result (a peak is to be obtained near a value of H0, pre-calculated). In other words, I am getting a disagreement between theoretical and numerical values of H0. The eigenvalue evaluation is OK I think because I have checked it both in _Mathematica_ and Fortran. Maybe something is going wrong in the second derivative evaluation. Kindly advise how to carry out numerical differentiation from a set of data points in _Mathematica_.
