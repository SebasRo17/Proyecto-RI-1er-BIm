All the examples in the Mathematica documentation specify that the syntax for the `GroebnerBasis` command is               GroebnerBasis[{poly1,poly2,...},{x1,x2,...}]      however it does return a result when ran just as               GroebnerBasis[{poly1,poly2,...}]      (although it does put a red caret in at the end, indicating it is missing an expected second parameter). I assume that, in this case, `GroebnerBasis` makes some choice for the variables. My intuition was that it would be `GroebnerBasis[polys] == GroebnerBasis[polys, Variables[polys]]`, but that does not seem to be the case. What is the behavior of the `GroebnerBasis` command without a variable specification?
