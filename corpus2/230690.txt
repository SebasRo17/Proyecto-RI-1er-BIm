I have the following sort of directory structure:               part1         build         src     part2         build         src      Now I have a header file that I would like to include in both parts of these projects, it will contain constants and some macro definitions as well as some utility functions, and I want these to be synchronized between the two parts. What would be the generally acceptable way to format my directory structure? Something like so?               part1         build         src     part2         build         src     share         src      and set up my make files in the `build` directories to also look in `../../share/src` Or is there a more "correct" way of doing this?
