I understand the advantages of using markdown in local text files, and then taking those files and generating HTML. This is great for documentation, readme's in git repositories and posts for static site generators. It is very simple to create markdown syntax in any text editor, it's human readable, and you can create HTML from markdown relatively easily. What I don't understand, is the advantages of using a wysiwyg editor for markdown in web applications, especially those that use a database server. (non-flat-file). I thought the whole point of using markdown was to remove the need for a wysiwyg editor. What is the advantage of using a markdown wysiwyg editor over an editor that just outputs HTML (avoiding the overhead of converting markdown to HTML in the process)? **clarification:** basically I'm looking for technical advantages to having a WYSIWYG editor output markdown instead of HTML. To the end user the text form will look the same, so it's only dealing with markdown/html in the backend of an application. Anchor CMS sorta does this, and I'm wondering if there is an advantage over just plain HTML output.
