I am writing Portfolio module for my web site and it has 3 components. Gallery Category, Gallery, & Gallery Images.   I am doing all the request handling, (creating, reading, updating, other), for the above 3 components in 1 class, Portfolio.   DB handling jobs for Portfolio module is done in another file.   My question is, even just for request handling purpose, can you do all the operations in 1 class? -Reddy
