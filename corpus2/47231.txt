During rather long computation I have intermediate steps `Print`ed with useful information which should be collected for possible use in future inside of the evaluation `Notebook`. When the computation is finished the final results are printed. But there are hundreds of intermediate `Print`s which fill the screen and contain supporting information which is interesting to see during computation but impede reading the final results. I wish to have an ability to collapse the intermediate prints in a `CellGroup`. Here is an example from the Documentation page for `EvaluationMonitor`:               FindRoot[x^2 - 2, {x, 1},       EvaluationMonitor :> Print["x = ", x " x^2 - 2 =", x^2 - 2]]      After evaluation of the above we get intermediate results in one collapsable `CellGroup` (note the collapsed cell group selected on the right): ![screenshot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Gy1Ti.png) My problem is that my computation involves several cycles with intermediate evaluations and I am forced to `Print` the final results after a cycle is finished. So all the prints by default belong to one cell group. It can be simulated as follows:               Do[Print@FindRoot[x^a - 2, {x, 1},         EvaluationMonitor :> Print["x = ", x , ", x^", a, " - 2 = ", x^a - 2]], {a, 1, 3}]      How is it possible to have intermediate prints grouped together and collapsable?
