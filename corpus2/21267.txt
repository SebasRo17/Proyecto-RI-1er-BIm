This was an interview question I got asked. As a software developer I work on whatever task is assigned to me, sometimes it's a GUI component requiring me to add a new dialog box, or change the existing GUI, other times it's a business logic that I need to add/modify, or a new interface required to expose some 3rd party library's functionality - so when I asked this question in an interview, how should I answer it? What exactly are they looking for?
