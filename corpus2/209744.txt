We have been using sharePoint server 2013 to build out intranet web application including, discussion forum, wiki library, calendars, announcements ,etc. Now a new requirement has been raised from the management that we want to build a new external web site for our company, including the following main sections; contact us , about us, services, our team member, our customers, etc. at this stage I am trying to find the best tool that we can use to build our website. Either using SharePoint 2013 or WordPress. So can anyone advices on what are the advantages and disadvantages of each tool? Regards
