I have a MySQL database that I connect to using Mathematica and would like to distribute my Mathematica code to others. We already have ODBC DSNs setup on peoples machines using the MySQL ODBC connector. I've done a similar thing before in R using RODBC. I attempted to use this;               Needs["DatabaseLink`"];     JDBCDrivers["ODBC(DSN)"]     conn = OpenSQLConnection[JDBC["ODBC(DSN)", "DatabaseName"]];      Which looked like it was going to work but after reading the documentation it seems that it uses a JDBC-ODBC bridge which I can't assume people have installed. My question is can Mathematica use a ODBC connection (without a bridge) and if so how? If I have to use a JDBC connection then that's fine but I want to make sure that I'm not missing something.
