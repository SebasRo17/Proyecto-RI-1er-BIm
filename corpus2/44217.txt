I am trying to plot 2 data sets with ListLinePlot and my problem is that no graph shows up. When I plot a single data set i.e. `ListLinePlot[Aluminium]` it looks great, like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/L4rSN.jpg) But when I try to plot **two** data sets with `ListLinePlot[{Aluminium, Steel}]` I just get axis: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/blQXr.jpg) I'm new to Mathematica and I'm not sure how it interprets the data but here's a sample of a single data set: > {{{-0.00396837, 0.00690848}, {-0.00396786, 0.00696155}, {-0.0039628, > 0.00775434}, {-0.00394408, 0.0105445}, {-0.00392182, 0.0141262}, > {-0.00390765, 0.0165268}, {-0.00389855, 0.0180618}, {-0.00389247, 0.019202}, > {-0.0038864, 0.0203702}}} and a second data set: > {{{-0.0343947, 0.006893}, {-0.0343942, 0.00694899}, {-0.0343897, > 0.00805173}, {-0.0343755, 0.0114375}, {-0.0343644, 0.0144129}, {-0.0343553, > 0.0165506}, {-0.0343477, 0.0177545}, {-0.0343401, 0.0187138}, {-0.0343345, > 0.0196253}, {-0.034329, 0.0209271}, {-0.0343239, 0.0220682}, {-0.0343193, > 0.0230841}, {-0.0343153, 0.0240036}, {-0.0343123, 0.024847}, {-0.0343092, > 0.0257369}, {-0.0343057, 0.0266416}, {-0.0343021, 0.0275453}, {-0.0342986, > 0.0284322}, {-0.0342956, 0.0293173}}}
