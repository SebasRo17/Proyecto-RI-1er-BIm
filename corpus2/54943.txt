I used DSolve on a differential equation e got the following result: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mBcY0.png) You may notice that C[ 1 ] is a function of the variables r and z in a defined form. If I substitute this result in my differential equation, it is the solution - nice. Now I can plug this in my other differential equation to build a differential equation in C[ 1 ]: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5MZFd.png) The question is, how can I use DSolve on this? If I do: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/lNKAA.png) I get: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8bgoe.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ifEEc.png)
