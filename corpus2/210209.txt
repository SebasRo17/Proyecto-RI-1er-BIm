At the company I am currently working for we started to do Scrum projects. It was not so hard to convince the managers to move from waterfall to Scrum. We're doing a project where we rebuild our platform from scratch. So (most) functionality is known and most improvements are rather technical. In this it could be justified to have technical tasks rather than user stories. Our backlog has got all kinds of technical tasks like:   * Rewrite DB class from MySQL to PostgreSQL.   * Implement system logging.   * Rewrite object cache. Things that come up during the stand-ups include that long "research tasks" are wanted, but they are never done. Also, the team members claim in the middle of the sprint that unplanned tasks need to be added. How should a Scrum Master deal with this? Could it be that for this kind of project, Scrum is NOT the way to go?
