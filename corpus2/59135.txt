The polynomial `P(x)=x^‎‏4‏‎-‎‏4‏x^‎‏2‏‎-‎‏2‏x+‎‏1`‏‎ has ‎‏4‏‎ real roots (this can be clearly checked by plotting). But solving `‎P(x)=‎‏0‏‎`, using `Solve[x^‎‏4‏‎-‎‏4‏x^‎‏2‏‎-‎‏2‏x+‎‏1‏‎==‎‏0‏‎,x]` leads to `x=-‎‏1‏‎` and `‎‏3‏‎` other roots which (however they're ‎not) seems complex number as they are represented in terms of `i` (the imaginary unit):‎ ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CDbbm.jpg) But I want to have the roots represented in a real closed radical expression. I mean neither in ‎trigonometric representation (such as the output of `ComplexExpand[]`) nor with any `i`'s in it. Is ‎there any simplification function or procedure that can help?‎ ‎ I've tried `Simplify[]` and `FullSimplify[]` and their various options. Even I've combined them with ‎some other expression manipulation functions such as `Expand[]`, `Refine[]` and `ComplexExpand[]`, ‎but I could not reach my goal. ‎
