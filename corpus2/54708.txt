I want some high-quality 2D graphics produced by _Mathematica_ in my paper. My step-by-step operation as follows: First I make the plot, for example,               Plot[x^3 + 2 x + 3, {x, -2, 3}]      Then I   1. click the right mouse button    2. copy the figure    3. paste in my Word document However, I discover that Word renders my graphic jaggedly. So my question is: how can I extract a graphic from my notebook and transfer it to Word preserving full Mathematica quality? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/hvgmj.png)
