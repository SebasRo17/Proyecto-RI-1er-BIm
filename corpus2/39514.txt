I have an equation such as:               a*z^2 + b*(z - c)^2 == d       where `z` is a complex variable and `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are all complex parameters. I want to put `x+I*y` instead of `z` and decompose this equation into two pure real and imaginary part for further analysis, but I don't know how to do it by _Mathematica_! Can anybody help me? Thanks in advance
