It's not uncommon where I'm working on a site that includes things like binary (or effectively undiffable due to factors outside my control) specification documents (e.g., PDFs, Word Documents, Excel Spreadsheets) and multimedia source files (e.g., FLA source files, Photoshop files, Illustrator files). How should these be stored? My instinct is to just throw them into git. Storage is cheap, but it does make the clone operation take much, much longer than it otherwise would. A potential alternative would be to use a wiki. I've tried it in some cases but never ran into a case where the wiki format's inherent strengths (layperson-accessible version history and easy access to latest copies) have or would have led to enough benefit to justify the additional work in maintaining the wiki. The third option is to just let them hang out locally and in email threads. So what approach should I take to this?
