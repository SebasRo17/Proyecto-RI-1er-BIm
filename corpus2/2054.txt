I would like to show graphics repeatedly with changes in parameters. Neither of the following show anything. Nor do they give an error message.               Do[Plot[y = Sqrt[(1/n) x], {x, 0, 1}], {n, 1, 5}]          For[n = 1, n < 6, n++, Plot[y = Sqrt[(1/n) x], {x, 0, 1}]]      These merely show the plot for n=1.               Do[Return[Plot[y = Sqrt[(1/n) x], {x, 0, 1}]], {n, 1, 5}]          Do[(Pause[1]; Return[Plot[y = Sqrt[(1/n) x], {x, 0, 1}]]), {n, 1, 5}]          For[n = 1, n < 6, n++, Return[Plot[y = Sqrt[(1/n) x], {x, 0, 1}]]]      (I tried Pauses in the others, to no avail.) How do I make this work?
