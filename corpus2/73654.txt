I am going to be doing a short PHP test/project (20-30 mins) at an interview very soon. The job is at a junior to mid-weight salary (although no specific knowledge level is in the job spec) at a media agency. I am looking for any advice on where to concentrate my revision? Should I focus on core concepts (design patterns) or more on method syntax recall? I am not sure if I will have web access during the test, is this normal? any example of a what a small project might mean? Any advice at all would be gratefully received.
