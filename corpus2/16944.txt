I tried retrieving `FinancialData` for a few companies but when I tried doing it for NTDOY, I couldn't. As of 25/12/2012, querying                FinancialData["PK:NTDOY"]      yields > FinancialData::notent: PK:NTDOY is not a known entity, class, or tag for > FinancialData. Use FinancialData[] for a list of entities. However, this is weird for two reasons. Firstly, `PK:NTDOY` is included in the list of financial instruments Mathematica supposedly has data for:                FinancialData["*NTD*"]      yields                {"JK:INTD", "NASDAQ:GKNTD", "NASDAQ:UNTD", "PK:ANTD", "PK:NTDMF", "PK:NTDOF", "PK:NTDOY"}      Secondly, if I try using free-form input, e.g. > = NTDOY price from 25 December 2011 to 25 December 2012 I get the same (notent) output; on the other hand, if I click on the orange "Show all results" plus symbol, I get a WA-like tab filled with meaningful data, even though sometimes Mathematica crashes while computing. So my question is: what does `FinancialData` truly mean when it states that something is not "known"? Is this a software bug or is it simply that more data is available to WolframAlpha than is to Mathematica? (I'm using Mathematica 8.0.1.0, by the way.)
