Consider the function               λ[n_] = Sqrt[2 n];     ϕ[n_, x_] = 1/Sqrt[2^n n! Sqrt[π]] HermiteH[n, x];     f[x_] = Sum[2 Re[(-1)^(n + m) (1/(λ[m] + λ[n + 1]) + 1/(λ[n] + λ[m + 1]))                 If[n != m, 1, 1/2]] ϕ[n, x] ϕ[m, x] E^-x^2, {n, 0, 100}, {m, n, 100}];      Why is               f[-4.0] == 4.9697      while               f[-4] // N == 1.07681      ? The second result is correct as you can check by using `SetDelayed` in the definition of `f`. This discrepancy has to do with approximations. It would be good to fix it, since computations are faster if the function is defined with `Set`. I would also appreciate suggestions to evaluate this sum more efficiently. Thank you!
