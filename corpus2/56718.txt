I thought that Visual Studio 2010 SP1 would include support for using SQL Server Compact Edition 4 inside the designer, but it seems not. Was I wrong, or has I managed to botch up my installation somehow? I installed SQL Server CE 4 from the download page, not through the web installer. If Visual Studio 2010 SP1 does not, and should not, include such support, what are my choices, if any?
