I am trying to convince the lead developer of an open-source project I'm contributing to, to conform to the PSR standards (PSR-2 in particular) created by the PHP Framework Interop Group. He is willing to adopt PSR-0 and PSR-1, but he is opposed to PSR-2. His argument is that PSR-2 is too inconsistent: opening braces for classes and methods MUST go on the next line, but opening braces for control structures MUST go on the same line. I believe that the difference between classes / methods at one side and control structures at the other is not an inconsistency, in fact they are different things. I also believe that consistency between different projects is far more important than treating classes / methods and control structures like they are the same, and that consistancy between projects should outweigh personal preferences... but I can't convince him. Are there any more arguments I can use to try to convince him to use PSR-2, instead of a seperate, yet-another coding standard?
