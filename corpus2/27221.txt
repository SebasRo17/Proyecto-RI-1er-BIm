I am trying to find the best-fit trend for my data. Here I just generated it but let's say I don't know my data trend at all.               test = RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[100, 10], 100];     data = TemporalData[test];     proc = EstimatedProcess[data, ARMAProcess[3, 3]];     forecast = TimeSeriesForecast[proc, data, {5}, Method -> Automatic]     sims = RandomFunction[proc, {0, 10^2}, 4];     ListLinePlot[Join[data["Paths"], sims["Paths"]],      PlotStyle -> {Directive[Thick, ColorData[1, 1]], ColorData[10, 1],      ColorData[10, 2], ColorData[10, 3], ColorData[12, 4]},      PlotLegends -> {"data", "Simulations"}, ImageSize -> 550]      As results of the fit shows, neither of AutoRegressive methods of _Mathematica_ are being fitted to my data. How can I use the Euler-Maruyama method mentioned here and disscuded here for fitting my data and have the fitness test data for it? How can I also do the Monte Carlo simulations for them and show upper, lower bound and mean of simulations on my data?
