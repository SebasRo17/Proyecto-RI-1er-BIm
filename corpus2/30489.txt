I'm new to _Mathematica_ , so I suspect this question involves either a misunderstanding involving variables or the usage of `>>>`. On a _webMathematica_ page (backed by _Mathematica_ 5.2), I have the following:               foo[arg_] := Module[{argN},         ArgN = arg;         filenameS ="Absolute/Path/To/File";         ArgN >>> filenameS; (*Problem Line*)     ];     foo["test"];      Running this appears to do nothing. When I replace the line               ArgN >>> filenameS;      with               PutAppend[ArgN, filenameS];      It works perfectly, appending `"test"` to the file. Why doesn't the infix form of `PutAppend` work in the same way?
