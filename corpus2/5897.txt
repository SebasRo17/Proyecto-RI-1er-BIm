The following creates a button to select a notebook to run. When the button is pressed it seems that Mathematica finds the notebook but cannot evaluate it. The following error occurs > Could not process unknown packet "1"               Button["run file 1",           NotebookEvaluate[           "/../file1.nb"]]      This occurs under Mathematica 8 on all platforms. Any help greatly appreciated, Christina
