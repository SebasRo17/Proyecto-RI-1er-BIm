I have a select dropdown, with '+' and '-' buttons that add and remove items before submission. I would like to be able to remove the elements with the '-' button after they have been added to the database. I'm not sure how to go about doing this, other than removing prior entries and rewriting the options again. Ideally, it would be reusable and simple to figure for the other developer on the team, or anyone who may replace me down the line. Can someone point me in the right direction?
