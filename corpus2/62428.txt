Since the early days of my college life I have been using Java and biggest problem that we have is absolutely being less productive than other interpreted languages. All people are sure that java is one of the best compiled language. However, neither Sun nor Oracle has put enough effort in to solve this problem. One of the problem is, of course, class reloading. Latest attempts from community to solve this problem are DaVinci Hotswap project, JRebel, PlayFramework. However, at the time of this writing they were still not mature (imo) and native. Some of them are not enterprise ready, some of them are not compatible with all IDEs, some of them are immature universtiy projects. The road map and even developer ready Java is ready, but the Java community still does not have a solution for on the fly class reloading. Is it so difficult for Oracle to put effort forth to solve this problem? Why has class reloading not been implemented natively yet?
