I'm a developer and I have had several experiences in web application deployment which are the following:   1. Deploy all files then apply configuration values as appropriate to the environment. We've used this style of deployment for larger softwares with long development cycles and quick releases aren't needed or allowed unless for emergencies.   2. Deploy only what has changed; manually update configuration files with what new or updated configuration as appropriate to environment. We've used this style for web applications that tend to be more agile, i.e. fix and feature releases are almost done daily. I've had issues with this before where not all assemblies dependent on an assembly that has changed were identified (A constant value was change in assembly A and the same constant was used in assembly B and only assembly A identified as changed). Which of the 2 is a better (or best) practice? I'm starting a new medium sized project where deployments would be on a monthly basis and would like to establish this process early on.
