My co-workers tend to think that it is better to limit non-domain type suffixes to a small fixed set of OOP-pattern inspired words, e.g.:   * *Service   * *Repository   * *Factory   * *Manager   * *Provider I believe there is no reason to not extend that set with more names, e.g. (some "translation" to the previous vocabulary is given in brackets):   * *Distributor (=> *DistributionManager or *SendingService)   * *Generator   * *Browser (=> *ReadonlyRepositoryService)   * *Processor   * *Manipulator (=> *StateMachineManager)   * *Enricher (=> *EnrichmentService) (*) denotes some domain word, e.g. "Order", "Student", "Item" etc. The domain is probably not complex enough to use specialized approaches such as DDD which could drive the naming.
