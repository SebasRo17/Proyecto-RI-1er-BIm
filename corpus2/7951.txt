I'm a student of computer science but I am only taking entry level web development classes. I'm looking for some out-of-class reading, tutorials, and other ways of learning but I'm not sure what I should start in. What is a good set of programming languages (different paradigms?), frameworks, suggested projects, and maybe even some open-source communities that I should start to look at and start learning? Also, maybe even some books or blogs on development processes in the professional world. I'm looking to start getting in to professional development around the end of college. I understand practicing it will be the best way to learn anything but if I don't know what I should practice, I'm lost at that. :)
