I'm working on a 2D-physics engine, and I need a certain variable to be precise only to the hundredths. Are there any methods for basically shaving off all of that unneeded precision? I have tried things like               "{0:.2f}".format(a)      but that obviously produces a string, not a number. I'm moving an object based upon its speed, and I want it to(obviously) stop when its value is 0.0, but it keeps going because its speed is really something like 0.0000562351.
