I am interested in the numerical evaluation of the following integral: $\int \prod_{i=1}^n dx_i \delta(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i) \prod_{i=1}^n f_i(x_i)$ where $f(x)$ is a complicated function. Unfortunately NIntegrate seems to give an answer with too large errors; this seems to be problem of the multi- dimensional integral. The function contains the phase fluctuations ($\sim e^{ikx}$), which could be one of the reasons. In practice $n\sim 5$, although it is certainly better if I could take $n$ large. For comparison, I can also consider an integral $\int \prod_{i=1}^n dx_i \prod_{i=1}^n f_i(x_i)$ but instead of evaluation this whole expression in NIntegrate, I could factorize the integral to be $\prod_{i=1}^n \left(\int dx_i\, f_i(x_i)\right)$, evaluate the 1-dimensional integral first and then take a product. This seems to give an answer which is numerically much better than NIntegrating the n-dimensional integral. [I am numerically checking the known mathematical identity so I have something to compare with. The one with the delta function corresponds to $SU(N)$, the one without to $U(N)$.] The trouble with the one above, with 1 delta function, is that the integral does not factorize. However I hope there is a way to achieve numerical accuracy, rather than brute-force NIntegrate of the whole expression. In any case I would appreciate any suggestions for better numerical accuracy.
