Just completed the first pass through Peter Siebel's Practical Common Lisp. I'm fairly comfortable with C#, Ruby, Java; The chapters that teach Lisp and the early 'practical' chapters were easy on my brain. However towards the end of the book, the practical chapters (on binary serialization, id3 parsing, web programming and the HTML generating DSL) seemed to be just out of reach - I recognized the primitives and methods being used ; but the means of combination left me flabbergasted. e.g. Given the specs, I couldn't sit down and write that code on my own.. I skipped some of them and strafed through the rest. Are there other who felt that there was a missing level between the first 22 chapters and the practicals ? Or is it just me ? Should I read the basics again? Or is there another book that will help me cross the chasm ?
