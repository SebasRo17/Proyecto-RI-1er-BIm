Mathematica seems not to be able to minimize this univariate function over integer arguments, $r>2, r \in \mathbb{Z}$.               k=6;     SB[n_, r_] :=       Sum[Binomial[r Binomial[2 k, 2]/2, i] Binomial[         Binomial[n, 2] - r Binomial[2 k, 2]/2,          r Binomial[k, 2] + r - i], {i, r Binomial[k, 2] + r/2,         r Binomial[k, 2] + r}]               NMinimize[{SB[k r, r], Element[r, Integers] && r > 2}  , r]      This takes forever, even if, evaluated with `Table` the function in the interval $r=(2,100]$ for example, has perfectly valid values. The other command `FindInstance` seems unable to tell me a valid value when checking if $S_B(k r,r) > 0$ even if this is true for every value of $r$. Some help to make this computation faster or let it converge to a feasible solution? I know the solution is at $r=2$ but I just want to know how to properly specify this problem that is part of a more general framework.
