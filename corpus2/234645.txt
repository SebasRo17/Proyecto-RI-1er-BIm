I've had a few programming jobs in the past where I was the only developer working on a project. After I've left, I typically get several emails a week from these companies, usually from the developer(s) who's replaced me there. These emails are usually asking for details about how things work and how I'd best go about implement feature x based on the existing system. I'm usually polite and helpful, but these kind of communications really start to eat into my time making every job I work on another weight around my ankle. Not to mention they're projects that I chose to leave behind me for a good reason. My question is, would it be professionally 'ok' to tell them I'm just not going to offer support any more and refuse and answer inquiries? NB. None of these companies are paying me any type of retainer and the inquiries are often informal questions from developers and not management.
