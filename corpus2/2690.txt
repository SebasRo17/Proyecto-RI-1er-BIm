Brief Question about how to best match lists with Criteria from Identifiers (thus for me: translate SQL to Mathematica ;) ). If I have two sets:                set1 = {{ExperimentCode1,        No of Experiments1}, {ExperimentCode2, No of Experiments2} ...}        set2 = {{ExperimentCode1,         TypeofExp1}, {ExperimentCode2, No of TypeofExp1} ...}        Now set 1 has 10 Entries, set2 only contains data for 3.               'Sql: Select * from set1 Inner Join set 2 on set1.Experimentcode=set2.Experimentcode'        This only matches cases in SQL where the variables exist in both lists (Thus result = 3 Elements)               'Sql: Select * from set1 Left Join set 2 on set1.Experimentcode=set2.Experimentcode'        This returns all Elements from List 1 and the matched from List 2 (result=10 elements, 3 Elements have now the additional value type, the other 7 Null values for type). I think this is even more tricky when there is more than one Identifier (Thus two fields together represent a unique identfying number).
