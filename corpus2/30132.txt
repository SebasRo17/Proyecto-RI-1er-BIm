I have this set of data               mydata={{1244,0.90237},{1289,0.83072},{1306,0.76147},{1360,0.6094},{1388,0.40952},{1428,0.29419},{1488,0.15592},{1494,0.11718},{1527,0.09192},{1537,0.07757},{1590,0.04546},{1594,0.04563},{1654,0.03229},{1737,0.01976},{1740,0.01949};      and I need it fitted into a function of the form               Exp[-(A*TT*^n*Exp[-Ea/(R*TT)])*t]      where $R$ is the gas constant $R=8.31\dots$ and $t=0.002$. This is a decay and the function in the exponent is the Arrhenius factor. I checked the help for the fitting tools, but what I found was either in one variable, or in more variables, but for a higher dimensional plot. I also have variable bounds which I need to implement. I have this simple curve with parameters               A, n, Ea      $A$ is bounded by $10^{12}$ and $10^{14}$, $Ea$ lies between $270000$ and $320000$, $n$ close to zero (single digit). The plot of the function should be with respect to temperature $TT$ is the varying variable on the x-axis.
