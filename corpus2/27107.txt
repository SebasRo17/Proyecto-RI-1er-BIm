I have a problem with writing a _Mathematica_ function. I have been requested to show the results of my experiments with the measurement uncertainty (mu) like below:               measurementValue(mu)        Both numbers ought to be rounded with precision, given by the two most significant digits of mu. Example:               16(11), 123.4(1.3), 1230(10), 123.345(40)||123.345(0.040)      Getting proper format of mu is simple:               NumberForm[mu, 2]      But I don't have any idea, how to round properly measurement value. Finally I want to write a function, that returns the proper format of the value and mu as output.
