Web designers generally need to have a decent portfolio of websites to demonstrate their ability. It seems web developers should have a similar portfolio, but any portfolio website a web developer might put together might never be as flashy as a web designer's, whose main goal is to show off good design. Is it necessary to have a list of websites I can point to when talking about my experience? Or are there other ways to demonstrate my experience, like perhaps a blog that talks about the concepts I'm interested in?
