I am having a discussion with a colleague about using macro as a thin (extremely) layer of abstraction vs using a function wrapper. The example that I used is Macro way.               #define StartOSTimer(period)  (microTimerStart(period))      Function wrapper method               void StartOSTimer(period)     {         microTimerStart(period);     }      Personally, I liked the second method as it allows for future modification, the #include dependencies are also abstracted as well.
