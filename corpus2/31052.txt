The question concerns creating a function. Let consider the following code               With[{f = Function[t, Cos[t]]},      {First[#], f'[#]} &     ]      which returns               (* ==> {First[#1], Function[t, Cos[t]]'[#1]} & *)      How to can I force it to return the derivative evaluated (only second part of the returned list); i.e., how to can I get               (* ==> {First[#1], -Sin[#1]} & *)
