I often write tests when I need to set data object for integration tests involving a few pages with forms. Herein each form on a page could be represented by a different data object class. There are are times when test end up in filling same data for a specific page while varying it for other pages and validating the overall flow. I thought instead of setting data object each time from test method I can take advantage of instance initialization block to set data for tests. Herein I have listed a smaller version of tests I usually write - This my data class which holds data for form values - textbox, drop down etc. I have not kept setters for sake of brevity -               public class DataClass {          private int i;     private int j;          public DataClass() {         i=1;         j=1;     }             public int getI(){         return i;     }          public int getJ(){         return j;     }     }      Following is the helper class which is used by test class to fill form data on page -               public class WorkerClass {          private DataClass data;          public void setData(DataClass data){         this.data = data;            }          public int add() {         return data.getI()+data.getJ();     }          public int substract() {         return data.getI()-data.getJ();     }     }      And here is the test method. Notice that instead of calling setData of WorkerClass in each test method I used instance initialization block -               public class TestClass {          private DataClass data = new DataClass();     WorkerClass workerClass = new WorkerClass();          {         workerClass.setData(data);     }          @Test     public void testAddition() {         assert workerClass.add()==0:"addition Failed";          }          @Test     public void testSubstraction() {         assert workerClass.substract()==0:"substraction failed";             }        }      My question is, am I misusing instance initialization block and should rather be calling it from each test method, even if all the test method require same set of data?
