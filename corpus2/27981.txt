I want to plot an output response from a state space model. I use `StateResponse[]` to calculate it and then plot it. When I run my code, I face this message: > NDSolve::mxst: Maximum number of 10000 steps reached at the point t == > 0.007796405242565201`. I do not even use `NDSolve[]` command to solve my equations! This is my code and its answer: `u = -kk.StateResponse[ssmModelC, UnitStep[t] , {t, 0, 10}]` How is it possible to increase number of steps in `StateResponse[]`?
