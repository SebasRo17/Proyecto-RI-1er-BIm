I've been wondering for a while. I guess I have been adapting to the circumstances but I am in desperate need of some clearly defined workflows. Ok, so say I am working with one other person and I have 2 projects come up both of equally large size with LOOSE deadlines. What should I do: > a) turn down one, work on other exclusively > > b) take both on and develop both simultaneously > > c) assign one person to each project I have done c in the past which works fine. As a manager also, I've simply had to manage that project while I work on another. No big deal. But what is the ideal option above? I'd hate to do a because I am turning down work either though deadline would permit working on both projects. Any input? Following things should be taken into account: > -) all members have same expertise in design & development and can > effectively function as freelancers > > -) timezones may not be the same so they would not be working at the same > time
