Given the announcement of the windows 8 tablet edition and more details on the app store, it would be amazing if this infrastructure could be leveraged for the OSX desktop and or MonoTouch. http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/09/windows-8-experience/ Technically how hard would it be for Microsoft to do this? Is the only problem strategic? I know all about Mono, this is a question about microsoft supporting it directly from Visual Studio.
