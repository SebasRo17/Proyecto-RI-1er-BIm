I have large data consisting of values obtained by sweeping across three parameters (e, w, and f). I want to plot all this data on one graph using different shapes for e (e.g., circle, triangle, square, and diamond), different colors for w, and a letter inside the shape for f. So far I have               Jw1e1 = {{16, 832}, {32, 3150}, {64, 12237}, {128, 48212}};     J1 = ListLogPlot[Jw1e1, PlotMarkers -> (Style[Framed[H], Red]),        Frame -> True]     Jw1e3 = {{16, 826}, {32, 3127}, {64, 12145}, {128, 47851}};     J3 = ListLogPlot[Jw1e1, PlotMarkers -> (Style[Framed[H], Blue]),        Frame -> True]     Show[J1, J3]      I cannot figure out how have a square, circle, etc. appear as the specified shape by changing `Framed[H]`. If I replace `Framed[H]` by `Circle[]`, Circle[{0, 0}] appears on my plots and replacing by `Circle[H]`, `Circle[H]` appears.
