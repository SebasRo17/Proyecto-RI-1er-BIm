Here's what I'm doing: I am reading a file in BLL, which is sitting in the UI layer. Currently the application is using `HttpContext.Current.Request.PhysicalApplicationPath` to find the absolute path written in BLL. I feel this is not a good design and I am thinking that I should pass this information in some kind of structure to BLL or I could use a helper method to get that. Please let me know which one is better and if there are any better solutions / suggestions. Please ask if you need more details.
