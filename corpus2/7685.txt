Is there a built in function that would take a number and decompose it into a sum of powers of 2? The numbers will be non negative less than 256. For what it's worth I'm trying to understand a paper on RAID 6, which uses some Galois field in calculating the second parity (in this case) byte. There's a rule for mulitplying by 2, which is unusual in iteself, at least to me. It seems that in order to generalize mulitplication to any two bytes I would have decompose those bytes into powers of 2 and mulitply them like polynomials. Then in this case, mod them by 255. I can write a function to do the necessary decomposition, but I thought that there might be a built in function.
