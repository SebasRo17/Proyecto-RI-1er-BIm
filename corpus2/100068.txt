I know the software patent is a hot topic and is very frustrating. But as I live in the US I don't think I have any choice but to deal with it. What I'm wondering is if there are actually companies or a site where I can look up what patents might apply to my idea. Then, be able to license the appropriate use of the idea even if the patent is vague and ambiguous. Then, if a troll comes after me I can argue that I'm protected under the use of patent#XYX.
