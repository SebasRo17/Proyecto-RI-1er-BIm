I developed an app a few years back: while it's outdated and useless compared to what's available today, it was helpful for people when it was first released. I recently searched for my own name on Google, and came across a website that made the claim my app was malware that couldn't be uninstalled normally, and provided step-by-step instructions for removing it. This is, of course, not true and I'm pretty frustrated by the implication. How should I handle a situation like this? Should I confront the site owner, or handle it a different way?
