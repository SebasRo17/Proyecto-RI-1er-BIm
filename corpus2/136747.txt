I realized there could be a lot of bad code in a system while writing Java. I wonder why schools don't teach what programming practices are bad. For example, in Java, using a big try/catch block that catches `Exception` is bad, but no one told me. And we see the typical "String + String" concatenation appear in every corner of a program. Isn't it the job of schools, assuming most programmers are taught at a school and not self-taught, to warn students away from the pitfalls in a programming?
