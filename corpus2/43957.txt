How can I go about setting up a recurrence relation where the first 10 values are a constant and the second 10 values are another constant? Ideally, I'd like an efficient way to set               a[1] = 200     a[2] = 200     a[3] = 200     a[4] = 100     a[5] = 100      And so on, without having to type each term out explicitly.
