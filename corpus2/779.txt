It doesn't have to be programming or software development related, but just asked during an interview for an IT related job. I know some "left field" questions are meant to see how the candidate copes with unexpected and novel situations, but here I'm looking for a question that appeared to be completely unrelated to the job they were interviewing you for, or something that made you think "what useful information could they possibly get from my answer to _that_ question?".
