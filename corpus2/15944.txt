I understand how I can select a bookmark from the "+" menu of a `Manipulate`. Is there a way to select a bookmark from an arbitrary control, or define a control that implements bookmark functionality? For example, if I have something like               Manipulate[{x, y, z},      {x, 0, 10}, {y, 0, 10}, {z, 0, 10},      Bookmarks -> {"Center" :> {x = 5, y = 5, z = 5},"Zero" :> {x = 0, y = 0, z = 0}}]      Can I add a control that does the same thing as selecting the bookmark from the menu? For example, can I add something similar to `{preset, {"Center", "Zero"}}`, to create something that looks like ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ApAvc.png) where choosing one of the setters performs assignments to collections of `Manipulate` variables? Specifically: is there   1. a way to implement bookmark-like functionality by specifying a control that sets several `Manipulate` variables at once; is there    2. a way to explicitly select a bookmark from an arbitrary control (e.g. is there something like an"SelectBookmark[ _bookmark_ ]")? I'd have thought that               Manipulate[{x, y, z}, {x, 0, 10}, {y, 0, 10}, {z, 0, 10},      {{preset,         Which[# === "Center", (x = 5; y = 5; z = 5),              # === "Zero",   (x = 0; y = 0; z = 0)] &}, {"Center", "Zero"}}]      would at least achieve (1), but it has no apparent effect; I see no way to do (2).
