I just came across the following curiosity and I'm not sure whether it's a bug or just me missing something. Here's a minimal example: I defined the following "function" ` In[1]:= S[x_, y_, z_] := DiracDelta[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 1]; ` which is supposed to parametrize the surface of a unit sphere. However, when I integrate over the entire space (x,y,z $\in$ [-2,2] should do) I get $2\pi$ as a result ` In[2]:= Integrate[S[x, y, z], {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2}, {z, -2, 2}] Out[2]:= 2 Pi ` Shouldn't this be rather 4$\pi$?
