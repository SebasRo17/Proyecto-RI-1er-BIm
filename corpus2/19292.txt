I want to make an `InputField` that only allows a specific date format to be entered. I want to display a field hint in the format "dd:mm:yyyy". Once the user clicks on the input field, then the user should be able to enter date values. The user should not be able to enter anything that in not in the correct format. I require the ability to insert a separator of my choice. In the example above, my field separator is ":". The user should not be able to enter any other separator except for the one that I have given. Can anyone help me?
