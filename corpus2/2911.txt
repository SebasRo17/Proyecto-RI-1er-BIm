1. Is there a command window and an editor in Mathematica 8 similar to those in Matlab? In Mathematica GUI mode, all I saw is write code and run it in the same notebook.   2. In my Ubuntu terminal, I successfully started Mathematica by `./math` (which is the only way I know by the way and I would also like to know what options are available when starting up).  When I simply copy and paste the code from Heike , nothing new appears, and when I copy and paste the code of Daniel, it works. Wonder why?   3. Is it correct that there are exactly two ways of running Mathematica code: in a notebook, and in a Mathematica session running in my Linux terminal?  Are the notebook way and the GUI mode the same thing? What does "kernel" mean in Mathematica? What are some basic concepts and common sense of running Mathematica?
