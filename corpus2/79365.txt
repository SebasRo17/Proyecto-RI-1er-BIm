My brother just started learning some html/css at school and he loves it. He asked me to give my advice on what languages to learn in order to build great web-apps by the time he leaves school. (2015 or something like that.) I did some research, and right now I want to tell him (in this particular order):   * HTML -> HTML5   * CSS -> CSS3   * Javascript -> jQuery -> AJAX   * PHP -> Zend Framework   * MySQL   * Ruby -> RoR I would like to know if this is correct before I waste his time. Stackoverflow seems like a place where people know the answer to these kind of questions ;). Thanks!
