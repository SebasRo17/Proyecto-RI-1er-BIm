Wolfram Workbench allows you to create documentation for your own packages that is similar to the build-in documentation center. Integrating this type of documentation with the documentation center is possible starting from _Mathematica_ 6, and hence I would like to create packages whose documentation nicely integrates with _Mathematica_ 6, 7, 8, and 9. However, Workbench doesn't support this out of the box. Its documentation tools seem to be a spin-off from WRI own tools to create version-specific documentation, so it is no wonder creating cross-version compatible docs in Workbench is nearly impossible. So far, I've identified the following obstacles to creating cross-version compatible docs:   1. Documentation indices built with _Mathematica_ <= 8 are not compatible with _Mathematica_ 9, so docs built with <= 8 are not searchable in 9. See this workaround.   2. Documentation pages built with a given version of _Mathematica_ always give the " _This notebook was created in a more recent version of Mathematica_ " dialog warning in older versions. See this workaround.   3. The `PacletInfo.m` syntax has changed with _Mathematica_ 9; it now requires a `"Kernel"` extension. This chokes the _Mathematica_ 6 PacletManager, ruling out docs simultaneously compatible with 6 and 9. See this workaround.   4. Workbench 2 can only properly build docs with _Mathematica_ 7 or 8. _Mathematica_ 6 returns malformed notebooks (see this workaround by Simon Rochester), and 9 freezes halfway the build process for large packages.   5. Docs build with lower version look pretty bad on _Mathematica_ 9\. See this partial workaround. Points 2 and 5 are by no means deal-breakers, but 1 in combination with 4 certainly is. I've managed to find work-arounds for most of these issues, which I've posted below. If someone has identified similar issues or has better workarounds, I'm all ears!
