I'm trying to plot solution of system of equations as a function of parameter               Manipulate[{       Quiet[sol = Solve[{Ka*P*L*L == PLL, P0 == P + PLL, r*P0 == L + 2*PLL}, {P, L, PLL}]][[3]];       complex[x_] := PLL /. sol[[3]] /. r -> x;       Plot[{          Hold[Evaluate@D[complex[r], r]],          Hold[Evaluate@D[-complex[r], {r, 2}]]          } // Release,        {r, 0.1, 4},        PlotStyle -> {Red, Blue}        ]},      {Ka, 10000, 10000},      {P0, 0.5, 1}      ]      My plot has gaps! Why and how I can eliminate them? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3Frhi.png)
