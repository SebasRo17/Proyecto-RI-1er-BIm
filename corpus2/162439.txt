I currently have the following HTML code                 <time datetime="2012-08-23">         23. August 2012       </time>      I have that because I felt the "23. August 2012" format was easier for website visitors to read than               <time>2012-08-23</time>      Both of those HTML5 examples validate at w3, but the first one is obviously redundant, and I like to cut out markup I don't need. Is there another date formate that I can use in the second example that is (1) easy for website visitors to read, and (2) w3 valid?
