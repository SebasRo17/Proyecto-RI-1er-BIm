I am trying to put together a way to figure out if incidents occurred based on log content. Typically, on log (or db table) would contain a list of transactions composed as follow: {Timestamp} {TransactionID} {Message} As an example problem I have run into, I used this to detect if "incidents" occured by running some very basic queries such as:               SELECT Timestamp, count(*)     FROM table     GROUP BY Timestamp     HAVING COUNT(*) > 5     ORDER BY Timestamp      This works OK but has very strong caveats:   * In times of high activity it will return records for nothing (and raising the bar will hide rows that should get returned)   * Let say I have 4 events at timestamp t and 2 events at timestamp (t+1), my query will not return anything even if they should be considered. Unfortunately, aggregating timestamps by time ranges will lead me to the previous point about high activity time. Would someone have some insights on how to tackle the broader problem of incident detection within logs?
