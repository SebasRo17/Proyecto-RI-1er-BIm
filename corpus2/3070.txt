Starting from these two lists,               var = {a, b, c}      values = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8 , 9}}      how can I generate a list of rules?               rules = {{a -> 1, b -> 2, c -> 3}, {a -> 4, b -> 5, c -> 6}, {a -> 7, b -> 8, c -> 9}}      This is how far I have got               In: {{a, b, c}, {1, 2, 3}} // Transpose     In: Rule @@@ %     Out: {{a, 1}, {b, 2}, {c, 3}}     Out: {a -> 1, b -> 2, c -> 3}
