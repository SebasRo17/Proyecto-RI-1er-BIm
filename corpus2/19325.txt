I have a .dat file from FORTRAN output and I am trying to plot the results. The dat file is a series of rows with the row number as the first column. Now, every other row is empty, that may be problematic. I am trying to plot the second column vs the third column (not the row nr that is, but the actual data). I canÂ´t get the second and third column into an individual array. This is what I am trying to do               data = Import["C:\\Users....file.dat","Table"]     Grid[data]     1 1 0          2 0.999398 -0.000086244          3 0.997592 -0.000344186          4 0.994588 -0.000772091      Every other row in the table is empty, that is: `{}, {1, 1., 0.}, {}, {2, 0.999398, -0.000086244}, {},` I am trying to do               x = data[[ALL, 2]]      But I receive an error informing me that ALL is not an integer               Part::pspec: Part specification ALL is neither an integer nor a list of integers      How can I take all the values in the column 2 and 3 and store them in an individual arrays. If the empty rows will be problematic, how can I get rid of them?
