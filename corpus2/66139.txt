**When can you offer innovation, without being off-task?**   I can't understand how creative innovation fits in Agile and other methodologies. **People just want what they asked for, right?**   Say you're following an efficient methodology like Agile/SCRUM. When can you offer innovation, without being off-task? Say you're making an app and doing some creative stuff with the UX. The client gave you implicit instructions, and you're staying on track. Imagine you discover an innovation that's not a beta. If you introduce innovations the wrong way, you could appear off-task.
