I'm creating a sequence diagram for a simple program I'm working on for work. The diagram I'm currently working on is very high level - it defines the interface with lots of alt paths, but does not exemplify any specific use cases. I was wondering whether would it be more appropriate to instead make several diagrams which demonstrate specific examples. I'm not familiar with the way that these diagrams are intended to be used, and I've seen both specific examples and abstract examples. Thanks!
