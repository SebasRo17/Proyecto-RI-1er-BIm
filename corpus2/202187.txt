We all know “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog” used as benchmark for printing and fonts. I wonder if there is a similar “Lazy Dog” for Programming Languages. There are so many different programming languages, with all kinds of features and syntaxs, similar or different. The problem is: the user will be confused when using different languages at the same time. Although plenty of differences between different languages, there must be something in common, i.e. a task or routine. If we implement the same task in different languages, and try to cover most frequently used features, then the language learning or comparison will become much more easy. This kind of programme doesn't need to be very long, just like a tutorial but be common and abstract enough. Does it exist?
