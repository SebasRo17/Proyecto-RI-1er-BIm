Well in my book it is says that "there are non-decidable languages" And the proof is: > Every algorithm is a word. Then there are only countable algorithms. But > there are uncountable languages and therefore more than algorithms Why is it said that every algorithm is a word? A word is a concatenation of symbols, elements of an alphabet, then what's the relation between a word and an algorithm? Can anyone explain me that?
