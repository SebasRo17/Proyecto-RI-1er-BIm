This question is regarding MVP triads. Lets say I have two triads and first one has `View1`, `Mode1` and `Presenter1`. Second triad has `View2`, `Model2` and `Presenter2`. Now what I trying to do is, I just want to display the `View2` when I click a `button` in `View1`. You'd show the `View1` calling it's presenter's show method.               View1Presenter presenter1 = new View1Presenter (view1, Model1);     presenter1.show();      Now When I click `btnShowView2` button on the `View1`, it should display the `View2`. So how to call `presenter2.show()` from `View1`?
