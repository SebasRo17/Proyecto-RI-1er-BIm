I am writing an interpreter for a functional programming language that is going to run in the browser. Needless to say, performance is the one and only concern in this application. Emscripten is an LLVMâ†’JavaScript compiler which claims to produce programs that run only 2~3 times slower than native. It is really surprising, considering actual JavaScript applications tend to run 7 to 10 times slower than native, according to the Computer Benchmarks Game. And those are exactly the types of application I am worried about. So, said that, would it be profitable to code my application in C, and then compile it to JavaScript using asm.js, or is there something I am missing?
