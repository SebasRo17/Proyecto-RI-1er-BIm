Let's take the following (JavaScript) code that returns a function that closes over variables `x` and `y` to illustrate:               function test() {       var x = Math.random();       var y = Math.random();       var f = function() {          console.log(x, y);        };            return f;     }     test()();      _The code is nonsensical, I just want to close over`x` and `y`._ Variables `x` and `y` don't exist outside of the function `test` but they remain available in the function `f`. Barring any compiler optimizations (like inlining), do we say there is a single closure ( _created by_ `f`), or do we say there are two closures ( _for/over_ `x` and `y`)?
