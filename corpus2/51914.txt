I have the following data that needs to be analyzed :               data = ToExpression@Import["http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=8XKGYvSy", "Data"];      I have 6 sets of coordinates (including this one) that I can easily plot on the same graph with `ListLinePlot`. However, I need to determine the `x-coordinate` of each of the 6 curves that has a y-value of a specific number of my choosing, say, -3. My goal is to do something like this with an intersection (using `FindRoot` between the line `y=-3` and `Interpolation[data]`. When I run `Interpolation[data]`, I get the following error message: > Interpolation::inder: The order-2 derivative of {-1.47,-7.0394} is not a > tensor of rank 2 with dimensions 2. >> I've seen similar uses of `Interpolation` for data sets much smaller than mine. Also, I'm importing my data from _Excel_ if that makes a difference. **EDIT:** I have done what others pointed out and removed the redundant braces. However, some of my sets still turn up an error message when I use `FindRoot`. `data = First@ToExpression@Import["http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=ayyGwmHw", "Data"][[1]]; f = Interpolation[data] FindRoot[f[x] = -3, {x,-.001}]` Produces the following error message: > Set::write: Tag InterpolatingFunction in > InterpolatingFunction[{{-0.0316228,-0.0000316225}},{4,7,0,{100},{4},0,0,0,0,Automatic},{{-0.0316228,<<49>>,<<50>>}},{Developer`PackedArrayForm,{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,<<51>>},{-3.18065,-3.1091,-3.03726,-2.9653,-2.89326,-2.82049,-2.74795,-2.67462,-2.6016,-2.52775,-2.45388,-2.37942,-2.3048,-2.22943,-2.15383,-2.07749,-2.00068,-1.92324,-1.84519,-1.76636,-1.68673,-1.6063,-1.52493,-1.44259,-1.35918,-1.2746,-1.18877,-1.10161,-1.01302,-0.922938,-0.831354,-0.738193,-0.643498,-0.547431,-0.450204,-0.352232,-0.25411,-0.156647,-0.0608189,0.0322768,0.121594,0.206229,0.285555,0.359262,0.427319,0.489892,0.547309,0.599959,0.648252,0.692602,<<50>>}},{Automatic}][x] > is Protected. >> > > FindRoot::jsing: Encountered a singular Jacobian at the point {x} = > {-0.001}.
