I have made a search on a Hong Kong job seeking website. There numerous of jobs titled "Computer Analyst". These are the requirements of the job:               Over 3 year experience relevant working experience in IBM Mainframe environment.     University degree in Computer Subject.     Proficient in system analysis, design and coding for the banking systems.     Application knowledge of Core banking and Card applications is definitely an advantage.     Sound in using IBM CICS/COBOL, and VSAM for both online and batch application systems.     Good communication skills with internal users.      Quite a number of jobs are similar: They requires candidates to have the following qualities:   * Computer Subjects especially Computer Science   * 3 years above experience   * IBM Mainframe COBOL   * Proficiency Then it comes to my question:   1. It makes it hard for new programmers to enter the industry. How should someone enter the industry, i.e. making him/herself suitable for this kind of position?    2. Do they still want new programmers in this field?   3. How should one learn to operate IBM Mainframe(Or any kind of Mainframe)?   4. Is knowledge in finance required or crucial?
