If there's something that would kill Go language, then it's name. I find it very hard to find anything in web related just by using "Go" in the query. The word is on of the most frequent in English. So I see everything in the result except Go-related stuff. Even Google, who sponsors the language and famous for tracking anything I search, can not track I'm a programmer so interested in the programming language and not English grammar. How to search for information related to the programming language itself, excluding the results related to English grammar? Imagine for example a blog post where someone mentions his observation about Go. He probably won't use the easy-to-search sentence like "go programming language", maybe something "there's one thing I like about Go".
