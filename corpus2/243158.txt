I interpret the above quotes as saying that **Hypermedia control** contains both _a link to a resource_ and _an annotation describing the role of linked resource in the context of the current representation_. And we call this annotation ( which describes the role of linked resource ) a **link relation value**. Is my assumption correct or does the term **link relation value** actually describe something different? Thank you
