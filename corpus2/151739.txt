Recently I've learned that using a regex to parse the HTML of a website to get the data you need isn't the best course of action. So my question is simple: What then, is the best / most efficient and a generally stable way to get this data? I should note that:   * There are no API's   * There is no other source where I can get the data from (no databases, feeds and such)   * There is no access to the source files. (Data from public websites)   * Let's say the data is normal text, displayed in a table in a html page I'm currently using python for my project but a language independent solution/tips would be nice. As a side question: How would you go about it when the webpage is constructed by Ajax calls? **EDIT:** In the case of HTML parsing, I know that there is no actual stable way to get the data. As soon as the page changes, your parser is done for. What I mean with stable in this case is: an efficient way to parse the page, that always hands me the same results (for the same set of data obviously) provided that the page does **not** change.
