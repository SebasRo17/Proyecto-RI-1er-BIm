Using Mathematica v9.0.1 This example is from the docs:               data1 = Table[{t, 9.8*t^2}, {t, 0, 3, .1}];     data2 = Table[{t, 9.8*t^2}, {t, 0, 5, .2}];     Export["datasets.xlsx", "Sheets" -> {"Experiment 1" -> data1,                                           "Experiment 2" -> data2}, "Rules"]      Returns: > JLink`Java::argxs: The static method System`Convert`ExcelDump`write was > called with an incorrect number or type of arguments. The arguments, shown > here in a list, were {XLSX,C:\Documents and > Settings\xxx\datasets.xlsx,{Experiment 1,Experiment > 2},{{{0.,0.},{0.1,0.098},<<27>>,{2.9,82.418},{3.,88.2}},{<<1>>}},{{{Null}}},{{{}}},Author->Created > by Wolfram Mathematica 9.0 : www.wolfram.com}. While the following:               Export["datasets.xlsx", {data1, data2}]      works OK, but I need sheet names. Any idea?
