I would like to change all values of a series to positive values. I refer to my previous question, answered in the most part, very elegantly by RunnyKine. However, there remains a slight glitch that I can't seem to overcome:               expr1 = x + (2 x^2)/y - (3 x^3)/y^2;     expr1 /. {Times[-1, c_] :> Times[1, c], Rational[-1, d_] :>      Rational[1, d], n_?Negative :> -1 n}      gives:               x + 2 x^2 y + 3 x^3 y^2      I can't seem to fathom where the missing '/' has gone from between the x & y values.
