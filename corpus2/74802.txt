I'm trying to understand whether cloud computing is meant for small to medium sized companies OR also for large companies. Imagine a website with a very large user base. The storage and bandwidth demands as well as the number of database transactions are incredibly high. The website might be hosting videos, music, images, etc. that keep the demands high. Does it make sense to be in the cloud when you know you need huge volumes of storage, bandwidth, and GET,PUT,etc. requests? (Each of these variables costs money in the cloud) OR does it make sense to build your own infrastructure? I can see the cost savings of cloud computing if you are a small business, but if you were aiming at the next big thing on the Internet, I can't quite see the benefits.
