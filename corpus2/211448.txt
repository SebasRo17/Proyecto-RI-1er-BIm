There are some guidelines out there (eg scala guidelines) and I'm wondering if it's okay to do some tidying up when committing other changes or if the commits should be more focused and to the point? Eg - remove unused, reorder per style guide. It might make it harder to read the pull request - but it will improve the project quality at least a little. What's your general rule of thumb? I'm not sure if I'm breaking unspoken taboos.
