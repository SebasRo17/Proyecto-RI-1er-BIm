I want to solve the trigonometric equation : $$(3-\cos 4x )\cdot (\sin x - \cos x ) = 2.$$ I tried               Solve[(3 - Cos[4*x])*(Sin[x] - Cos[x]) == 2, x]      It returns the solutions in terms of `Root` objects yielding also this message : > >     Solve::ifun: Inverse functions are being used by Solve, so some > solutions may not be found; >     use Reduce for complete solution information. >> >   How do I tell _Mathematica_ to do that? How can I solve this equation : $\tan(2x)â‹… \tan(7x) = 1$ ?
