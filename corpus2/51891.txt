I am trying to figure out a way to change the contents of a cell that has previously been evaluated in my notebook. To do this, I'd like to overwrite the cell. I've seen questions like How to pipe a stream to another notebook? and How do I direct output to a specific notebook or cell? and so far they have not helped me accomplish this.               NotebookApply[cell, data]       The above is supposed to write data to the specified cell, but I haven't had any luck with this, I'm most likely incorrectly identifying the cell. The most promising example I've seen so far has been this from the CellObject page:                 Do[CellPrint[        Cell["1", "Output", ShowCellTags -> True,          CellTags -> "overwrite" <> ToString[i]]], {i, 1, 3}];        obj = Cells[CellTags -> "overwrite2"][[1]];       NotebookWrite[obj, Cell["2", "Output"]];      But I don't really understand what it's doing, and I don't understand how to adapt it to suit my needs. If I have thisCell identifying the CellObject I'd like to change...               NotebookWrite[InputNotebook[],       thisCell  = Cell[BoxData[RowBox[{"mysteryVar = 0"}]], "Input"]]      How can I overwrite the contents of this cell? (I'm running ver 9). Thanks!
