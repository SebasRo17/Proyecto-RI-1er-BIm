I have 23 variables (energy production units) which take values for each hour of the day (energy dispatch table). Here is a PasteBin example of data. I am trying to represent the distribution of the total energy production for each hour. So far I have managed a pretty decent plot using :               accunits = Table[Accumulate[Transpose[allunits][[k]]], {k, Range[24]}];     ListLinePlot[Transpose[accunits], PlotRange -> All, AxesOrigin -> {1, 0}, ImageSize -> 500, Filling -> colors, PlotStyle -> Opacity[0]]      I still don't fully understand the proper use of `FillingStyle` with `ColorData`, so I created a list :               colors = Join[      Table[i -> {{i + 1}, Yellow}, {i, 1, 3}],      Table[i -> {{i + 1}, Orange}, {i, 4, 8}],      Table[i -> {{i + 1}, Red}, {i, 9, 15}],      Table[i -> {{i + 1}, Brown}, {i, 16, 20}],      {21 -> {{22}, Blue}},      {22 -> {{23}, Green}}];      Note the two last units are hydro and renewables, so the color scheme is different, while the 21 other units are thermal, so I tried to recreate a simplified `TemperatureMap`. This gives me the following image ![Dispatch](http://i.stack.imgur.com/iq1yk.png) **My question(s) is** :   How can I refine the plot so that the lines between colored regions don't appear so aliased and so that the space between the x-axis and the first unit is also colored? Also, how can I apply a temperature color scheme independent of the number of thermal units (the last two units are always hydro/blue and renewables/green)? EDIT 1 : I found a solution for the coloring of the first unit, by adding a list of zeros as a first "unit" (I had to change the `colors` list to take into account this extra first "unit"):               accunits2 = Table[Accumulate[Transpose[Prepend[allunits2[[i, j]], Table[0, {p, Range[24]}]]][[k]]], {k,Range[24]}]      Cheers, E
