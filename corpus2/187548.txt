The very simple piece of C++ code below is incorrect, it's easy to see why and tools like Valgrind will tell you. In running several C++ codes containing this kind of error, I noticed that each time, it ended up with a `Segmentation fault` at the line which tries to use the address. So my question is: is it safe to claim that trying to use an address before it's allocated will **inevitably** lead to a `Segmentation violation` at the corresponding line?               class ClassType     {       public:int data_;     };          ....     // Using address before it's allocated     ClassType * ClassType_ptr;     int x = ClassType_ptr->data_;
