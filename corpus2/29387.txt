When trying to export an `Image` as PNG the resulting file is a completely black image. This happens only for certain images I have not been able to determine exactly which, so I uploaded a notebook that triggers it. Is this a known bug with a known fix? ![brokenness screenshot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/thXBI.png) Some system info:               Fedora 19 3.9.9-302.fc19.x86_64     Mathematica 8.0.4     8Gb RAM
