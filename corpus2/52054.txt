I am trying to generate C code for some functions, which I do not post in full because they are a few hundred lines long. The functions do nothing too fancy: a bunch of dot products, powers and roots. Still, when compiling to C code Mathematica sticks in some unwanted dependency on its own libraries, which is not acceptable for the use case in question. The functions I am trying to compile have 5 arguments, 4 of which are 3-dimensional vectors. The compile printout of one of them can be found **here**. As you can see, there are 3 Mathematica functions being pulled in: DotVV, Power and Internal`ReciprocalSqrt. Is there any way I can get rid of these without modifying the code manually? **Edit:** here is the code I am using to compile the function               Compile[{{pos, _Real, 1} , {a, _Real, 1}, {v, _Real, 1}, {ba, _Real,          1} , {V, _Real}} ,        xSol, CompilationTarget -> "C"];
