I just started writing some new class and it occurred to me that I was adding a lot of method arguments that are not strictly needed. This is following a habit to avoid having state in classes that is specific to some method call, rather than being general configuration or dependencies of the class. Doing so means that a lot of methods that could have no arguments end up with one, two or three. I'd like to hear your opinions on what you think of this tradeoff, and how you go about deciding which approach to take in what situation? Since code is often easier to understand than English when describing code, I created a little gist that has both variants in it: https://gist.github.com/JeroenDeDauw/6525656
