Where can I find some references concerning when to use options and when to use multiple arguments in designing and writing functions? Seems most built-in functions have arguments less than 3 and with a large number of options. Are you confusing at the choice of using arguments or options? And sometimes too many arguments which are ordered, the bad thing is that we may forget how to pass parameters with the right order. This is saying that, when using options, we don't care the order of options, just pick the ones needed. Sometimes multiple arguments could be combined to one list argument. Sometimes multiple arguments are convenient to be implemented into the rough/original demo functions. Sometimes multiple arguments are more frequently used in some of my short-run functions. Sometimes options will be added to some of my old functions, and especially long-run functions. Sometimes options can be well inherited and translated from different functions.
