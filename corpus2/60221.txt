Currently in the 4th semester of engineering in an Indian university. The thing is - is it better to do as many short-lived projects/research work on diverse topics of computer science or stick to one/two projects consistently throughout my undergraduate years? Case in point: currently working on an image-processing project that promises to carry on for a year or so (as per the prof). Does this seem like being over-specialized at too early a level? Although taking on too many things will spread me out thin and in all probability not end up getting any meaningful work done. Especially as I hope to apply for grad school in the US. Would really appreciate any views and suggestions on this.
