![Four Cuboids](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mFupy.jpg)    I have a number of cuboids intersecting as illustrated. I would like to see their intersection, almost the view from inside. Setting the `ViewPoint` to `{0,0,0}` does not reveal much of the structure. Is there some way to visualize this with clever `Graphics[]` options, or must I compute the convex polyhedron that is the intersection of the cuboids (which is really what I want to see)? **Solved by Jens:**   ![Cuboids4](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9w2O7.jpg)
