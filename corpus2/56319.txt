Mathematica 10 provides beautiful high-level machine learning functionality. Sadly, the learned functions once created are rather opaque objects. I need to use them in other projects, so here is my question: **Can I export the neural networks, random forest decision trees, or any other internals of the learned functions for externally use, e.g. can I export a neural net into a standard FANN File format.** PS. My real hope is to use _Mathematica_ **V10** to generate machine-vision convolutional neural networks and then embed them within my clojure, pythons and iOS projects.
