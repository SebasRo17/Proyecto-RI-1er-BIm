I was creating a class diagram for an application I was working on today and I didnt include the JPA entities since I had all the information I thought was important in my DAOs, for example, I just care about how to register a user regardless of what information does a User object contain, so I only included the UserDao in my class diagram and added an operation called register which has a parameter of type User without having a User class in my diagram. My question is if its necessary to include every single class I have in my diagram or can I omit the classes that I will be forced to add because I am using a certain framework such as JSF or JPA?
