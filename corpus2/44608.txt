I have searched, but didn't find much help on my issue. I have an optical physics problem that I'm working on ..               apeture = 1*10^-6;     r = Range[100];     k = Range[100];     λ = 632.8 * 10^-9;     pal = Pi*(apeture/λ);     θr = (r - 50)*(Pi/90);     field = Array[0 &, {k, r}];     Intensity = 1*(Sin[pal*Sin[θr]]/pal*Sin[θr])^2      admittedly I am a newcomer to Mathematica but not to programming. I operate mainly in embedded C but "speak" Python, Java, and Ada as well. So please understand that my question is mostly about using Mathematica. What I need is a n x m matrix 100 entries square that the Intensity function maps onto down each row. When the matrix is populated, I create a copy of it, rotate it by pi/2 and add the two. Once done, I plot the result. This is to study the interference patterns of orthogonal single-slit diffraction (Mill's Cross effects). An Edit for Clarity: Once the initial conditions are set, I need to place a function output in each row of the matrix. The columns are identical (at first). Then, I perform a 90 degree rotation of the matrix (CW or CCW.. doesn't matter as long as the results are orthogonal) and add the two. The resultant is an interference matrix that can be plotted. My questions in this regard:   1. Do I need to write a loop to do this, or can I write a compound statement like I have seen in other programs (MathCAD and MATLAB) that will automatically propagate the values in the matrix?   2. After reading the various posts on matrix rotation, I'm not entirely convinced of the best method. Suggestions are appreciated. Thanks for your help!
