Please consider the following: I need to extract from `MyList` all last parts of each 3-tuple.               MyList={              {{0.`, 2, 5}},              {{0.`, 1, 8},{10.`, 10, 10},{10.`, 6, 2.5}},              {{0.`, 1.25, 10},{0.`, 8.9, 100}}            };      I tried to apply the following but it did not work:               MyList /. {a_Number, b_Number, c_Number} :> c      Please note, that `a`,`b` and `c` must be of `Number`, otherwise the last 3-tuple of `MyList[[2]]` would be extracted to, since it `MyList[[2]]` itself represents a 3-tuple. The result must be:               {{5},{8,10,2.5},{10,100}}
