I'm working with web development since 2009, when I started with PHP. When I moved to ASP.NET I've heard a lot about DDD and OOAD where a lot of focus is given to this "business logic" and "business rules". The point is that all the apps I've developed until now were all about CRUD operations and I've never seem these things in practice. I simply can't imagine what those things can really be in practice. So, what really is this business logic and how this fits into an app? I know these are implemented as methods in domain models, but what those methods could possibly be, and where in the application they could possibly used?
