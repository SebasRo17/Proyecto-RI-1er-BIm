One of the code bases I work on has a development environment that is running on a dev server and cannot be copied over to my PC to locally test and develop. I am wondering what is the proper way to work with this code base? It is object oriented and I have found it to be very tedious and time consuming to do my work using Vim when working on such a codebase. I have another project which I have running locally and I like to use Eclipse and sometimes Sublime text to make changes to the codebase. Is there a way to utilize such tools that I use locally with a remote project, and if so what is the proper way to set this up? Should I remotely mount my system? We do have git/hg setup with these environments however I like to test and debug things in very small changes and this would produce a lot of commits that are un-needed. As well it is also time consuming. Ideally it would be great to just be able to work like it is a local environment and when I save and refresh a page the change is there. Is my best solution mounting?
