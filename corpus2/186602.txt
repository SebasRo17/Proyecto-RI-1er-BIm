I have made a java program that allows to mark an exam made by one student. In the interface the student chooses between a set of options for each question, and by an array (that holds the correct answers) I get the score of the student. By the way this simple program is made using console java, no swing or applets at all. The information of which answers are correct are stored in a vector, so each answer of the students is compared with this vector for getting the final score. I would like to put his program into one domain that I recently got, so that one student at the moment of entering into the webpage could make the exam; and another program installed in the server will check the correct answers and give other questions, in case the student wants to practice. One friend told me that it is possible to wrap the console java application into java for web, but I just dont know the details for doing that. What would anybody suggest or if there is any online tutorial that could help me with that? My domain has the following extensions:   * FTP    * MySQL    * Apache    * SharedTomcat Please this is not a discussion to know which tool is better, I want just to use Java, but I am pretty lost with all the web technologies that one can use with this language.
