I'm looking to create a comparison and ranking system which allows users to view 2 items, click on the one that they feel is the better one and then get presented with 2 more random items and continue to do this until they decide to stop. In the background, I want the system to use these wins and loses to rank each item in an overall ranking table so I can then see what is #1 and what isn't. I haven't got a clue where to begin with the formula, but I image I need to log wins and loses. Any help/direction appreciated!
