I'm using a code sample from MSDN in my project. Accompanying the sample is this license: http://pastebin.com/K46NYf69 I've modified the code sample slightly to better suit my needs and I now want to release my program as open source. However, I'm not sure which licenses are compatible with this license because I cannot find it on Google. The license claims it is a Microsoft _Permissive_ License but I can only find Microsoft _Public_ License. Also, I'm not completely sure what this license allows. Can I modify the sample? Can I package it in my project under another license like the GPL or the Apache/BSD license? Thanks for reading.
