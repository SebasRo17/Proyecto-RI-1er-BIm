At work, we have a software written in PL/SQL - Oracle Forms 10g, which runs the software as a Java Applet. My Company bought the software and we have to develop the software, but we feel that Oracle Forms 10g Technology with Java applet is out of date. It's a technology from the past decade and we must move the software to a different platform (ie. Web or some other platform). Is this a good or bad idea? And why?
