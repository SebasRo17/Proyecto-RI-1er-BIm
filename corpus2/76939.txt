Relevant XKCD There are many sites on the Internet that require login information, and the only way to protect against password reusing is the "promise" that the passwords are hashed on the server, which is not always true. So I wonder, how hard is to make a webpage that hashes passwords in the client computer (with Javascript), before sending them to the server, where they would be re-hashed? In theory this doesn't give any extra security, but in practice this can be used to protect against "rogue sites" that don't hash your password in the server.
