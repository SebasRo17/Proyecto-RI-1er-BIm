> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Do programmers need a union? I have come across this website that is a trade union for Android Developers http://www.andevuni.org/ I was inspired to search for a trade union after this post Should developers accept overtime/weekend work/denied bonus payments? which was featured on Hacker News How effective could a trade union be to improve working conditions for Software Developers, more precisly, Android developers? I am an Android developer myself, and I am planning to release my app in a month or so. Could this petition by the trade union be effective at renegotiating the 32% Google tax on Android apps? If yes, should I wait with releasing my app?
