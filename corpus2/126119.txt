I am a Web Developer (working with PHP/WordPress/Symfony2) in a small company (still hiring but at the moment 5 staff), has ~8 months experience (currently a Computer Science student) and asked to fulfill more of a Project Manager role. I am not really even good at personal time management nor would I say my programming is that outstanding yet (still learning, frequently stuck on errors, sometimes server fault eg. setting up a development server and SVN). In reality, it appears compared to my peers, its actually good, but thinking about Google, Microsoft or even err ... Oracle maybe, my skills are probably quite lacking still I thought either way, its a good learning opportunity. How do I start? I think I need to have a proper way of collaboration or communicating each others progress and documentation. Theres SVN but being relatively new, it slows things down sometimes. How do I assign work such that people dont mess up other's code? I actually caused a colleague quite a headache when I edited some configuration, meant for personal development use. I found myself waiting for another colleagues work (user management/login/registration) to be able to complete mine (ACL part for my "module", similar to blog posts). I actually wanted to "fake" a logged in user, but that didnt work out (entirely)
