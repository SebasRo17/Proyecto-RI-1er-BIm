A couple of weeks ago I got a new job as a studentworker for a webagency. The job is 15-20 hours of week. Even though I am new in the company, I feel right at home and I enjoy working with my co-workers. To start of with, I was assigned to work on an internal tool in the company, in order to learn their systems and their development platform. The deadline for this project is this week, and I am right on time. But today (wednesday at noon) I received an email from my boss, asking me to do a new project that has a deadline at friday morning. The new assignment alone will be hard to finish on time, and on top of that I need to finish the other assignment on time. My question is: How do I handle my boss expecting me to be a superhero? **EDIT:** I will talk to my boss about delaying one of the projects. But another problem is that the new assignment will be hard to do on time (friday morning). I didn't have a say on the deadline - I just got a mail telling me the deadline. I am new in the company and want to stay, but I don't want to start off on the wrong foot with the boss.
