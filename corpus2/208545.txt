Today I asked myself a quite fundamental question, well .. I guess it is one. But google- and SEing couldn't give me the answer I was looking for. I'm writing programs for quite a few years now, but the languages in which they were written, was always given by higher seniors, customers or by myself for learning purpose. Let's say for instance that I want to write a application with basic functions, like database access, calling webservices and so on.   Which language should be used, and why? Ignoring factors like cross- platforming, UI, which DB system or webservices are used ... imagine something like a black body in physics. As example, why should I use Java over C++ or Python over Ruby? Not saying that this question is limited to these languages. Are there good reasons for choosing an specific language, like performance or memory usage, or is it, in case of a "black-body-situation", just the personal preference which determines the actual used language? Thanks in advance. ... and sorry if this question is to general.
