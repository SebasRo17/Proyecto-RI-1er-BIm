I manually evaluate this cell to set Prime[0]               Unprotect[Prime]     Prime[0] = 1     Protect[Prime]         I manually evaluate this cell to reset Prime[0]               Unprotect[Prime]     Prime[0] =.     Protect[Prime]        In case I forget to do it, is there a way to automatically evaluate the second cell when I close the nb? **Motivation** I'm working with bags of primes and want to use $p_0$ as the bag for all prime greater than the square-root of some $n$. Displayed as: $\left\{p_0^1,p_1^5,p_2^2,p_3^1,p_4^1\right\}$ With counts as: $\left\{1,5,2,1,1\right\}$
