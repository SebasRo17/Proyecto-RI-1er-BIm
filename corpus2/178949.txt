We are on the verge of a conversion. For years, our company supported only IE for its internal (intranet) home-built tools. Since a few of our users are still on XP, which means IE only goes up to 8... a heavily JS / jQuery site wont even load! We have been in the process of converting to use Chrome instead, to make use of its javascript performance. But, it has now been suggested that we support all common browsers... internally for these tools. Which means more development time to scale-back some of these new applications, more time to test in all browsers, and we are already under staffed. Are there any good informational sites/posts out there, that already make this argument?
