As we all know our site's logo was completely generated by Mathematica. I suppose it is quite natural to make the next step -- to generate the animated version of this logo. There's a lot of space for creativity here, and I suggest to consider the following options.   1. Animated process of construction from scratch, as it is described in Verbeia's blog post.   2. Animated morphing of original pentagonal star to the current heptagonal one (J.M.'s idea in the comment)   3. Some less fussy, a neutral animation of the logo itself, more suitable for placing on webpages.
