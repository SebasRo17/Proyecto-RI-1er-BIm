* Which are C# 4.0 programming paradigms?   * In what category does extension methods fall into? > A programming language can support multiple paradigms. For example, programs > written in C++ or Object Pascal can be purely procedural, or purely object- > oriented, or contain elements of both paradigms. > > In object-oriented programming, programmers can think of a program as a > collection of interacting objects, while in functional programming a program > can be thought of as a sequence of stateless function evaluations. When > programming computers or systems with many processors, process-oriented > programming allows programmers to think about applications as sets of > concurrent processes acting upon logically shared data structures. > > Just as different groups in software engineering advocate different > methodologies, different programming languages advocate different > programming paradigms.
