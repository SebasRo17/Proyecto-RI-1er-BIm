I've found many Code Review tools:   * Phabricator (by Facebook) - http://phabricator.org/   * Rietveld (by Google) - http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/rietveld.html   * GitHub - https://github.com/   * Crucible - http://www.atlassian.com/software/crucible/overview   * GitLab - http://gitlabhq.com/demo.html   * SmartBear - http://smartbear.com/products/software-development/code-review   * etc. But didn't found any, which would be directly connected with the versioning system. As I want the code review proccess to be required, so nobody can push any single line of unreviewed code to master, I need my versioning system to **deny all pushes of revisions which were not reviewed yet**. Is there any tool which does that? Or is there any easy way how to do that?
