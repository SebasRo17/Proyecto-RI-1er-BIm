I'm currently running a start-up with a buddy and I noticed that some of my university assignments could be finished by simply copying some code from some of the programs we've developed. Are there any legal troubles I could run into? Or is this just a bad idea in general(as it is starting to feel right now)? Sorry if this is in the wrong place I wasn't sure whether to place this here or in stackoverflow.
