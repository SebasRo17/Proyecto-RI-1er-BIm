here's a simple question: I have a function:               Compile[{T, μ, dq, ω, m},       Module[{s = 0.0 + 0.0 I, mu = -10*T},        Do[s = s + 0.1*T*(expr), {mu, -10.0 T, 10.0 T, 0.1 T}]; s], CompilationTarget -> "C"]      where `expr` is some long expression assigned before. I cannot make this work other that manually copy-pasting an explicit long expression for expr. I tried `Evaluate` and some combinations of `ReleaseHold`, but it did not work for me. Any ideas?
