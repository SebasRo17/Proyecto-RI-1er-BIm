Currently we use Scrum with the exception that our Scrum Masters sometimes act as project managers rather than facilitators of the Scrum process. About half of the time team members pull tasks on their own, but half of the time the Scrum Master assigns the tasks to team members. I would like us to fully adopt self-organizing teams. However when we tried giving team members more decision-making power, it led to very long arguments between team members, and since there would be no one with the final say, these arguments would block progress. Do you think there is a way to minimize arguments with self-organizing Scrum teams?
