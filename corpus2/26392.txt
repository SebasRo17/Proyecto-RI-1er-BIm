I am new to Mathematica so the my questions might be pretty much at the pupil's level. If I want to use differentiation to derive:                   (fg)' = f'g + g'f      How can I keep empty symbol `f, g` from been evaluated for derivative and get 0? For example if I use                   D[f g, x]      I immediately get 0 result. I guess it might be related to **hold** , but couldn't find out the correct way to get it work.
