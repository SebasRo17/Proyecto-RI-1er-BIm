In _Mathematica_ version 10, `HoldForm` no longer produces the same results as in version 8 ( **edit:** I only have versions 10 and 8 installed, so can't compare to version 9 directly). Here are some examples (on Mac OS X): **Formatting of`\\[ScriptCapitalE]`** This symbol is output correctly:               InputForm[ℰ]      > `ℰ` But when wrapped as follows, I get gibberish:               HoldForm[InputForm[ℰ]]      > `â °` **Arguments in`HoldForm`aren't held** Why would I want to use `InputForm` inside `HoldForm` in the first place? Here is one example, using the constant `E`. I would like it to be displayed as `E`:               HoldForm[InputForm[E]]      > `E` On the other hand, the constant is formatted differently if I leave out `InputForm`:               HoldForm[E]      > `` So why not use `InputForm` without `HoldForm`? Because then I can't write assignments like this:               HoldForm[InputForm[E = 1]]      > `E = 1` Here, I get no error because of `HoldForm`. So far, so good. But now things become inconsistent again if I put the same construct into a `Plot`:               Plot[x^2, {x, -2, 2}, AxesLabel -> {x, HoldForm[InputForm[E = 1]]}]      ![plot error](http://i.stack.imgur.com/i4D08.png) This used to work in version 8, but now it throws an error. The resulting plot is still correct, but the messages seem to indicate that `HoldForm` was ignored at some stage. Indeed, I then proceeded to do a more basic test:               Clear[x];     Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 1}, AxesLabel -> {"x", HoldForm[x = 3]}];     x      > `3` Yes, that's right. `HoldForm` was completely ignored. What can be done to fix this? **Edit** I tried to report the issue, but am currently receiving web form errors at the Wolfram site, so will have to try again later.
