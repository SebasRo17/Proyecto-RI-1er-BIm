Suppose I have `MyClass` with a very simple dependency. It uses constructor injection.               public class MyClass : IMyClass     {         private IA A;              public MyClass(IA a)         {             A = a;         }     }      This code get shipped and some other developers are using it.   At some point in the future I need to add in a second dependency, on IB. **How should I add this dependency on IB?** Some options, and why I disapprove:   * Just add it to the constructor      * Braking change.   * Inheritance or the decorator pattern.      * Extra classes and code bloat.     * New class will have boilerplate code passing around the IA.     * I have no guarantee that other developers will switch to using the new class.   * Use a service locator to populate the new IB field.      * I'm now using two different types of injection for extra confusion. It seems to me that constructor injection is just not easily extensible.
