Given sorted data, the search solution is obvious. Given unsorted data, sensible options are sort then search or just linear search. This question is about what to do if the data is _somewhat_ sorted, **but cannot be re-organized** (write operations require sector erase, and sectors won't fit in ram). the details: Data records are logged **sequentially with a timestamp**. The timestamp clock however, from time to **time resets to Epoch** for a while before it's synced or it's simply adjusted back due to daylight savings etc. The search result should be the log record with timestamp closest to the time specified. While performing a binary search for record at a particular timestamp, it is possible to land on a patch of discontiguous log data, and pivot the wrong direction. Besides a brute linear method, is there a heuristic we can take advantage of here? e.g. a Simplex Search immune to local minima? **update:** We can assume about 95% of the records are in sorted sequence. about 5% (scattered through the log) are the dirty hiccups. The the beginning of the hiccups _can_ be identified when the timestamp goes backwards in time and **and have an earlier stamp than the beginning of the log**
