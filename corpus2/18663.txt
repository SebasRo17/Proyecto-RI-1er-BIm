I am wondering what are the general tips & hints for speeding up symbolic integration. As far as I understand, it solely depends on the form a function is represented before it is processed by `Integrate`. So, `Simplify`, `ExpandAll`, `PowerExpand` _etc._ should be used. Are there any other strategies? My monster function (it looks relatively simple, though) is:               f[r_]:=(A^(2) E^((2 r α)/(3)) α^(3) (A^(8/3) \     (-0.002396-0.001198 r α)+E^((8 r α)/(3)) α^(4) \     (0.00001755-(8.776*10^(-6)) r α)+A^(4/3) E^((4 r \     α)/(3)) α^(2) (-0.0002734+0.0004785 r α)))/(r \     (1.000 A^(4/3)+0.02853 E^((4 r α)/(3)) α^(2))^(4))      or (TeX) $$ \frac{A^2 \alpha ^3 e^{\frac{2 \alpha r}{3}} \left(\alpha ^4 \ e^{\frac{8 \alpha r}{3}} \left(0.00001755-\alpha r \left(8.776 \times 10^{-6}\right)\right)+\alpha ^2 A^{4/3} (0.0004785 \alpha \ r-0.0002734) e^{\frac{4 \alpha r}{3}}+A^{8/3} (-0.001198 \alpha \ r-0.002396)\right)}{r \left(0.02853 \alpha ^2 e^{\frac{4 \alpha \ r}{3}}+1.000 A^{4/3}\right)^4} $$ where $\alpha > 0$ and $A > 0$ are some parameters. What I am trying to do: `Integrate[f[r]*r^2*4*Pi,{r,O,Infinity}]` Sure, I could have used `NIntegrate` for some specific $\alpha$ and $A$ (and belive me, I did it:), but now I am interested in the general result. Seems like the situation is hopeless, because my laptop can not handle it.
