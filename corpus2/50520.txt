I am in a bit of a bind. I have been contracted to create a small suite of applications for Android, iOS and WP7. Currently I am also on the market for a new notebook for development. Now the issue I have is I can either buy a consumer grade macbook and a laptop or I could just buy an 8gb Ram, SSD, i7 mackbook and virtualise windows 7. I have never used a mac or macbook before so before I go purchase anything I would like to know what your thoughts are on this. Has anyone any experience with this?
