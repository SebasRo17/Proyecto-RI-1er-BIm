At my company, there is a habit for the engineers to refer to their respective hardware/firmware/software in the first-person as if the device they are responsible for is a manifestation of themselves. I'll give you an example: > **Hardware Engineer:** "I don't receive the first byte, so I stay off." > > **Software Engineer:** "I'm sending you the first byte after the ack flag, > so I thought you were getting it." > > **Hardware Engineer:** "No, you're not turning me on." It was this very example I overheard today that nearly had me giggling in fits. _"You're not turning me on."_ Well, I should hope not! So, is it common practice for engineers to do this, or simply unprofessional? Any suggestions for changing this apparently bad habit?
