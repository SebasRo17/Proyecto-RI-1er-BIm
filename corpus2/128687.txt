Quite a few of my friends want to have their own personal website to showcase their talents. However, they don't want to deal with such technical things as writing html and managing web server. Neither do I. It would be nice that we go to our URL and view our pages and we edit and update our information when logging in. So basically the content displayed will be what we provide and at the same time we can choose from some provided templates for page layout and style. It seems a typical content management system to me. If it is, I'd like to build a simple one myself because I'd like to have the experience of building a simple CMS. Since I have no previous experience for this, I need some help figuring out what is all I need for it. And, what are the most appropriate tools and technologies? So far, I have **html** , **css** , **JSP** , **Tomcat** , **SQLite** in my mind. Is that enough? Are they the best combination? Also, I have no idea how to approach the authorization and security aspects of building the system. (PS: I'm not sure what tags are proper for my question. Feel free to edit them for me)
