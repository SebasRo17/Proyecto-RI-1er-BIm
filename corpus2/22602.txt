I'm a newbie at Mathematica and I couldn't find how to label the maximum and the zero of a simple function in `Plot` with their names:               rho[r_] = 1 - r^2;     Plot[rho[r], {r, -1, 1}, AxesLabel -> {r, \[Rho]}]       and i want to show the maximum on the plot with               Subscript[\[Rho], c]      and the point rho[1] with               Subscript[R, TF]
