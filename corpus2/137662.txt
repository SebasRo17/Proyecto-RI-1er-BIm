I just want to make sure I'm using the right license for my open source API wrapper project for some social networks and also make sure I understand it. Could you just describe the basics of that license? What I can and can't do, etc? Does these things suit the GPLv2 license:   * Open Source'ness   * Ability to use it in your own project   * But also give credit for it on ones website and keep copyright notices at the top of source files   * Have control over it as in if you don't like how someone is using your code, you can report it somewhere after contacting the developer.   * I would also like to make commercial versions and add ads to my project - so exceptions in the license would be noted. * * * Thank you all for your answers and comments. I've gone with the shorter and easier to understand New BSD License (BSD). Thanks anyway.
