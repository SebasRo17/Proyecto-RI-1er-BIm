My .NET application makes its work and then creating a report (an Excel worksheet). The report holds thousands of short text strings [KEY - VALUE], so excel worksheets suites very well, one column holds keys and another holds values. It's easy to examine this reports. But because of performance issues now i'm trying to find another file format to create reports in .NET in a way that's easy to manually examine, like a table or plain text. So what kind of file can I choose? Sorry my bad english.
