On mathematica 9 when you begin to type a special character you get a popup window that allows you to autocomplete it like such: ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/VBR06.png) However, when you try the same with an input alias like ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/MZAED.png) no autocomplete appears. Is it possible to add the input alias to the autocomplete box and have them appear there like the special characters?
