I've been thrown head-first into a new job developing web applications in PHP. I'm by no means new to PHP, but I haven't developed large-scale applications before. I'm wondering how to structure my development to avoid setting myself up for problems in the future. How do I design and architect my applications in a sound way that allows them to scale over time in terms of functionality and performance. I'm thinking of things like:   * Separating back end from front end   * Directory structures I would appreciate pointers to architectural and application design patterns, frameworks and methods that allow me to approach large-scale PHP web application development in a sustainable way.
