I know, that I can change the color of a function with the help of PlotStyle:               Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 3 Pi}, PlotStyle -> {Green, Thickness[0.01]}]      I also know, that I can vary the color in relation to the function value:               Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 3 Pi}, PlotStyle -> {Thickness[0.01]},       ColorFunction -> "BlueGreenYellow"]      I wonder if it is possible to change the thickness of a plotted function dependent on the function value, for example the absolute value of the function. For the example above a nice thing would be to have, that the line is e.g. **twice as thick** at the minima and the maxima as it is at the roots.
