I was wondering if ffmpeg supported gpu acceleration. I was reading on their websites and came across contradicting information. http://www.ffmpeg.org/general.html#Video-Codecs -H.264 / AVC / MPEG-4 AVC / MPEG-4 part 10 (VDPAU acceleration) http://ffmpeg.org/trac/ffmpeg/wiki/x264EncodingGuide -Will a graphics card make x264 encode faster? No. libx264 doesn't use them (at least not yet). There are some proprietary encoders that utilize the GPU, but that does not mean they are well optimized, though encoding time may be faster; and they might be worse than x264 anyway, and possibly slower. Regardless, FFmpeg today doesn't support any means of gpu encoding, outside of libx264. If not, is there any way to add gpu acceleration to h.264 encoding/decoding?
