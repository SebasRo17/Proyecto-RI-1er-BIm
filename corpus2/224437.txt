Trying to make our shop an agile environment, we struggle with some bits and pieces of that world. While not making it waterfally, we do have to have some sort of agreement on what a new feature needs to do. We follow the KISS and "minimally viable product" principle. Still, after discussing a story, we end up with:   * UI/UX design   * Acceptance criteria   * Constraints   * Use cases   * Some extra specifications (like what fields to show in tables etc) As tools we use JIRA, Greenhopper, Balsamiq, Glyphy and Confluence and they are working very well but we're not quite sure where to store which bits and how to make this work together well. How do you guys approach that. Please include details on how far you go detailing the feature before development starts.
