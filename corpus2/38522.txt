I have a higher dimensional function: $$f(x,t)=-\ln(t)-\ln(1-\left\|x\right\|^2-t^2)$$ where $x\in\mathbb{R}^n,~t\in\mathbb{R}$. I want to compute the derivatives with the commands               D[f, xi]     D[f, t]     D[f, xi, t]       and higher, to check my own computations which I do by hand. I dont know how to define the function $f$ to apply the commands. Im new _Mathematica_ user and I've not found a right solution Documentation Center.
