I have started using _Mathematica_ to automate file backup operations. The logistics I need make _Mathematica_ a good choice. I am testing and developing the Notebook manually, and `Print` outputs document the operational events. The saved Notebook provides a record of the process for that day. I would like to have an easy way to direct Print output to a separate file, for example, by adding               DirectPrintOutputTo["filename "<>DateList["Year","Month","Day"]<>".txt"]       at the beginning of a Notebook. The advantages of this approach seem obvious. I assume I would need to load my function from a package before calling it. Is something like this this possible? Any suggestions about how to do it? Alternatively, maybe I could write a print function called `PrintTo` that would, on first use, open an output file with the name assigned to `printToFileName`, and I could use the editor to change all the `Print` functions to `PrintTo` functions. Not so fancy, but I think I know how to how to do it. I think that I answered my own question, in the sense that my alternative idea seems straightforward and pretty implementable.
