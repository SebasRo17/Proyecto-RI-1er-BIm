I have a list `{{a1, a2, a3},{b1, b2, b3}, ...}` and I want to replace the numbers less than 10 by `0x` (just insert a 0 before the element, so that `2 -> 02`, `3 -> 03`, etc). How can I do that? To clarify, I will later export this table and run it through a program that will upload it to a database. These number are identifications for different objects, and for some reason the list needs to be all aligned. If I just export it as it is, I would get something like > >     1  2  3 >     20  40  55 >   which the program can't read.
