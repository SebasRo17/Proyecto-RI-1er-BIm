Let's say that we have an application, with two (or more) different versions. E.g. Professional and Lite editions. What would be the best way to keep the source under version control (DVCS in particular). The assumption here is that some or most of the code is common, but the Professional edition has some extra code as well. What would be the optimum way of versioning the code with a system like git or Mercurial?
