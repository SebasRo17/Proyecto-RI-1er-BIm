I'm trying to build a head that recognizes molecules. Here's the code               Mol::arg = "Invalid molecule.";     Mol[Except[Subscript[_String, _Integer] ..]] := Message[Mol::arg]      I'd expect that this code should recognize molecules of the form               Mol[Subscript["C", 4], Subscript["N", 5]]      but it should issue the message if something like               Mol[Subscript["C", 4], 7]      is entered. However, when I enter this last one, no message is issued. I don't understand what I'm doing wrong.
