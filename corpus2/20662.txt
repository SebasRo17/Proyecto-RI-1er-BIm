I have this function.               SetAttributes[zf,HoldAllComplete];     zf[x_] :=        If[Denominator[Unevaluated[x]] == 0,          Numerator[Unevaluated[x]],          Numerator[Unevaluated[x]]];      It is supposed to just return the numerator anytime the denominator is 0.               zf[1/0]      > 1               Cos[-(3*Pi)/2]      > 0               zf[1/Cos[-(3*Pi)/2]]      > ComplexInfinity It works fine when the denominator is literally 0, but it fails when there are functions/variables, such as when `Cos[x] == 0`. How would I go about evaluating the denominator separately, then if that equals zero, drop the denominator, and evaluate the numerator only without evaluating the entire fraction? Basically my question is how do I make `zf[1/Cos[-(3*Pi)/2]]` output `1`?
