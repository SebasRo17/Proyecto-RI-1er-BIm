I've made a multiplication table with this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/splld.jpg) Then I removed the repeated permutations with:               gg = Range[1, 10]; Subsets[gg, {2}] // TableForm      Now, when the multiplication table has the repeated permutations removed, this table is now similar to a triangle: (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5) (1,6) (1,7) (1,8) (1,9) (1,10) - 10 multiplications (2,3) (2,4) (2,5) (2,6) (2,7) (2,8) (2,9) (2,10) - 9 multiplications ... (9,10) - 1 multiplication How can I build a triangular table based on this? I'm trying to use arithmetical progression precedure like:               gg = Range[1, 10]; x = 1; gb = {};     While[x <= 9, AppendTo[gb, Take[Subsets[gg, {2}], {H, J}]]; x++]      I was thinking on doing               gg = Range[1, 10]; x = 1; gb = {};     H=0;J=0;     While[x <= 9, AppendTo[gb, Take[Subsets[gg, {2}], {H=H+1, J=J-1}]]; x++]
