I have two vectors, one containing sampled energies and the other one for each of these energies a weight: `e(i)` and `w(i)`. I bin the energies `e(i)`. Now I want to compute the sum of weights `w` in each bin separately. I can bin the energies using `BinLists` and make a plot with `Histogram`. How do I perform the sum over weights in each bin? I would obviously need access to the indices `i` in each bin. Any elegant solution to this problem would be welcome.               e = {0.129454, 0.160294, 0.140456, 0.152359, 0.174006, 0.186969};     w = {2.12373*10^-6, 0.00029488, 5.68648*10^-6, 0.000100244, 2.28126*10^-6, 6.74131*10^-6};
