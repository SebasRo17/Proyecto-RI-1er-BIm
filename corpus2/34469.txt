Before you chastise me for asking this, I have an Adobe Air app that has a lot of investment in it, and if there is a way to utilize the existing code-base in _any_ way, it is worth considering. I have heard news reports in passing about Adobe creating some kind of tool to allow flash or air apps to be ported to native objective-c code, but the information found in google is mostly commentary on the one-time Apple blockade. My question(s) is/are this:   1. Is it even possible, at any level, to use an existing Air app to create a Mac Store app?   2. If possible, what are the resources I can use to accomplish this?
