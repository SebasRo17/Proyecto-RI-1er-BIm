I work for an in house IT shop. We use a scrum-like system. What we are struggling with now is getting the business owners to follow the process. They all like it in concept until they want something, then the process is for the other people. How do you convince them that following the process will give them more consistent results then just throwing a grenade over the fence and saying, "make it work".
