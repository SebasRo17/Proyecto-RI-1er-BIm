In two and half months I have successfully brought a team from the brink of doom to being a successful development team. The project is a using new .net technologies (MVC, EF), has new tools, and the team members have a large say in how a feature will be created, designed and implemented. What I want to do for the team is to keep this momentum going. I think the motivation is good and the project is interesting enough that it won't bore someone just yet, but I know that as time goes on, doing the same thing over and over lowers the interest level. What as a team lead can I do to make sure that we keep up this high level of motivation we have right now?
