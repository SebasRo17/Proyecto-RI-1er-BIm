For example, the substitution `(x + y) -> s` fails here:               In[1]:= (-x - y) /. (x + y) -> s          Out[1]= -x - y      Of course, I could try applying the rule `(-x - y) -> -s`, but this strategy becomes unwieldy in more complicated cases. At the very least it would require duplicating a lot of rules. For example, if the expression to be transformed were something like               (x + y)^2 + 2 (-x - y)      ...then I'd need to use something like               {(x + y) -> s, (-x - y) -> -s}      Is there a better way to transform the above expression to `s^2 - 2 s`?
