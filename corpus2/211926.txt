I have a question that I really can't find a straight answer to. Let me start by saying I'm not asking for a step by step tutorial, or even plan on doing anything. I'm just curious. I've been reading up all day on the development of operating systems, and how they're built from scratch. I have a pretty firm grip on the theory of it. However, there is one step I can't seem to find an answer for. Before the existence of a full on, tool filled operating system, how would one even write a simple boot loader for a computer that doesn't any have a boot loader, or anything for that matter, in its boot sector? What would the very first step be after acquiring a computer with the bare minimal? (I.e., screen, keyboard, processor, ram, hdd, floppy)
