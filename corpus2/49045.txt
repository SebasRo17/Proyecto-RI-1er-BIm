I have following set of coupled transcendental equations. $\tan^{-1} \left(\frac{\sigma+\beta}{K'-1}\right)+\tan^{-1} \left(\frac{\sigma-\beta}{K'-1}\right)=\frac{2 \sigma}{K'}\cos(\beta\tau)$   and   $\log\left(\frac{(K'-1)^2+(\sigma-\beta)^2}{(K'-1)^2+(\sigma+\beta)^2}\right)=\frac{4 \sigma}{K'}\sin(\beta\tau)$ Here K', $\sigma$ and $\beta$ are variables and $\tau=0.07$ is a constant. I want to obtain $\sigma$ vs K' curve (as shown in the attached figure) by eliminating $\beta$.   I tried to eliminate $\beta$ by using _Eliminate_ function of _Mathematica_ , but it gives:   _Eliminate::ifun: Inverse functions are being used by Eliminate, so some solutions may not be found; use Reduce for complete solution information._   When a tried using _Reduce_ , _Mathematica_ keeps on running and does not give anything.   I also tried using FindRoot and NSolve to find values of K' and $\sigma$ that satisfy these equations for a range of $\beta$ going from $-2\pi/\tau$ to $2\pi/\tau$, but I keep on get either $\sigma\approx 0$ or very high.                 Do[Print[FindRoot[{ArcTan[(sigma + beta)/(k - 1)] +        ArcTan[(sigma - beta)/(k - 1)] == ((2 sigma) Cos[0.07  beta])/k,      Log[((k - 1)^2 + (sigma - beta)^2)/((k - 1)^2 + (sigma +           beta)^2)] == ((4 sigma) Sin[0.07  beta])/k}, {{sigma,       2.5}, {k, 2.0}}]], {beta, -2 Pi/0.07, 2 Pi/0.07, 0.01}]      I am relatively new to Mathematica, so please suggest me ways to handle such equations.![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5Cq5j.jpg)
