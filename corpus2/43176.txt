Say I have an equation like               A + 5 B + 10 C == 0      and I want to have _Mathematica_ write this as               (A/5) + B + 2 C == 0      i.e., I want to pick a term (B in this case) and choose its coefficient (1 in this case) and have _Mathematica_ divide or multiply the equation appropriately. I can't figure out a way other than using Solve to solve the equation for B, but that's not ideal (especially since it moves B to the other side of the equation). ### Edit A good solution should also be something one can apply after a Collect, a Simplify, etc., without undoing those commands, since the equations I'm dealing with are much more complicated than this simple example!
