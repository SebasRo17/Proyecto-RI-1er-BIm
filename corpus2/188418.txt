As a Lead Programmer my responsibilities include calculating the deadlines of the projects. To do this I have discussion with related team players and calculate a deadline estimation. Sometimes, I got a scared voice from CTO saying that the estimated deadline is too much. Then I have to shorten the deadline. With a shorter deadline, programmers have to work with extra pressure. How can I represent (points) to the CTO that the calculated deadline is reasonable?
