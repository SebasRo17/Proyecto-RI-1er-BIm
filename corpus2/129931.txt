The webpage of Converge states that: > Converge has a macro-like facility that can embed domain specific languages > with arbitrary syntaxes into source files. I am most intrigued by the possibility to create domain specific languages. My understanding of the purpose of such languages, is that they enables the developer to become much more efficient when solving domain specific problems. So, I went on to read the "about" section. There are two examples of usage here, but none of them describe how the developer could save development-time by utilizing Converge. Can anyone come up with an example or refer me to an example? I am happy to read examples in other languages than Converge.
