> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Interviewing a developer who's skilled in a language you don't know I must interview people for a C# position we have. I work on the java side of the project, and master it quite well. When I interview for java position, I ask some technical-questions/programming-problems so I can make sure the candidate has solid skills, not just '5 years experience'. But I don't know C# at all. I could look for some questions online (and their answers), but if I ask them these questions, I might not be able to see clearly if their response is right or wrong, maybe they have a point in some way etc. Also I won't be able to follow up in any side discussion etc. So what I am basically asking is if someone with java/C# knowledge can think of questions that:   1. are deep enough to show the guy is solid   2. I (with java knowledge but zero C#) can discern their reply is good/reasonable/well thought or not.
