I created a plot with a horizontal BarLegend for TemperatureColors (see1). Code:               PlotLegends ->           Placed[BarLegend[{"TemperatureMap", {15, 30}},Ticks -> Table[i, {i, 15, 31, 1}], LegendMarkerSize -> 300,             LegendLabel -> "T(\[Degree]C)",             LabelStyle -> {Bold, Black, 11}], {Bottom, Center}]       Now I just want to have the BarLegend having the temperatures on it decreasing from left to right, means values and colors reversed with high temperatures on the left. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0d9Jk.jpg)
