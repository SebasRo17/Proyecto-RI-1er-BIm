I have heard of OOCSS some time ago, but never really looked into it. Today I did so, and I thought of the implications of applying OOCSS to a simple CSS theme. One problem I thought of is that, by its nature, OOCSS encourages DRYness and consequently the use of many concise classes that should be applied to elements by the HTML developer. As a CSS theme, I would assume it isn't something significant enough for a developer would go out of his/her way to add specific classes to their elements when writing HTML:               <button class="blue rounded no-border $etc">Button</button>      as opposed to:               <button>Button</button>      Perhaps the HTML developers would be OK with writing the extra code, although it seems there is just as much repeating code on the HTML side as there would be without OOCSS. So, is OOCSS not a one-size-fits-all methodology for writing CSS code, as in this example? Or am I not understanding things properly?
