For my own amusement and instruction I've been developing a C# / .NET library that is basically a wrapper around the Google Geocoding API. It simplifies the entire process and enables users to perform geocoding entirely within .NET code. At some point I was thinking of making the library freely available and, possibly, open-sourcing the entire project by uploading it to somewhere like GitHub or CodePlex. However, Google have a whole host of restrictions on using their service in their Terms of Service. One of these restrictions is: > Note: the Geocoding API may only be used in conjunction with a Google map; > geocoding results without displaying them on a map is prohibited. So my questions are:   1. If I do release my library for other people to use (for free) then do I need to include a license of some sort and does that need to reference the Google Terms of Service?   2. If people use my library in a way that violates Google's terms then who is responsible? I don't want to in anyway to open myself up for liability for other peoples' actions when using my code. **Edit:** I appreciate people here are not lawyers and I don't expect legal advice. I'm just more interested in what people have done in similar situations or would do in this situation. I'll won't hold anyone to account, honest!
