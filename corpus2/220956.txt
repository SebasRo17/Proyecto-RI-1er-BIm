I'm using some codes that I modified, from Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming to create another project, the project is released under GPL V2. The License agreement is written here, it says: Copyright Â© 1998-2002 by Peter Norvig. My question is: Were's almost in 2014, do I still have to include that license or did it expire and therefore I may use the codes anyway that I like?
