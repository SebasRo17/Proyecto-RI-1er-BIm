We have two C++ classes named `Important` and `Small` The class `Small` use a few methods and attributes from the class `Important`, but not all. Since our application is performance critical, instead of copying all attributes (possibly pointers) of `Important` that are needed by `Small` and redefine the few methods in `Small`, we decided to just let `Small` hold a pointer on `Important`. Can performance justify such a design choice?
