I have this expression for the correlation function for a rigid rotating molecule: $G(\tau) = 4 \pi \int \omega ^2 P_2[\cos (\omega \tau)] P(\omega) \, \mathrm{d}\omega \quad [1]$ where $P_2$ is a second order Legendre polynomial, and $P(\omega)$ is some distribution function. and they say "$P(\omega)$ can be solved either by a Fourier transform of Eg. 1 or by choosing an appropriate model for $P(\omega)$" An example of this 'done' in the book is: ![fft](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cTYSC.png) They say "(bottom graph) Angular velocity distribution functional $P(\omega)$ obtained from a Fourier Transform of $G(\tau)$ (the top graph)" I am quite confused how I go about obtaining this distribution via a Fourier transform. I tried a few functions in mathematica but got no where. Any help would be great. Thanks
