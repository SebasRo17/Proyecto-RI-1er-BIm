In the bar chart (with negative values)               BarChart[{{1, 2, 3}, -{4, 5, 6}},       ChartLabels -> {Placed[{"r1", "r2"}, Above],         Placed[{"c1", "c2", "c2"}, Below]}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QmI3s.png) the bar and group labels can be placed above and below the bars. How can I place the bar and group labels on the upper and lower frame axes like in the paired bar chart               PairedBarChart[{Range[4], Range[4]/2}, {Range[4], Range[4]/2},       ChartLabels -> {Placed[{"pair1", "pair2"}, Above],         Placed[{"g1", "g2"}, "LeftAxis"],         Placed[{"a", "b", "c", "d"}, "RightAxis"]}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ipx5E.png) where the labels are placed to the left and right axis by using `Placed[{"g1", "g2"}, "LeftAxis"]` and `Placed[{"a", "b", "c", "d"}, "RightAxis"]`? Unfortunately, this doesn't work with `BarChart` and "TopAxis" nor "BottomAxis".
