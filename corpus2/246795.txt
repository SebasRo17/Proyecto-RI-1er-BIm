I'm looking at using GCM to send notifications from my rails app to an Android app. The getting started guide says:               In the resulting configuration dialog, supply your server's IP address.      I'm using Heroku, so the IP address is changing frequently correct? Can I still use GCM? Was looking at using the rails gem and I couldn't find any documentation related to Heroku.
