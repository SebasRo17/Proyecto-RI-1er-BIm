Agile adoption can fail in some organizations, I even worked for a company where waterfall was the only (the true) way but only because they tried Agile on a project and failed. When I asked the people who still remembered that (I was a junior) I was shut down hard, like I was reminding them a bad nightmare that really happened. I don't know why the project failed. There are resources found on the web why Agile fails is some companies but the reason are mostly economic. So I thought I ask here fore some feedback. What are the reasons Agile adoption fails in some organizations? Or, another way of putting it.. What do you need to succeed with Agile?
