If I have two lists:               list1 = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}};          list2 = {{5, 6}, {7, 8}};      I want to export these two lists to an Excel file and have `list1` in a a worksheet called "list1" and `list2` in a worksheet called list2. How do I do that ...using information contained in `ref/format/XLSX` and `ref/format/XLX`? **Edit** What I had in mind actually was from the Import and Export sections of the documentation for XLSX that give descriptions of the syntax for exporting.               Export["file.xlsx",expr, elem] creates an XLSX file by treating expr as specifying element elem.          Export["file.xlsx",{expr1,expr2,...},{{elem1,elem2,...}}] treats each expri as specifying the corresponding elemi.          Export["file.xlsx",expr,opt1->val1,...] exports expr with the specified option elements taken to have the specified values.          Export["file.xlsx",{elem1->expr1,elem2->expr2,...},"Rules"] uses rules to specify the elements to be exported.      Could I re-phrase and ask if someone could explain how the Export syntax examples above map to a working export to two worksheets? For example elements in the documentation, at the top of the documentation page anyway, are not listed for `Export`(other than "Data") but are listed as e.g. "Data","Formulas" etc. for `Import`. So I am unclear about how any of those export syntax examples correspond to something containing a worksheet name.
