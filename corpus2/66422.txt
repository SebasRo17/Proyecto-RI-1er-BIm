While it's almost impossible to apply for a freelance job without a sufficient portfolio/work experience, I see selling my scripts as a solution. Problem is, so far I've seen only one forum, where such trade is going on - DigitalPoint. Are there any more +/- trusted places to offer your scripts for sale?
