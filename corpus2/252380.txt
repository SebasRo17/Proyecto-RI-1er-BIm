I'm migrating a website that use Javacsript/HTML/PHP using reusable javascript code, in certain moment I saw the opportunity to simplify code in functions that use almost the same code. **Let's say** : _I want to display values from the database into various`<span>` or `<div>` elements using AJAX. all the referred elements use the same layout to display the data, the difference only resides in the element id or a minimal procedure to validate data._ **That's all.** However, I quickly came to the conclusion that I don't have a way to refer a specific element in HTML without use the `id` property, and the only alternative that I think was the use of `name` property. I know that this property it's only for `<input>` in a `<form>`,and because this elements are not `<input>` this rule doesn't _apply_ ( _I know that in HTML the rules are not enforced_ ). The basic idea is to stop using `id`s to make my code more reusable. To pass from this:               <div id='sGroupName1'>       +---<div id='elementA1'>       |     +---<span id='txtA1'>       +---<div id='elementB1'>             +---<span id='txtB1'>          <div id='sGroupName2'>       +---<div id='elementA2'>       |     +---<span id='txtA2'>       +---<div id='elementB2'>             +---<span id='txtB2'>      to this:               <div id='sGroupName1'>       +---<div name='elementA'>       |     +---<span name='txtA'>       +---<div name='elementB'>             +---<span name='txtB'>          <div id='sGroupName2'>       +---<div name='elementA'>       |     +---<span name='txtA'>       +---<div name='elementB'>             +---<span name='txtB'>      Doing my code in this way, i think will break the HTML5 conformity rules. I know this isn't a problem _per se_ , because I have solved in not orthodox way, but I want to hear what is the best way to deal with this situations. I know that exist a question related HTML - Alternative for ID when ID is only unique within a certain scope? but in this case I don't want to deal with classes and CSS rules because the current page is using a lot of CSS and there are a lot Javascript function in the page that manipulates the CSS class, using Class as kind of identifier, I think would lead to some bugs (but not so sure).
