I have an email helper class that has a method that sends email:               private static class EmailHelper     {         public static void SendEmail(string from, string to, string subject, string message)         {             MailMessage msg = new MailMessage(from, to, subject, body);             var client = new SmtpClient("my.smpthost.com"); //this will be moved to config.             client.Send(msg);         }     }      My smtp host string will be placed in my config file. Question is what's the recommended way to pass the smtp host to this method? Should I have a constructor in this class that takes in the smtp string? Or, should I pass the smtp as a 5th parameter? Or should this method directly read from the config? (I realize that there may be several different ways to do this, but I am trying to understand the recommended approach, or at least approaches that are NOT recommended, keeping in mind the SOLID principles.)
