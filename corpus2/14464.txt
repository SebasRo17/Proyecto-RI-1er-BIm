The help browser is not getting window focus when clicked on it. Clicking links or buttons in the help browser works without window focus, but copying code or typing in it doesn't. I can get window focus on the help browser by using the alt+tab or the Window menu. I'm running Mathematica 8.0.4.0 on Ubuntu 12.10. Mathematica is the only software that has this behavior, that's why i post this question here. Has anyone else experienced this behavior or know a solution to it? edit: switching focus between notebooks behaves normally.
