In Document based NoSQL to create tables (AFAIK) I need: Create such many as many rows in table documents with same ID field (that will be table id) and each time need to set the columns (for each document). Then you first search documents by id (table) and next search what you need in the selection. Please correct if I understand it wrong... And is it sane? How could that be fast?
