Since there isn't yet a Q&A site for legal issues and since this is related to an Android app, I'm posting it here, instead of Stack Overflow cause this is not code related. I want to separate this question into 3 sub-questions which are all related though. These questions are about the Free, Commercial and Extended licenses of DryIcons. **1)** Generally speaking, would I be in violation of the free license if I used some icons in my paid version of an Android app? I'm a bit confused... The free license has the following in the "Grant of Rights" section: > b. You may use the Licensed Material in any personal **or commercial project > unlimited number of times** according to the DryIcons Free License Terms and > Conditions; From this I take that yes, I can use their icons in my paid Android app. But then I read this in the commercial license under "Restrictions": > e. Licensee may not use Licensed Material in electronic items for resale, > such as website templates, electronic devices (i.e. computer, iPhone, > phones, etc.) **software applications** , document templates, wallpapers, > screensavers, e-cards or similar products that Licensee intend **to sell or > distribute** ; Which one assumes the extended license is the one we need for a paid app. But isn't this a little bit contradictory? Doesn't that point in the free license allows me to simply use their work in paid apps? **2)** Now, let's assume I really need to buy a commercial/extended license to use their work on my paid/commercial Android app, something I'll be in fact selling to an unlimited number of users. Would I fall under the commercial/extended or the free license if I used In- app Billing in my Android app? With In-app billing I wouldn't be selling their work **at all**. My app would be free with a bunch of features and I would be also using their work. But since my app is free I'm also free to use their work as long as I give proper credits with a link to their website as they state in the free license (no problem doing that, I'm all for it). Then, with In-app Billing I would actually be selling **extra features** to my app (by providing an upgrade to a "Pro" version), not their work. Do you think I would be in violation of the free license like this? **3)** And now a similar situation as the previous point. What if, instead of In-app Billing, I would have 2 apps. One completely free using their work as the free license allows me. And another which is nothing more than an "unlock app", something that would unlock **extra features** on the **free** app. The "unlock app" is the real paid app and this app does not use their work **at all**. Do you think this is exactly the same situation as in the previous point and that I'm just playing with semantics? What's your opinion on that? Do you think I would be in violation of the free license like this?
