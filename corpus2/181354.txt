A colleague and I have run a Kanban board at 2 places of work now, introducing a kind of scrum-ban agile/lean process into the team. Helping us move towards more flow orientated work and continuous releases. I just wanted to ask your advice, that when a task is peer tested or tested by the test team further down the board, what should happen to the tickets where a fault is found? We've tried 2 methods:   * Create a new ticket for the problem and chase this through the board until it catches up with the original faulted ticket. Then progress them both together through the board.   * Move the original ticket back to 'development to-do' or 'development work in progress'. Does anyone have any suggestions on best practices in this situation?
