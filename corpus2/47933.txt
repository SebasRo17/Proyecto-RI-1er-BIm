ie. you speak out the code, and someone else across the room types it in Anyone tried this? Obviously the person taking the dictation would need to be a coder too, so you didn't have to explain everything and go into tedious detail (not 'open bracket, new line...' but more like 'create a new class called myParser that takes three arguments, first one is...'). I thought of it because sometimes I'm too easily distracted at my computer. Surrounded by buttons, instant gratification a click away, the world at my fingertips. To get stuff done, I want to get away, write my code on paper. But that would mean losing access to necessary resources, and necessitate tedious typing-up later on. The solution? Dictate. Pros:   * no chance to check reddit, stackexchange, gmail, etc.   * code while you pace the room, lie down, play billiards, whatever   * train your brain to think more abstractedly (have to visualize things if you can't just see the screen)   * skip the tedious details (closing brackets etc.)   * the typist gets to shadow a more experienced programmer and learn how they work   * the typist can provide assistance/suggestions   * external pressure of typist expecting instructions, urging you to stay focussed Cons   * might be too hard   * might not work any better   * rather inefficient use of assisting programmer   * need to find/pay someone to do this
