By recently looking at the TIOBE Programming Community Index (Sep 2012) I noticed the following order:   1. C   2. Java   3. Objective-C   4. C++   5. C#   6. PHP When looking at the tag frequencies of stackoverflow however, the situation is as follows:   1. C#   2. Java   3. PHP   4. JS   5. Android   6. jquery (JS)   7. iphone (Objective-C)   8. C++ (Java takes the lead when accounting for Android tagged posts w/o a Java tag). JavaScript also likely has surpassed PHP in total numbers of programmers? I realize the tag-frequencies may not be the best indicator, but it is likely a sufficient measure nonetheless. What am I missing that explains this discrepancy, especially for `ANSI C` and `JavaScript` ( #11 in the TIOBE index)? **Links** :   * Wikipedia TIOBE index   * The Transparent Language Popularity Index   * Jobs Tractor language trends   * Github top languages   * Langpop
