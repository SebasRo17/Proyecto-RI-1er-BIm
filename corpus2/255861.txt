I use Struts 1 and my application only supports IE browsers. The following straightforward code works fine on IE9 and above, i.e. when click on action1button, action1 is invoked; click on action2button, action2 is invoked.               <html:submit property="someaction" styleId="action1button" styleClass="button">       <bean:message key="someaction.action1" />     </html:submit>          <html:submit property="someaction" styleId="action2button" styleClass="button">       <bean:message key="someaction.action2" />     </html:submit>      But on IE8 and below, when action2button is clicked, both action1 and action2 are invoked. Though action1button still only invokes action1. I am very confused. Does anyone have any idea what's going on here?
