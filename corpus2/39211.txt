I'm not a math-guy really (a programmer actually) and this is my first question. And excuse me if I can not explain my problem good. The problem is I have a sequence of integers and I want to detect if they are consecutive or not. e.g.               a1 = {1, 2, 3, 4} (* consecutive *)          a2 = {0, 1} (* consecutive *)          a3 = {0, 1, 2, 4} (* non-consecutive *)          a4 = {3, 4, 5, 6} (* consecutive *)          a5 = {3, 5, 6, 7} (* non-consecutive *)          a6 = {2, 3, 4} (* consecutive *)      The numbers come from a list's indexes that a user selected in UI. Actually I want to see if he selects a consecutive rows or not. Is there any way (sure there is :)) to check this without walking through all items in the list? I mean for example by using the first and last number in the list etc? Update: **Note:** The numbers:   1. they are integers,    2. they are ascending,    3. no repeats
