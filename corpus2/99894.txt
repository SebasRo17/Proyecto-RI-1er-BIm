HTTP redirects are done via HTTP codes 301, and 302 (maybe other codes also) and a header field known as "Location" which has the address of the new place to go. However, browsers always send a "GET" request to that URL. However, many times you need to redirect your user to another domain via POST (bank payments for example). This is a common scenario, and really a requirement. Does anybody know why such a common requirement has been neglected in HTTP specification? The workaround is to send a form (with parameters in hidden fields) with action set to the target location (the value of the **Location** header field) and use `setTimeout` to submit the form to the target location.
