I have a data set in form of:(this is just an example)               1324501020     3241030205     4332020134      the data are stored in a text file (e.g. data.txt) but I need to convert them into a matrix format such that each number be place in a cell like this:               1 3 2 4 5 0 1 0 2 0     3 2 4 1 0 3 0 2 0 5     4 3 3 2 0 2 0 1 3 4      or in terms of `List` in Mathematica, I need to have `{{1,3,2,4,5,0,1,0,2,0},{3,2,4,1,0,3,0,2,0,5},{4,3,3,2,0,2,0,1,3,4}}` in other words, the final data set supposed to be a matrix of numbers. Any idea??
