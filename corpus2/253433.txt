Basically I have a series of logic in my website that can lead to 5 total outcomes. Basically two different if tests and then a catch all else statement. For example:               if cond1:         if mod1:             #do things         elif mod2:             #do things     elif cond2:         if mod1:             #do things         elif mod2             #do things     else:         #do things      I was thinking about rewriting it like this:               if cond1 and mod1:         #do things     elif cond1 and mod2:         #do things     elif cond2 and mod1:         #do things     elif cond2 and mod2:         #do things     else:         #do things      Is there any real difference in these two coding options/a better choice for this kind of logic testing?
