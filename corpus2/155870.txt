As freelancers, we meet somewhere and chat about a new idea for a project, brainstorm etc. Up to this point, we have taken notes of the ideas, but we would like to be able to share more efficiently the ideas with each other. However, I fear that if I use some online product (such as Google Docs) these ideas could be seen by people outside the team (employees of the company of the online product, other users...). I am not sure if I am being a little _Paranoid parrot_... One solution that we have considered is to install a Subversion with just one _ideas.txt_. But that would require a server in one of our houses, which is a little unconfortable. So how do you share your ideas for a new project with your team without risking the ideas to be _stolen_?
