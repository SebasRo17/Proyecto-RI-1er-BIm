I successfully installed Jenkins and then Sonar to go with continuous integration. The firsts reports are not that good in term of rules violations ,comments, code duplication ... I set Jenkins to get java classes, run tests with cobertura and then launch SONAR once every night during week days. I then asked the developers to put some time and effort in correcting rules violations, and try to re-factor the code using SONAR data. However it seems they would like to see their corrections in SONAR almost as they commit them. So I got different choices :   * Let the SONAR launch to once a day   * Allow developers to launch sonar task themselves   * Decrease Jenkins time between builds (like every 1h) 2nd solution : I'm afraid of the number of snapshot that will appear in the SONAR history and the fact that it'll make the "compare since last build" a lot less useful. 3rd solution : A bit of the 2nd solutions problems adding that Jenkins will have a lot of builds, most of them irrelevant. What are your experiences on these problems? Thanks
