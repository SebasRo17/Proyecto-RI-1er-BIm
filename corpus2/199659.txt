What do you think would be the most effective solution to maintain an object status through a life cycle? The goal to be able to be continue from any state any time. During the life cycle likely to have human interactions over a variety of interface. For example, an order which needs to be approved by a few people. Or a data supply process that can requires many people to approve or edit? In my mind some solutions:   * When called a function serializes the object and saves it in a database.   * All steps of the process would be saved to somewhere (database, csv, xml, etc.), so it can always be recreated based on this.   * Possibly a mixture of the two methods? Any good methods for the problem?
