I was trying to compute the probability that a coin is from a particular underlying distribution given that a particular set of tosses was observed. (I know this can be done in a different way, but I was just thinking of using Bayes in this context.) I wrote this function:               PPP[heads_, total_, a_, b_] :=       (Integrate[p^heads (1 - p)^(total - heads), {p, a, b},          Assumptions -> {0 < a, a < b, b < 1, 0 <= heads, heads <= total}]) /         (Integrate[p^heads (1 - p)^(total - heads), {p, 0, 1},             Assumptions -> {0 <= heads, heads <= total}])      When I evaluate               N[PPP[1000, 2000, 495/1000, 505/1000]]      I get > >     0.345408, >   which seems reasonable. (The probability that your coin's distribution is between 0.495 and 0.505 given that you've witnessed 1000 heads in 2000 tosses is 0.345408.) but, if I do               PPP[1000, 2000, 0.495, 0.505]      I get > >     3.936310242253867*10^468. >   This makes no sense just on the face of it. The integral at the top is a _subset_ of the integral at the bottom, and the integrand is strictly positive, so there's no way the numerator can be greater than the denominator. Why is this happening? (I'm using _Mathematica_ 9.0.0). Here's the notebook with those equations, if you don't want to cut and paste: ppp.nb.
