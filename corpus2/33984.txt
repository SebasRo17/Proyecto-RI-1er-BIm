**Preamble** : I am working on a document that I plan to publish as a Supplementing in a regular scientific journal in the CDF form. In this document I fail to make the following thing: **Explanations** : There should be a button embedded in the text of a document referred below as the "main document". It is very much like in my recent question: How to specify a StyleSheet of a newly programmatically-created notebook? Upon its pressing, this button should bring up a notebook containing some text and an evaluated Manipulate statement. To be specific, here is a simplified example:                   Button["Show",      CreateDocument[       Column[{         TextCell["Some text" , "Text", FontSize -> 20],         ExpressionCell[          Manipulate[           Plot[Sin[a*x], {x, 0, 2 \[Pi]}], {a, 0, 1}]          ]         }],       WindowTitle -> "Some title", WindowSize -> {550, 400}],       ImageSize -> {50, 18}, BaseStyle -> {"GenericButton", Bold}]      Upon evaluation of this code a button appears. This button can be copy-pasted into any line of the text cell of the main notebook document. It should like like this:                                    Some text button some more text.       where instead of the word "button" the button should stay. Upon pressing this button the notebook opens. It contains the text "Some text" and should contain the dynamic demonstration defined by the Manipulate statement above. **The problem** : It works nicely in Mathematica. It does not, if I transform the main document into cdf. When I press the button in this cdf version of the document, the interactive part is not shown, instead a gray rectangle appears and a message comes up "This dynamic content cannot be displayed by the CDF player. To display this dynamic content requires Mathematica". However, it is a very innocent Manipulate statement, which is certainly displayed, if I put it in the CDF directly, not by such an oblique way. I guess that it is some CDF limitation here. However, **My questions** :   * Do you see any workaround here?    * May it be that it is since the document created this way is .nb, rather than .cdf, and it results in my attempts to use the CDF-Player to read the .nb document?   * If yes, most probably I cannot instruct Mathematica to create .cdf instead of .nb starting from the cdf main document, can I? Thank you in advance. Later edit: I indeed asked already this and have forgotten it completely. I am sorry. The outcome is that such a thing is impossible. That's a pity.
