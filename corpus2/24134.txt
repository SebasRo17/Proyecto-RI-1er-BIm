I'm doing some electric circuit calcualtions and I'm trying to get the phasor representation of some arbitrary function of Sin or Cos. Could be complex like:               (0. - 10. I) Sin[1000 t]      For instance, if I have:               Vin = 10Cos[1000t- 90Degree]      which is:               Vin = 10Re[Exp[-I*90Degree]*Exp[I*1000t]]      I want to get the magnitude angle form. i.e $10\angle-90^\circ$ I can get the magnitude with:               MaxValue[Abs[Vin], t]      but I can't get the phase angle correctly. I've tried:               Re[N[ArcCos[(Vin/MaxValue[Vin, t]) /. t -> 0]/Degree]]      but that gives $90^\circ$ not $-90^\circ$ So I have 2 questions actually:   1. Can I force mathematica to keep my function in $\cos\left(something - 90^\circ\right)$ form instead of changing it to $\sin\left(something + 0^\circ\right)$?   2. And how can I correctly obtain the phase angle
