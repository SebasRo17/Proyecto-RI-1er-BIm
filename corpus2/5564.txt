Need a Free, Fast(development and runtime) and Reliable(transactions and locking) tool set for creating an enterprise application for SMBs. I'm thinking of an application framework + UI framework + DB which will help me in developing the software faster. As it is known, business softwares need lot of similar UIs to be created. My idea is ...to create a new form with N number of fields and connecting it to the database for basic CRUD operations within 30min to 1hr. I got the taste of Intersystems Cache technology stack with an app framework on top of it. To be frank...it is amazing... I'm looking out for something similar to this in opensource. Any suggestions?
