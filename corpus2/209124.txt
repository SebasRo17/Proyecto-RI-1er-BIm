A client asked us to automate his offline paper-based processes. He sent us a copy of the physical forms that he uses. Our team met and discussed how the navigation should be, what major components would exist in the UI. That's it. Problem is, we don't have actual "written" requirements. With a lack of an actual business/system analyst in our company, what are the steps that we should take to reach the point where we are ready to start developing the system?
