I have an idea in mind, but **it still confuses me the database area**. Imagine that **I want to show real time data** , and using one of the latest browser technologies ( _web sockets_ \- even using older browsers) it is very easy to show to all observables (user browser) what everyone is doing. **Remy Sharp** has an example about the simplicity about this. But I still don't get the database part, **how would I feed** , let's imagine (using Remy game Tron) that I want to save **the path for each connected user** in a database and if a client wants to see what is going on with a **5 sec delay** , he will see that, not only the 5 sec until that moment but **the continuation in time** ... how can I query a DB like that?               SELECT x, y FROM run WHERE time >= DATEADD(second, -5, rundate);      is not the recommended path right? and pulling this x in x time ... this is not real data feed correct? If can someone help me understand the Database point of view, I would greatly appreciate.
