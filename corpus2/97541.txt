I use unsigned ints everywhere, and I'm not sure if I should. This can be from database primary key id columns to counters, etc. If a number should never be negative, then I will always used an unsigned int. However I notice from other's code that no one else seems to do this. Is there something crucial that I'm overlooking? Edit: Since this question I've also noticed that in C, returning negative values for errors is commonplace rather than throwing exceptions as in C++.
