OK, so here I got the solution of a numerically-solved PDE. I wish to plot in a graph, for a given time, the point x where the solution reaches 1/2. So here's the relevant string of code:               eps=5/9;     phi6m = NDSolveValue[{         D[u[t, x], t, t] - D[u[t, x], x, x] ==                 -6 u[t, x]^5 + (8 + 4 eps) u[t, x]^3 - (2 + 4 eps) u[t, x],         u[0, x] == Tanh[x],          Derivative[1, 0][u][0, x] == 0,          u[t, -7] == -1, u[t, 7] == 1                          }, u, {t, 0, 6}, {x, -7, 7}];     Do[         phi62 = phi6m[k/10, x];         phi6plus[[k]] = FindRoot[phi62 == 1/2, {x, k/10}],      {k, 1, 55}]     ListLinePlot[phi6plus, PlotRange -> All]      But when I run that code, I get all the values of x where the solution is worth 1/2 for the sampled time points instead of a plot. It also says that ListLinePlot is called with no argument. How am I to make a graph with the values of phi6plus for the given values of k? If possible, I'd also like to interpolate the data contained in the phi6plus array.
