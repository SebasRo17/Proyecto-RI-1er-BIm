I'm trying to find an efficient algorithm for the following algorithm. I have a sequence consisting of lists of indices denoting indices to be removed. The semantics are such that each sequence must be performed in order. I want to take these sequences and flatten them into one sequence of absolute indices to be removed. This can be achieved by performing a series of sieves (somewhat akin to the Sieve of Eratosthenes). The caveat is that this technique is slow (quadratic). Thus this group of relative indices:               R0: 0 3 10 15     R1: 2 7 20     R2: 1 11 12 14 17     R3: 0 1 2      Would correspond to this group of absolute indices:               A0: 0 3 10 15     A1: 4 9 22     A2: 2 17 18 20 24     A3: 1 5 6      And when merged into one sequence of absolute indices, I would have the following:               A': 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 9 10 15 17 18 20 22 24      There may be any number of relative sequences, each of which may contain any number of elements and may have large gaps between indices. The input relative sequences are sorted in increasing order any may not contain duplicates. Obtaining the intermediate `A#` lists is unnecessary. I only care about the list `A'` from the inputs `R#`. * * * Clarification on the algorithm Let's take the list of non-negative integers               0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 ...      And remove the indices given by R0 Then we have               1 2 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 ...      The removed values yield A0 (`0 3 10 15`) Now remove the indices given by R1               1 2 5 6 7 8 10 11 12 13 14 16 17 18 19 20 21 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 ...      The removed values yield A1 (`4 9 22`) Now remove the indices given by R2               1 5 6 7 8 10 11 12 13 14 16 19 21 23 25 26 27 28 29 30 ...      The removed values yield A2 (`2 17 18 20 24`) Now remove the indices given by R3               7 8 10 11 12 13 14 16 19 21 23 25 26 27 28 29 30 ...      The removed values yield A3 (`1 5 6`)
