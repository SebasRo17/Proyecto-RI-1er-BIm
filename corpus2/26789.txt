Let me first explain what I am doing and then I will explain the problem that I can't figure out. I am basically trying to solve 2 equations for 2 unknowns (`a1` and `a2`) with some given definitions such as `GL1` `GL2` `GC1` and `GC2`. With the given code below, I solved the unknowns in terms of some parameters and (`C1` and `C2`). However, I want to substitute the equations of `C1` and `C2` in the solutions. I tried to put the equations first like given `GL1` `GL2` `GC1`... But I didn't get any answers then I tried to solve it without putting `C1` and `C2` and I got an answer. I now try to substitute those by using `Simplify`, but I don't get any answers again. I need some help to solve these equations. Please check my code below.               GL1 = fd a1 t Y1;     GL2 = fd a2 t Y2;     GC1 = (Y1 + Y2) (1 - fd) t p;     GC2 = (Y1 + Y2) (1 - fd) t q;          FullSimplify[       Solve[((GC1 - GL1) q / (GC2 - GL2) p) (a2/a1) - (C2/Y1)/(C2/Y2) == 0 &&          a ((GC1/(1 -    fd) - GL1/fd)/C1 + (GC2/(1 - fd) - GL2/fd)/C2) +          2 b (1 - 2 fd)/fd (1 - fd) == 0,        {a1, a2}] ]           (*     Solutions: (2 roots for a1 and a2)     {{a1 -> 1/(2 a C2 fd^2 t Y1 (p q Y1^2 - ...,       a2 -> 1/(2 a C1 fd^2 t Y2 (-p q Y1^2 + ...      },       {a1 -> 1/(2 a C2 fd^2 t Y1 (p q Y1^2 - ...,        a2 -> 1/(2 a C1 fd^2 t Y2 (-p q Y1^2 + ..}}     *)      Now as we see solutions are in terms of `C1` and `C2`, I want to substitute these two equations:                  C1 =  (1 - t (fd a1 + (1 - fd))) Y1;        C2 =  (1 - t (fd a2 + (1 - fd))) Y2;      When I substitute these equations and try to Simplify I don't get any answers, I think the kernel goes into a infinite loop. Any suggestions.
