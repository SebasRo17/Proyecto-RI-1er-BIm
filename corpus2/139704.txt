I am basically asking this question to see if I am being unreasonable. My current employer has locked down the machines of all developers so that we do not have access to the root or c: drive. For example, I cannot write a directory under C:. I also cannot install any software which touches the registry. Is this an extreme action or am I overreacting to common security measures? What is the extent of security on your company provided machine? To add some scope to this question, I am a web application developer and I'm talking about a laptop owned by the company.
