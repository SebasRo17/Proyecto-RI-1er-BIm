Is there a way to construct an interface so that the Code and the Graphics remain in sync? For example I would like to be able to drag/drop and move around different shapes in Graphic while seeing the code change. Then I would like to edit the code so the graphic changes. **Updated image to clarify interface** ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ts4uX.png) I'm aware that you can see the graphics source by hitting `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`E`, but this isn't ideal because the graphics source code is often in the displayform and much more verbose. Additionally it doesn't allow me to see how the code changes while I am editing the code. I'm working on some code that uses dynamic currently, but I'm not sure of the right technique just yet. **EDIT:** **Both the`InputField` and the `Graphics` should be live and editable. The problem currently is that the the `Graphics` elements can't seem to be Dynamic. If you set it as Dynamic it is impossible to re size and move the elements around.**
