I'm a full time consultant for a contracting company. Essentially, I'm just a full time employee and when my current contract is up, I roll to the 'bench' until they find me another contact. One of the independent contractors I'm colleagues with threw a job my way (he's overbooked currently) for a very small company of just a couple employees to do some maintenance on their website. My handbook states "No individual shall provide consulting services for a fee in competition with [COMPANY]". But this company isn't a client of my employer (and I doubt ever would be since they're so small). To boot, some of my co- employees for my company either talk on the DL about doing contracts independently, or even have formed companies to do outside contracting with outside clients. Is it safe to do outside contract work even if you're a full time contractor for a consulting firm? (A lawyer question obviously but would love some feedback from anyone with experience)
