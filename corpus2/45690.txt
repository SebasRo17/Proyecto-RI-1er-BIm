Say That I have the constraint:               .5<x1<x2<x3<x4<40      I want to use this constraint in a Nminimize function. It seems that mathematica runs into a problem when you have this. For example Nminimize will output an error saying that this function variable is not real for "-x2" but this constraint defines my variables all to be positive. So is there a better way to write this constraint?
