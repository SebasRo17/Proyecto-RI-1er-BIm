I have $$X_1=T + W$$ $$X_2=2 T + 3 W$$ where $$W \sim N(3,5) \,\text{;}\,\, T \sim N(1,2)$$ and $$P(X=X_1)=P(X=X_2)=\tfrac{1}{2}$$ which I have awkwardly expressed as               X2 = TransformedDistribution[       2 T + 3 W, {W \[Distributed] NormalDistribution[3, Sqrt[5]],         T \[Distributed] NormalDistribution[1, Sqrt[2]]}]          X1 = TransformedDistribution[       T + W, {W \[Distributed] NormalDistribution[3, Sqrt[5]],         T \[Distributed] NormalDistribution[1, Sqrt[2]]}]          XX = TransformedDistribution[       i a + (1 - i) b, {a \[Distributed] X1, b \[Distributed] X2,         i \[Distributed] BernoulliDistribution[0.5]}]      This serves fine for generating `RandomVariate`s and for calculating `Mean`, `Variance`, etc.; but I would like to plot the PDF of $T$ vs $X$ and am struggling with how to correctly construct the joint PDF to do this. How should I go about constructing these distributions so that the joint PDF, $f_{X,T}(x,t)$, can be plotted using, for example with `ContourPlot` or `Plot3D`?
