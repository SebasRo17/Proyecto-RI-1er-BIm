I've searched high and low for a good answer to this question, and as far as I can gather it's just a combination of standard organization tools (keeping a routine, good folder structure, extensive documentation) and making sure you think about each step before you move on. I'm planning on starting a new web application very soon, and I'm finding the volume of choices I need to make almost overwhelming. Although I usually create applications using Django I've been considering the alternatives recently. Also, things like which host should I go for, which version control system should I use and which bit should I start on first are driving me crazy. I was wondering if anyone had any professional advice for me on how I can better manage what I'm doing so that I get this project off on the right foot.
