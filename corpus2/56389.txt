I have this table of values, how do I find the maximum value? i.e. find $z_{max}(x,y)$               tt1 = Table[Solve[z^2 == x^2 y - z, z, Method -> Reduce], {x, 0, 5, 1}, {y, 0,          5, 1}]       By visual inspection, clearly max $z$ occurs at the most bottom right element in matrix, $z = \frac{1}{2}(-1 + \sqrt{501}) $ How do I get _Mathematica_ to read out the position and value of maximum z? I tried using:               Max[tt1]      but it didn't work..
