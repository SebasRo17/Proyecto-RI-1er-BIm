In theory, if you were to open two computers that were perfectly synced together on a website that has a form. This form has fields where say for example the username has to be unique. Assuming both computers have the same information on the form, and in theory let's say that the submit button was pressed at the same time, and that these two computers have the exact same build and internet speed and the same response time from the server, whose information would be submitted to the database and whose information would be denied knowing the username field is unique.
