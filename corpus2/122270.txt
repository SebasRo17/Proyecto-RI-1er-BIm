Let's says that I am creating a PHP library that is using PHP 5.3 and namespaces and my library requires another library to work (this case it is the sfYaml library). I am trying to think of the best way to include this library. Is it considered good/acceptable practice to include the third party libraries directly in my code (assuming the license allows which sfYaml does) or is it better to not include the third party libraries and just have the user make sure the libraries are somewhere on their system and have them configure the path? I mean that only issue I have had in the past with including that third party libraries in my libraries is that if the user also has the same library for their project, there would be issues with including it twice however now with PHP 5.3 and namespace, that is not an issue. I am just try to think if there are any other issues with including third party libraries directly in my code (with having them namespaced under my main namespace).
