I'm starting a new company, and our software will be a SaaS solution offered to municipalities around the world. Their interface will be web-based. I am trying to figure our which software development frameworks and which software platforms would be able to support a fully multi-lingual system. In this I mean that I need to be able to have the same screens operate in different native languages (including right-to-left), both for display and data-entry. I want to be able to maintain a single application for all languages. I need to be able to add new languages pretty quickly (= no development) once the system is set up.   Since I am starting from scratch, I have the privilege to research and choose in advance, and not force a solution into an existing application.   Also, I have experience in leading development on Java, .NET, C++ and C, so I am open to use any technology that will meet my business needs. I would appreciate recommendations with pros and cons.
