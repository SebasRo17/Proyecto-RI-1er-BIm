I'd like to know the general procedure of how an IDE is built/compiled/created. Additionally, what are some tools/scripts used to create an IDE? I don't mean to say that compiling IDE **needs** an IDE. It was just a general assumption made by me that since IDE is just a piece of software too so it sounds logical to me that they may use the previous version of IDE to build the next one. I want to understand how the IDEs are built.
