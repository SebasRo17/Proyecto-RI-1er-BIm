This is driving me nuts: I'm trying to control the parameters for a relatively large system of ODEs using Manipulate.               With[{todo =       Module[        {sol, ode, timedur = 40},        ode = Evaluate[odes /. removeboundaries /. moieties];        sol = NDSolve[Join[ode, init], vars, {t, 0, timedur}];        Plot[Evaluate[c[1][t] /. parms] /. sol, {t, 0, timedur}]        ],      controls =        Sequence @@         Table[{{parms[[i]][[1]], parms[[i]][[2]]},           0, (3*parms[[i]][[2]])}, {i, 1, Length[parms]}]},     Manipulate[todo, controls, ContinuousAction -> False,       ControlPlacement -> Bottom]]      The solve step, in which sol is created, performs successfully. When trying to make a Plot from this however, I get all kinds of errors like               NDSolve::ndnum: Encountered non-numerical value for a derivative at t == 0.`      Although NDSolve runs fine when Plot is commented out! Note that this code relies on global variables defined elsewhere in the script. I should also add that the code inside the Module[] works when copied to a fresh cell. Could someone help me out? Thanks!!
