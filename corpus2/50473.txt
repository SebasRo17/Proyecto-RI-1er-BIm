I have a list of X values and Y values separately, and also together with:               data=Transpose[{X,Y}]      This data is from a chromatogram, and I want to extract the retention time tR (X) that corresponds to the highest value of absorbance (Y). I normally perform an interpolation with               f=Interpolation[data];     tR=x/.Last[FindMaximum[f[x],{x,1}]];      For some reason this approach is not working with a recent chromatogram, and I wanted to extract the X value that corresponds to the maximum Y value directly from the two lists like this:               Position[Y,Max[Y]]      This gives me the position in the vector where I can find the X value I want. If I input the value manually I get the X value I am looking for:               X[[9970]]      So far so good. However, if I try to assign Position[Y,Max[Y]] to a variable (for automation, since I have a program that does all the data extraction and plotting for me), I cannot get the X value:               ymaxposition=Position[Y,Max[Y]];     tR=X[[ymaxposition]]      > Part::pspec: Part specification {{9970}} is neither a machine-sized integer > nor a list of machine-sized integers. >> This isn't working either:               Position[Y,Max[Y]]     tR=X[[%]]      Any help will be very welcome.
