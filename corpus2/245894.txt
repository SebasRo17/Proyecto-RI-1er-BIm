Let's say I have a relational database application and a "user" object and a "message" object. Now I want to show the number of unread messages to this user. What's the best way to archive this? Do I introduce a field in the user and count it up if the user receives a message and decrease the count if he reads one? Or do I execute a query every time to compute the number of messages for the user that are flagged as unread? I think the first approach is more complicated and error prone, but will perform better than the second approach. How is this normally done or what's the better approach?
