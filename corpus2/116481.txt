Our code is bad. It might not have always been considered bad, but it is bad and is only going downhill. I started fresh out of college less than a year ago, and many of the things in our code puzzle me beyond belief. At first I figured that as the new guy I should keep my mouth shut until I learned a little more about our code base, but I've seen plenty to know that it's bad. Some of the highlights:   * We still use frames (try getting something out of a querystring, almost impossible)   * VBScript   * Source Safe   * We 'use' .NET - by that I mean we have .net wrappers that call COM DLLs making it almost impossible to debug easily   * Everything is basically one giant function   * Code is not maintainable. Each page has multiple files that are created every time a new page is made. The main page basically does Response.Write() a bunch of times to render the HTML (runat="server"? no way). After that there can be a lot of logic on the client side (VBScript), and finally the page submits to itself (often time storing many things in hidden fields) where it then posts to a processing page which can do things such as save the data to the database.   * The specifications we get are laughable. Often times they call for things like "auto-populate field X with either field Y or field Z" with no indication of when to choose field Y or field Z. I'm sure some of this is a result of not being employed at a software company, but I feel as if people writing software should at least care about the quality of their code. I can't even imagine that if I were to bring something up that anything would be done soon, as there is a large deadline looming, but we are continuing to write bad code and use bad practices. What can I do? How do I even bring these issues up? 75% of my team agree with me and have brought up these issues in the past, yet nothing gets changed.
