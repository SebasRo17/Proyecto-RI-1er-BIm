Based on what information, can we identify something as a software development framework? For example the Wikipedia article of 'software framework' claims it should include support programs, compilers, code libraries, etc. But there are some companies I know of which call a code library 'framework'! What should a certain development environment contain to be considered as a 'framework'?
