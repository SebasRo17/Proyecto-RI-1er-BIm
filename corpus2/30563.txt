As we know, there are only $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ variables in a symmetric $n$-dimensional semi-definite matrix. Is it possible to produce a $n$-dimensional semi-definite matrix whose trace is $1$ using only $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}-1$ variables, $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ from symmetry and one from the trace constraint? If so, what is the best way? Till now, I can produce a $n$-dimensional semi-definite matrix $\rho$ whose trace is $1$ in the way               t = ({       {a, b, c, d},       {e, f, g, h},       {i, j, k, l},       {m, n, o, p}     });     œÅ = t.t\[Transpose]/Total[Flatten[t]^2];      but I need $n^2$ variables and sometimes `Total[Flatten[t]^2]` may be zero because of semi-definiteness. Any help or suggestions will be appreciated.
