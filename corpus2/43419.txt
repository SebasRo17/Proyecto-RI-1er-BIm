I have a list of numbers `list1` from which I want to create another list (`list2`) consisting of only those numbers that are equal to the sum of _any_ two members of `list1`, as long as the total is under 15. So for example if `list1 = {1,4,6,8}`, then I want `list2 = {2,5,7,8,9,10,12,14}`. I could do this by: `list2 = Union[Flatten[Table[Table[i + j, {i, list1}], {j, list1}]]]` which does give the right result, but then I run into two problems:   1. I have no idea how to filter the list so that it only displays numbers less than 15. I tried appending `/; x_ < 15` to the end, but this didn't do anything   2. This works fine for a list this small, but what I really want to do is scale this up to a list consisting of several thousand elements - for which it takes a very long time, and crashes my computer in the process. How could I make this function more efficient? Thank you
