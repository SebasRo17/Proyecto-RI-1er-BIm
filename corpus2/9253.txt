If I have two expressions with sums in them, like this: $$\begin{align*} b&=\frac{\sum_{i} (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i -\bar{y})}{\sum_{i}(x_i -\bar{x})^2}\\\ r&=\frac{\sum_{i} (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i -\bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i}(x_i -\bar{x})^2\sum_{i}(y_i -\bar{y})^2}} \end{align*}$$ and I wanted to produce a simplified expression of $\frac{b}{r}$, how would I do it? The problem is the sums. It seems Mathematica doesn't like the unspecified, unevaluated sums. **Edit:** I was expecting to end up with something like this: $$\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i}(y_i -\bar{y})^2}{\sum_{i}(x_i -\bar{x})^2}}$$ I've been playing around with `Expand`, `Simplify`, `FullSimplify`. There may just be a way to apply it that I'm missing.
