In the context of information theory, **entropy** is a measure of _uncertainty_ of a random variable. In quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle states that $\Delta x\Delta k \ge 1/2$. The same can be expressed in terms of information entropy as $S_x + S_k \ge 1 + \ln\pi$. The information entropy $S_x$ is defined as: $$ S_x = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} {\rho(x) \ln\rho(x) dx} $$ where $\rho(x)$ is the probability density function of the variable $x$. In continuation[1,2,3] of my study of the infinite square well problem, I'd like to check whether the informational version of uncertainty principle holds. For that, I need to calculate $S_x$ and $S_k$, for various numbers of $n=1,2,3,\ldots$, and check if their sum is bounded, knowing the respective probability density functions for position $x$ and momentum $k$. Here is my code for $S_x$:               ClearAll["Global`*"];     (* The length of the well *)     L = 1;          (* The eigenfunctions, n=1,2,3,... u[n,x] is zero outside of [0,L] *)     u[n_, x_] := Sqrt[2/L] Sin[n π x/L]          (* Probability density function for the x(=particle position) variable *)     (* Again, the domain of ρ(n,x) is the [0,L] interval *)     ρ[n_, x_] := u[n, x]\[Conjugate] u[n, x]          integrand =       Simplify[-ρ[n, x] Log[ρ[n, x]],        n ∈ Integers && x ∈ Reals]          (* Out= -2 Log[2 Sin[n π x]^2] Sin[n π x]^2 *)          (* Integrate over [0,L] since we haven't defined u[n,x] outside of [0,L] *)     (* We could have defined it though and then we would be integrating from -inf to +inf *)     Integrate[integrand, {x, 0, L}]          (* Out= -(1/(6 n π))(π (6 n - I π + 6 I n^2 π + n Log[64] -            12 n Log[1 - E^(2 I n π)] + 6 n Log[Sin[n π]^2]) +         6 I PolyLog[2, E^(2 I n π)] -         3 (-1 + Log[2 Sin[n π]^2]) Sin[2 n π]) *)      At this point it's already obvious that the value of the integral cannot be determined, since the terms $\sin(n\pi)$ equal zero and $\ln{0}$ is undefined.

Any ideas on how to trick _Mathematica_ to calculate the integral ? **Mathematica.SE related (to the physical problem) questions** : Is there a more mathematica-y way to label these plots? Why does FourierTransform converge while same integral manually written does not? Calculate integral for arbitrary parameter n in infinite square well problem
