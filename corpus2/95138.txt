There is a company in my city which does supply chain optimization, data mining and predictive modelling. I tried hard but was not able to enter there. Now I want to do similar sort of work. They apply many optimization techniques which makes the decision making of company easier. Presently I know Python, Django, PHP, Linux and web development. Can anyone guide me that what i need to do for that sort of work, what thing I need to learn so that after 5-6 years I can also start making those type of softwares for small shops. I mean which languages and tools I need to learn.
