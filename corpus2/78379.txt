I'm coding a Linux/PHP site for an organization. The site has two views, activated by a login $_SESSION variable indicating whether one is logged in as a member or not. I need to provide search functionality for both the public and for members. The members area is private. Note that Google Custom Search can't be used here in that case. Does anyone have any recommendations on F/OSS scripts (or perhaps cheap scripts I can purchase) that would provide this functionality with two separate indices, one public and one private, and which would provide paginated results and a keyword search form? Otherwise, I guess I'll have to code one myself. I'm trying to save time, and therefore keep more money in my pocket. P.S. Note I can't ask this on StackOverflow because they want programmer questions there. This isn't a "how do I code this?" question, but "what F/OSS scripts or cheap sitescripts would solve this problem?" type of question. Note also that this won't help me either. I mean, look at the answers of that question.
