Preparing myself for ISTQB, I found a bit odd many things in their textbooks. E.g. they call black box testing as functional testing when you are not concerned with structured but only observe the ouput based on inputs. But later they say that functional testing is done at levels..well, how can I do unit testing without the knowledge how it works if I can just see it (and must see it). It is white box but then it is in the conflict..
