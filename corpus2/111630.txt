How should I bring some very rusty C++ up to date, as I'm sure the language and best practices have evolved? I realise this might be close to being off- topic so let my clarify some details. About 10 years ago I think I was quite a good C++ programmer, I'd devoured the Scott Meyers books, I could solve the puzzles in the lint adverts in Dr. Dobbs. I was probably a bit of a language lawyer. I've been programming mostly Java, some python for the last 10 years so my OO skills are still up to scratch. But having joined a company where C++ is common I've realized I have to admit to myself I am both really rusty, and there are language features now which are either new or a lot more common than I remember - things like namespaces etc. I realise reading and writing code (especially pairing) is a good way to get up to speed, but is there any other resource people would recommend in this to give me an accelerated head start. Book? Web-page? Tutorials? To summarize:   * Recommendations for C++ specific refresher resources?   * Not OO/programming generally.   * Things in addition to just reading and writing code.
