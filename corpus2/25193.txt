I would like to solve the following ODEs $$\begin{cases} x'(t)&=y\\\ y'(t)&=-y(t)/t-e^{x(t)},\\\ x(0)&=1,\\\y(0)&=0, \end{cases}$$ ### (EDIT : The second equation _used_ to be $y'(t) = -x(t)/t - e^{x(t)}$). with the following code:               NDSolve[{       {x'[t] == y[t], y'[t] == -y[t]/t - Exp[x[t]]},        {x[0] == 1, y[0] == 0}}       ,       {x, y}, {t, 0, 1}]       I get the warning:               Power::infy: "Infinite expression 1/0. encountered."      How do I fix it? Note that, in some cases, a "small" change of the initial values will make a "large" change in in the solution, so substituting $0$ with a very small number, say $10^{-100}$ is not "good" enough. Are there other ways to fix this?
