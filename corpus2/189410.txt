I am new to ORM, and we started developing a new system using NHibernate as the ORM. I think this question may refer to any ORM and any language/platform. The Team Leader has said we should use NHibernate only when retrieving our domain data model objects, ie, not to use any of the built in NHibernate selection or aggregations that will retrieve single primitives or a list of primitives. The reason behind it was that we need to make a distinction between classic ORM and other abilities, so that usual select and select max will use a "classic" DAL project. I think this is not so good, because we break the data access to two, and what's wrong using NHibernate abilities which gets checked compile time? **Are there any reasons to making this distinction?**
