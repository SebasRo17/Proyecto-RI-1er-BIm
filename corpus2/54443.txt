I'm having trouble combining assumptions with the execution of `Simplify` in a long equation. The idea is to separate imaginary and real parts of a complex equation. Therefore I am trying to assume the variables as reals.               Simplify[-Re[(a+I b) (2-c-d-I e-I f)],       {a ∈ Reals, b ∈ Reals, c ∈ Reals, d ∈ Reals, e ∈ Reals, f ∈ Reals}]          But the output is just ignoring the assumptions. How should I implement it?
