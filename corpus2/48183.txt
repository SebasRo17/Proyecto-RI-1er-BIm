I have two sets: games and players. Players pick their games. As such I will have data say g1={p1,p3,p5},g2={p2,p4},g3={p2,p3,p5}. My interest though is to build the connections among players because of the common games they have played. For instance, since p1 played with p3 and p5 in game 1, then they are connected. I can then build an adjacency matrix for the players: {{0,0,1,0,1},{0,0,1,1,1},{1,1,0,0,1},{0,1,0,0,0},{1,1,1,0,0}}.I'll be doing this for hundreds of games and thousands of players. Question is: how do I efficiently get the adjacency matrix given the data? Thanks for the inputs.
