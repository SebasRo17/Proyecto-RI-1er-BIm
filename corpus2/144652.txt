I've been under impression, that monkeypatching is more in quick and dirty hack category, rather than standard, good programming practice. While I'd used from time to time to fix minor issues with 3rd party libs, I considered it temporary fix and I'd submit proper patch to the 3rd party project. However, I've seen this technique used as "the normal way" in mainstream projects, for example in Gevent's `gevent.monkey` module. Has monkeypatching became mainstream, normal, acceptable programming practice? See also: _"Monkeypatching For Humans"_ by Jeff Atwood
