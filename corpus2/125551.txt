I'm trying to bring more structure in my worklife by trying to maintain my 'knowledge' of new techniques/bugfixes/workarounds. I find them on google (sometimes after a while of searching) and fix my bug/learn new stuff... I don't really expand my 'library' with this knowledge. So after a while, when I encounter the same bug, i need to search it again and this can be time intensive. How do you guys keep track of this knowledge? I mean, most of us are on a busy workplace, with no time to memerize every bugfix/piece of knowledge about a product/language. I want to be able to reference this information in my own library. While trying to keep links, texts and code snippets organized and maintainable, rather then a textfile/Evernote for each subject, making it almost impossible to find and organize this information...
