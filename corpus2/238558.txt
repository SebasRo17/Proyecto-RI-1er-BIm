So, pretty straight forward question. Somebody told me that all shopping carts should be secure. I can see in some instances where this would be beneficial... but all instances? I realize that typically carts are stored on the server via a session, but in the end the details of the cart have to be sent to the user so they can see what is in their cart. This is very difficult to google because all that comes up is ads for commercial shopping carts. Question: Is it a standard/typical to secure all shopping carts? (pages which display the shopping cart)
