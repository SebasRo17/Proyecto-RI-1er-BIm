Let's say I have a system. In this system I have a number of operations I can do, but all of these operations have to happen as a batch at a certain time, while calls to activate _and_ deactivate these operations can come in at any time. No matter how many times the `doOperation1()` method/function is called the operation is done only once in the batch. To implement this, I could use flags like `doOperation1` and `doOperation2` but this seems like it would become difficult to maintain. Is there a design pattern, or something similar, that addresses this situation?
