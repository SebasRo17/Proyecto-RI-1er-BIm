I have defined a function               logicalInputField[i_, fieldSize_, numberOfFields_, enable_,tx_,symbol_] :=     Column[{InputField[Dynamic[tx[[i]]], Number, ImageSize -> fieldSize,      Enabled -> enable, ContinuousAction -> True],       Dynamic[If[TrueQ[tx[[i]] == ""],                             (symbol[[i]] = "Please Enter"),(symbol[[i]] ="Right")                                                                                  ]  ]}]       I am calling this function here.               DynamicModule[     {s = {}},      For[i = 1, i <= 3, i++,          With[{i = i},AppendTo[s, logicalInputField[i, {50, 20}, 3, True,{"", "", ""}, {"Please Enter", "Please Enter", "Please Enter"}]]]];          Panel[ Row[s]]]      I want to ask whenever I am not giving tx and symbol as an argument at the time of defining function. and then calling it, it works fine. But, as soon as I enter some value in `InputField` , it gives error message               Set::setps: {, ,} in the part assignment is not a symbol.      Why? How can I call the `Part` of a variable from the user defined function.
