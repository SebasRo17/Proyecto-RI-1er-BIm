I am wondering why it seems to be popular to have the login page of a SPA be a separate page that is not page of the SPA (as in loaded and send data through ajax requests)? I only thing I can think of is security but I can't think a specific security reason. I mean the only thing that come to mind is that if your login page in part of the SPA, it sends the username/password through ajax which can be seen by such tools like firebug or web inspector however even if you send it as a normal POST request, there are other tools that can easily capture this data (like fiddler, httpscoop, etc...). Is there something I am missing?
