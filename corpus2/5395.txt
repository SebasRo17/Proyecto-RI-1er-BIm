I am storing lists of expressions into a MySQL database. Each list is of form               {_String, {_String, _Real}, _Real}      What data format should each column of the database table be? I am thinking `TEXT`, `TEXT`, `FLOAT`. Any suggestions? I need to be able to import values back to Mathematica (with `SQLExecute[]`, `SQLSelect[]`, etc.) and be able to work with expressions in Mathematica program.
