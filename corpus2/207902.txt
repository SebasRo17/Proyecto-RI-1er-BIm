I am new to sql. I have added 2 new tables in database. The primary key of first is a foreign key in the other. The type of the keys is integer. Now I want to generate the keys in the code and assign it to new data so that the association between different rows of the tables is right. How do I ensure uniqueness of keys and also get the latest key from the db so that there are no errors while saving. If I had used guids then I would have assigned a new guid to the primary key and then assigned the same to the foreign key in the other table. Also there are multiple clients and one server which is saving the data. The data to be inserted in both the tables is decided in the c# code and is not derived from the row inserted in the primary table. Even if get the id in db then also the relation between the rows should be stored in some form from the code because after that it is lost.
