I have a web-application with an async HTTP backend, which gets called by the client by AJAX requests. The client has to start a job and then polls for the result. I started with a simple 150ms polling interval, which was fine for small jobs, but big jobs, which could take several minutes, threw many failed requests to the server. Currently, I just add 1000ms to the delay after every poll, so the polling gets slower over time for longer requests, but never longer than 10 seconds. **Are there some formulas, statistics, or algorithms that I could use to dynamically optimize the polling time?**
