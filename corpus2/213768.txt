For example a new research paper comes out and it describes some algorithm, say this is a cutting edge algorithm and came out last week, is there anything stopping me from using that algorithm in my codebase that is for commercial purposes? What if the paper includes some code and I use that code? There does not seem to be any information about code licensing on the paper so I am not sure how this is meant to work.
