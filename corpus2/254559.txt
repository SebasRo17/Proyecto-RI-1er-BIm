I heard that twitter practices "dogfooding," meaning that they use their own API for the website. However, I don't really understand how that's true. When I use Firebug, I see that all the AJAX calls are made to some URL like:               https://twitter.com/{username}/{whatever else}      Rather than:               https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/...      If they are using different URL's, how are they using their own API? I think I have the wrong notion of what an API is... Also, how would it work with OAuth? Do they validate themselves? How does one use his/her own API ("dogfood")?
