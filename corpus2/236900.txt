Im currently working on a rails program. It contains many different databases but to keep things simple I have a people, student, and faculty table. A person can be a student or faculty member and there all connected by the person_id. A faculty member advises students so the student is connected to the faculty member by the id of the faculty. To create a student you need to select a major and a faculty member(faculty_id). Being that the student and faculty members are all people.. in my dropdown I had to use               <div>       <%= f.input :faculty_id %>       <%= f.association :person, label: "Advisor", label_method: :to_label ,  value_method: :id, include_blank: false, collection:  Person.where("role_id=?", @role.id)%>          </div>      to limit the people in the drop down to only faculty members. But the issue Im running into now is how would I set the faculty_id attribute of the student with the selected value of the association collection?
