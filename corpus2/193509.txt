Considering that it's April, 2013; do I still need to worry about non- JavaScript capable/enabled clients? Note: This question excludes having helper text with: _JavaScript is required to view this page, upgrade to a modern browser or modify your settings_ BTW: Just to be clear, in order to cater to non-JavaScript capable/enabled clients; I will have to: prerender (cache) a version of my decoupled (JavaScript on the client-side consumes my RESTful API) website. Because of framework limitations this will result in far less functionality for the non-JavaScript user.
