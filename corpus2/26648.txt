I've tried to run the following code:               f[x_] := 2 ArcTan[x] + ArcSin[2 x/(1 + x^2)];     Plot[D[f[x], x], {x, -4, 4}]      Same with `SetDelayed`:               df[x_] := D[f[x], x];     Plot[df[x], {x, -4, 4}]      It starts to complaining:               General::ivar: -3.99984 is not a valid variable. >>     General::ivar: -3.83657 is not a valid variable. >>     General::ivar: -3.67331 is not a valid variable. >>     General::stop: Further output of General::ivar will be suppressed during this calculation. >>      But this code works:               f[x_] := 2 ArcTan[x] + ArcSin[2 x/(1 + x^2)];     df = D[f[x], x];     Plot[df, {x, -4, 4}]      Did I miss something or this is an issue?
