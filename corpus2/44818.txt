Suppose I have a function of a variable `f`, depending on some other parameters `a` and `b`, for example: `fun[f_,a_,b_] := Sin[a*f] + Cos[b*f]` I can plot and manipulate this function for some independent values of the parameters `a` and `b`: `Manipulate[Plot[fun[f,a,b], {f, 0, 10}], {a,0,5},{b,0,5}]` ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YD0A2.png) Now, suppose I would like to give discrete values to these parameters, and change both at the same time. For example,I define two points: `A = Sequence[1,1];` and `B = Sequence[4,2];` I can do this plots: `Plot[fun[f,A], {f, 0, 10}]` or `Plot[fun[f,B], {f, 0, 10}]` but when I try to combine them, in order to include the possibility to manually choose between 'A' or 'B', `Manipulate[Plot[fun[f, X], {f, 0, 10}], {X, A, B}]` I obtain an empty plot... Instead, I would like to get a plot with two button, 'A' and 'B', corresponding to two different pairs of values for the parameters a and b. I tried to use `List[ ]` instead of `Sequence[ ]`, but it failed to work too! I also tried `Row[ ]`, adding some braces but nothing happened... :( What should I do? Where is the problem with my code? Thank you all in advance!
