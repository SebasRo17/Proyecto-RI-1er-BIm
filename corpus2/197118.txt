I'm currenetly struggling with choosing how to proceed as a programmer. I mainly programmed games and would like to continue. And for about 5 years or so I just used C++ and OpenGL, so I spent a lot of time on infrastructure, strange bugs, and mostly getting basic things to work. A friend of mine then recommended python and after initially being aversed by it being not as explicit and formal as I was used to I was shocked by how much more productive I could be and how much progress I could actually make in a very small amount of time. So currently I'm working on a multiplayer-shooter and repeatedly I find myself struggling with python being not as fast I might want it to be. I know that that I have to approach writing efficient code in python very differently now, but even with a little help from friends that are more experienced with python there is just too much going on sometimes (and extrapolating this, I know that I will end up stuck). There are a lot of things I really like about my "home-language" C++, but after knowing how many hours I could be wasting I don't really want to go back. What language can you recommend which offers high-productivy, is memory-safe (I really hated this) and as high-performance as I can get, but is still mature enough to be used for kind of serious projects (games-related) and maybe even mature enough to have people already having spent some time on OpenGL-Bindings or various libraries for Sound and similar (alternatively easy access to shared libraries written in C). Easy cross-plattform is a big plus! So no .NET please. Is this even possible?
