Often we as programmers see large organisations wasting huge sums of money on bloated and inefficient solutions to problems. This pains me greatly because I like organisations to benefit from best of breed solutions. However, my abilities as a programmer are limited when it comes to influencing the key decision makers and often my perspective on the matter is constrained to my own little technical world. So, my question is this. After encountering an egregious waste of money on some software and/or hardware that really got your goat, **what did you do about it to get it fixed** or were you doomed to bite the bullet and mutter forever under your breath? I'm interested in hearing your overall experiences **and especially what lessons you learned about how to tackle this sort of thing in the future**. Let's not name names, the experience of how to tackle the problem is more important than the actual offending product.
