How does one now implement a discrete set of state space models? I had used `KalmanFilter` in the old TimeSeries application, but was keen on trying to do all this in the "new paradigm" of StateSpaceModel[] in _Mathematica_ 10. _Mathematica_ 's own docs for the TimeSeries package has a section on state- space form and the Kalman Filter. Fundamentally I want to make F and G time-index dependent lists of matrices. Ultimately I want to implement a time-varying CAPM model as described in Tsay using _Mathematica_ 10. Ideas?
