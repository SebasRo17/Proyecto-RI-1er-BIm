When looking through Java documentation or answers for Stack Overflow / programming forum questions, I often see people referring to methods like `String#format`, `Object#clone` etc, rather than `String.format`. Is this something to do with it being a non-static method, or is this just some convention? This is quite hard to search for due to most search engines ignoring the '#' symbol so I apologise if this is a duplicate question.
