I am not very used to do numerical simulations on Mathematica. I have a problem with numerical integration of this function. Is there any way for this calculation? Input:               α := 0.07          A := Sin[θ]*Sin[θ2]*Cos[φ - φ2] + Cos[θ]*Cos[θ2]     B := Sin[θ]*Sin[θ3]*Cos[φ - φ3] + Cos[θ]*Cos[θ3]     V := Sin[θ2]*Sin[θ3]*Cos[φ2 - φ3] + Cos[θ2]*Cos[θ3]          c2 := (B*c*c3 - c3*c3)/(A*c - c3*V)          integrand :=       1/2 1/((-1 + E^(c^2 - α)) (-1 + E^(c2^2 - α)) Abs[A c - c3 V])       c^4 c2^2 c3^2 (1 + 1/(-1 + E^(c^2 - α))) (1 + 1/(-1 + E^(c3^2 - α)))      (1 + 1/(-1 + E^(c^2 + 2 A c c2 + c2^2 - B c c3 + c3^2 - 2 c2 c3 V - α)))       (1 + 3 Cos[2 θ]) (c Cos[θ] - c3 Cos[θ3])      (c2 Cos[θ2] - c3 Cos[θ3]) Sin[θ] Sin[θ2] Sin[θ3]          NIntegrate[integrand,          {c3, 0, ∞}, {θ3, 0, π}, {θ2, 0, π},          {φ3, 0, 2 π}, {φ2, 0, 2 π}, {c, 0, ∞}, {θ, 0, π}, {φ, 0, 2 π},          Method -> "MultiDimensional"]      Output:                   NIntegrate::slwcon: Numerical integration converging too slowly; suspect one of the      following: singularity, value of the integration is 0, highly oscillatory integrand, or      WorkingPrecision too small. >>              NIntegrate::eincr: The global error of the strategy GlobalAdaptive has increased more      than 2000 times. The global error is expected to decrease monotonically after a number of      integrand evaluations. Suspect one of the following: the working precision is insufficient      for the specified precision goal; the integrand is highly oscillatory or it is not a      (piecewise) smooth function; or the true value of the integral is 0. Increasing the value of      the GlobalAdaptive option MaxErrorIncreases might lead to a convergent numerical      integration. NIntegrate obtained -27257.8 and 652260.228217954` for the integral and error      estimates. >>      I am using Mathematica 8.0
