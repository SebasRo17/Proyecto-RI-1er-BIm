I am looking for advice on how to create my data schema for a public web site. Currently, we have an Intranet website where our agents create the data needed for reservations. The data includes tables like Establishments, products, prices per periods, and a typical Users table. This intranet is already in production. I've been tasked to create a public web site, where anonymous Joe and Jane will be able to book a reservation without calling one of our agent. The site will offer registration and will display the data available from the Intranet, albeit as read-only. The public site itself will have some data of its own. I am a bit reluctant to combine the data from the public site into the same database than our intranet, but most of the information that will be displayed on the public site will come from the pre-entered data from the intranet. Are there any best practices concerning the separation and sharing of information between a public and a private website?
