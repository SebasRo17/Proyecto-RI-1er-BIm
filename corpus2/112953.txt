Throughout my various workplaces and through my university life I always wrote code which I thought "this would be really useful in generic situations". Indeed, I intentionally write code, even if it takes me a while to write, which I know will help me in the future (e.g. custom `SubString()` functions). Hence the reason for 'Helper' classes. These functions I'm sure can probably be found elsewhere online but the point is, I wrote them, and I will use them again later in other jobs or for personal projects. Currently I don't maintain a personal code library as I never have time to sit there and copy code from my work place / projects to another personal location. Question is, is it wrong to take code you have produced at work and re-use it ( **a** ) for personal projects, and ( **b** ) in other jobs?
