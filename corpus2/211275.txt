Is there some sort of standard regarding http api responses? After reading this discourse thread I started to wonder. We are developing our public http json api at my work, and we do not return anything when it's not strictly needed (for example a PUT to /resource/{id} only returns 200 when ok or the corresponding 4XX or 5XX code, but no json body) Should we return a generic `{"success":true}` like they discuss on that link above, or is it ok to return a "void" body and handle everything with http response codes?
