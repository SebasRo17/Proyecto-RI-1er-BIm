I was in a heated discussion the other day, about whether or not it's practical to have a perfect validation score on any HTML document. By practical I mean:   * Does not take a ridiculous amount of time compared to it's almost-perfect counterpart.   * Can be made to **look good on _older browsers_** and to **be usable on _very old browsers_**.   * Justifies the effort it may take to do so (does it come with some kind of reward on SEO/Usability/Accessibility that cannot be achieved in a simpler way with almost-perfect validation) So basically, **is perfect validation score practical on any HTML document?**
