This is a legal question with mixing code I've written in my own time with code I've been paid to write for an employer. I'm employed at a company with an employment contract, and am paid hourly. This is in Ontario, Canada in case that that affects matters. I've been working on a project for my employer, and in this project I've incorporated some code that I had previously written in my own time at my house for another project (as in I own the code outright). My code is now tightly coupled with the project at work (as in it won't work without it). I have at times needed to make changes to my original code to get it working with my work project, and since I am paid hourly for my time, I've technically been paid to work on my own code. But since I was paid for it, does my employer now technically own this code? Suppose I leave this company tomorrow, do I need to leave my source code behind? I'm not saying I would, but do I still retain exclusive and unrestricted rights to my original code?
