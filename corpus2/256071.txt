I want to develop a website in CodeIgniter framework in which I can access any webpage via slug. For example just like WordPress and Magento we can access category page by `www.sitename.com/category_type/category_detailpage` And also we can access that Category_detail directly just by adding its slug after main URI `www.sitename.com/category_detailpage`. How I have to design schema of slug table in database if you have any case study Project Code for this Slug Directory in CodeIgniter then please let me know. I want to manage whole websites slug in only one table. But I haven't clear idea about how I can manage category / subcategory / detailpage in only one table and then how can I access it using slug only? I wants to make my own custom framework in codeigniter so that I can access any page via slug only whether it's category page subcategory page or any single page. How can I achieve that?
