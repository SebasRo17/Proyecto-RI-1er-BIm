I am a beginner with _Mathematica_. For my research purpose I would like to get a list of all the polynomials in $F_2[x,y,z,w]$ and for each polynomial I would like to know the result that it gives then it is applied on each point on $F_2 ^ 4$. More concretely, F_2={0,1}.Take 2 variables x and y. Consider all possible polynomials, where degree of both x and y are less than or equal to 1.you have usual multiplication and addition modulo 2.(that means whatever you get by adding or multiplying elements of F_2 take the remainder when divided by 2). The desired answer would be like, Polynomials (0,0) (0, 1) (1,0) (1,1)                x         0     0     1     1       likewise consider all other polynomials with the property given above and I would like to get a table of what values the polynomial takes at the given point, like I have mentioned for the polynomial x. Any help will be appreciated.
