I've been itching for a while to learn a new language. I cut my teeth on PHP, though I don't use it anymore. I primarily program in D and Python now. I feel that these languages complement each other well, because D is close to the metal, statically typed and bleeding edge, while Python is more dynamic, interpreted, more mature and has better library support. I also know C pretty well (mostly learned from using the C-like subset of D), have some knowledge of C++, and have written a few very small one-off programs in Perl and Java. The key things I want in a langauge are:   * A language that significantly expands my horizons. I don't want to learn something that doesn't teach me anything conceptually interesting relative to D and Python.   * A practically oriented language. I absolutely, 110% refuse to spend any effort whatsoever learning a language that feels academic and emphasizes purity over practicality.   * Something that is mature, modern and well supported enough to use for real work. This doesn't necessarily mean large production projects, but at least serious prototypes and research code.   * Good generics, templates, duck typing, type inference, or something similar to avoid the rigidity of plain old static typing is a must.   * Terseness and readability count, though these are admittedly subjective.
