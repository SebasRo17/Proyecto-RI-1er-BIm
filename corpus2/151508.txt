GNU recommends making an `AUTHORS` file to list the authors and contributors of a program. But how many "levels" of authors and contributors should the file contain? E.g. if I write a program `foo` that actively use some library, should I include the authors of that library in the `AUTHORS` file? It seems that the answer is "yes," because total code of `foo` contains code from the library. But if yes, that means I should also include the authors of all other libraries, including standard libraries of the compiler, authors of the compiler and other tools for producing final executable code, authors of the OS... When I should stop?
