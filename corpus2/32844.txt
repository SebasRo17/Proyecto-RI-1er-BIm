I have a function f(x,y,z) of three variables and some constants:               P1 = 630*10^6;     a1 = 6.1;     deltaf = 680*10^-28;     rho = 13600;     Na = 6.03*10^23;     M = 270;     N1 = rho*Na/M;     sigmaf = N1*deltaf;     v1 = 161/(0.7958)^3;     Ef = 3.2*10^-11;     A1 = 3.87*P1/(v1*Ef*sigmaf);          flux1[x_, y_, z_] :=   A1*Cos[\[Pi]*x/a1]*Cos[\[Pi]*y/a1]*Cos[\[Pi]*z/a1];       I want to plot this function in 3D frame with color to represent the value of a f(x,y,z) at each triplet point. And need color bar to show variation. Give me suggestions. I have used the following command but it is not working properly.               ContourPlot3D[      A1*Cos[\[Pi]*x/a1]*Cos[\[Pi]*y/a1]*Cos[\[Pi]*z/a1], {x, -3,        3}, {y, -3, 3}, {z, -3, 3},       ColorFunction -> (ColorData["TemperatureMap"][#3] &)]      I want the plot to look like this: ![plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/h0Zwy.png) (It is the last plot on this page.)
