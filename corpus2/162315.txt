What are the conventions for item batch identifiers in inventory management systems? For example: A retail supermarket can order '`Item X`' from either 'Supplier A' or 'Supplier B'. When it completes an order for the item from either supplier, it needs to store the record of the receipt. Inventory quantity for the item is increased upon receipt of the order. However it is also required to store some record of the supplier. Thus some sort of batch identifier is required. This batch identifier will uniquely identify the item received and the supplier from whom it is received. A new batch is created each time items are received in stock (for example, after an order). Hence, for purposes of accounting / auditing, information available to identify an item after it was sold comprises of `ITEM_CODE`, `ITEM_NAME`, `BATCH_CODE`. The `BATCH_CODE` is unique and is associated with `DATE_RECEIVED`, `SUPPLIER_CODE`, `QTY_RECEIVED`. Is this a complete system specification for the above scenario or has anything significant been left out?
