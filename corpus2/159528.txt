Some time ago I was to learn iOS development at my work. I didn't manage to learn it because I was moved to more important task with another technology already familiar to me. But the short time I spent on iOS, I felt that I could do better if I spent a few hours at the workplace during which I could discuss some matters concerning iOS with my colleagues who know it, and the rest of the time working at home. I think many developers would share my opinion and prefer to learn the new technology at home. Is there any accepted practice? Has any developer had an experience when the company encouraged the developers to choose where they feel more comfortable to learn new technologies?
