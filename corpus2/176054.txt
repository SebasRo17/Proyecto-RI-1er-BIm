I am developing a web application and have the app deployed into Tomcat server. Tested on IE and Firefox and are working fine. Meaning when I close the browser and reopen the app, the data will be reset. When deploy to Websphere, the data is reset only in IE but Firefox don't. Meaning Firefox will cache the old data. I did try to clear the cache in FF but still failed. I did a test in FF3 and FF16, FF3 will reset the value but FF16 doesn't, I am just so curious why this could happened? Now I don't know whether this is my code problem or is actually the FF caching problem. Any clue on this?
