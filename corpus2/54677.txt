I am making complex 3d graphics, and to clear up functions, I want to use `With` to remove a repeated action. This action occurs many times through many functions, so I want the `With` outside all of them, so I only declare it once. Except Mathematica doesn't seem to like having a `With` outside a function, if it is replacing parameters. A simplified version is shown below:               With[{y = x},      draw[x_] := Cylinder[{{y,0,0}, {y+1,0,1}}, 0.1]      ...(*other functions:See Bottom!!!!!!!!*)     ]      then:               Graphics3D[draw[3]]      If I do the above, it brings the error: ![The Error](http://i.stack.imgur.com/c2VB8.png) So it should go y -> x -> 3. But it only gets half-way. It has changed y to x but I think it is after when the parameters are put in, so x is not changed to 3. Is there a way to keep the `with` outside, so it is only declared once. Also, in case anybody says put the `With` before `cylinder`. No, I don't want to do that, as there are other functions using the values changed by "With" -----------------------EDIT----------------------------- The answers can replace the values for one function, as is shown in the code example, but it doesn't show (although I did say it), that it needs to work through many functions, as shown below. Sorry for the confusion, as causing the first two answers to not fully work.               With[{y = x},      draw1[x_] := Cylinder[{{y, 0, 0}, {y + 1, 0, 1}}, 0.1],       draw2[x_] := Cylinder[{{y, 0, 0}, {y + 1, 0, 1}}, 0.2]      ...(*more functions*)     ]
