I've been hearing a-lot about the "new" MV* frameworks. I've tinkered with KnockoutJS, creating an invoicing application, but I much prefer to write clean, modular code in raw JavaScript - leveraging utility APIs and other libraries when necessary. Given a methodical/structured/SOLID approach to writing a JavaScript application, where OOP, SOC, SRP and other design principles are adhered to, wouldn't the usage of MV* frameworks be superfluous? Are there any articles that express/address these concerns? I've found one in the past _note - i've migrated this question from SO to this site, as its more appropriate for this audience._
