I am going to start a little side project very soon, but this time i want to do not just the little UML domain model and case diagrams i often do before programming, i thought about making a full functional specification. Is there anybody that has experience writing functional specifications that could recommend me what i need to add to it? How would be the best way to start preparing it? Here i will write down the topics that i think are more relevant:   * Purpose   * Functional Overview   * Context Diagram   * Critical Project Success Factors   * Scope (In & Out)   * Assumptions   * Actors (Data Sources, System Actors)   * Use Case Diagram   * Process Flow Diagram   * Activity Diagram   * Security Requirements   * Performance Requirements   * Special Requirements   * Business Rules   * Domain Model (Data model)   * Flow Scenarios (Success, alternateâ€¦)   * Time Schedule (Task Management)   * Goals   * System Requirements   * Expected Expenses ## What do you think about those topics? Shall i add something else? or maybe remove something? I rode every single answer, and i would like to thank all of you for the useful information. I am doing this side project for a company, and they spect from me a constant flow of communication and i will need to explain why i do every single thing, because i will have to administer the resources they will give to me. This will be my first func spec and as i said i want it to be useful, not just big and useless. I think this is something that has to be done, but i want to do it in the way that will be more useful for me and my team. Its bad that i we dont have a manager, so thats why i also need to take care about some administrative tasks... Regarding to the agile programming, i think this is 100% compatible with the agile aproach. I am an Agile programmer my self and i honestly fell more confident when someone already did the thinking for me. I still Junnior, but i worked before as a Tapestry web developer in other projects, were the organization was a total chaos. I dont agree i am doing a waterfall aproach, i think i am just trying to define some boundaries that will make the project being easier when the development starts.
