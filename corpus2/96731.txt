Studying for the .NET 70-515 exam. There is a chapter on Web Parts. I will suck it up and learn what I need to learn here, but... I am wondering, do ASP.NET developers in the real world often turn to Web Parts _outside_ of SharePoint development? I do not **ever** plan to deal with SharePoint - I prefer working on large scale public-facing web sites and applications - and Web Parts (SharePoint, too) hardly seem useful to me in that context. But what do I know? Help me understand the relevance or irrelevance of this technology, please. Should I keep ASP.NET Web Parts on my _ignore-list_ , if SharePoint is already on it too? Thanks!
