I have been working in a hedge fund firm for two years and I am the only person who writes almost all the codes. So far, luckily there is no software glitch or bug causing money lost. However, it is not guaranteed that it never occur. I am just wondering if there is a way to write safe code. Of course, unit test is one of the ways. But some of the tests cases are not easy to test and some situations may only occurs in a specific day e.g. busy trading day and the program cannot handle it. FYI my company will hire a less senior develop in the coming months. EDIT: Regarding the safety, the program is not allow to send numerous erroneous orders to the market like Knight Capital . To an extreme extend, program crash is far more better than it. Since I am the developer and also the tester, the software is ready to release that is based on my decision. I agree that tester is required. However, I have a concern that is the tester need to know the whole logic of the trading system which is confidential stuff.
