I work at a company that wants to be agile, but the business analysts often provide us "user stories" that are more solution than problem statement. This makes it difficult to make good design decisions, or in more extreme cases, leaves few design decisions to be made. It does not help the programmers understand the user's needs or make better design decisions in the future. Our product owner makes an effort to provide us with problem statements, but we still sometimes get solution statements, and that tends toward a "code monkey" situation. An additional challenge is that some (not all) of my teammates do not see a problem with this, and some of them honestly want to be told what to do. Thus, when we receive a solution statement on our backlog, they are eager to jump right in and work on it. I believe that as a software engineer part of my job is to understand the user's needs so that I can build the right thing for the user. However, within our organization structure, I have zero contact with the user. What kind of things can I do to better understand our users?
