for clarity, **code review** = a team meeting and reviewing/sharing code What are the potentially negative aspects of the code review process in a development environment? What comes to mind for me   * Strong criticism can lead to negative interactions and feelings of animosity between colleagues.    * Laziness to read and understand new code can lead to apathetic and very general feedback.   * Considerable Time investment is required to organize and execute the review process. There must be more than this though, What negative things have you guys noticed or experienced?
