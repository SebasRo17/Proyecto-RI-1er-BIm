I hold masters in CS and now I'm mobile apps developer (entry level), I always start to plan things when starting or doing any project both at work and projects I do at home (for passion) - as I can deliver the project on time but sometimes I am running out of time like 10 tasks a day vs my time forecast will take 2 on that day? As I'm beginner level, I want your suggestions on how important is task management for a person like me and for achieving my goals? My target for the next 3 years will be a Project Manager or similar role - I believe which these time managing skills will be a needed quality.
