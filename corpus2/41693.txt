I would like to produce some **3D** distributions of points using **_Mathematica 7.0_** , that **look like** the picture below : ![A 3D fractal-like/percolation-like distribution of random points in 3D space](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CEajz.png) How could I do that ? What are your suggestions ? What Mma 7 codes could do a distribution of points which is _approximately_ like this ? I'm not specifically looking for a diffusion limited aggregation method. Any other method would be interesting, if it's reasonably fast. Ideally, the code should compile very fast. Adding some color shades to the distribution would be a nice option. **EDIT :** The picture above was taken from this topic : Distribution of random points in 3D space to simulate the Crab Nebula which is about filaments and sub-structures in the Crab nebula.
