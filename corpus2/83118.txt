I've been asked to estimate the percentage of time I spend coding at my current position in a job interview (I said about 70%). This excludes time for things like documentation and meetings. What does this statistic tell an interviewer? I'm guessing that they are looking for a balance between coding too little (thus being out of practice) and coding too much (not seeing the bigger picture of product development). * * * EDIT: After reviewing your answers I'm even more curious what the actual reasoning behind this question was... I should have just asked the interviewer! Your answers are actually really funny in the context of this company.
