But there is an error like bash: `/home/gaurav/Desktop/package2/B.java: Permission denied` Here is My first code and directory is /home/Desktop/package/A.java               package package1;     public class A     {     interface A1     { void show();       void display();     }     }          class B extends A     {      public void show()     {     System.out.println("This is show method()");     }     public void display()     {     System.out.println("this is Display metthod()");     }     }      For compilation I did this command it's works fine.
