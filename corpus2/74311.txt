Background: I want to learn, try out new frameworks, tools, languages, but I'm terrible at coming up with something to build. The company I work for recently completed work on building a piece of software for internal use. I was not involved in the project at all. The software is purely internal, we do not sell it on. The results are not what people hoped for. Is it acceptable for me to build my own solution in my own time but use the requirement documentation for the companies project? Are there pitfalls I should watch out for with this approach, things I can do to mitigate those risks? Alternatively I could build it the way I think it should be done without referencing those docs. Is this the better approach as it definitely frees me to do what I like with the code afterwards?
