We have to develop our own file management system in Java web application. We need to sync files between our main server and client severs and find out whether all the client server has all the latest version of files. Our files are in pdf, doc and xls format they changes every now and then as and when it is required. What we are thinking of using MD5 checksum to find out hashcode of files on Main server and store it in database. Same would be there in Client Servers database. After comparing records on database we would come to know whether client servers are synced or not. Please suggest if there are any better ways to do the same.
