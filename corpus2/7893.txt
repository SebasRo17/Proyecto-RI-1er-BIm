I have a computing environment comprised of:   * 27" iMac with dual cores running Mac OS X 10.6.8 and   * 2 XServes each with 2 quad cores running Max OS X Server 10.6.8   * All networking by ethernet to a Time capsule. I now run Mathematica on the iMac and use the XServes for parallel processing. I have Wolfram lightweight grid manager running on the XServes. Since installing the grid manager the XServes won't fall asleep. Their energy use settings look like this: ![Energy Saver settings](http://i.stack.imgur.com/JiOIj.png) which should trigger them into sleep mode after 5 minutes of inactivity. The warm summer weather has made this a pressing issue. XServes run hot and power hungry. I don't need them running constantly and don't want to run air conditioning all the time to cool them. Also, I want to run some processing from a remote location while I escape NY's summer heat for a few days. Sleeping and waking the servers figure into my working vacation plan ;-) Does grid manager run some process which prevents the XServes falling asleep? If so, how can I start and stop the process?
