Consider this example:               Manipulate[status = Dynamic[If[a < b, Yes, No]], {a, 2}, {b, 5}]      The output of this calculation is               (*Yes*)      when I call status again I get `Yes` as expected. No when I want to used the output of status in further calculation I failed. I tried to do the following:               status === Yes      the results is `False` The full form of status is not what is seen in the output. My question is, how to use the output of expression no matter what the definition of that expression is. (Note: `status[[1]]` does not help because the level of the output is unpredictable) Thank you.
