I've just started making some simple but non trivial(i think) programs in Ubuntu -- as of now have made a small xkcd scraper, which i plan to develop into a multi webcomic downloader+viewer At this point, would it be a good idea to start publishing the code on a site like Github or launchpad? (currently I'm not really worried about people copying my code/licensing) Or is it better to publish the code only after the program is completed? Also, can you suggest some such sites where I can post such codes and get suggestions for improvements/discuss the code with others?
