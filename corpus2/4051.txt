I asked this same question in Mathematics, and it was suggested I might try here. I'm more comfortable with Maple, but if I can get Mathematica to do what I'm after, so much the better. Basically I'm trying to symbolically integrate something like this: $\displaystyle\int \frac{a\mu-b}{||a\mu-b||^3} \mathrm{d}\mu$ where $a,b$ are vectors and $\mu$ is a scalar. The denominator is the cube of the 2-norm of the vector, and can be found by taking the dot product of a vector with itself, and raising it to the power of $\frac{3}{2}$. Right now in Maple I'm explicitly multiplying out the denominator and making substitutions so that the denominator, at least, is only in terms of scalars ($a \cdot a = C$, etc. ), but I hate doing it this way, because it adds a lot of bookkeeping. Basically I'd like the computer to understand that $a * (b \cdot a)$ is not the same thing as $b * a^2$, but that $a \cdot b * c \cdot d = c \cdot d * a \cdot b$. What's the most kosher way to do this integration in Mathematica? **UPDATE** This is the full integral I'm trying to do. I'm not sure it even has an answer, but the first integral is similar to what I have above. So I was hoping I could take any techniques that work on the simpler one above and apply them to the full problem below. Let: $\vec{f} = (a - c) \mu_1 + (b - c) \upsilon_1 - (x - z) \mu_2 - (y-z) \upsilon_2 - (z - c) $ where $a, b, c, x, y, z$ are vectors representing positions, and $\mu_1, \nu_1, \mu_2, \nu_2$ are scalars. I want to find: $\vec{F_G} = \displaystyle\int_0^1 \int_0^{1-v_2} \int_0^{1} \int_0^{1-v_1} \! \frac{f}{||{f}||^3} \, \mathrm{d} \mu_1 \mathrm{d} \upsilon_1 \mathrm{d} \mu_2 \mathrm{d} \upsilon_2 $
