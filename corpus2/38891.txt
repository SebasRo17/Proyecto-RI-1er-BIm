I'm starting my first Ruby on Rails project as I've been excited about the language for quite a while now and I'm sick of writing PHP. I've gathered that rails is pretty much an automation framework which should really speed up programming on the backend for me. Though this does not impact the frontend, I still need to write tables, styles and div's to put my layout together. I know there's libraries like ExtJS out there that automate a big part of this process but I was wondering if there's any frameworks out there that actually integrate with Ruby on Rails, as in, offer a build-in way to handle ajax queries for example. **TLDR** : I would really appreciate some tips on a good JS framework to go with Ruby on Rails.
