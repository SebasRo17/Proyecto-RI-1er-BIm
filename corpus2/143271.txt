> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  how do you remember programming related stuff? During my work experiences, I always met many kind of blocking problems with different technologies. When I remember the efforts I spent to find the solutions I become frustrated and want to find a way to keep all in mind. Generally I keep all the project I made in my Hard Drive, and I usually reuse them when I encounter a problem i already encountered. But this is not to really efficient when you reopen your own code and say: Who is the sucker who wrote this code!? I'm thinking to make my own website in which I can post some tutorials / articles about the problems I met and their solutions. So I keep all in mind and help community. Do you think that it will be a good idea or just a loss of time regarding the actual programming forums?
