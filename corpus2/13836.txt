We know that changing the option `InterpolationOrder` in `ListLinePlot`、`ListPlot3D`、`ListContourPlot` will change the shape of the curve:               (*A example from the help*)     data = {{0, 0}, {1, 2}, {3, 4}, {4, 2}, {6, 0}};     Table[ListLinePlot[data, InterpolationOrder -> n], {n, {0, 1, 3}}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KLxc6.png) But nothing changes for NDSolve:               Table[Plot[Evaluate[First[x[t] /. NDSolve[{x'[t] == y[t], y'[t] == -x[t], x[0] == 1,              y[0] == 0}, {x, y}, {t, 0, 10}, InterpolationOrder -> n]]], {t, 0, 10}], {n, 1, 3}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/AsyM8.png) I checked the help and found the only example for `InterpolationOrder` in `NDSolve` is to set it to `All`. (The same example appears in two different places…) So I met the question written in the title, and, what if I want to change the `InterpolationOrder` of the `InterpolatingFunction` worked out by `NDSolve`? * * * (Sigh…) Seems that `InterpolationOrder` in `NDSolve` is really "useless", and there's no option that can change the interpolation order of `InterpolatingFunction` worked out by `NDSolve`…whatever! here I've already picked up another approach for changing the order: I just need to replace the `InterpolatingPolynomial` with `Interpolation[…, InterpolationOrder -> …]` in the link.
