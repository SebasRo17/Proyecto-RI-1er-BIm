There are already few questions here on Programmers about organizing small teams, but we have a bigger (medium-sized?) team, and that's a bit of a different animal. So, my question is this: **How do you organize a medium-sized team with a very large, older codebase**? Or better, let's quantify it a little more clearly: The team has:   * 20 Developers (good mix of senior and junior)   * 7 QA Folks The product is large (2 million lines of code) with 10-12 major modules divided over three major areas (Desktop client, backend server, web). The team needs to do:   * support/maintenance for the existing customer base   * Customize the product to support new sales and existing customers   * Build new features to keep the product moving forward   * provide regression testing for all new features as well as fleshing out regression for technical debt Specific sub-questions:   * What are the thoughts on "Specific support team" vs. "Module teams fix all their bugs"   * How do you maximize development time and minimize admin time (code reviews, other "lead developer stuff")   * How do you integrate/organize the QA people to ensure proper testing and regression suites?    * What non-technical positions (QA Manager, Dev Manager, etc.) might be good for maximizing developer productivity? Your thoughts on the matter are greatly appreciated. EDIT: I should add that I'm not clueless here, I'm just trying to stimulate some ideas. This isn't an easy problem, and so I'm open to the wisdom of you fine people here.
