I have this equation:               4b*Cos[2t]-4a*Sin[2t]==4Cos[2t]+8Sin[2t]      Which I would like to solve. Without using mathematica, you can pretty easily see that a = -2 and b = 1, but when I solve it with mathematica it gives me various long results including sometimes tan, sec cot etc. I can break it up into to parts like this:               Solve[4b*Cos[2t]==4Cos[2t],b]     Solve[-4a*Sin[2t]==+8Sin[2t],a]      However, the point with mathematica isn't to make everything manually, and I would hope there is a method to use, without manually editing the equations. So my question is: How do I solve this for a and b, with the results of a = -2 and b = 1?
