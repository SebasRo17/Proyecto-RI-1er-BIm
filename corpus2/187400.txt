More specifically: **Is a job in programming really as bad as it sounds?** I'm still in high school, but I love programming. I take all of the programming classes that my school offers (which are actually quite a lot), and program in my free time. In college, I intend to do something related to programming, and then I eventually hope to get a job in programming something. However, from what I've read on the internet, a job in programming sounds really terrifying and intimidating, and I'm wondering what it's like, and if it's really as bad as it sounds.
