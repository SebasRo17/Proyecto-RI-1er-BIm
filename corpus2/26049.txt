I'm trying to use `ListPlot3D` to plot some data, and I'm using the `InterpolationOrder` option to make the plot smoother. But the output plot is not very responsive when rotate or edit with the drawing tool. Here is an example:               ls = Table[Sinc[x*y], {x, -10, 10, 0.2}, {y, -10, 10, 0.2}];     ListPlot3D[ls, PlotRange -> All]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/l0mny.jpg) setting `InterpolationOrder->2` gives a smoother plot, ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/eCWs9.jpg) The problem is the second plot response very slowing when rotate with the mouse. So is it possible to produce an interpolated smooth but very responsive plot? Here is what I've tried so far               f = ListInterpolation[ls, {{-10, 10}, {-10, 10}}];     ListPlot3D[Table[f[x, y], {x, -10, 10, 0.1}, {y, -10, 10, 0.1}],       PlotRange -> All];      this gives nicer plot than the first one, but is still seems not as good as the second one. Adding more points seems makes the plot unresponsive.
