**Idea.** To make my shareware program free in less-developed countries. Or release a free edition for these countries. **Purpose.** More users, bug reports, extensions, active forum, etc. Anyway, 90% sales are in ~30 richest countries. Why not make it free in China, India, Russia... **Question.** What are possible problems? I can't find info on this topic. It seems that almost nobody does it (I know only Windows 7 Home Basic). **Algorithm.** How would you implement it? I know it's possible to detect country using IP. It's OK if would fail to detect in 20% cases. When country is detected, the user would get license key for free. Country detection and license key generation can be implemented in web server. EDIT: Country detection can be performed when user wants (clicks button 'Register for free'). Then program connects to my website, which detects country and generates a license key from user's hardware ID. Then the free key can be used on that PC like a purchased key, and no internet connection required. On other PC/hardware the user can simply repeat the procedure, as long as he/she is in one of these countries. EDIT: Country detection is easy and fast, i tested it with this php script+database. It worked with all IPs of my website visitors of this month. However some of them may actually live in other countries (see jwenting answer).
