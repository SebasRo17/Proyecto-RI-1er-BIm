I am working with LTSpice (Discret electrical circuit ( Spice) simulator). I would like to import LTSpice ouput data into mathematica for processing and plots. An example of a file can be found here (https://www.dropbox.com/s/ixbp11p6876pz1o/Test_SCOneDiode.raw) Any comments, suggestions and helps are welcome! Thank you in advance
