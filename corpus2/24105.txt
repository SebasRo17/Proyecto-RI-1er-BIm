Is there any way to differentiate a solution obtained by `ParametricNDSolve`? For instance, I have the position $\phi_\gamma(t)$ as a function of time, parametrized by the constant $\gamma$. Now I want to differentiate with respect to time but keep the result a `ParametricFunction`. If my solution is called `xp`, simply writing `D[xp,t]` does not work, and it does not seem possible to seek for a solution of $\frac{d}{dt} \phi_\gamma(t)$ in the command of `NDSolve` or `ParametricNDSolve`, although one can differentiate an `InterpolationFunction` obtained by `NDSolve`. So, is there a way to differentiate a `ParametricFunction` with respect to the variable (or the parameter)?
