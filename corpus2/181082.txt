I'm looking at plupload for some upload features on a website I'm developing. Now plupload is GNU GPLv2 licensed and that implies that all derivative software should also be GPL licensed (right?). Therefore I run the plupload through my minifier, the single minified js file will violate the license, and upon request, I must make _all_ the sources of my page available (right?). I'm curious about:   * can I use the plupload API without having to open source my code?   * does the license exclude minified code somehow?
