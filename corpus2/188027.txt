In every Website you read about BDD (Behaviour Driven Development) you find a very simple nice example showing you how obvious and easy is it to define your requirements. But trying to implement this process in a big product (not a calculator example) showed me that things can get (or will get) pretty complex and unreadable; especially changing requests at a later point means a lot of work to correct the Integration tests for this. So I'm wondering, is BDD really worth it? Does it solve a problem that other techniques don't!
