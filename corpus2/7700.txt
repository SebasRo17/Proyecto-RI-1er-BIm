How can I change the elements of a list, say on positions `{{1, 4}, {3, 1}, {2, 3}, {4, 4}}` in one go? Take this list for example:               In:= (m = Array[RandomInteger[9] &, {4, 4}]) // TableForm          Out= 0  6   2   8          3  8   8   0          3  7   4   1          4  8   2   4      This is how I want to the elements on the specified positions to change.               m[[1, 4]] = Style[m[[1, 4]], 14, Bold, Blue];          m // TableForm      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nuly6.png) The result is that the 8 in the last element of the first row is now blue and bold (and bigger to stand out).
