I would like to list all possible times in a 12-hour period, where the hour hand overlaps the minute hand completely. This is really a question about three distinct things - to be done in Mathematica - though only the first of the following points really interests me:   * Finding solutions to an equation with several variables, where each variable has _different_ restrictions on its domain;   * Formatting those solutions in a convenient format;   * Using those solutions to draw the actual clocks! So what we have is two different variables, $h$ and $m$. $h$ is an integer, between $0$ and $11$, and $m$ is a real number, between $0$ and $60$. We want solutions to when $$ 30h - \frac{11m}{2}=0 $$ within those domain restrictions. I have tried using both `Solve` and `Reduce`, but neither seems capable of giving me anything more than conditional expressions. So I would like to find all possible solutions, format them in a nice hour:minute format, and maybe even draw the actual clocks corresponding to these solutions. The formatting and drawing are actually not that hard (though elegant, efficient, and different solutions are certainly welcome); I am truly interested in mixing the domains for $h$ and $m$ above, and getting meaningful answers. Please feel free to tag as you feel appropriate.
