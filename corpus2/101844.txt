I invested most my time and resources in programming, and now I think it's time I should invest some time in learning about user interface design, user experience, and usability. What are some good resources about usability and designing user interfaces? I'm mainly looking for more theoretical topics, such as color theory and color physiology and how they affect users, along with information about best practices.
