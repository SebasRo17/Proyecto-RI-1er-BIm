To provide a bit of background, I have a set of wind flow data from a two- dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulation in an urban environment. The data that are returned from the simulation are two matrices, u and v, that highlight the wind flow velocity in the horizontal and vertical directions of the plane: ![A false-color image of the u matrix: the wind flow in the horizontal direction.](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Sasco.png) ![A false-color image of the v matrix: the wind flow in the vertical direction.](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TNxo7.png) To briefly go over the above images, the first is a false-color plot of the u matrix. In this case, warm colors correspond to regions of high wind flow velocities in the horizontal direction (going from right to left) while cooler colors correspond to either regions with low wind flow velocities or those velocities going in the opposite direction. The light blue polygons in the image are the buildings, which have no horizontal wind flow velocity. The second image is a false-color plot of the v matrix. In a similar fashion as before, warm colors correspond to regions of high wind flow velocities in the vertical direction (going from top to bottom) while cooler colors correspond to either regions with low wind flow velocities or those velocities going in the opposite direction. The yellow-green polygons in the image are the buildings, which have no vertical wind flow velocity. As I have done in the past for my computational fluid dynamics plots, I combined both of these matrices into a form that could be understood by Mathemtica as a ListStreamPlot. That is, for each spatial location in my u and v matrix, I pass out an array of values: `{{{x_location,y_location},{u_value,v_value}},...}`. For this particular simulation, I only considered rows of u and v that were sandwiched between the buildings; a copy of the data contained within a Mathematica notebook can be obtained from here. When I went to go and make a ListStreamPlot,               ListStreamPlot[data, AspectRatio -> 0.5, StreamPoints -> Fine, PerformanceGoal -> "Quality", StreamColorFunction -> "Rainbow"]      however, I ended up with far fewer stream lines than I have been accustomed to seeing: ![A streamline plot of the wind flow data](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fR5Iw.png) Consequently, my question is this: how can I ensure that Mathematica includes more streamlines in the plot? (It is apparent, from the above images of u and v, that there should be more streamlines that could be generated.) Moreover, I would like to ensure that the arrows on the ListStreamPlot are included in the final visualization along with the chosen color scheme; the latter of these desires seems to be ignored in my ListStreamPlot, which leads me to believe that there might need to be some post-processing done to the data. Also, as a final note, I have already looked at the discussion here and the highest rated response from Jens has not worked in the context of my data.
