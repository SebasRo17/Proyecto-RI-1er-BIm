So you've inherited a large codebase that you need to make substantial changes to and you wish to get a pretty complete understanding of the software before starting. Would you diagram it? If so, which tool do find most suited for a large codebase? Ideally I'd want expandable nodes representing major concepts in the flow that could be drilled down into for a sub-concepts, and sub-sub-concepts. Preferably UML based, but not essential. Are there decent automatic source diagramming tools, in particular, PHP->UML?
