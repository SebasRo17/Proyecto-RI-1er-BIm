Whenever a potential customer downloads a copy of my software they get the "Unknown Publisher" warning message. I understand that if I purchase a code signing certificate this message goes away and the customer does not get the scary warning. I'd like to know if anyone has information on how effective these code signing certificates are with regard to customer behavior. What difference did you see in customer behavior or acceptance after you signed your code using a certificate?
