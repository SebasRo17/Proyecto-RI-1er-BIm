According to various sources e.g. http://www.proofwiki.org/wiki/Definition:Binomial_Coefficient and Wolfram themselves http://functions.wolfram.com/GammaBetaErf/Binomial/02/ , the binomial coefficient ${n\choose k}$ is is defined as 0 whenever $k$ and $n$ are negative integers and $k\le n$. But when I type               Binomial[-1,-1]      Mathematica returns               1      I looked up the documentation for the definition of `Binomial` and it says > In general, ${n\choose m}$ is defined by > $\Gamma(n+1)/\Gamma(m+1)\Gamma(n-m+1)$ or **suitable limits** of this. Apparently, when $n=-1$ or $m=-1$ since $\Gamma(0)$ is not defined the suitable limit case is applied. So, why does Mathematica return 1 for ${-1\choose -1}$? What precisely is the "suitable limits"?
