I built a lot of websites and applications during my life, I can put them under the following categories:   * Did all the project as a freelancer -> For other companies    * Did part of the project as a freelancer -> For other companies    * Did all the project my self while was working for another company    * Did the project with team members while was working for another company    * Did all the project my self and for my self Now I am creating a company with a new brand and have my own employees, My question is: Is it ethical, and normal to put on my new company website, screenshots and info about these projects I created my self before? which to put and which not put from the previous categories?
