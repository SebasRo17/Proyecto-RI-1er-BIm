I like Haskell, plain and simple. While Haskell is used in production software, it's not especially widely deployed from what I've seen. What is the most similar and still widely used language in regards to production projects so that I might have a snowball's chance of using something similarly awesome in industry? Also is the same language from the first part available on large numbers of platforms? If not, what is the best alternative that has wide platform deployment? I'd like a single language to put on my to-do list rather than a massive swarm or family. Hard evidence would be a plus.
