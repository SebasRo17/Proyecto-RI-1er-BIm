in below picture I draw a graph base on weight of a controller system against cost function. I want to linearise and divide this curve to for example 5 five intervals. is there any function in mathematica to give me such a thing. I thinking first maybe I can get gradient of function and choose the nearest amount together. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uW5VP.jpg)
