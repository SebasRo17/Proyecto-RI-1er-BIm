I've read the available documentation but I still haven't found an `NumberForm -> Integer` function yet. No result in this site's search, either. Does it exist? I should mention: _there are no decimals in my numbers_. They are all integers, which makes me wonder why MMA bothers to fiddle with them at all. Numbers like `84039` get transformed to `84039.0`, and `8048511` to `8.048511*10^6` * * * The problem is I'm importing an XLS file that _should_ contain only strings - the fields are set to `Text` in Excel - but Mathematica has its way when using `Import` and outputs a list containing multiple different number formats. Preferably, everything imported by Mathematica would be kept as string, and not converted to `Real` or `ScientificForm`. Exporting to CSV and reopening with `ReadList` also hasn't worked well.
