So I know everyone here is all about private offices, how many developers actually have them. I am sort of half skeptical. I can believe that lead developers have them, but thats normally just one person in your average office. If it would not be to much to ask:   * Do you work in a totally awesome office or a nasty old cube? (or somewhere in between)   * What's your relative rank in the office? (junior, programmer II, senior, lead, etc.)   * are you doing internal software, or are you in a software-centric environment? (the general thought seems to be that internal developers get cubes while others live in "Joel-Spolsky-Programmer-Candyland")
