As mentioned, I wish to read the first line of a file, and if needed, overwrite it with a new string. The aim is to have a CSV with a list of possible elements. Example:               Adding the elements: 5 A, 6 B, and 7 C to a blank CSV:     A B C     5 6 7     Adding 4 A, 9 D:     A B C D     5 6 7     4 0 0 9     Adding 2 B, 7 E     A B C D E     5 6 7     4 0 0 9     0 2 0 0 7      Rewriting the file is okay for small files, but the files are expected to grow to sizes of hundreds of MB, so repeatedly overwriting the entire file is not practiceable, since the entries are preferably done quickly. How would one go about overwriting only the first line of the file? Reading the first line is possible from http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/5179/how-to-read-data-file- quickly# _=_, but what about writing?
