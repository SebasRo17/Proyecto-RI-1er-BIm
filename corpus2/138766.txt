If we have a 4 way tree such as the one shown below, and we do an in order traversal, what would the output of the in-order traversal be for an M-way tree? In which order would the nodes be visited? When would the value in the node be processed (upon first visit or upon second visit)? (As a concrete example, what would the step by step procedure for the in order traversal be for the example tree shown below?) ![screenshot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Fpyk5.jpg)
