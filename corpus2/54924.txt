I am learning how to cluster large datasets and this maybe a newbie question, but I haven’t found a suitable answer in the Documentation or on this board. My question is best illustrated by an example. Let’s import some data:               irisData = Import["http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/data/iris.csv", "CSV”];     (*Column labels *)     pLabels = {"Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width", "Petal.Length", "Petal.Width", "Type”};      How do I construct clusters based on only two columns say “Sepal.Length” and “Sepal.Width” and still retain the rest of the data… as part of the clusters Ideally I would like a function:                 findClusters[data,n,columnlist]       that would cluster the _data_ into _n_ clusters using the data in the _columnlist_ such that output data format of the clusters is the same as the input data. I can find the clusters and plot them as:               clusters = {cluster1, cluster2, cluster3} = FindClusters[irisData[[All, 1 ;; 2]], 3];     ListPlot[{{#1, #2} & @@@ cluster1, {#1, #2} & @@@ cluster2, {#1, #2} & @@@ cluster3}, AspectRatio -> 1, ImageSize -> 200, FrameLabel -> pLabels[[1 ;; 2]]]      But I’d like to use the clusters that I found using FindClusters above to explore say “Sepal.Length” vs “Petal.Width” or some other data analysis.
