I have a set of coordinates on the sphere in terms of cartesian coordinates. I would like to convert them to spherical data points. However, when I try to convert the point {0, 0, 1} it tells me that the solution is indeterminate. Why is this?               CoordinateTransform[ "Cartesian" -> "Spherical", {0, 0, 1}]      > ArcTan::indet: Indeterminate expression ArcTan[0,0] encountered. >> Best, Andy
