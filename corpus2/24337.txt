Let $A_1$ and $A_2$ be two $3\times 3$ hermitian matrices. Then their numerical range is defined as two-dimensional set \begin{align} \mathbb{S}=\\{\left[u^HA_1u,u^HA_2u\right]\in \mathbb{R}^2,u^Hu=1\\} \end{align} where $u$ is a unit-norm vector. Each of the $u^HA_iu,~i=1,2$ is a real number. Thus for a given $u$, I calculate the first co-ordinate as $u^HA_1u$ and second co-ordinate as $u^HA_2u$, then I have to vary $u$ through all possible unit-norm vectors. Thus $\mathbb{S}$ becomes a 2-D set. **EDIT** If it is possible to find a solution for the real case, that is fine. But then the matrices $A_1$ and $A_2$ will be of size $6 \times 6$. The reason is you can convert the above set of equations in terms of real variables and real matrices in higher dimensions (twice the dimension to be exact).
