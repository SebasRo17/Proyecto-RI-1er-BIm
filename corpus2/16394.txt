I would like to ask for help in how to use the new _Mathematica_ 9 time series functions to make some sales forecast. For example, for one of our stores, I have this data set with 35 points, from January 2010 to November 2012 with sales in               salesData = {5.14, 5.32, 6.04, 5.84, 6.09, 6.03, 5.79, 6.26, 5.91, 6.44, 6.54, 7.76, 6.24, 6.19, 6.37, 6.72, 6.72, 6.52, 6.64, 6.96, 6.51, 7.03, 6.79, 8.11, 6.82, 6.96, 7.85, 7.68, 7.80, 7.80, 7.80, 8.22, 8.19, 8.67, 8.29}      If I plot it with DateListPlot as below:               DateListPlot[salesData                 ,{2010,1}                 ,Joined-> True                 ,AspectRatio->0.2                 ,DateTicksFormat->{"MonthShort","/","YearShort"}                 ,PlotLabel->Style["Sales Chart",18,Bold,Blue]                 ,ImageSize->800     ]      I get: ![Sales Graphic](http://i.stack.imgur.com/EunTo.png) My question is: How do I use `SARIMAProcess`, `TemporalData` and `TimeSeriesForecast` to get the forecast and the prediction band with some confidence interval as in this picture? ![Sales Forecast](http://i.stack.imgur.com/VaEW0.png) In this case, the series shows seasonality by year and this is the reason I know that the S in (S)ARIMA is necessary. I'm new to time series, so if possible, I would like to have didactical answer. I am vague on the meaning of the SARIMA coefficients and how to determine them.
