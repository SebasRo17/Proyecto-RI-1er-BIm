In Ruby, I'm creating a small game development framework. Just some personal project - a very small group of friends helping. Now I am in need of handling geometric concepts. Rectangles, Circles, Polygons, Vectors, Lines, etc. So I made a class for each of these. I'm stuck deciding whether I should package such classes in a module, such as `Geometry`. So I'd access them like `Geometry::Rectangle`, or just `Rectangle` if I `include` the module. Now then, my question isn't about this specific scenario. I'd like to know, **when is it suitable to package similar classes into one module in Ruby?** What factors should I consider? Amount of classes? Usage frequency? Complexity?
