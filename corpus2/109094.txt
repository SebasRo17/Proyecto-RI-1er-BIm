Google created Google Web Toolkit (GWT) and doesn't use it when building their own web applications. Does this mean GWT is not suitable for building dynamic applications? Or have caching problems? Or have RPC problems? Or are there other concerns that prevent Google from using this technology? `EDIT`: I don't say here that Google don't ever used GWT in any app, but What I am want to say, why they are not using it in a wide range?
