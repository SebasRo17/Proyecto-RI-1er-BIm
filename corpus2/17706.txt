I want to put my Plot output into an MS Word document without having to edit it in Corel first, so I want to export it ready for Word in vector format complete with legends, expressions, axes, and frames. Is it possible to do that in _Mathematica_ 9? After getting `Plot` output, what procedure should I follow to put it into Word? I want the best quality figures in my Word document with thin colored lines. Here is example of what I to do when I have many curves on one plot, using dashed and dotdashed combination.                 Plot[{Sin[x], Sin[2 x], Sin[3 x], Sin[4 x], 1/x}, {x, 0, 2 Pi},          PlotLegends -> "Expressions"]      I look forward to seeing your examples of multi-curve plots that are Word export-ready.
