I am working on an Asp.NET MVC web application. I have the following (simplified) entities:               public class Course     {         public int Id { get; set; }         public string Name { get; set; }         public string Description { get; set; }         public User CreatedBy { get; set; }         public EventArea EventArea { get; set; }     }          public class EventArea     {         public int Id { get; set; }         public string Name { get; set; }         public string Description { get; set; }         public User CreatedBy { get; set; }         public CoOrdinate CoOrdinate { get; set; }     }          public class CoOrdinate     {         public int Id { get; set; }         public int Latitude { get; set; }         public int Longitude { get; set; }     }      Users can register and create their own Course entities. Each Course has a geographical location, represented by an EventArea which can also be created by a user. As an EventArea represents a geographical location it should be available for use by other users who want to create a course in the same location. However making EventArea entities available to users other than the creator raises the following questions:   1. What happens if the EventArea is modified or deleted by the creating user?   2. Who should be able to view/edit/modify an EventArea entity? Any alternative suggestions for how to approach a scenario where an entity created by one user can be referenced by a different user?
