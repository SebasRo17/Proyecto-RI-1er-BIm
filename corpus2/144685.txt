In this Stackoverflow anwer I dimly recall being taught that it's better to use as "wide" a condition as possible to terminate a loop, rather than testing for an exact termination condition. i.e. use:               while (x < 10)       rather than               while (x != 10)      however I cannot recall (or find) any formal basis or rationale for this. Is this actually written down anywhere as best current practise?
