Is there a way to detect double click events? I did not find anything on the doc page of `EventHandler`. Use case: I want to re-implement the `Crop Image...` functionality available form the context menu when clicking images. The cropping GUI appears much too slowly with even moderately large images, such as screenshots of the full screen. Although I could use a button to crop, I'd prefer using double click, just like in the original implementation.
