I am a Biology student, who has changed my career to IT and have been working in the software field for the past 4 fours under the **QA (auditing processes for ISO9001 purposes)**. Now I'm a Software QA Execute and have decided to increase my knowledge on QA. What are the next steps I can look for? Are there any **certifications** that I can do under QA, which will be very useful? (I have already done certification on IQA). I have heard about **CSQA** certifications for QA, are there any other certifications apart from these? Or as always, are there any books for upgrading my knowledge on QA?
