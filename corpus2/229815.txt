Just finished Stanford lecture on `SQL` (by Prof. Jennifer Widom). However I have developed a confusion regarding the use of `EXISTS` clause. I thought it is just like a condition and an expression so that if it's true, the above query proceeds (much like the Boolean `AND`). So having a slight doubt regarding this question: > Passenger = {pid, pname, Age}   >  Reservation = {pid, class, tid} and tables are populated with some data and following query is executed:               SELECT pid      FROM Reservation      WHERE class = 'AC' AND EXISTS          (SELECT * FROM Passenger WHERE age > 65 AND Passenger.pid = Reservation.pid)      Now the thing that is getting me troubled is that I thought that the use of `EXISTS` is simply that the above main query proceeds if the subquery returns something. So as the subquery was returning something, I expected the query to return all PID's where `class = 'AC'`. I didn't think that it was executed tuple by tuple. So how to remove this confusion?
