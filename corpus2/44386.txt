I am trying to make an InputField for numeric input, but               InputField[Dynamic[num],Number]      Does not allow the user to type `1.3*^-13` or `1.3*10^-13`, for example. The characters are simply disallowed in the field. I tried               InputField[Dynamic[num],Expression]      which allows `1.3*10^-13` but does not allow the `1.3*^-13` shorthand. The `*^` simply disappears when I type the `-`. Further exploration shows that it the shorthand entry does work with positive exponents like `1.3*^6`. So, my workaround is to use `Expression` and to remember to use explicit scientific notation whenever I have a negative exponent, but allowing an `Expression` in an `InputField` is always a dangerous proposition. Is there any way to get this to work with `Number`?
