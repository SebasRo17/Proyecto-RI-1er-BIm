I had a small project that I was doing on the side. It was basically a couple of forms linked to a DB. Access was out, because it was a specifically meant to be a web application. Being a small project I used ASP.NET Dynamic Data, but, for various reasons, the project ended before deployment. I met the client recently, and he said there was a need for it still. I'm considering restarting the project with Dynamic Data, but I've seen some Lightswitch demos, and was suitably impressed with the BETA. I will wait for RTM if I use it, but is it a good idea to use Lightswitch to replace the Dynamic Data? The amount of work I put into the Dynamic Data site isn't really an issue. Additional information: It's a system that tracks production in a small factory, broken down by line, machine, section and will generate reports. I would guess that the data structure will remain fairly constant over time, but that the reporting requirements will grow. The other thing is that the factory is part of a larger group, and I'm hopeful that, if this system succeeds, similar work with be forthcoming for other factories.
