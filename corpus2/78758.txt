I want to make a networked building game with limited physics(just for the characters) and I wanted to know what the best route would be. I was looking at a browser based Java game or a downloadable C++ game or maybe even a downloadable Java game. Anyways, would a browser based game be too slow for something like this(thousands of blocks with multiple players)? What are your thoughts/suggestions?
