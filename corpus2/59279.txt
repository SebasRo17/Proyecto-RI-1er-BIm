Suppose I have a torus and a closed path on said torus:               r = 1;     R = 2.5*r;     a = .8;     b = .4;      path = ParametricPlot3D[{{(R + r Cos[a Sin@w]) Cos[b Cos@w], (R + r Cos[a Sin@w]) Sin[b Cos@w], r Sin[a Sin@w]}}, {w, 0, 2 π},  PlotStyle -> {Black, Thickness[0.008]}];     patch = ParametricPlot3D[{{(R + r Cos@v) Cos@u, (R + r Cos@v) Sin@u, r Sin@v}}, {u, 0, 2 π}, {v, 0, 2 π}, Mesh -> False, PlotStyle -> Opacity[0.75]];     Show[patch, path, Boxed -> False, BoxRatios -> Automatic]      ![torus with path](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xOgU9.gif) What I want to know is: Is there some way of plotting my torus without the part that is cut out by the path? I'm sure there is an easy way to do this with something like "Eliminate" but it seems just outside of my skill.
