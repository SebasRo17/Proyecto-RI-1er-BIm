I am signing a contract with someone remote in another country in regards with creating a new style sheet for their website. In our agreement the client pays 1/3 of the money first as deposit and the rest will be paid when I show the completed project online to him. Now my question is, since I know CSS is viewable online and there is no way to encode it, apart from the fact that I need to trust him, is there any way that I can protect my work from being stolen before the final payment? How do theme developers usually work remotely? I would appreciate if you please share your experiences with me
