I have a Physics problem which huge and tiny numbers and Mathematica just gives me a speed of my particles which is the speed of light. Then $1/\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$ becomes singular. If I use smaller values for my radius `r`, it works, but with the radius of 300 light years, I just get error messages. Is there some way to increase the precision or something like that? ![](http://wstaw.org/m/2012/06/16/Bildschirmfoto4.png)
