Working on an E commerce application where we need to send so many email to customer like   * Registration email   * Forget Password   * Order placed There are many other emails that can be sent, I already have `emailService` in place which is responsible for sending email and It needs an Email object, Everything is working find, but I am struck at one point and not sure how best this can be done. We need to create content so as it can be passed to `emailService` and not sure how to design this. For example, in Customer registration, I have a `customerFacade` which is working between `Controller` and `ServiceLayer`, I just want to delegate this Email Content creation work away from Facade layer and to make it more flexible. Currently I am creating Registration email content inside `customerFacade` and some how I am not liking this way, since that means for each email, I need to create content in respective Facade. What is best way to go or current approach is fine enough?
