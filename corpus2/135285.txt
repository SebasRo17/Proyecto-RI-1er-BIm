My company is looking to add Bluetooth functionality to our hardware, so that we can integrate connectivity to our products with various tablet devices. To do this, we are looking to purchase an all-in-one chip that we can integrate into our boards. Everyone within the development team is new to Bluetooth integration and as I am doing my research, I am finding a lot of references and material that points me back to Bluetooth.org and mention becoming a Special Interest Group (SIG) member. This has raised various questions regarding the necessity for us as a company to join the SIG. We would rather not have to go through that process because that would involve paying various fees and dragging corporate lawyers into the process. We've already had to jump through a few legal hoops ( _ahem_ , MFi anyone?) and would prefer not to have to go through any of that again for the sake of development time. If we want to integrate simple Bluetooth connectivity into our devices, do we have to go through the process of joining the Bluetooth SIG or are we covered and allowed to promote our devices as Bluetooth enabled since the all-in-one chips we will be integrating will becoming from a major manufacturer who has already become a SIG member and has had there chipset certified by the SIG?
