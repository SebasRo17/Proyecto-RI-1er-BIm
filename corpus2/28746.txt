Specifically, I would like the components to have a side length of $l$ pixels, and where each point in the morphological component is at most a fixed Manhattan distance $d_{max}$ away from its centerpoint. How might I do this, perhaps using Dilate? And is it possible to have overlapping morphological components? Update : Answer to the last point on whether components can overlap: No (see comment by belisarius below). Update 2 : The command:               Dilation[Components, r]      Will take a single pixel, and blow it up it up into a square block with $r$ pixels on either side of the centerpoint. If there were some manner of generating a single-pixel component at each of my POI positions, I believe that would solve my problem. Is there an easy manner of doing this?
