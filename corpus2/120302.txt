I understand that in normal php if we're including a file we're merging the source of it in the script and it would take longer for that page to be parsed/processed but if we're using HipHop shouldn't it be ok to just create one single php file and include every file in it (that contains some class) and every page which needs those classes (in separate file each) can just include one single php file? Would this be ok in presence of HipHop?
