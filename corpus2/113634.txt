I have a website that is about electronics. I want to make some functional calculators such as calculation for analog filters which will have to show lots of plots and stuff like that. This is a sample of what I am looking for and obviously it is only PHP and its graphic functions. I want to have similar thing but much more interactive with realtime sliders and stuff like that. What should I go for? Java Applets? or stick to JavaScript/PHP? I am asking this because I can do it with Java much faster (know it better than JavaScript and PHP). But I am afraid of browser incompatibility, security options for Applets and similar things. What is your suggestion?
