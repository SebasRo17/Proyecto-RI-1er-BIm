I don't know what best to give as title to this so pardon me if it sounds weird. I saw this question asked on IT Security and another site asking people to disable Java from their system or browser because it's vulnerable. As a lover of Java, though currently doing C#, I would love to still do more Java in future, but this news is giving a bad name to the good old Java. Wouldn't this drive developers like me away from Java? Wouldn't it spell a bad name for Java among developers and prospective clients?
