I've adopted a tagging system of x.x.x.x, and this works fine. However, you also need to leave a comment with your git tag. I've been using descriptions such as "fixes bug Y" or "feature X", but is this the best sort of comment to be leaving? Particularly, what if a tag encompasses several fixes, it seems not to make sense to have a very long tag comment. Does this mean that I should be creating a tag for every bug fix or feature, or should the tag comments be reflective of something else? I have a few ideas that may be good, but I'd love some advice from seasoned git tagging veterans :) For those who prefer specific examples:               1.0.0.0 - initial release     1.0.0.1 - bug fix for issue X     1.0.0.2 - (what if this is a bug fix for multiple issues, the comment would be too long, no?)      Another example, in this example, the comments are more or less the same as the tags, it seems redundant. Is there something else we could be describing? https://github.com/osCommerce/oscommerce2/tags
