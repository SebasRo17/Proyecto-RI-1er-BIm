When writing a callback, when is best to have the callback return a value, and when is it best to have the callback modify a parameter? Is there a difference? For example, if we wanted to grab a list of dependencies, when would you do this:               function GetDependencies(){         return [{"Dep1" : 1.1},                  {"Dept2": 1.2},                  {"Dep3" : 1.3}];     }      And when would you do this?               function RegisterDependencies(register){         register.add("Dep1", 1.1);         register.add("Dep2", 1.2);         register.add("Dep3", 1.3);     }
