The Mathematica manual states > `TimeConstrained` takes account only of CPU time spent inside the main > Mathematica kernel process; it does not include additional threads or > processes. However, my computation involves a parallel computation. As an example, consider the code               count = 0;     SetSharedVariable[count];     ProgressIndicator[Dynamic[count], {0, 500}]          f = Total[ParallelTable[count++; i^2, {i, 1, 500}]];          TimeConstrained[f, .1, "fail"]          (* 41791750 *)      How can I achieve that "fail" is returned. I can imagine that it could be complicated to compute the total CPU time of all sub-processes, but for my application it would be sufficient to consider the absolute amount of real- time that has passed as `AbsoluteTiming[]` does. Any suggestions?
