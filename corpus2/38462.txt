Consider the following integrals that I asked _Mathematica_ to do,               Assuming[m >= 1 && q >= 1 && k >= 1 && m ∈ Integers && k ∈ Integers,        Integrate[Exp[-2 π[m q Sqrt[λ + 1/4] + k Sqrt[λ]]], {λ, 0, ∞}]]          Integrate[Tanh[π Sqrt[λ]] Log[1 - Exp[-2 π q Sqrt[λ + 1/4]]], {λ, 0, ∞}]         for various different positive values of $m,k,q$ or in general In each of these cases, _Mathematica_ just rewrote back the integral doing nothing. Does this mean that the integral converges, but _Mathematica_ doesn't know how to do it? * * * It would be an added bonus if someone can point out if and how these integrals can be done!
