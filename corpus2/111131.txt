My current employer pays for certification fees and college classes (provided that you earn an 'A'), but I'm looking for other things to suggest to them. Very few of us have time to take advantage of the college classes, and the material covered in certification exams isn't always the most practical information. (Code Access Security, anyone?) Maybe a book allowance? Some incentive to work on an open source project? In what kinds of creative ways does your employer provide for your continuing developer education? ### See Also > How to Keep Your Developer Team Educated
