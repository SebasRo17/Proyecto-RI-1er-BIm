My company is starting a major greenfield development project using DevExpress WPF controls. I just read this critical review of their WPF controls. Do you agree that DevExpress does not understand the WPF paradigm and will cause our developers grief during development and maintenance? Can you suggest an alternate vendor of WPF controls? I'm looking for a vendor with WPF controls that will enhance our application while fitting well with the WPF API, binding and MVVM. You can read a quote from the blog post here.
