I have quite a bit of experience with using Django for websites and so when I started a new project I naturally chose to use Django for it. Everything went well for a time but now the application is really starting to rub up against what Django can comfortably cope with and I fighting all the time to ensure that things work as intended. I've been considering moving the site over to Java EE 7 now that it has been released. It certainly seems to provide the features I require as well as also being less forceful in the way that a project is laid out and maintained. I guess now that I have a good idea of how the application should be structured, development should be much faster. Have you felt the need to change the web framework you are using simply because it doesn't lend itself well to the type of project you are trying to produce?
