The Time Series package for Mathematica comes with a function called `LogLikelihood`. It is discussed and used extensively in the documentation (pdf). So does Mathematica 8. First I though my inability to use `LogLikelihood` was that it was being shadowed by the `LogLikelihood` function in Mathematica itself, but apparently not. Loading the package with               Needs["TimeSeries`TimeSeries`"]      works for every other function, but the only `LogLikelihood`function I have access to is Mathematica's built in one. Trying to refere to it with the full context, like so               TimeSeries`TimeSeries`LogLikelihood      doesn't work either. It is as if this one function simply isn't there. I've also tried re-downloading the package and reinstalling in case I got a corrupt version the first time around, but this hasn't helped. **EDIT:** The way I am calling the function should be correct:               data = TimeSeries[ARModel[{0.5, -0.2}, 1], 20]     (*{0.775171, -0.0377616, -0.568652, 1.56771, 1.32269, -1.60302, \     -1.53275, 0.127154, 1.37393, 0.138493, -0.0484376, -0.506817, \     0.731963, 2.28373, 0.374458, 0.468365, 2.48781, 1.24375, 1.0746, \     -0.401619}*)          LogLikelihood[data, ARModel[{0.5}, 1]]     (*LogLikelihood[{0.775171, -0.0377616, -0.568652, 1.56771,        1.32269, -1.60302, -1.53275, 0.127154, 1.37393,        0.138493, -0.0484376, -0.506817, 0.731963, 2.28373, 0.374458,        0.468365, 2.48781, 1.24375, 1.0746, -0.401619}, ARModel[{0.5}, 1]]*)      **EDIT2:** Using full context in calling the function has the same result:               TimeSeries`TimeSeries`LogLikelihood[data, ARModel[{0.5}, 1]]     (*LogLikelihood[{0.775171, -0.0377616, -0.568652, 1.56771,        1.32269, -1.60302, -1.53275, 0.127154, 1.37393,        0.138493, -0.0484376, -0.506817, 0.731963, 2.28373, 0.374458,        0.468365, 2.48781, 1.24375, 1.0746, -0.401619}, ARModel[{0.5}, 1]]*)      **EDIT3:** This is the context path:               $ContextPath     (*{"TimeSeries`TimeSeries`", "PacletManager`", "WebServices`", \     "System`", "Global`"}*)
