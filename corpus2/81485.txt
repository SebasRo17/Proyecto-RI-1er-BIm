I know a bit of both C and C++. I am assuming that many people who know C++ also know C. I am wondering what language I should pick to code in during an interview. C, because it's faster to make a working program in C, because you don't have to worry about thinking what objects your system should have, etc, as in C++ (though many experienced C++ programmers can code their solution in C++ in just the same amount of time)? Or C++, because then you don't worry much about passing parameter by parameter and you can just pass around the object etc and you can leverage on existing string library, etc.?
