A friend of mine told me that at a **very** big company, the programmers were told they are expected to actually work about 60% of the time **Added:** She meant 60% of the time they were at work, they are supposed to work, the rest if spent on surfing the web playing pool or ping pong or whatever, chatting, etc. I think I'm at about 70% How much do you?
