Let's say we have a class called 'Automobile' and we have an instance of that class called 'myCar'. I would like to ask why do we need to put the values that our methods return in a variable? Why don't we just call the method? For example, why should one write:               string message = myCar.SpeedMessage();     Console.WriteLine(message);      instead of:               Console.WriteLine(myCar.SpeedMessage());
