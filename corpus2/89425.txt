Normally when creating new global variables I do not define its access modifier. So as per java it will adopt property default access modifier. When I'm need to access that variable in out of default scope I change its access modifier else leave it as it is. So my question is " _Am I doing it right way? Is it normal to have default access variables? or should I use private/public for them? Is it good coding practice to not to use access modifiers?_ "
