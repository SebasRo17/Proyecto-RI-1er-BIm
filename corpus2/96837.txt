I asked in another question about where a good place to start learning programming was and I came to the conclusion with the many helpful answers, that I would like to go with Python. So now, would there be a benefit to using a .NET implementation like IronPython or should I just do Python? My understanding is I would get a better grasp of fundamentals _without_ relying on .NET, is that accurate?
