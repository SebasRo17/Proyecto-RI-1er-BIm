Our application is having 2 parts a web app running ROR and a web service running Sinatra. The application communicates with the mobile device for which we use different constants depending on the message we need to the send to the device. We are currently using integer constants saved up in a module. Eg:               SEND_HI="122"      As the application has grown and we have around 50+ constants we are realizing that this is a bad way to handle constants as different developer seems to give different constants and clashes occur. Also there is a mismatch between the constant values in ROR and sinatra (due to developers mistake obviously). What is a pain free way to handle constants or message identifiers.
