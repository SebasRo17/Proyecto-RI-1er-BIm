When one sets up an equation to solve one often needs to specify conditions on the variables such as               { x>0 && y>0 && z>0 }      This is not a problem if only a few variables are involved. However, it is another matter when say, 50 are required. Is there a compact form one can use? Using               (...) && Table[x[[i]], {i,50}] > 0      within `Reduce[]` or `Solve[]` will not work.
