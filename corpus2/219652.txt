I am working on a CMS, in which we have multiple clients that use it, so the code is stored on their servers. Each client has the default code (user manager, pages manager etc), but every client also has it's own set of code (themes, scripts, custom modules). I am trying to figure out a way to maintain an up-to-date code base for all the clients without having to make every single change to the core to every single client. We are using GitHub for version control, so I was think of having all the clients as different branches, but how can I keep the core up to date with the master? Am I think about this all wrong? What are my options?
