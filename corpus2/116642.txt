Not sure if this is a "subjective" question or not. I'm thinking about hiring a mid level java programmer and came to the realisation that all the competent programmers that I've worked with had a very strong knowledge of their chosen editor. My chosen editor is vim (sometimes I use it as a plugin in IntelliJ IDEA). So in the case that someone puts that they use vim to program with I was considering giving them a couple of quick tasks to see how they go about it. Something that you could do in varying different ways. For example today I had a xml file with placeholder strings of the form               <?xml version="1.0"?>     <root-element>        ....xml....        ${placeholder.here} some text ${placeholder.there}         and some more text ${placeholder.everywhere}        ....xml....     </root-element>      and wanted to convert it into a string that I could then paste as a java string array literal, sorted alphabetically. e.g.               ["placeholder.everywhere", "placeholder.here", "placeholder.there"]      Has anyone used this kind or metric in their interview process and if so what were the results? If you did use editor ability as a metric, what editing tasks did you set? Any problems with using this as a indicator (obviously amongst other criteria) of ability?
