I'm trying to add a color bar legend to a ListLinePlot with multiple lists. With 20+ lists a normal Legend gets long and bulky. Basically, each list line is associated with a different value. I've created a color gradient for the lines using the Hue function but cannot figure out how to get BarLegend to work with ListLinePlot. I've included a sample of the plot I have so far. It would be a much cleaner presentation with a colorbar for the legend. How do I do this, in an elegant way? I'd even settle for a non-elegant method right now. ![example of what I have](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5Nooe.jpg)
