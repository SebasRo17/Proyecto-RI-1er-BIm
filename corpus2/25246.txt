When I run this CDF document http://x6174x.blogspot.pt/2013/04/bankroll- growth-simulator.html on my desktop, each time I press "Run again" the Task Manager shows that the MathKernel.exe process associated with the CDF player uses increasingly more RAM. However if I try it on a laptop with the same OS (Win 7 Ultimate) the memory usage remains more or less constant. What could be wrong with the first CDF Player? I tried to reinstall it but the problem persists. I should add that the first computer has Mathematica 9 installed but the laptop has only the CDF Player. Could this be some interaction between the CDF player and Mathematica? Even if I have Mathematica closed when I run the CDF document it will show a Mathematica.exe process running. Thanks.
