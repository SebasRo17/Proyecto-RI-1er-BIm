I have heard of security firms who consult on the security of a clients systems. All of the people I know in this field are network engineers, but I know programmers get involved in security as well. What do security programmers who perform audits/consulting actually do? Do they literally go through the codebase looking for every vulnerability in people’s legacy systems? I have always assumed that is what they did, but it seems like this would be highly unreliable and not do much more than providing a false sense of security. Note: I’m not talking about programmers who write encryption algorithms or anything like that, only those concerned with software security audits/consulting.
