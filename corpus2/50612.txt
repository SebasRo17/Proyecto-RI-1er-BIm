Two questions, but I am not sure whether they are already answered or not.   * How can I create `PlotMarkers` (in `ListLinePlot`) with less points (less markers)? Or markers with some intervals. I have tried the Mesh option, but it does not work; it messes up all the plots.    * Is it possible to create `PlotMarkers` for normal `Plot`, not `ListPlot`? One way is to export the data to the list, but I would like to do it directly. More information: Suppose `ListLinePlot` of a number of data lists with legends. based on the suggestions, I have changed my plots into this, but honestly I cannot understand how it works!               style = Sequence @@ {Frame -> {{True, False}, {True, False}},         FrameTicks -> {{0, 1, 2, 3}, {0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.5}, None, None},         FrameStyle -> Directive[Black, 16, FontSlant -> Plain],         LabelStyle -> Directive[FontSlant -> Plain],         AxesStyle -> Lighter@Gray, TicksStyle -> Black,         LabelStyle -> {GrayLevel[0], 14, FontSlant -> Plain,           FontFamily -> "Helvetica"}, ImageSize -> 300,         AspectRatio -> 1/GoldenRatio}            ListLinePlot[{c1, c2, c3, c4}, PlotRange -> Full,        Evaluate@style,        PlotLegends -> Placed[{Long, S_Short, Short, Flexible}, Below],        PlotStyle -> (Directive[            AbsoluteThickness[2], #] & /@ (ColorData[81] /@ Range[6])),        MeshFunctions -> {Abs[#1] &, Abs[#1] &, Abs[#1] &, Abs[#1] &},        Mesh -> 6, PlotMarkers -> {Automatic, 20},        MeshStyle -> {ColorData[81] /@ Range[6], ColorData[81] /@ Range[7],          ColorData[81] /@ Range[8], ColorData[81] /@ Range[9]}]      The output is something like this, where as you can see each Markers has all the colours together. How can I solve this problem and improve it? Another problem is the distribution of the Markers which is not good. ![the output!](http://i.stack.imgur.com/y53h9.jpg)
