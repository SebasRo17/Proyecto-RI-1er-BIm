I'm too lazy to look at a pdf/table when the next tram is, so I did a windows widget that always tells me when the next one is. You can add, edit and delete trams to be watched. I don't work for this company, but I have tried to make it as professional as possible and I even threw the company logo into the widget. I believe other people could also use this and I would like to send this to the company. What's the best way to send it? Should I send photos, a video explaining the widget, the widget itself? I don't think they would pay me for this, nor do I expect this, but I'd love to make an internship there, if the spot is available. I could see myself developing an iPhone/Android app for the company, seeing that the only thing their app does is sell tickets and I'm sure other people would love to be able to see on their phone when the next train is. Even if they don't have an internship available, I'd still find it pretty cool if they made it available at their website and I somehow got credits for it. I think it's a pretty nice thing to have in the CV. But I wouldn't be interested if they are just going to publish it without any credits. What do you guys think? By the way, only a couple of trains and stations are available, as I don't have their database and right now what I have to do is manually insert the schedule. But this is very easy to add/change once they provide it. PS: Seeing this is career advice, to make it general, I guess the question is, how do I send software that was not requested, but could be useful, to a company? PS2: I'm sorry that I couldn't think up of a short concise title!
