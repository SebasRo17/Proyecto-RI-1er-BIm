My customer, a translations business owner, just told me that he has been reading about Ruby on Rails and told me that " _there are more PHP guys around there_ " and " _it seems the community prefers it_ ". What would you, as software engineer and freelancer, say to the customer to achieve these goals:   * Sell    * Make him see that the technology is my expert decision and Rails is as good or better than PHP (+ whatever framework) for this particular project. UPDATE: Thank you all for the suggestions! Tomorrow I've got another meeting with him, let's see how it goes, I will update again :) UPDATE 2: Finally I told him to read this thread and the result has been fantastic: He gave me the project and we are going to start right now. Thank you all for the help, you have free beer in my charge if we see someday :) BTW: I learned the lesson: be as transparent as possible, because if you believe in yourself and your work, there is no question compromising enough to beat you. regards
