I am currently trying to improve my use of exceptions, and found the important distinction between exceptions that signify programming errors (e.g. someone passed null as argument, or called a method on an object after it was disposed) and those that signify a failure in the operation that is not the caller's fault (e.g. an I/O exception). How should these two kinds of exceptions be treated differently? Do you think that error exceptions need to be explicitly documented, or is it enough to document the relevant preconditions? And can you leave out the documentation of a precondition or error exception if it should be obvious (for example, `ObjectDisposedException` when calling a method on a disposed object)
