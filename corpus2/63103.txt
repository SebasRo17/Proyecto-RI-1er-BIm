I'm wondering if someone has any experience with programming on an HDTV. I'm trying to decide between dual pc monitor vs one big HDTV, like 32" (or maybe even dual hdtv). The nice thing about hdtv is that they cost alot less than an equivalent sized pc monitor. I will specifically be using this for programming and graphics (photoshop, etc). I'm just wondering if HDTV is bad if I use it as a workstation b/c maybe it's worse for the eyes or not really good for programming (b/c maybe the fonts won't be crisp enough), etc. Any thoughts? Thanks
