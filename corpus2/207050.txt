Is there a way to prevent the editing of HTML and CSS contents in a page using Firebug-like tools? I found that some users are editing some values in hidden fields and some contents which written between a div or span tag for gaining some profits. They are doing mostly by editing with help of tools like firebug. Is there any way to identify such modifications? The problem here is that the values they are editing is generated when the page is compiled. The page is developed in PHP. The editing is done mostly in between the tags.
