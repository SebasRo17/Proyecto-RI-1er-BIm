We use WPF and Expression Blend 4. I'm trying to improve our workflow by tutoring one of our designers to use it for styling and animation. Slowly but surely I get the impression Blend in itself is to technical for the designer in question. I myself use it only occasionally (it's great for Visual States for instance) because a lot of things are easier done in code or not possible at all in Blend alone. It seems a developer with design experience is a lot more productive with it than a sole designer. Are there any good resources or advice as to how I can improve this workflow?
