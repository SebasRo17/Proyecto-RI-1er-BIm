Please Consider :               list={{5,2,6},{2,8,3}}      I need to get the product of all the element within list : As of now I do this :               (#[[1]]*#[[2]]*#[[3]]) & /@ list      Which means I have to manually specify the number of elements within each least and the sublists length has to b equal. How could do this automatically to automatically deal with the following case ?               listA={{5,2,6,3},{2,8,3,4}}     listB={{5,2,6},{2,4}}
