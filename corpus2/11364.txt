Sometimes, one needs to find all the solutions of three simultaneous nonlinear equations in three unknowns $$\begin{align*}f(x,y,z)&=0\\g(x,y,z)&=0\\h(x,y,z)&=0\end{align*}$$ within a given cuboidal domain; that is, all triples $(x,y,z)$ satisfying the three equations given above, and within the region defined by $x_{\min}\leq x\leq x_{\max}$, $y_{\min}\leq y\leq y_{\max}$, $z_{\min}\leq z\leq z_{\max}$. (I restrict the discussion here to _transcendental_ equations; algebraic equations are not too problematic for _Mathematica_ (`Solve[]`/`NSolve[]`, `Resultant[]`, `GroebnerBasis[]`...)) **How can I use _Mathematica_ to find these solutions?** `FindRoot[]` can only find one solution, and you still need an approximate location as a starting point for `FindRoot[]`. `NSolve[]` works (sometimes), but it takes long.
