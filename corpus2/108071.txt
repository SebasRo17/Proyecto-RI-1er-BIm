Obviously i'll have to make some sort of choice at what DB i choose to go with (MS-SQL/MYSQL/etc) but this question isn't about that. The question mainly is what other languages/tools would be helpful for someone wanting to get into Database Programming/Administration. I assume PHP would be helpful with MySQL along with XML Probably (or not?) however Im not sure of what else. Im pretty fluent in C/C++ but if I wanted to get more in depth with the NoSQL databases out there I probably need to brush up on my Java skills. Also Side question.....is 25 too young to be getting into this stuff? I took a few Database classes in College (Which I just recently graduated from), but I don't want it to be too late to learn something new.
