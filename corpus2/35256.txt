Let's say I use `SelectComponents` to select morphological components in an image according to some criterion, like "Elongation". Then let's say, I pull out a different set of morphological components using another criterion like "Area".               m1 = SelectComponents[testImage, "Elongation", # == 1 &];     m2 = SelectComponents[testImage, "Area", # > 42 &];      How can I properly merge `m1` and `m2` into a single set of non-intersecting morphological components?
