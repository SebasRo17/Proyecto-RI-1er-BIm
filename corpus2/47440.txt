I am trying to write a function which will perform the equation in the attached image. So far, I have:               x[n_] :=      x[n] =       2^(1 - n) Sum[Binomial[n, k] T[n - 2 k], {k, 0, n/2}]          x[6]      which outputs: $ \frac{1}{32} (20 T(0)+15 T(2)+6 T(4)+T(6)) $ How can I write an `If[]` (or similar) statement to half the `kth` term when `n` is even and `k=n/2`? Thanks in advance! ![Equation 2.14](http://i.stack.imgur.com/NKC7G.png)
