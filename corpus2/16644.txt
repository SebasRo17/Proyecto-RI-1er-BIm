I'm new to mathematica and am interested in solving the following BVP: $\epsilon \,y'' + 2 y' + y^3 = 0$, for $0 < x < 1$ and $y(0) = 0, y(1) = 1/2$. I have no experience with coding, so although I have read through the _Mathematica_ documentation, I'm still a bit confused as to how to do this. I think I understand `DSolve`, but what does that actually give me, and how do i plot it?
