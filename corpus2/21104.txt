I noted that only part of the legend shows up in `ParametricPlot` using v9's `PlotLegends`:               ParametricPlot[{{t, t}, {t, 2 t}}, {t, 0, 1}, PlotLegends -> LineLegend[{1, 2}]]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/NCR43.png) Inspecting the figure's `FullForm` gets me (among other things)               LineLegend[      List[        Directive[EdgeForm[GrayLevel[0.5`]], Hue[0.9060679774997897`, 0.6`, 0.6`]]      ], List[1, 2],       Rule[LegendLayout, "Column"]]      It looks like Mathematica forgot to add the second color. Adding the color manually gets me the full legend. This looks like a bug, but perhaps I'm missing something? I also noticed that virtually all examples in the "Options/PlotLegends" section of the `ParametricPlot` doc page yield a result differing from the pre-rendered image. Again, this looks like a bug, perhaps introduced by a last-minute addition. I'm using v9.0.1. Anyone with v9.0.0 care to check whether it exists there as well?
