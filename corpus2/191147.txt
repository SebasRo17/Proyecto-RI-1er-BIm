I want to write an android application that holds information where (climbing) rocks are located in a wider area. I want to display all rocks nearby my current location (say below 500m) and may be update the displayed distance to them (straight-line distance) in real time. To naively compute the distance between two points will not be efficient regarding a rock database with thousands of entries. For this special case the use of online services is discouraged as they are not available at all. I've heared about some location-aware databases. Does anyone have experiences with them (under android)? Is it efficient enough to divide the map of rocks into quadrants and enrich the rock database with these information? (Then compute the quadrant of the current location and only compute the distances of the rocks in the nearby quadrants?) I tried searching for an answer to this question (I'm sure others had these question too) but could not find anything appropriate. **tl;dr** How do I **efficiently** find points of interest near my current gps location?
