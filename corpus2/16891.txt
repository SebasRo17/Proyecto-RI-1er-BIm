I'm using `FindMaxValue` to study the distribution of maxima of `Abs[RiemannSiegelZ[t]]` between consecutive values of `ZetaZero`, Some background: `RiemannSiegelZ[t]` is `Zeta[1/2+I* t]` 'with the phase taken out'; i.e. real for real $t$ and with the same absolute value as `Zeta`. Outside of _Mathematica_ this is known as Hardy's function $Z(t)$. On the Riemann Hypothesis, $Z(t)$ has no positive local minima or negative local maxima 'for $t$ sufficiently large' (see Edwards' book "Riemann's Zeta Function".) In fact $t>5$ is sufficient. Thus on the Riemann Hypothesis $Z(t)$ is positive (resp. negative) and concave down (resp. up) with a unique local maximum (resp. minimum) for $t$ between `ZetaZero[2k-1]` and `ZetaZero[2k]` (resp `ZetaZero[2k]` and `ZetaZero[2k+1]`). To determine the maxima, I'm less concerned with speed or precision than I am with robustness. The documentation says that > `FindMaxValue[f,{x, x0, x1}]` searches for a local maximum in `f` using `x0` > and `x1` as the first two values of x, avoiding the use of derivatives. Is this routine _guaranteed_ to return a value between `x0` and `x1` if there is in fact a unique local maximum there (i.e., guaranteed to not jump outside the interval)? Should I be using a `Method` other than `Automatic`, and if so, which one? The documentation also says: > `FindMaxValue[f,{x, x0, xmin, xmax}]` searches for a local maximum, stopping > the search if `x` ever gets outside the range `xmin` to `xmax`. It does not say what the parameter `x0` determines but from earlier documentation one would suppose that it is the starting point for the search. What does it mean if the search 'stops'? Does _Mathematica_ return an error message? What is the difference between               FindMaxValue[f,{x, x0, xmin, xmax}]      and               FindMaxValue[{f, xmin < x < xmax}, {x, x0}]      Finally, I'm having difficulties with (I think) the fact that `FindMaxValue` has the attribute `HoldAll`, for example               In[3]:= t1 = N[Im[ZetaZero[1]]]; t2 =       N[Im[ZetaZero[2]]]; tmid = (t1 + t2)/2; FindMaxValue[      RiemannSiegelZ[t], {t, tmid, t1, t2}]          FindMaxValue::nrgnum: The gradient is not a vector of real numbers at {t} = {17.8742}. >>          Out[3]= 2.31595
