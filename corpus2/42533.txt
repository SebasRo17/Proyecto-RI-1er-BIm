I have a shapefile with the following `"CoordinateSystemInformation"`:               "PROJCS" -> {"NAD_1983_StatePlane_Illinois_East_FIPS_1201_Feet",     "GEOGCS" -> {       "GCS_North_American_1983",        "DATUM" -> {         "North_American_Datum_1983",         "SPHEROID" -> {"GRS_1980", 6.37814*10^6, 298.257}},        "PRIMEM" -> {"Greenwich", 0.},        "UNIT" -> {"Degree", 0.0174533}},      "PROJECTION" -> {"Transverse_Mercator"},      "PARAMETER" -> {"False_Easting", 984250.},      "PARAMETER" -> {"False_Northing", 0.},      "PARAMETER" -> {"Central_Meridian", -88.3333},      "PARAMETER" -> {"Scale_Factor", 0.999975},      "PARAMETER" -> {"Latitude_Of_Origin", 36.6667},      "UNIT" -> {"Foot_US", 0.304801}}      I would like to plot {Latitude, Longitude} points and overlay these images, but I am having trouble converting coordinates. The shapefile data contains coordinates in the vicinity of {1.16328*10^6, 1.89271*10^6}. (This is Chicago.) One point I would like to plot is {41.8713, -87.6737}.               GeoGridPosition[GeoPosition[{41.8713, -87.6737}], "TransverseMercator"]      gives the wrong coordinates:               GeoGridPosition[{-0.164851, 0.743066}, "TransverseMercator"]      As does               GeoGridPosition[GeoPosition[{41.8713, -87.6737}], "Mercator"]      which yields:               GeoGridPosition[{1.6114, 0.806147}, "Mercator"]      What am I doing wrong? It's not a question of reversed coordinates as in this thread.
