I have worked for two days to find a way through this problem. I am porting my student grade records into _Mathematica_ from spreadsheets, or sometimes from my college web sites, or sometimes from my word processor. I have many different source formats as you see, but I find I can always get the data into the format where it will paste into a word processor in one or the other format sketched in my subject line above. I can deal with the _Mathematica_ end of the project once the grades are in the form `List["B+", "C-", "A", "B"]` \-- from there convert them into gpa's, points, sums, averages, whatever -- but I have not been able to operate on the data Pasted into _Mathematica_ because the pluses and minuses are interpreted as parts of incomplete expressions, which blocks execution of string functions. To get the data in, I need to use use the Windows Copy command, then Paste into _Mathematica_. The source can easily be one of the two character formats shown just below. (Or see my subject line.) But unfortunately the grades often have pluses and minuses, especially B+ or C+. But if I paste the following example straight into List in an Input cell, it is interpreted as an incomplete expression:               List[D+, F , C-, F, A-, B, A, A- ,D-, B-, C-, B, D-, D, B, D, A+, B, D, B+, F, C-, F, C+, D-, D+, B]      The same thing happens if I paste the same information in this way:               List[D + F C - F A - B A A - D - B - C - B D - D B D A + B D B + F C - F C + D - D + B]      So I need a "container" to paste into, which will eliminate white spaces, attach any pluses or minuses to the preceding character, and interpret each letter grade as a string as here: `List["B+", "C-", "A", "B"]` (By the way the only letters which appear are ABCDFWI, if that permits simplification, and the only non-letters are + and -). I feel kinda dumb asking about this, but Strings in _Mathematica_ are so crazy I'm just not there yet.
