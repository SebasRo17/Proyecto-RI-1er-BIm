In Geometry 3D, How can I find the vertices with integer coordinates of a triangle whose perimeter and area are positive integers with _Mathematica_? Suppose its vertices $(x,y,z)$ has coordinates belong to interval $[-50,50]$ If the triangle with three sides 9, 10, 17, I choose a vertex is $(1,2,3)$ and tried               a = {x, y, z};     b = {x1, y1, z1};     c = {1, 2, 3};     {a, b, c} /.       Solve[{SquaredEuclideanDistance[a, b] == 9^2,         SquaredEuclideanDistance[a, c] == 10^2,         SquaredEuclideanDistance[c, b] == 17^2, -50 <= x <= 50, -50 <= y <=          50, -50 <= x1 <= 50, -50 <= y1 <= 50}, {x, y, z, x1, y1, z1},        Integers]      I tried with perimeter. Time is too long.               a = {x1, y1, z1};     b = {x2, y2, z2};     p = Norm[a] + Norm[b] + Norm[a - b];     Solve[{p == k,        12 <= k <= 50, -5 <= x <= 5, -5 <= y <= 5, -5 <= z <= 5,        5 <= x1 <= 5, -5 <= y1 <= 5, -5 <= z1 <= 5}, {x, y, z, x1, y1,        z1, k}, Integers]      I used Maple and found some triangles. For example $A(-6,1,2)$, $B(-9,1,2)$, $C(-9,1,6)$ or $A(1, 2, 3)$, $B(13, 21, 51)$, $C(49, 18, 15)$; The answer of Maple http://www.mapleprimes.com/questions/200319-Perimeter-And- Area-Of-A-Triangle-Are I love this answer. * * *
