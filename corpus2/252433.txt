When I should use REST? In what kind of web applications? In terms of java in what situation RESTful would be better than ordinary servlets / JSP ? Imagine that I have a web page where users can upload two kinds of files and create some objects that are later saved in DB(current tasks etc). The only think users can download is this two kinds of files. Will RESTful be a good approach in that kind of service?
