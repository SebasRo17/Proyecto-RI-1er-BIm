I have two lists of data which I am plotting on two `ListLinePlots`. I would like to have these two plots appear perpendicular to each other on a 3D graphic. I have tried to do this using a modification to the answers to this question, but I am quite new to _Mathematica_ so I had some trouble converting this into code that works for me. Is there any way that I can implement this method when the data is lists rather than functions of some variable?
