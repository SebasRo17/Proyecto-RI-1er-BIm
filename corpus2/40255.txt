Recently I heard of a company that, for interviews, asks potential employees to stand up and write out code on a whiteboard. Apparently that freaked alot of interviewees out. This got me thinking and even though I consider myself a reasonable programmer, I would be hard pressed to write lengthy code out without referring to previous code I had written or doing a quick Google search. How many programmers could safely say "Yes I could write all my code out just like I was writing an email"?
