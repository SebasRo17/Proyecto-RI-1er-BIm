I'm preparing a presentation where I want to place a background image on each slide (for aesthetics). These are extremely color filled images (like photos; lets use "ExampleData/lena.tif" as example), which means that once they are the background, the text becomes hard to read. So, I wanted to have some fading, like white at the top left corner (my background is not white: {253,253,251}, which means that the background color is important to be an option), and then **fading in** in the direction of the bottom right corner. This fading should not change the color in itself (if you understand what I mean: not brighter, but more or less "transparent"). Transparent fading would be the best, since it would cover for whichever slide layout we have; but not sure how to pass it correctly to another program (using MS Powerpoint). It would be great to be able to change each extremity fade value (that is, not from 0 to 1 all the time), and to change direction. To change the fading function is a plus, but I think that not needed at this time (I mean: linear in the chosen direction, or power, or etc.)
