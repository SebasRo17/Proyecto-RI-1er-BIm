I'm looking for some examples of experiences from people who have made the move from programmer to team leader. I'm kind of wanting to know the reasons why people have done it. Specifically, these are some questions and concerns that are floating around in my head.   * Did you have a waning desire to write code but still a strong desire to create programs?   * Did you realise that you were more of a people person and you could utilise your communication skills better?   * Was it because you were asked by management and thought why not?   * For the money?   * How were the initial few months after making the move?   * Were relations with colleagues affected?
