I've never written a php class before from scratch. But I guess you have to start somewhere right? I've got an idea, but need help with logic. Please tell me what you think. Below is shorthand obviously. In the planning stages.               Class -       -> type (recurring, single, day)      -> Recurring days (4,2,3,4,1,2....etc. for odd schedules- need even pairs)      -> Shift Type (onshift, vacation, medical, etc...)      -> Emp Id      -> Start      -> End      -> Location Id      -> Hours per day      -> Day start time           get schedule ( by account/location/company/unit/crew/individual )           select single entries           separate array into days (1 day) increments           if single entries have linking day entries, replace array with day entry information           return mysql array of days for the time period;           set schedule ( dates, emp id)           if recurring               if already exisits || conflicts with existing                   error               create recurring template in db table               create single db entries using recurring days for 1 year           if single               if date is between dates already in db || more than 1 year out                   error               else                   insert into db           if day               if no existing single range                  error               else                  insert into db under day table, with id linking to id of existing single.           remove recurringOnly(emp id)           delete all entries with recurring id           remove all entries( from this date forward, emp id )           delete entries with start date > date           cronUpdate( cron start / end dates)           if cron start / end dates                delete anything with dates bigger than nextUpdate (to make sure no errors)                select recurring db entries with nextUpdate between cron start/ end                insert into db the next set of "recurring days" for the employee                update nextUpdate date for employee           else - error
