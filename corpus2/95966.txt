I've read the Learn You a Haskell book up to the point where they introduce Monads and stuff like Just a. These are so counterintuitive for me that I just feel like giving up trying to learn it. But I really want to try. I'm wondering if I can at least avoid the advanced concepts for a while and just starting using the other parts of the language to do a lot of practical tasks with the more basic parts of Haskell, i.e. functions, standard IO, file handling, database interfacing and the like. Is this a reasonable approach to learning how to use Haskell?
