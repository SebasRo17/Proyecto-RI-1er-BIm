I am trying to launch Wolfram _Mathematica 8_ Home Edition. The installation itself occurred without a hitch. Note: "..." indicates my machine name, username, etc. ### Linux Version ...$ uname -a Linux ... 3.5.0-25-generic #39-Ubuntu SMP Mon Feb 25 18:26:58 UTC 2013 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux ### Error Messages ...$ mathematica /usr/local/bin/mathematica: 237: /usr/local/bin/mathematica: /usr/local/Wolfram/Mathematica/8.0/SystemFiles/FrontEnd/Binaries/Linux/Mathematica: not found ...$ math /usr/local/bin/math: 166: exec: /usr/local/Wolfram/Mathematica/8.0/SystemFiles/Kernel/Binaries/Linux/MathKernel: not found ### Things I have tried I found someone who had the exact same error message come up, only it was on the Mint 10 system. Here is the link: http://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=47&t=61409 The author seems to have dealt with the problem by installing a missing library. The only issue is that the author of the forum post declined to state what library was missing! I have tried making sure all my repositories are up- to-date using the Software Updater. Does anyone have suggestions for packages I can try installing using the Synaptic Package Manager? If Mathematica runs fine on Ubuntu 12, it must be an application or library that is missing on LUbuntu that is preventing the launcher from recognizing the file. Because I can assure anyone who asks that the files in question are all there. To wit: ...$ ls /usr/local/bin/mathematica /usr/local/bin/mathematica ...$ ls /usr/local/Wolfram/Mathematica/8.0/SystemFiles/FrontEnd/Binaries/Linux/Mathematica /usr/local/Wolfram/Mathematica/8.0/SystemFiles/FrontEnd/Binaries/Linux/Mathematica ...$ ls /usr/local/Wolfram/Mathematica/8.0/SystemFiles/FrontEnd/Binaries/Linux/Mathematica /usr/local/Wolfram/Mathematica/8.0/SystemFiles/FrontEnd/Binaries/Linux/Mathematica All the files above have 755 permissions, in case anybody is wondering about that. I can show the screen readout for that too, if anyone is still skeptical. I would appreciate any suggestions, although I would like them to involve getting Mathematica to run in LUbuntu. I would prefer to change my operating system only as a last resort.
