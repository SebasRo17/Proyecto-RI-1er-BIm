Is there a way to prevent session id restore on startup/restart of user's system? We are using a asp.net app and I am able to login and access the site. For the first time session id is created and stored in cookies. Problem:   But if I restart my system without signing out, the session is still alive.   How can I prevent this? from server side. I can try to delete cookies but it is not practical, as each user will have different preferences.
