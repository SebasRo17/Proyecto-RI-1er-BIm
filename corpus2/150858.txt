How can 2 or more developers code a certain feature/module of a software? Let's assume that the module is big and feature rich. How would they prevent each other from overlapping their code? Say, we have the same method but is implemented in a different way. Do you think it might be better to have one focused at a specific feature only? Is a version control system like Git would help solve the problem? Is it correct that it allows developers to have these "branches" and then merge it later on? What's your take on this?
