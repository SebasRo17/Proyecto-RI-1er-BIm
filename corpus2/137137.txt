I want to generate code documentation in a simple format. The key items are Method Signature, members, constructors, methods. I am taking various applications in .NET and creating documentation for them. I will be adding notes to each item. The end result should look similar to MSDN or Java API documentation. So, I want to take my source code and have some kind of template generated that I can append notes to. I want to pick and choose certain classes and not others across various applications. I'm not talking about intellisense documentation. This documentation will be used for reference outside of visual studio. AFAIK, that's all the XML comments are good for in .NET. I'm documenting various interfaces and entry points for writing extensions for a 3rd party application. We do not own their code, so I can't just go in and append XML comments to their interfaces, classes etc. Instead, I need to implement the interface and comment it up. Then document it on the web. Documentating each implementation just to explain their architecture is redundant. They do not document their stuff...that's the core issue here. Is there any tool that can assist with this process? What do you suggest?
