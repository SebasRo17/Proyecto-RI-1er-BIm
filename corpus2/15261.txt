I have been looking at RentACoder, Freelancer and eLance from last few years but I always hesitated to register at these site. Hesitation includes little worry too. These questions fill me: (1) Is there a legal contract between the bidder and the coder? Just in case my delivery date extends, what happens? (2) After delivery, payment reach without trouble or not. (3) In case the customer didn't find the project useful, then? Probably he might say that it is not useful to me and you return money. He might copy the source code and return another copy to me. (4) What are further recommendations? How should I start?
