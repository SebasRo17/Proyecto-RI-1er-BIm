In pricing a service or product it is general practice to not merely charge for the effort spent and the costs involved + margin but from the value delivered down. As an independent consultant, how do you set the price of your work? What is the process of determining your hourly rate as an independent software developer? If you have one, what is your hourly rate and how did you arrive at that figure? What factors would you take into account. Is the process of setting a hourly rate only based on balancing demand with supply so that supply (you and your time) doesn't get overwhelmed? When are the good times to raise your rates? Are there projects in which you have had to charge higher than other projects? If so, please cite examples. Do you change your hourly rate based on what kind of development you are doing? (for example, .net programming more, and lesser for php programming) Do you set hourly rates based on what type of business the client is? If so how? If you know of any relevant articles or material on the topic of charging for programming services, please post the same.
