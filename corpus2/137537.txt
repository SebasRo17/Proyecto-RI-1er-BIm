I am switching from C#+Visual Studio to Ruby+Vim for a few months. The **only** thing that I am missing from C#/Visual Studio is **intellisense** , especially when I have a new ruby gem to familiarize. As a programmer with a below-average memory like Joel, I miss the a happy time in Visual Studio that I can `Ctrl`+`Space` everywhere to get a hint list so that I don't have to memorize a single method , whether it's name or it's parameter list. I can even get it's usage/sample code at MSDN with only a press of `F1`. So, ruby(dynamic typing language)+vim/TextMate programmers, when you are coding Do you run google/gem API reference manual/irb/ri side by side with your vim/TextMate like me most of the time ? or A Good memory is a must-have for ruby(or other dynamic language) programmers?
