I write open source .NET class libraries as a hobby and thought about signing them. I can get Visual Studio to generate me a password protected public/private key pair and save it as a .pfx file, but I don't think I should do this for _each and every_ project. One key pair should be enough, right? Obviously I'm not going to put my .pfx file with the source code in my online public repository: only the assemblies I release should be signed with my key pair. Other people can use their own keys if they want. So I'm left with some .pfx file that supposedly contains my public/private key pair.   * How do I manage my key pair effectively?   * Where do I store it?   * Do I have to import it somewhere?   * How can I use it on both my PC and my laptop?   * How do I prevent the key pair hell when switching from PC to laptop?
