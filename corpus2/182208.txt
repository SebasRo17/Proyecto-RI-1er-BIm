We are looking for a new way of doing pair programming. It's looks like best way of programming, it is faster and you push out great tested code. But there are some downsides. Ad hoc items that pop up.   crashing.   back ups.   there is only ever one driver. What we thought might be the best possible environment is that we have a server running a VM. Both myself and my programming partner SSH inside and run some sort of VNC, or teamviewer locally between so that we can both work on files simultaneously and say one person works on the views and the other works on setting up apache. So we are looking at working on the same system from two different computer simultaneously. This way we could then when needed link to our other branches and have pairing "systems" that we could like to. Or if someone needs to jump out and work on something else the other person can carry on without him. What do we need to learn to set up such an environment, or accomplish something like this?
