I never used an automated test mechanism in any of my projects and I feel I'm missing a lot. I want to improve myself, so I have to start tackling some issues I've been neglecting like this and trying Git instead of being stuck on SVN. What's a good way to learn TDD? I'll probably be using Eclipse to program in Java. I've heard of JUnit, but I don't know if there's anything else I should consider.
