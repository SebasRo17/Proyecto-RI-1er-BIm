I'm building an application, and I'm thinking long-term I would like to be able to allow plugin support. The application I'm creating is a Java based application. How could I allow plugins using a scripting language, or is it better to require plugins to use Java? Would I need to create some sort of plugin interface to allow the use of plugins? Any ideas of references of where to start?
