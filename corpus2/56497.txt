I'm trying to create a structures analysis program based on the stiffness method. The program should analyse frames. All the program should be included in the manipulate function. What I want at first to be able to draw the structure using graphics. The problem is the user has to specify some variables in order to draw the figure(spans and floors number) which will be the variables in the manipulate. How can I do this? Since the number of objects to draw is varying how can creat one single function to do this job. I'll will explain it again. If the user chooses one span and one floor the function should draw two vertical lines with one horizontal between them. If he chooses 2 spans 2 floors he should see 3 vertical lines with 2 lines horizontally spaning between them midway and 2 horizontal lines at the top. Thank you.
