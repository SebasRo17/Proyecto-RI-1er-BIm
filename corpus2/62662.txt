Sometimes I get a bit disillusioned with the types of projects that I work on as they are just basically business apps that aren't exactly groundbreaking and are usually redundant as far as other applications already existing that do similar things. I have thought that it would be nice to possibly eventually get into working as a programmer for a company that is doing medical research or some other type of scientific research to where I would feel I am working towards something that I feel is potentially beneficial to a wide number of people, this relates to some recent life experiences but I won't get into that here. Also, I'm not really interested much in doing computer science research, more research for other fields that make use of programming. I currently work as a Java web application programmer and I don't know much about jobs of the type that I would be looking for in this field. I would be interested to hear from anyone with experience in this who could possibly point me towards resources or tell me a bit about what working in this field would be like, I assume it would be quite different than working for the types of businesses I have worked for so far. Thanks for any info
