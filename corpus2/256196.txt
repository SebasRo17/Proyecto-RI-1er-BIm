I am trying to reuse an object but my function is getting called twice. Here is what I have:               var KEYBOARD = {       template: 'keyboard';       getkeyboard: function(){         console.log(this.template);       }     }      now in one file I do this:               $.extend(KEYBOARD, {         template: 'keyboard',      }).getKeyboard();      then in a different file I do:                $.extend(KEYBOARD, {         template: 'keypad',      }).getKeyboard();      Now in the second file the getKeyboard function prints out:               keyboard     keypad      Can someone please tell me what I'm doing wrong? I thought I could change the properties and run them through the function, but for some reason it holds the values of the first object.
