Based on this question: I have a list of bspline functions (nearly 1000) provided by applying `BSplineFunction` to a list of points. I want to get the points each of bspline function for `Range[0, 1, .1]`. For instance:               functions = {bsplinefunc1, bsplinefunc2, bsplinefunc3};      The desired result is:               result =       {bsplinefunc1[0], bsplinefunc1[.1], bsplinefunc1[.2], ..., bsplinefunc1[1]},        {bsplinefunc2[0], bsplinefunc2[.1], bsplinefunc2[.2], ..., bsplinefunc2[1]},       {bsplinefunc3[0], bsplinefunc3[.1], bsplinefunc3[.2], ..., bsplinefunc3[1]}}      I tried to use the solutions of this question, mainly Istv√°n Zachar's answer; however, I couldn't make it work. Any help is appreciated.
