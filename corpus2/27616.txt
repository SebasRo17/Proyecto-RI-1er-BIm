This should be a really simple question, but it isn't in the documentation for some perverse reason. I like the default `ColorFunction` that _Mathematica_ uses for `Plot3D` and the like. I'd like to use the same color scheme for other _Mathematica_ plots that don't have it as the automatic default. However, after looking through all of the Color Gradients listed by `ColorData["Gradients"]` I can't find any that match the effect of just setting `ColorFunction->Automatic`. My question: What does _Mathematica_ call its default color palette, why isn't it listed in `ColorData`, and how can I access it to apply it to other plots?
