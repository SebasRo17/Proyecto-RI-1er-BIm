The company I work within is tentatively moving towards an Agile project management strategy - having experienced the "joys" of waterfall one time to many. Key to this is a shift in emphasis towards delivering functionality as opposed to meeting hard deadlines. While the development process and client relationship has certainly improved by the iterative releases fostered through Agile , it is proving somewhat harder to apply the same rationale to the funding strategies for the project. Clients are often unaccustomed to concepts like Agile, and express great concern with **what they percieve** as a case of "it'll be ready when it's ready". I would like to hear people's thoughts and experiences in funding Agile projects **edit:** I want to stress that _I am not asking folks to explain the pros and cons of the Agile method_ to me, nor that I believe Agile equates to "it'll be ready when it's ready", this is a fear expressed by the clients/businesses I've worked with when advocating Agile development practices. What I am interested in is the experiences people have had resolving the conflicts between "traditional" waterfall budgeting methods entrenched in business client/relationships and more progressive development methods - and the budgeting strategies they have adopted to support that evolution.
