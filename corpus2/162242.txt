I have been working on an open source Museum Collections Management web application that is to be used to keep track of a museum's accessioned, donated, loaned or otherwise acquired artefacts. This involved designing and creating a rather large database (in relation to my previous experiences), which stores all kinds of varying information (artefact information, changing location information, personal contact information, pictures, etc), that needs to be flexible and easily extendible. I am just finishing my university degree and I am not a professional when it comes to database design and so I am really wanting to create a thorough test suite to ensure that what I have in place "works". I have read up on database testing and have come across a few articles that mention Regression Testing in regards to databases but I do not fully understand what this all involves. From reading this article at Dr.Dobbs I understand that one sort of testing that I will need to do is validate that the logic in the database is correct. So I would create tests that insert certain data into the database and then follow it up with a query to ensure that I get the correct data back from the database (ensuring that all the appropriate triggers or views are working). The confusion comes in with the mention of testing for "Data Quality". In the article above the author makes mention that you want to validate the following with tests:   * Column domain value rules   * Column default value rules   * Value existence rules   * Row value rules   * Size rules What types of tests would this involve and how would they be implemented? Also this is my first time writing a test suite for a database, are there any good guidelines on how/where to begin or any processes that I could follow to guide my test development?
