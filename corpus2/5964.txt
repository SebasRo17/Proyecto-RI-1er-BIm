We frequently recruit fresh talent into our company straight from the Universities. While a lot of training goes on for these developers, I think there should be a training program that simply teaches them good coding skills (note, I am not talking about knowledge of .net framework). What I am looking for is a software which allows me to automate some of this training. The part that should be automated is   * Create coding assignments   * Automatic submission of assignment   * Automatic evaulation of the submitted assignment on code quality Have you guys ever seen something like this in the wild?
