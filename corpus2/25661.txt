is there any way to plot a "3D set" of points subject to certain rules? For example, my task is to find maximum of some function of three variables which have to meet some conditions. Of course I can't use Plot3D and RegionFunction because I would need a 4D space. So I tried to plot only the constraints (where "z" would be a function of "x" and "y"): the constraints are 3x^2>2y^2+z^2 and x^2+y^2=1, and then I used               Plot3D[{Sqrt[3 x^2 - 2 y^2],-Sqrt[3 x^2 - 2 y^2]}, {x, -5, 5}, {y, -5, 5},       RegionFunction -> Function[{x, y}, x^2 + y^2 <= 1 && x^2 + y^2 >= 1]]      But this isn't working for some reason - I get only a box without any plot, but even if it did work, it wouldn't be very helpful because the first contraint is inequality and not an equation. I hope I expressed myself correctly and comprehensibly, English is not my mother tongue. Any ideas how to solve my issue?
