Is there a methodology to debug websites without a browser? Normally I use a web browser to view a results page. The slow debugging process confuses me a little. To correct an error I need to switch to a code window (which takes some time). Then I correct the error and return to a browser window, press F5, and wait for the page to update (which could take 10 secs). It could take only 1 second if the page automatically updates after I correct my code. I'd like a tool where I could see my code and a corresponding result page on one screen. I need a tool that updates an open page upon code changes. I would also like to edit both server and client sides (generally JavaScript), and see my changes as soon as possible, without unnecessary 'user' manipulations. **Update**. I need a tool which controls source files. It must reload a browser when any source file is changed. A good feature can be reloading with cache clear (for example if a changed file has specific extention such as .js, .css).
