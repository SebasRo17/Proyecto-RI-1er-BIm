So I'm reading a book for architecting applications for the enterprise from the Microsoft Press. It's a great book, and I'm learning a lot. However, it's very high level, and can be applied to a lot of different domains (not even just .NET, even though that's how the book is geared). The first project I want to develop after reading the book is a Windows Forms application in .NET 4.0. I want to use a lot of the books concepts to develop the app, but I really want a great Windows Forms dedicated book to read before starting that's really going to tell me all I need to know about developing Windows Forms apps. I found plenty of books for .NET 2.0 and stuff, but nothing for Windows Forms in the new .NET 4.0 Framework. Any suggestions?
