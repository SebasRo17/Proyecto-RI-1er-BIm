The solution to this system of differential equations:               NDSolve[{         x''[t] == k[t] y'[t], y''[t] == -k[t] x'[t],          x'[0] == A, y'[0] == 0, x[0] == 0, y[0] == 0},        {x, y}, {t, 0, 10}]      satisfies this equation:               x'[t]^2 + y'[t]^2 == A      But when `NDSolve` solves the system, the speed will eventually move away from it's initial value `A`. Is there anyway to make `NDSolve` keep the speed normalized?
