I fear this question is going to send shivers down the spine, and/or instinctive anathema of the very thought... Basically: **has anyone ever been asked to diagnose and assign individual culpability to defects?** In other words: to be asked to work back through the code, to try and establish who was responsible for the line/function/module that introduced it in some way, and then record that persons name in the ticket so that a report can breakdown defects not only by severity, component, estimate, etc - but also by team member. Iâ€™m asking this because - like me - you might want to just try and get inside the mindset of a manager who might propose it, and in so doing, understand why they might think this is extremely useful. Surely, you might ask, this time would be better spent actually fixing the defect?
