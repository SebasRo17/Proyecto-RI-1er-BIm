Is there an equivalent to `Sum` for `And`? That is, just like instead of `Plus@@Table[f[i], {i,3,6}]` (or `Total@Table[f[i], {i,3,6}]`) you can write `Sum[f[i], {i,3,6}]`, is there a single pre-defined function that can replace `And@@Table[f[i], {i,3,6}]`? If not, is there a better alternative for `And@@Table[...]`? Note that, at least in Mathematica 8, `Conjunction` is not the right tool (despite the claim in the documentation that "`Conjunction` is to `And` what `Product` is to `Times`") because it only substitutes logical values, that is, it can only replace the special case `And@@Table[f[var], {var, {False, True}}]` (and of course multi-variable versions of the same structure).
