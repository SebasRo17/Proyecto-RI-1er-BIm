Many programmers, upon first encountering Python, are immediately put off by the significance of whitespace. I've heard a variety of reasons that this is inconvenient, but I've never heard a complaint from a Python programmer. Of course, I haven't met a lot of Python programmers, as I have spent my career in the Java world. So my question is for those of you that have participated in a large Python project (more than 3 months, with Python being the primary language used): Did you find the whitespace issue to be inconvenient and continually annoying? Or was it a non-issue once you got in the flow? I'm not asking the question because I'm for or against Python, or for or against its use of whitespace. I happen to like Python, but I've never used it for anything big. Please don't provide speculations if you are not experienced in Python.
