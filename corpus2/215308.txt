I'm trying to understand which part of my code I should to test. I have some code. Below is example of this code, just to understand the idea. Depends of some parametrs I put one or another currency to "Event" and return his serialization in the controller. Which part of code I should to test? Just the final serialization, or only "Event" or every method: getJson, getRows, fillCurrency, setCurrency?               class Controller {         public function getJson()         {             $rows = $eventManager->getRows();                   return new JsonResponse($rows);         }     }          class EventManager {         public function getRows()         {             //some code here             if ($parameter == true) {                 $this->fillCurrency($event, $currency);             }         }              public function fillCurrency($event,  $currency)         {             //some code here             if ($parameters == true) {                 $event->setCurrency($currency);             }         }     }          class Event {         public function setCurrency($currency) {             $this->updatedAt = new Datetime();             $this->currency = $currency;         }     }
