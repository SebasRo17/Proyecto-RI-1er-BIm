I was wondering if there was a more elegant way of finding whether an element exists in an N-dimensional array. The way I would do it is:                inArrayQ[a_,el_] := If[Length@Position[a,x_/;x==el]==0,False,True];      But this seems rather cumbersome. I am surprised there is no built-in Mathematica function that does this, but if not, is there a better way to write such a function?
