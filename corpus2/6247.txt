**Note:** This question was asked when Mathematica 8 was latest release. Version 9 has built-in support for volume rendering through `Image3D`. * * * There's an example on wolfram.com showing some medical data rendered in 3D. Unfortunately there's no code, only an animation. ![Volume rendering](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3Wf3c.png) Note that the data is shown as a solid three-dimensional body, not only 2D slices of it like in the example on the doc page of `Texture`. Given a 3D texture, how can such a visualization of a solid 3D body be made using Mathematica? You will find the volumetric data on the doc page of Texture, under Applications -> Volume Rendering. I notice there's something included with CUDALink. Unfortunately I can't try it (I don't have the hardware), but it looks quite different from the image I linked to above, so I think there must be an independent way to produce the image above. [With Sjoerd's hardware (it's pretty cool, movements are totally smooth):]   ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uWMip.png) Link to the MathGroup version of this post.
