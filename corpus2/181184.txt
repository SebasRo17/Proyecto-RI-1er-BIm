I have a couple of exam questions for my compilers class and wanted to check if my solutions are correct. The first question is: > Consider a language in which numbers start with an optional minus sign, > followed by one or more decimal digits, followed by an optional decimal > point. If the number contains a decimal point it is followed by one or more > further decimal digits. Express the syntax of numbers in this language as a > regular expression. And for my answer: > ("-")? ["0"-"9"]+ ("."["0"-"9"]+)? The second question is: > Construct a deterministic ﬁnite state automaton for recognising the numbers > as described in Question 1 And my answer is: ![Diagram of finite automaton](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vfFf8.png) Where state 2,4,5 and 6 are terminals. Are these solutions correct? I am unsure of what the DFA should look like and it's differences to an NFA. Thanks !
