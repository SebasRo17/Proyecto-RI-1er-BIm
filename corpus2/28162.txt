Inspired by the recent question Alternatives to LaTeX (currently 58 upvotes) on http://tex.stackexchange.com/: Are there any paid-for or open source alternatives to Mathematica which produce equal or even better functionality, specifically with regard to solving, manipulating and visualising algebraic expressions. Note: a similar question is Best open-source Mathematica equivalent, however this question is targeted at users of Mathematica.SE (and is five years in the future).
