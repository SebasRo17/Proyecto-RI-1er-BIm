Hello I'm new to web development and I'm making simple webpage for managing parts. I came with idea of making something like "One page". Render layout once and later replace body content with ajax calls. Because of each "part" of the webpage like StorageList consists of views `like create,details,edit etc` I decided to show those pages in modal windows over the main page and get this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Uh4rp.png) These modals are also loaded using ajax. As you can see "Ajax. Ajax everywhere" :) And now my question is my approach good or making this page basing on the ajax calls and dynamically loaded content will cause me any problems in future in maintaining?
