I am a new to storing dates based on time zones. Need to know the standard way to store the date in the datastore. My requirements are   1. Easy to query the date based on the date range.    2. show the date with the client appropriate time zone selected by him(I am having a table maintained for the timezone separately)    3. Able to query using the datastore Admin console also. Any suggestions/ideas regarding this will be a great help in proceeding further.
