I am going to be developing a program that detects duplicate files and I was wondering what the best/fastest method would be to do this? I am more interested in what the best hash algorithm would be to do this? For example, I was thinking of having it get the hash of each files contents and then group the hashes that are the same. Also, should there be a limit set for what the maximum file size can be or is there a hash that is suitable for large files?
