When I was working as a website designer/engineer I primarily used databases for storage of much of my dynamic data. It was very easy and convenient to use this method and seemed like a standard practice from my research on the matter. I'm now working on shifting away from websites and into desktop applications. **What are the best practices for data storage for desktop applications?** I ask because I have noticed that most programs I use on a personal level don't appear to use a database for data storage unless its embedded in the program. I'm not thinking of an application like a word processor where it makes sense to have data stored in individual files as defined by the user. Rather I'm thinking of something more along the lines of a calendar application which would need to store dates and event info and such where accessing that information would be much easier if stored in a database... at least as far as my experience would indicate.
