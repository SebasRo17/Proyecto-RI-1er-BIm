First of all please be aware this post contains some abusive language but I hope it will not bother anyone. I apologize for the bad language but that's what the name is. As I've been doing documentation on existing programming languages attempting to make a complete list of them I stumbled across terrible programming languages, which were clearly not made for actual use and implementation due to their insane difficulty. Languages such as Brainfu*k and LOLCODE or Whitespace are fool languages because they have no real use. For example, a "Hello world" program written in BrainFu*k. Taken from Wikipedia:               The following program prints "Hello World!" and a newline to the screen:          +++++ +++++             initialize counter (cell #0) to 10     [                       use loop to set the next four cells to 70/100/30/10         > +++++ ++              add  7 to cell #1         > +++++ +++++           add 10 to cell #2          > +++                   add  3 to cell #3         > +                     add  1 to cell #4         <<<< -                  decrement counter (cell #0)     ]                        > ++ .                  print 'H'     > + .                   print 'e'     +++++ ++ .              print 'l'     .                       print 'l'     +++ .                   print 'o'     > ++ .                  print ' '     << +++++ +++++ +++++ .  print 'W'     > .                     print 'o'     +++ .                   print 'r'     ----- - .               print 'l'     ----- --- .             print 'd'     > + .                   print '!'     > .                     print '\n'      or another example taken from LOLCODE language:                HAI      CAN HAS STDIO?      PLZ OPEN FILE "LOLCATS.TXT"?          AWSUM THX              VISIBLE FILE          O NOES              INVISIBLE "ERROR!"      KTHXBYE      These languages are very difficult to learn/read/work with. My question is - Why do they exist? What is the purpose of them? Also, is there an official "name" for these type of languages?
