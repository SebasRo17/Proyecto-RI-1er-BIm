The Lean Software and System Consortium 2011 conference, which took place last week, stated the vision and values of lean software development. Here are the six values of lean software development as photographed by one of the attendees. Number 1 is " **accept the human condition**." While I can sense the humanistic and maybe even anti- _Taylorist_ mood in this statement, I'd like to ask the experts to explain this principle and how to apply it in our daily work.
