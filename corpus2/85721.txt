My plan is to develop a web based application in the future. I think I can name it "Booth Reservation System" for the Events companies here in our country. One of the main functionality of the system and the most tricky part/difficult part is that the user can upload a "floor plan" (the design of the area were the booth is located in any image format) and then select the specific location on the floor plan to reserve to the booth. Also, the user can create a floor plan on the system. What do you think? What programming language can I use?
