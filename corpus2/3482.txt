You've shipped, asserts are turned off, you receive a _rare_ crash report indicating that a null pointer violation occurred in your code. In a development environment, the problem would have been caught by an assert. All you have is a crash report, so reproducing the issue is near impossible. Following the backtrace doesn't give any clues as to why the crash happened in the first place. Options: \- Add pointer checking to prevent the crash. This will prevent the crash, but you probably won't even find out why it happened in the first place. \- let it fly, hope that it happens again with a repro scenario Let's say the application isn't intended for a guided missle or automatic braking system... Which would you choose?
