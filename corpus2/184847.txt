I'm creating a pizza place application where employees will be able to create orders for customers(pizza and any number of toppings). This is for a school project but the requirements have nothing to do with this question. On the GUI I have a number of checkboxes that the employee will use to determine which toppings the pizza should have. I want to use the decorator pattern for this. **This is what I want to do(just not sure if its a good idea):** I want to put all of my decorators in a separate namespace, and then using reflection grab all of the decorator names out of that name space and use them to build the checkbox list. The reason for doing this is because if more toppings are added later I think it would be beneficial to just be able to add assemblies (topping decorators) without having to recompile/re-distribute the entire application. Thoughts? (I just learned reflection and I have a hammer and am just trying to pound everything in that even remotely looks lilke a nail)
