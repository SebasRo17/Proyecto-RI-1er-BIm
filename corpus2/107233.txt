I was hoping for some direction or guidance regarding my C++ learning experience. I have now read two books, from cover to cover, twice. The first was Ivor Horton's Beginning Visual C++ 2010 and Starting out with C++ Early Objects (7th Edition). At this point and after several months I feel like all I know how to do in C++ is create a basic class, define some methods, use the STL, and read and write info to and from the console buffer (cin/cout). But simple things like saving data to a file, reading from a file, printing, connecting to an FTP site, doing some basic graphic manipulation on the screen (not even DirectX/OpenGL), and so-on I can't do or don't even know where to start. I feel I still haven't learned C++ thoroughly. I think you guys get where I'm going with this. I tried downloading SFML and compiling it in Visual C++ 2010 Professional. After quite a bit of time, I got it, but then I was lost. I followed the tutorials and one didn't work. I kept getting an error regarding a missing symbol and after an hour or so on Google, I couldn't figure it out. Can anyone point me in a direction of where one goes from here? I would imagine others have been at this point sometime during their early days.
