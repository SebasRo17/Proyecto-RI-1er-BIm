The .NET/Link tutorial shows how to call functions defined in DLLs. The example uses the `GetTickCount` Win32 API function               << NetLink`     InstallNET[]     getTickCount = DefineDLLFunction["GetTickCount", "kernel32.dll", "int", {}]          getTickCount[]          (* ==> 91226108 *)      Unfortunately this does not work by default when usign a 64-bit version of Mathematica to call a function defined in a 32-bit DLL. Let's use the 32-bit version of `kernel32.dll` to test:               getTickCount =       DefineDLLFunction["GetTickCount", "c:\\windows\\SysWOW64\\kernel32.dll", "int", {}]          getTickCount[]          NET::netexcptn: A .NET exception occurred: System.BadImageFormatException:         An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format.         (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8007000B)        at Wolfram.NETLink.DynamicDLLNamespace.DLLWrapper15.GetTickCount().      How can I call a 32-bit DLL from a 64-bit Mathematica?
