When evaluating MemoryConstrained for a large memory limit:               MemoryConstrained[Print["aaa"],10^10]      I get:               MemoryConstrained::ipnfm: Positive machine-sized integer or Infinity expected at position 2 in MemoryConstrained[Print[aaa],10^10]. >>      I have tested to find the limit, and is exactly 4294967295 bytes. Is there a reason for this? I need a larger memory limit. I am using Mathematica 9.0.1 and 32-bit Windows 7.
