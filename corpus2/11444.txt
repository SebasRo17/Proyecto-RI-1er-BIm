Suppose that I have the following list called `mylist`:               mylist = {80.2, 80.3, 80.4, 327.6, 327.7, 327.8};      I would like to split `mylist` so that "runs of consecutive elements" are placed in the same sublist. Here, I will define two "consecutive elements" as real numbers that differ by 0.1. The second element can be either 0.1 greater than or 0.1 less than the first element, although in reality it makes more sense if the second element can only be 0.1 greater than the first element. (In my actual application, `mylist` is a list of times [i.e., elapsed time], in seconds, for example. My system is sampled every 0.1 seconds. Time never moves backwards, at least in my world!) So the result I would like is:               {{80.2, 80.3, 80.4}, {327.6, 327.7, 327.8}}      I am thinking that `SplitBy` would be appropriate for this application: > `SplitBy[list, f]` splits _list_ into sublists consisting of runs of > successive elements that give the same value when _f_ is applied. However, in looking in the documentation, it is not clear to me how "adjacent elements" are defined. In Mathematica 7, "More Information" says: > `SplitBy` performs comparisons only on adjacent pairs elements. Thus, what `f` do I use? I have tried:               SplitBy[mylist, #[[2]] - #[[1]] == 0.1 &]      and               SplitBy[mylist, #2 - #1 == 0.1 &]      but neither work. Does `SplitBy` define separate "slots" for the first and second element of a pair? Thanks for your time.
