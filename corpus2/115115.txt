I'm new in the field of programming. I really enjoy it as a career, but I'm not sure I can handle sitting at a desk for eight hours a day. I don't mind it for short stretches of time of course, but I can't do it day in and day out. Is there a field of programming that possibly has jobs that require less time spent at the desk?
