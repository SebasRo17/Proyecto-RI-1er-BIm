I have developed for Android for half a year or so and it is going quite well. I found the learning curve steep in the beginning, but then I somehow got the idea of it all and now I don't have to fight so much anymore. Rather I spend the time on specific problems like "How to do X in Android" but that is usually simple enough to google - or to ask here :) Anyhow, I just discovered Basic for Android and I must admit it looks attractive. It has the kind of IDE I am used to (Delphi) and it seems to be very capable. But on the other hand I am still new in the Android universe so I don't find myself competent enough to really judge the pros and cons of the tool. Have any of you tried it, and if so, what are your thoughts about it?
