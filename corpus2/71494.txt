In my understanding, the `partial` keyword does nothing but allow a class to be split between several source files. Is there any reason to do this other than for code organization? I've seen it used for that in generated UI classes. It seems a poor reason to create a whole keyword. If a class is big enough to require multiple files, it probably is doing too much. I thought that perhaps you could use it to partially define a class for another programmer somewhere to complete, but it would be better to make an abstract class.
