If an OSS project is not backed (for example, by the Apache Foundation), how is the OSS license upheld? My specific scenario is this: if I create an GPLd mobile application with a non-commercial transformations clause, what's to actually stop someone from re-releasing it as "Pro" and charging for it? I assume the owner of the store (Apple/Google/MS) aren't going to uphold licenses on my behalf. Would it come down to me personally having to pay for a lawyer (which seems like a lot of effort to protect a good will gesture)?
