I've been a Java (and PHP) developer for most of my life, but will need to use C for my next project. I remember some basic stuff we did back in school with fork, pthread, semaphores, etc. but I'm not sure if that's still the "way to go" here, or if there have been any recent developments/improvements etc. Google's results seem to be fairly dated. Or does that just mean that this is still the current "state of the art"? Or will I have to use a (system-independent) libary like glib if I want higher-level abstractions, like synchronized queues? What other libraries are there? (The programm will only have to run on Linux though)
