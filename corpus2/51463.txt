Given               expr = f[x, g[y], z]      In the following query, the pattern `h_[__, c_]` appears as last slot in `Alternatives`:               Cases[expr, (h_[c_] | h_[c_, __] | h_[__, c_, __] | h_[__, c_]) :>        h -> c, {0, Infinity}]      Gives               {g -> y, f -> x}      Ie, "f[__,z]" is not matched but is matched when the pattern is rotated to the first slot:               Cases[expr, (h_[__, c_] | h_[c_] | h_[c_, __] | h_[__, c_, __]) :>        h -> c, {0, Infinity}]      Which gives:               {g -> y, f -> z}      Souldn't `Alternatives` be commutative? Apparentely only the first match per level is returned. Is there a method to return `x, y` and `z` containing patterns?
