I want to produce `n` functions. For example, assume that by giving `n=3`, 3 definite integrals will be created, like the following:               In[1]:= n=3;          (The algorithm and Processing )          Out[1]:={ Integrate[f1,{x,x1,x2}], Integrate[f2,{x,x3,x4}], Integrate[f3,{x,x5,x6}]}      OR:               Out[1]:=  Integrate[f1,{x,x1,x2}]+ Integrate[f2,{x,x3,x4}]+ Integrate[f3,{x,x5,x6}]      What is the elegant way to do this calculation and produce different functions ?!
