I'm trying to learn OGSi framework (Equinox distribution). I have registered my service, but I'm confused about a piece of code that I've copied:               IAgendaService service = new AgendaService();      What does this line of code mean? I think that in the service object, there are the `IAgendaService` methods that I've implemented in `AgendaService`, but I' m not sure about this. Could it be a sort of upcating? (I know that it can't be because there is no inheritance, but I try to find something similar to compare)
