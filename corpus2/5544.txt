![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0CDy3.png) Dear all, I've been trying to set prepare a grid with different charts for comparisons. The issue I have is that the first row of the grid has the legend distorted. The issue does not occur for subsequent rows. (see the elongated legend boxes?). I defined a function to create a combination of two charts, then created a grid and exported it to pdf.               chartTrends[country_, percent_] := Module[       {a, b},       a = salesTrend[country, percent];       b = Table[         Labeled[Last[a][[i]],           If[Mod[i, 4] == 1, Rotate[headings[[i]], 90 Degree], None]], {i,           Range@Length@headings}];       Grid[{{BarChart[b, ChartLayout -> "Percentile",            ChartStyle -> ColorData[35, "ColorList"],            PlotRegion -> {{0.10, 0.90}, {0.10, 0.90}}, ImageSize -> 1000,            ChartLegends ->             Placed[Style[#, FontSize -> Small] & /@ First[a], Right]],           BarChart[b, ChartStyle -> ColorData[35, "ColorList"],            PlotRegion -> {{0.10, 0.90}, {0.10, 0.90}},            ChartLayout -> "Stacked", ImageSize -> 1000]}} ]]      This is what I used to create the grid and export it to pdf.               myGrid = Grid[         Partition[         Column[{"", Style[#, Bold, FontSize -> 36], "",              chartTrends[#, 0.9]}, Alignment -> Center] & /@ countryList,          4], Alignment -> Center, Frame -> All,         FrameStyle -> Directive[LightGray]];     Export["myGrid2.pdf", myGrid]      I've tried with GraphicsGrid instead of Grid, but that creates other problems such as cropping the legend box. Any clues?
