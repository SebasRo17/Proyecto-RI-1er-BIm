I have a live stream of notes and note velocities using `SoundNote` and `SoundVolume`. My problem is that I have no idea how to export the MIDI data in real time to an external synthesizer. Would I just use something like this, for example?               Dynamic[Export["file.mid", Sound[SoundNote[0]]] ]      I haven't tried this yet because even if I did have a dynamic MIDI file, how would I get the third party software, like GarageBand or Logic to recognize the MIDI input stream? Another way to phrase this question would be: how do I make _Mathematica_ into a live-playing software synth and not just produce a static MIDI composition?
