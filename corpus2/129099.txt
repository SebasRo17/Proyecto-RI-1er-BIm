My understanding is that one of the key features of a B-Tree (and a B+Tree) is that it is designed such that the size of its nodes are some multiple of the block size of whatever media the data is stored on. Considering that, in a memory managed language like java/c#, we don't really have access to _how_ , _when_ and _what order_ , data is accessed from the drive... can we still predictably benefit from the major advantage of this data structure?
