I am working on a CNC (computer numerical control) project which cuts shapes into metal with help of laser. Now my problem is once in a while (1-2 times in 20 odd days) the cutting goes wrong or not according to what is set. But this causes loss so the client is not very happy about it. I tried to find out the the cause of it by   1. Including log files    2. Debugging   3. Repeating the same environment. But it wont repeat. A pause and continue operation will again make it to run smoothly without the bug reappearing. How do I tackle this issue? Should I state it as a Hardware Problem?
