Is it possible for _Mathematica_ to parametrically find a local minimum of a given function (say of some variable $x$ where $(a,b,c)$ serve as parameters) subject to the constraint that a given symmetric matrix is positive semi- definite? The entries of the matrix are monomials of $(x,a,b,c)$. Namely, the function is: \begin{equation} f(q)=\log\bigg[\frac{(1-q)(1-r^2t^2)(1-x)}{1-q-t^2+qr^2t^2-x+2t\sqrt{qx}-r^2(1-x-t^2+xt^2-xt^4+2t^3\sqrt{qx})}\bigg] \end{equation} (where the logarithm is taken to the base of 2)                      f=Log2[((-1+q)(1-r^2*t^2)(1-x))/(-1+q+t^2-qr^2*t^2+x-2*t*Sqrt[qx]-r^2(-1+t^2+x-t^2*x+t^4*x-2*t^3*Sqrt[q*x]))]      and the matrix is: \begin{equation} S=\left( \begin{array}{cccc} \frac{1}{r^2} & 1 & 1 & t\sqrt{x}\\\ 1 & \frac{1}{t^2} & 1 & \frac{\sqrt{x}}{t}\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 & \sqrt{q} \\\ t\sqrt{x} & \frac{\sqrt{x}}{t} & \sqrt{q} & 1 \end{array} \right). \end{equation}               S={{1/r^2, 1, 1, t Sqrt[x]}, {1, 1/t^2, 1, Sqrt[x]/t},         {1, 1, 1, Sqrt[q]}, {t Sqrt[x], Sqrt[x]/t, Sqrt[q], 1}};      the parameters $(x,r,t)$ are arbitrary value in $(0,1]$, which is also the domain of the variable $q$. Thus I need to find the minimum of $f(q)$ subject to $S\succeq0$ (in the sense of positive semi-definiteness) and $q\geq0$. I have no clue how to do it. I've tried using the `FindMimimum`command but didn't manage to make it work.   If is it indeed possible, it would very much help me to know how to formulate such a command. Thanks!
