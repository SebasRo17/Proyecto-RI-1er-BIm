I was now talking with some people and they told me that if i was intrested in a job in the future for Java programming i should not spend too much time only learning Java SE i should spend time learning Java EE instead.. Now that brought me to some questions.. Java Enterprise Edition why use this ? What can i make with this that i can't make in Java SE?, And what kind of applications is this good for? Is there any good books out there that i can read to learn the Java EE? If i know Java SE well is it easier to learn Java EE ? Thanks! I will keep browsing the web for some anwears for theese questions.. And if i find anything i wil update this question.
