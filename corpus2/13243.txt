At school we learned that $\log_b(x)=\log(x)/\log(b)$, which is implemented in _Mathematica_ as `Log[b, x]`, but the results are different.               Log[8]/Log[2] // N      returns > >     3.  (* Real *) >   while               Log[2, 8]       returns > >     3  (* Integer *) >   If I want to validate the argument of my `hadamardMatrix[]` function as a power of 2:               hadamardMatrix[1] := {{1}}     hadamardMatrix[2] := {{1, 1}, {1, -1}}     hadamardMatrix[n_ /; IntegerQ[Log[2, n]]] :=             KroneckerProduct[hadamardMatrix[2], hadamardMatrix[n/2]]      How can I be sure that any `Log[2, 2`N`]` will always be regarded as integer?
