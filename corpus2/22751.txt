I want a function that works like in the following example: it gets an expression which contains a variable var and evaluate it setting setting var = value. I used `Block` to avoid expr being evaluated if variable var holds a value in the notebook. It seems that my function works correctly - I made also a trace - but I get var inside block coloured red and I think it's a warning from _Mathematica_. Can you explain to me why I obtain it? Is my code wrong? Is there a better way to obtain the desired behavior?               SetAttributes[myFunc, HoldFirst];          myFunc[{expr_, var_}, value_] :=       Block[{var}, expr /. var :> value]      ![picture](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GYvIn.png)
