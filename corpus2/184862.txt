I have run into a corner-case problem with the general guidance of:   * nouns for variables   * verbs for functions Specifically, I have a case where the word is ambiguous - it can be either a verb **_or_** a noun. And in some cases when we're discussing the application, it will be used _both_ ways in the same sentence. My intent is to make sure the program will remain readable to future developers as well as myself when I return to sections of code months later. One of the examples is with a `battery`. A `battery` has a `charge` and you can also `charge()` a battery. I think that having both `Battery.Charge` and `Battery.Charge(value)` will be confusing to future developers. My current solution is to simply pick a different word for one or both of those cases (the variable and the function). My problem with that approach is the `Battery` object's variable and function for `charge` won't align with design discussions involving the `Battery`. **My question is if there is another / better way to handle this conflict in naming convention?** * * * Some additional reading on the subject. None really addressed the particular of my question.   * Meaningful concise method naming guidelines   * Naming conventions for variables   * The selected answer from What naming guidelines do you follow?
