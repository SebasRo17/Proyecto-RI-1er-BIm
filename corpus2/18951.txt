Say I have a series of $n$ complex numbers of the form $A_k e^{(I \ \theta_k x)} $ where $A_k$ is a real number and so is $\theta_k$ and $k$ runs from $1$ to $n$. $x$ is an algebraic symbol. Example I have to calculate:- $ 3e^{5Ix}+10e^{7Ix}+2e^{1Ix}$ Now I need to find the summation of the series. I can do this manually because I know all the phase angles (in terms of x) and the lengths of the complex numbers in space, so I will simply add them up like vectors using the parallelogram law and apply the appropriate formulas to successfully reduce the sum of the series to one number say $R e^{I\ F}$ where R and F will be functions in $x$. How do I calculate this number with Mathematica?
