For my Calc III class, I need to find $T(t), N(t)$, and $B(t)$ for $t=1, 2$, and $-1$, given $r(t)=\\{t,t^2,t^3\\}$. I've got _Mathematica_ , but I've never used it before and I'm not sure how to coerce it into solving this. (My professor told us to use a computer, as it starts getting pretty nasty around $T'(t)$. By hand, $$T(t)=\frac{1}{ \sqrt{(1+4t^2+9t^4})}\\{1,2t,3t^2\\}$$ I've tried defining `r` as stated above and using `D`,`Norm`, and `CrossProduct`. However, I get a bunch of `Abs` in my outputs (am I missing an assumption?). Additionally, I can't seem to google up how to ask _Mathematica_ to sub in a specific value for $t$, once I get the equations worked out properly.
