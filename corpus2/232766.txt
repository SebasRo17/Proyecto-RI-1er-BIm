I am writing a program that creates backup of directories. Which of the following approach is better for code organization? Create separate class for Backup and Zip logic -               class BackupUtil:         def backup(self):            None          class ZipUtil:         def archive_dir(self):            None      Or use function nesting like this -               class BackupUtil:         def backup(self):             def archive_dir():                 None              None
