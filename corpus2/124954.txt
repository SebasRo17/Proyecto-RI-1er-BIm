What do you call a collection in which each item may be looked up by **one** of multiple keys? A partial, simplified definition in C# might be:               class MyDataStructure<TKey1, TKey2, TValue> {         private List<TValue> _values;         //map keys to indices         private Dictionary<TKey1, int> _keys1;         private Dictionary<TKey2, int> _keys2;              public TValue GetByKey1(TKey1 key) ...         public TValue GetByKey2(TKey2 key) ...     }      There's `MultiKeyMap` in Java, but that seems to lookup items based on a combination of keys, not by **each key individually**. Does what I've described have a well-established name? ### EDIT If there's not an established name, feel free to offer a new one. Or state your preference for one of these:   1. ChoiceKeyDictionary   2. AlternateKeyDictionary   3. DualKeyDictionary
