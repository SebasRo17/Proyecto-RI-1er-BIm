It is very simple in Mathematica to convert a list of lists into a matrix: all you need to do is apply the `//MatrixForm` function to it and voila. Is it possible to do the reverse though? I have a matrix that I want to convert back into a list of lists, so as to manipulate its elements more easily. Is this possible? Is there a '`ListForm`' function that deletes all `MatrixForm`s from the element in question? As an example, here is the `FullForm` for one of my elements: `MatrixForm[List[List[63],List[4,62]]]` Is there a function which would take this as input and return simply `List[List[63],List[4,62]]`? Thank you
