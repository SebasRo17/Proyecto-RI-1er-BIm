I've been wondering about applications that have a set of checkboxes or radio buttons, even collections of form fields in their UI. At this moment I'm handling all the choices separately but of course this becomes a complete mess very quickly. There has to be an established way to deal with this that I don't know of. _If check box a is unchecked then check boxes d through e are enabled_ etc. etc. How should I be approaching this? Not in the UI of course, that's for sure. I would love to hear some insights and best practices as well as potential pitfalls. (BTW: I've tagged this "rules-engine" because I haven't got a clue what to tag this. Please feel free to edit the question, retag and remove this line.)
