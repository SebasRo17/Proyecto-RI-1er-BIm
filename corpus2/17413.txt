In my function it returns a plot of my data, say example, using ListLinePlot, and this is the size I obtain: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nAgS4.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ImAlW.png) but when running a series of simulations inside a Table: Table[tCorrStudentsT[i]=sensStudentsT[sensMat[[i]], mcRun,chrT,hrT,ppT,r] ,{i,10}] the resultant graphs look like these, without manually adjusting each graph after simulation is complete? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Tz129.png) so how can I set it such that the series of graphs will be consistent with my single simulation result plot size?
