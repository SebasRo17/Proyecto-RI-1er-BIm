This is a generic question about class names and ORMs, but for context; I'm working on a Flask web app in Python using SQLalchemy. I'm struggling with naming a new class that will contain the business logic to process reminders. In the database there is a table named "reminders" that contains data I need. The ORM has created a class 'Reminders' to access it. Of course, for the business-logic class, the only good name I can think of is also "Reminders", but as I said, there already is a class with that name in my models. I was thinking this could potentially lead to confusion. My question is; is this still the way to go, two different classes with the same name (but with a different path), or is there a better way/convention to tackle this? PS: There is one limitation on what I can do; the database is legacy and used by other software, so renaming the table would be 'problematic' at best.
