From Wikipedia: > the term endian or endianness refers to the ordering of individually > **addressable** sub-components within a longer data item as stored in > external memory (or, sometimes, as sent on a serial connection). These sub- > components are typically **16- or 32-bit words, 8-bit bytes, or even bits**. I was wondering what "addressable" means? For example, in C, the smallest addressable is a byte/char. How can a bit be addressable? Thanks and regards!
