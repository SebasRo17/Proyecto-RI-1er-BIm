I am the only front-end developer in a team composed for 3 .Net devs, 1 QA and 1 PM. Although we have another team from another office halfway around the world, to whom would i do code review with?   * me + front end developer from another office.   * me + one of the .net developers in local office.   * other choices/course of action to take? this in assumption that:   * .net developers have minimal experience in css and table-based layouts and as well as javascript;   * me and the ui dev's time difference is that im 8 hours ahead of him.   * sometimes most front-end and backend's mind doesnt jive.
