I have a function (using `SetDelayed`) that currently returns 3 values in a list. Later on I use the result of this list along with `[[1]]`, `[[2]]`, and `[[3]]` to use the values. Is there a way I can give each value a "name" of some sort, and return only one value in such a way that all these values can be accessed by name? (Coming from an object-oriented programming perspective, I just want to return a single object with a few fields/accessors.)
