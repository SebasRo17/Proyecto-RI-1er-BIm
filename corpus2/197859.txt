I'm preparing a presentation about Agile methodology for managers (not programmers) and I'm looking that, from a side, the Agile talks about **functional perspective*^ (in Scrum we have _planning game_ ) but, from other side, it lacks any (standard) definition of **functional measure**. In my opinion it's strange: how I can give a magnitude of effort by functional needs of user if Agile methodology doesn't use a formal/univocal definition of **functional needs** and doesn't adopt any formal functional measurement (Function Point, COSMIC). If you have played to _planning game_ or _User Story_ , what was your measure unit? Have you used the FP or COSMIC?
