I am trying to create a `Table` where the iterator has two ranges with different iteration steps. Let's consider a simple example: I want to find the square of the numbers from 1 to 9 in steps of 1 and from 50 to 90 in steps of 10. I could do it like this:               Table[i^2, {i, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90}}]      This needs a lot of typing though. How can I iterate over two ranges without having to type all the numbers by hand?
