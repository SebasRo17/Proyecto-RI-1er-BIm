I'm in college. I've taken to finding badly coded websites, e-mailing the owners and telling them I can fix it in exchange for Paypal money. I just completed one of these little fixes for a site, and having been previously burned, I'm a little hesitant to e-mail him his corrected code. Specifically I'm using @media queries in CSS to hide ads on certain, mobile sized screens and hiding mobile ads on desktop sized screens. How can I prove to my client that I have his completed work without just handing out my code? We both don't know anything about each other, we've probably sent a total of 6 emails to each other. I really need this 60$, lol
