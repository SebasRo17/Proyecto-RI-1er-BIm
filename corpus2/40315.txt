We had a failure in our software today and after investigating discovered that the failure should have been occurring for weeks, but it waited until this morning to rear its ugly head. Is there an accepted name for such a bug that I can use when referring to it with other programmers? The closest I could find was a Schr√∂dinbug, but I'm don't think it applies, since nobody was inspecting any code. The bug was just lying in wait.
