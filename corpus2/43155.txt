When we do a `StreamPlot`, I want to show the bifurcation when $a = 0$ transitions to $a >0$, but do not see a better way to do this than the following.                   Animate[StreamPlot[{1,-x^4 + 5 a x^2-4 a^2}, {y,-5,5}, {x,-4,4},                             PlotLabel -> Row[{"a = ", a}]], {a,-1,1}]      Is there a better way to show this bifurcation? Maybe an animated gif like this Bifurcation diagrams for multiple equation systems) (this is a system and my example is not a system)? **Update** To be more clear, the original system is $$x'(y) = -(x(y))^4 + 5a(x(y))^2 - 4a^2$$
