Where I work, we use an in-house ETL solution that's homegrown and has been around for 5-10 years. I'm still new to my data analysis job, but I was wondering about the ETL tools that are out there. This is a new area for me. My situation, and job, is basically   * digging in a set of databases (DB2, SQL2005, Citrix, Ancient Cobol Database with a SQL Wrapper on top, MySQL, etc).   * Gather the desired information.   * combine the different datasets into one set.    * output into a file of choice (CSV, Tab Separated, Pipe Separated, XLS, etc).   * FTP to customer. I guess what my real question is, given my job, what are some good ETL suites that I can look at and compare to my in-house tools? This is more to research some other options. Ultimately, I'd either suggest a new solution or get options/ideas to improve our current app.
