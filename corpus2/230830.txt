We need to support 5 languages for our product. This means that in order to have a potentially shippable product we need to translate all text new to the Sprint to all these languages. It doesn't make sense to me because the text might change after a few Sprints during which the users will use the application and give feedback. So paying the translating company for translating text that will most likely change doesn't seem to be a wise decision. So what do you do with localization in Scrum?
