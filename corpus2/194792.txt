**Question:**   Can a mere entry level programmer become a mid or senior level programmer working in a company as the only programmer without a mentor? **Background:**   I was hired as an entry level programmer for a mid size company that does not do programming except for internally. I am regarded as a genius inside the company with a decent salary but after 2 years I decided I wanted to move to an actual software company. The interview processes have been extremely demoralizing because even though I have wrote intra-company enterprise applications these interviews have made me aware of how little I actually know.
