I work with code, where data is stored/exchanged in Hashtable/Dictionary/Associative-Array-like structures, like this               {        'alpha': None,        'bravo': '',        # 'charlie' is not given     }      there is not much standartization, which field is 'given', and when given, if it may be given as None/Null/Nil or an empty string. As a result, the code is littered with checks like `if hasattr(obj, 'alpha')` and default fallbacks. **Is there a name or slang term for this kind of (imho) anti-pattern?** UPDATE: it seems, currently there is no name, so i'd like to hear suggestions. Currently we have these:   * Incorporeal Horde (credits to psr)
