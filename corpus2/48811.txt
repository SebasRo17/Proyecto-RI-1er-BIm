I want every output expression in a notebook to use `//PowerExpand` and also to format numbers as scientific. Is there a way to do this without explicitly calling `ScientificForm[]` and `//PowerExpand` on every input? i.e. I want to be able to enter               In: 4.3*^-5*Sqrt[M]*(L*n^2)^{3/4}     Out: {0.000043 \Sqrt[M] (L n^2)^(3/4)}      and instead get,               Out: 4.3e-5 M^(1/2} L^(3/4} n^(3/2)      ~~Aside: is there a way to make mathematica ** _never_** use radical symbols, and to use exponents instead?~~
