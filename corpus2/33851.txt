Recently one of our key engineers resigned. This engineer has co-authored a major component of our application. We are not hitting Truck number yet though, but we're getting close :) Before the guy waltzes off, we want to **take actions necessary to recover from this loss as smoothly as possible** and eventually 'grow' the rest of the team to competently cover the parts he authored. _More about the context: the domain the component covers and the code are no rocket science but still a lot of non-trivial stuff. Some team members can already cover a lot of this but those have a lot on their plates._ These are the actions that come to my mind:   1. Improve tests and test coverage - especially for the non-trivial stuff,   2. Update high level documents,   3. Document any 'funny stuff' the code does (we had to do some heavy duct-taping),   4. Add / update code documentation - have everything with 'public' visibility documented. Finally the questions: What do you think are the actions to take in this situation? What have you done in such situations? What did or did not work well for you?
