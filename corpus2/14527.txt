Suppose I wanted to write down a list of $p^2$, for $p$ a prime between $1$ and $20$. I would expect               Table[If[PrimeQ[k], k^2, Sequence[]], {k, 1, 20}]      to work. In fact, this produces,               {Null, 4, 9, Null, 25, Null, 49, Null, Null, Null, 121, Null, 169, Null, Null, Null, 289, Null, 361, Null}      Why does this happen, and is there a variant which does work the way I expect? Of course, I can just do               Map[(#^2) &, Select[Range[20], PrimeQ]]      I don't have a real reason to avoid this, but it feels less readable to me. UPDATE: Given the answers I'm seeing, I should point out that this is meant to be a toy example and the actual code involves boolean functions much messier than `PrimeQ[]`, for which there is no analogue of `Prime[]` available. But Szabolcs answer is exactly what I was looking for, thanks!
