I'm currently building a very small website, around 20 to 30 views, 10 controllers. I know MVC is only a design pattern and should only be the top presentation layer. I'm currently at a stage in development when you start question yourself and what you're doing. It feels like this small website don't 'need' the N-tier architecture because it's too small for that. But in the long run maybe it's worth it. Is it worth the time to migrate to N-Tier? IS there some level of abstraction when you **should** migrate to n-tier? Is there some magic point when the project grows too large? Or should it be done directly in the beginning of the development?
