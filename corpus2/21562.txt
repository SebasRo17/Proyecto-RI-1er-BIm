One problem that I have faced over the years is that when I stop using a technology (COM,QT)/language (VBScript)/feature (Templates) for development over the time I lose skill in that. What in your opinion is the "easiest" way to retain familiarity so that when I come back to any of them, effort for relearning is minimal.
