From a few other questions here, it seems like the suggested route to learn Dvorak is just to do it, and while I have a couple weeks of vacation I'm using, it might be a good time to give it a whirl, so I'm not totally useless at 4 WPM when I go back to work. That said, in a few weeks would I severely damage my QWERTY knowledge or would it still be hanging around? Should I switch back to QWERTY occasionally while learning Dvorak?
