Up until around January 2013, the minor updates of major Java versions were always consecutive: 6u30, 6u31, 6u32, 6u33 and so on. The same is true for Java 7 updates. But, starting around January or February 2013, some minor version numberings were skipped. Take a look here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_7_updates As you can see, the minor updates are 7u10, 7u11, 7u13, 7u15, 7u17, 7u21, 7u25. Where did 7u12, 7u14, 7u16 etc. dissapear ? Was there a specific reason why they were skipped ? If they were actually faulty and couldn't be released, then:   * how come there is no significant uptake in the time-gap between them ?   * how come up until January/February this year this never happened, but is constantly happening ever since ? I tried searching for an answer to this, but couldn't find anything. So I thought someone here might have a clue about this.
