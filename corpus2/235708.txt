I've always wondered what other programmers think about the idea of creating pure aesthetic functions. Say I have a function that processes a chunk of data: `Function ProcessBigData`. Say I need several process steps, only valid for that data: `Step1`, `Step2`, `Step3`. The normal aproach I see the most in source code is to write comments like so:               Function ProcessBigData:         # Does Step1         Step1..         Step1..              #Does Step2         Step2..         Step2..      What I usually do, but always felt wrong due to the lack of such coding style by fellow peers is:               Function ProcessBigData:         Function Step1:             Step1..             Step1..              Function Step2:             Step2..             Step2..              Step1() -> Step2()      I am mainly concerned if there any drawbacks for such style in **Javascript** and **Python** Are there any alternatives that I'm not seeing?
