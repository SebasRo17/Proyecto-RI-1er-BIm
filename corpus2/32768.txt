I'm doing a slideshow for an informative conference, so I need a slideshow running in background on some monitors. My question is: is there any way to make _Mathematica_ to cycle slides automatically? `Manipulate`, `Animate` and `SlideView` have the "Play" button by which one can set the speed. I'd need something similar for the slideshow. Any idea is welcome, also those which require the editing of notebook code.
