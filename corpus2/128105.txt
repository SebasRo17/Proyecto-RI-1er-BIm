I have been doing some research on developing on the Android platform and found that the only way to develop an app using C++ is using the NDK. I also came to know that the NDK has limited support to C/C++, with C++ having even lesser support than C. Here's the problem. I need to develop using C++ as I'm not very familiar with Java. In fact, not familiar at all. I'm still 18, so I don't have much experience with many programming languages. After doing some more research I have found a non-official NDK, called the NDK-CrystaX that implements more support for C/C++ than the official NDK. Before I start using I have to know if it would be legal to use this custom NDK in an Android app and still be able to sell it on the Android Marketplace. Is it? Or is it not? Another solution would be if the newer releases of the NDK had full support for C/C++. But I'm not sure of that either, so I'm seeking your generosity again and asking you to share your knowledge on this too.
