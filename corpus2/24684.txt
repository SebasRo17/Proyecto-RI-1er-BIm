Jens NÃ¶ckel has write functions about (List) Contour Plots with rasterized shading in Mathematica: http://pages.uoregon.edu/noeckel/computernotes/Mathematica/rasterContourPlot.html It works well. But in Mathematica 9 it can not work with PlotLegends. How to modify? I can use Grid to combine a result of rasterListContourPlot with a legend, but this lost the link of the graphic with the legend.               rasgrap = rasterListContourPlot[RandomReal[1, {10, 10}], InterpolationOrder -> 3]     mylegend = BarLegend["LakeColors"];          Grid[{{rasgrap, mylegend}}]      rasterListContourPlot can be found in the above link.
