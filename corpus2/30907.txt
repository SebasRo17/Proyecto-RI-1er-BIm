I am using a Mathematica function which returns some error term in symbolic form. I needed a way to determine if this term starts with a minus sign or not. _There will be only one term_ This is to avoid having to worry about Mathematica auto arranging terms like `x-h` to become `-h+x` and hence it is not fair to ask for more than one term solution. Here are some examples of the expressions, all in input form               negativeTruetests = {(-(71/12))*h^2*Derivative[4][f],     (-1)*h^2*Derivative[10][f],     (-(359/3))*h^2*Derivative[10][f], -2*h, -x*h^-2, -1/h*x }          negativeFalseTests = { h^2*Derivative[4][f] , h^2*Derivative[4][f],     33*h^2*Derivative[4][f], h^-2, 1/h}      I need a pattern to check if the expression starts with minus sign or not. ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5GB80.png)
