I'm starting to use continuous integration for one of my projects and had some questions about structure and architecture. It's basically a multi-device webservice that is split into one server repository and multiple device-specific client repositories. My question is the following:   * Since clients are dependant on the server to run their tests, does it make sense to split them into another repository ? I did some builds with Travis CI as examples and it worked great but now that I want to add tests, it's raises the issue of being dependent on the server project. Server that itself also has it's own build and tests. From a project architecture side it makes sense to split server and client repositories but I have troubles looking at the big picture and the CI server integration.
