Are there currently any best practices for community-built open source projects? First, this is not a criticism only an observation: open source code comes with nearly no commenting. There's an open source project that I want to debug, but the lack of commenting intimidates me into setting aside less time since I'll have to spend hours catching up. In my novice opinion, it seems that development times would drop if the new programmer to contribute could easily go back and see how everything works on arrival. I understand that this probably isn't done now because everyone's working for free and have lives & bills, so I would never dare criticize someone working for "me" as an open source user for free. I'm just saying it might be simply overlooked in the haste to put out code, and it may be surprisingly more efficient to put out less code but more comments. I am a novice and have no way to confirm this. Please inform me if I am wrong. I've also found this, which seems to be a great outline for when one controls the program oneself, but I wonder if there might be anything missing for an open source project with disparate contributors. Is there a standard for community-built open source projects? If so, where?
