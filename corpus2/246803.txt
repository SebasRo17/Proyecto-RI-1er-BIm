I know that when we speak about an array having 1, 2, or 4 dimensions, we mean arrays like this:               1: [0]     2: [0,0]     3: [0,0,0]     4: [0,0,0,0]     ...      Is the first 'axis' of an array the only thing that defines its dimensionality? Can an array with 4 dimensions be represented these ways?               [0, [0,0,0]]     [[0,0], [0,0]]      or does this fall under some other definition of dimensionality? Another option is that a 4-dimensional array would be of the form               [ [[ [0,..],[0,..] ], [ [0,..],[0,..] ]], [[ [0,..],[0,..] ], [ [0,..],[0,..] ]], [[ [0,..],[0,..] ], [ [0,..],[0,..] ]], [[ [0,..],[0,..] ], [ [0,..],[0,..] ]] ]      e.g.               [        [         [ [0,..],[0,..] ],          [ [0,..],[0,..] ]       ],        [         [ [0,..],[0,..] ],          [ [0,..],[0,..] ]       ],        [         [ [0,..],[0,..] ],          [ [0,..],[0,..] ]       ],        [         [ [0,..],[0,..] ],          [ [0,..],[0,..] ]       ]     ]      Is this just a nomenclature nuance that I'm bringing up? Is this definition relative to the field in which we are discussing (computation vs. physical systems)? * * * _(the thoughtscame from this question.)_
