Can a software program licensed GPL (version 2) rely upon libraries licensed under APLv2 without running afoul of the GPL? The language here suggests to me perhaps not. In my specific case I'm looking at a daemon that uses some APLv2-licensed external libraries. **UPDATE** (In response to answers/comments.)   1. For the purpose of this question, I cannot relicense the main program (the daemon)   2. The main program has been extended with functionality that uses `apr-util` and perhaps other APLv2 components My question is, can I release the extended daemon under the GPLv2, or is this something I need to keep to myself (no distribution) and/or re-implement without APLv2 if I am committed to **(a)** releasing this extension, and, **(b)** keeping the daemon GPL'd?
