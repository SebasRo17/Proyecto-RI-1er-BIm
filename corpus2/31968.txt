I'm trying to figure out how to transfer the concept of a priority queue to the functional world. Searches have turned up some implementations that use Append and other expense list copying techniques. I'm guessing there is a better way. An example of what I am trying to solve is consider the products of all pairs of N digit numbers in descending value order. For small N I can do something like...               Reverse[         Cases[             SortBy[                 Flatten[                     Table[{i, j, i*j}, {i, 1, 9}, {j, 1, 9}],                 1],              Last[#] &],          {i_, j_, k_} /; i <= j]     ]      Alternative solutions to the problem in particular are welcomed, but I am really looking for a generic answer of how to apply the priority queue concept to the functional world.
