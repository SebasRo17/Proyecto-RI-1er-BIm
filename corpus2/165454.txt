I am a Database/ BI person with 5+ years of experience (SQL Server and Oracle). I would really love to work for a startup, but from the feeling I get from seeing the job postings, most startups are not looking for people other than developers for their IT team. Do startups even look for other IT people other than developers? And if so, how can I connect with ones that are looking for DB persons?
