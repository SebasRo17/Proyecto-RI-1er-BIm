I'm wondering how I can solve a system of ODE that has a interpolating function? For example, `z` and `y` are `InterpolatingFunction`s generated by prior `NDSolve` commands. Now I need to solve a second ODE system:               {x2'[t] == -k1*x2[t]*y[t]/h2[t] + k2*z[t],      h2'[t] == -3*(-k1*x2[t]*y[t]/h2[t] + k2*z[t]),      x2[0] == 0, h2[0] == 1}      where `k1` and `k2` are constants.
