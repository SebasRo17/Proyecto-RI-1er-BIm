I wish to numerically solve the following PDE. Although there are some complete discussions for solving PDEs in tutorial/NDSolvePDE, there is no hint for the nonlinear case by discretization. Thus, I will be thankful to receive some helps on the following NPDE where $x \in [0,1]$, $t \in [0,2]$, The equation is $$\frac{\partial u(x,t)}{\partial t}+u(x,t) \frac{\partial u(x,t)}{\partial x}=c \frac{\partial ^2u(x,t)}{\partial x^2}$$ with initial condition $$u(x,0)=\frac{2 \pi \beta c \sin (\pi x)}{\alpha +\beta \cos (\pi x)}$$ and boundary conditions $$u(0,t)=u(1,t)=0$$ I tried the backward finite difference (FD) for $\frac{\partial u(x,t)}{\partial t}$ and the central FD for the others. I wrote the following code, but I think there are some gaps in it. Because, the approximate solutions do not match the exact one $$u(x,t)=\frac{2 \pi \beta c e^{-c \pi ^2 t} \sin (\pi x)}{\alpha +\beta e^{-c \pi ^2 t} \cos (\pi x)}$$ Note that `Subscript[w, i, j]` stands for the approximation in the grid point $(x_i,t_j)$.               M = 8; NN = 8; m = M - 1;      n = NN - 1; alpha = 5.;      beta = 4.; c = 0.05;      T = 2.; h = (1. - 0.)/M;      k =T/NN;          (*Defining the Grid points*)     Table[Subscript[x, i] = 0 + i h, {i, 0, M}];      Table[Subscript[t, j] = 0 + j k, {j, 0, NN}];          (*Defining the Initial Conditions*)     For[i = 1, i <= m, i++,        Subscript[w, i, 0] = (2. c beta Pi Sin[Pi Subscript[x, i]])                          / (alpha + beta Cos[Pi Subscript[x, i]])     ];          (*Defining the Boundary Conditions*)     For[j = 1, j <= n, j++,        Subscript[w, 0, j] = 0     ];      For[j = 1, j <= n, j++,        Subscript[w, 1, j] = 0     ];          (*Defining the nonlinear equations due to discretization*)     For[i = 1, i <= m, i++,       {        For[j = 1, j <= n, j++,          f[i, j] = Subscript[w, i, j]             + (k/(2 h)) Subscript[w, i, j] (Subscript[w, i + 1, j] - Subscript[w, i - 1, j])             - (c k/(h^2)) (Subscript[w, i + 1, j] - 2 Subscript[w, i, j]                            + Subscript[w, i - 1, j])             - Subscript[w,i, j - 1]        ]       }     ];          F = Flatten[Table[f[i, j], {i, 1, m}, {j, 1, n}]];      Dimensions[F];     F // MatrixForm;     Vec = Flatten[Table[Subscript[w, i, j], {i, 2, M}, {j, 1, n}]];          (*Finding the solutions*)     Sol = Part[NSolve[F, Vec, Reals], 1]      Any suggestion is appreciated. In fact, what would be the final nonlinear system of equations resulting of discretization?
