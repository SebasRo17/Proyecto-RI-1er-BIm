I'm sensing this might be a rookie mistake but normally I roll my own legends but decided to try the built in legends for a `ListPlot3D`. `PlotLegends` is listed as an option for `ListPlot3D` but curiously in V9 there are no usage examples. On the other hand there are several examples for `Plot3D`. Specifically I was trying to create a legend analogous to this example from the `Plot3D` docs.               ListPlot3D[Table[Sin[x y], {y, 0, 3, 0.1}, {x, 0, 3, 0.1}],       ColorFunction -> "Rainbow", PlotLegends -> Automatic]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ur5ot.png) However I want to use my own specific `ColorFunction` but it appears that as soon as you depart from the named built-in string colour functions `PlotLegends` ceases to work. I know how to "roll my own" so I am not seeking assistance with creating my own function. I simply want to know if it is possible to make something similar using the built in options for `ListPlot3D`, whether I am overlooking something or whether this is a bug. **Edit** From Wolfram: _the current design of the PlotLegends -> Automatic option is to turn off the plot legend when a pure function (as`ColorFunction`) is present._ which means that this               With[{cf = Blend[{Blue, White, Red}, #] &,     data = Table[Sin[x y], {y, 0, 3, 0.1}, {x, 0, 3, 0.1}]},         ListPlot3D[data, ColorFunction -> cf,              PlotLegends -> Automatic         ]     ]      doesn't work ...which would appear to make it a design oversight rather than a bug.
