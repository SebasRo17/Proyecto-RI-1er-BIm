I have some projects that are in a very early development state. They are nowhere nearing completion but I do host them (as public repos) on GitHub because:   * I have multiple computers and I want access to my code everywhere   * I want a backup for my code   * I want it to be easy if someone wants to collaborate in some way   * I use GitHub Issues as a poor man's project management software Is it OK to publish a project on GitHub even when it is very early in the development? I am a bit concerned about someone to come by and say `OMG this is total BS, this code is so bad!` while looking at unpolished/still in development/not tested code. What are your practices when you start new public projects? Do you wait until you have something substantial to show or you create a bare repo directly on GitHub and start from there? I used `GitHub` throughout this post but this applies to every code hosting service out there.
