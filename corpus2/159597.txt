Is there a graph/diagram editing tool that can output (or even better also parse) pseudographics, that can be easily inserted into source code comments? Like this:               +---------------+                 |  Some Class   |            +---------------+     |  ----------   |----------->| Another Class |     | @its_attribute|            +---------------+     | @another_attr |           /      +---------------+  --------/             |         /             |        /     +---------------+     |Something Else |     +---------------+
