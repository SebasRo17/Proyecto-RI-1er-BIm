I'm trying to do this integral, which is shown on the Wikipedia page on the Hankel transformation: $$\int_0^{2\pi}\mathrm d\varphi\;e^{\mathrm im\varphi}e^{\mathrm ikr\cos(\varphi)}$$ The answer is supposed to be $$2\pi\mathrm i^m J_m(kr)$$ Mathematica cannot seem to do this integral; it simply gives me the input back:               Integrate[         Exp[I m phi] Exp[I k r Cos[phi]],         {phi, 0, 2 Pi},         Assumptions -> Element[m, Integers]     ]      Why can't this be done? It can do it for explicit values of m = 0 and m = 1, but after that it begins reporting the answer in terms of polynomials times a zero-order Bessel function or something similar. Perhaps I'm expecting too much of the software, but I'd expect it to be able to verify integrals listed on Wikipedia pages. Is there something I'm overlooking?
