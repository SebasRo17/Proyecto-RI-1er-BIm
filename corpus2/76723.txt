I work in Delaware and live in PA. The law in Delaware is clear: My side programming projects are my property and not my employer's, unless I do something on the side that's very similar to the paid work. (See DE code chapter 19 section 805 here: http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/decode/19/8/805). Nevertheless my employer doesn't want to provide me with a piece of paper recognizing my right to my own side projects or even the legitimacy of that DE statute. Still they wanted a list of all my projects before I started, which is perhaps 20 total. Since then I've put out over 10 iOS apps that I wrote in the evenings. What are they up to? What are my options?
