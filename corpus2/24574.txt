I've seen the news yesterday that Java 7 and Java 8 passed but the majority weren't very happy. Can anyone clarify what consequences does this have on Java and the community ? What licenses did Oracle change to be exact? A lot of people think that this might be the end of Java. Should I go ahead with learning Java or should I maybe move to .NET ? I don't have any preference as to one or the other, but I'm a bit concerned now with all this pressure surrounding the Java ecosystem. Since time is important for everyone and time is what I have less have these days I'd like some advices from the community here.
