I am not sure weather it is a proper question to ask out here but it is really bothering for a while. As the official website writes: > The Rails Rumble is a distributed programming competition where teams of one > to four people, from all over the world, have 48 hours to build an > innovative web application, with Ruby on Rails or another Rack-based Ruby > web framework. After the 48 hours are up, a panel of expert judges will pick > the top ten winners. One thing I don't get is how judges make sure that the app was made in the given time constraint. The quality of apps is so magnificent that I am really skeptical that such elegant apps could be made within 48hrs, even if you have planned it straight out on paper.
