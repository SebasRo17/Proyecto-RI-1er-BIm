Following the formal user story style: > As `<user>`, I want `<goal>` so that `<benefit>`. Our team has found difficulties in expressing things where there is a desire by the system's owners to do something which negatively affects the user. As an arbitrary example, let's say owner wants to have the system charge customers every time they check their email. Following the formal style of user stories, you might write this as follows: > As a customer, I want to be charged every time I check my email so that the > system owner can increase their revenue. Obviously the customer has no desire to be charged; the story becomes jarring to read and the language is getting in the way of the facts. How could the requirement be written differently?
