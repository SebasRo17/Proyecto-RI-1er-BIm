I have a list called `cant` with some amounts of samples to take from the list `community` as follows:               cant = {5, 1, 2, 3, 4};     community = {{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, {1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}};       I'm trying to find a better way to do this task:               where = {};     Table[AppendTo[where,       Table[Flatten[{RandomSample[community[[i]], 1], i}], {cant[[         i]]}]];, {i, Length[community]}];      The result is:               where      {{{3, 1}, {2, 1}, {3, 1}, {4, 1}, {4, 1}}, {{1, 2}}, {{3, 3}, {3, 3}}, {{1, 4}, {3, 4}, {1, 4}}, {{4, 5}, {1, 5}, {3, 5}, {1, 5}}}      Because with               where[[1]]     {{3, 1}, {2, 1}, {3, 1}, {4, 1}, {4, 1}}      The 5 samples in the first item (3, 2, 3, 4, and 4) have the index of community 1. I read about Reap and Sow, but really I couldn't understand how to implement this. Any idea of how to make this faster because I'm working with large communities and sampling thousands? I appreciate your help,
