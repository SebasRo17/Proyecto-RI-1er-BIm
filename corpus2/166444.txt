Let's say I have an `assemblyA` that has a method which creates an instance of `assemblyB` and calls its `MethodFoo()`. Now `assemblyB` also creates an instance of `assemblyC` and calls `MethodFoo()`. So no matter if I start with `assemblyB` in the code flow or with `assemlyA`, at the end we are calling that `MethodFoo` of `AssemblyC()`. My question is when I am in the `MethodFoo()` how can I know who has called me? Has it been a call originally from `assemblyA` or was it from `assemlyB`? Is there any design pattern or a good OO way of solving this?
