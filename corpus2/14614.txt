I need to find all the roots of this function. I know it is simple to find by hand, however, I wish to learn how to do it so I can apply it later. The problem is that it only gives me one root.               Distance[t_] := t*(t - 1)*(t - 1.5)^2*(t - 3)     Velocity[t_] := Simplify[Distance'[t]]     FindRoot[Velocity[t], {t, -100, 100}]          {t -> 2.63641}      I can find the minimum and maximum. However, how would I plot them on the same graph as the function without copy and pasting the points manually into a list?
