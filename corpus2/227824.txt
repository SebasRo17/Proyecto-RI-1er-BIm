Proposals for new Python features are collected in documents called PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals). There's a master list at http://www.python.org/dev/peps/ which links to (for example):   * Labeled break and continue http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3136/   * Asynchronous IO support http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3153/   * Remove Backslash Continuation http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3125/ It's great that proposals are published publicly for the community to read. However, how is the community supposed to participate? The pages don't allow comments. It strikes me as weird the Python developers would make proposals public then deliberately exclude the community from discussion. Have I missed something? In particular, I'd like to read other people's comments on http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0453/ and add my own. * * * For comparison, Ruby feature proposals are made as posts to its bug tracker. You can read everyone's comments below, and add your own (after making an account)   * Refinements and nested methods https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/4085   * Frozen string syntax https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/8579   * Exception#cause to carry originating exception along with new one https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/8257 Nodejs feature requests are plain GitHub issues, which is probably the most inclusive. It's very easy to join GitHub and post a comment.   * https://github.com/joyent/node/issues?labels=feature-request
