I have a situation where we on a regular basis need a freshly installed "virgin" Windows installation to do various work in isolation on, and building one from scratch every time in a vmware instance is getting tedious. Perhaps there are cloud offerings providing a service allowing to request one or more Windows instances and after a very short while they were available for logging in through Remote Desktop? After usage they were just recycled without having to pay for a full Windows license every time. Do this exist for a reasonable price? What is your personal experiences with this?
