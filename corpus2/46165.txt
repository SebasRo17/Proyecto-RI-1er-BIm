This question is similar to my other question: How do I randomly select 'k' positions in a list and shuffle their respective elements without effecting the other elements? Imagine first a pack of cards. We randomly draw $k$ cards from the pack, and then sequentially reinsert them 'somewhere' in the deck (between cards or above or below the deck). Now I'd like to do the same thing with list elements using some hypothetical function `pluckReinsert`:                k = 3;      list = {card1, card2, card3, card4, card5, card6, card7, card8, ..., cardN}      pluckReinsert[list,k]           output > {card2, card1, card3, card7, card4, card5, card42, card6, card8, ...}      Here, by chance, we randomly chose to "pluck" the set of cards: `{card2, card7, card42}`. We then, sequentially, placed `card2` on top of card 1 (there were $N+1$ total choices given the $N$ cards in the deck), placed `card7` between `card3` and `card4`, and finally, placed `card42` between `card5` and `card6`. At any of these sequential addition steps, there are were $N+1$ choices for placing the card (i.e. there would be nothing to stop us from an ordering like: `{card42, card2, card1, card3, card4, card5, card6, card8, ..., cardN, card7}`). Is there a clever Mathematica trick to do this in one or two lines?
