For learning and understanding purpose, I currently want to try to make a small relational `DBMS` with simple features like (for now) only sequential reading/writing and **CREATE TABLE** , **INSERT** , **SELECT** , **UPDATE** and **DELETE** management. I am currently on the " _think_ " part of the project and I am stuck on the way to store the read data in memory. First I was thinking of putting them properly on a structure, but the problem is that tables are all different, know the type of each column is not an issue, but I am not sure C provide a way to make fully dynamic structure. My second and current idea is to make a simple `char array` of the required length and just get the data by order with cast. But I am not sure if it is the good way to do that part, so I wanted to ask for your opinion and advices about that. Thanks in advance for your help. * * * nb: I hope my question is enough clear and understandable, I still lack of pratice in english
