I've declared my own probability distribution as follows               dist[a_, b_] := ProbabilityDistribution[Cos[(b x)/2]^2 Sinc[a x]^2, {x, -400, 400}];      When I try to create a random variate using this probability distribution I only get data points in a range (-400, -245).               data = RandomVariate[dist[200, 500], 10^4];     Histogram[data, 200, "ProbabilityDensity"]      ![Histogram of prob. dist.](http://i.stack.imgur.com/suMFe.png) Just to clarify, this isn't an issue with the histogram, when I look at `data` it does only contain numbers in the range seen above.
