N.B. I have bitten the bullet, and I am going through Leonid Shifrin's "Mathematica Programming: An Advanced Introduction." (Which needs no introduction in this forum) One question I have: could one establish that a symbol has a built-in rules, based on DownValues or related functions? For example:               Unprotect[Sin]     Sin[x_Integer] := Sin[N[x]]     Protect[Sin]          Sin[1]     (* 0.841471 *)     DownValues[Sin]     (* HoldPattern[Sin[x_Integer]] :> Sin[N[x]] *)      Hey, where are the built-in rules for Sin?
