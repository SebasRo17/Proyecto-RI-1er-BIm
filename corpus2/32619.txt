How can I quickly convert a number with $n$ decimal points to a number of with $m$ decimal points? `Round` works, however, it is slower than I would like. This example rounds a set of $100$ real numbers to $0.1$ decimal precision:               testvalues = Table[{RandomReal[], RandomReal[]}, {i, 1, 100}]          t1 = AbsoluteTime[];          For[i = 1, i <= 10^5, i++,       Round[testvalues, 0.1];     ];          t2 = AbsoluteTime[];          t2 - t1      Takes $\approx 11.87$ seconds on my 3.47 GHz CPU. `Floor` and `Ceiling` take a commensurate amount of time.
