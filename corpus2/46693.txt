Suppose a camera and the need to measure the speed of a ball such as a tennis ball. Usually, the speed of ball is measured with Doppler effect where the pulse difference reveals the speed. Now I want to measure the speed of the ball from the images with _Mathematica_. You can suppose 1/30 sec shutter speed. > **How would you measure the largest speed of the ball in Mathematica?** **Different Methods** > > **I. Image Difference method** >> >>> Shoot two pictures in 1 second interval. From the difference of images, you get the length travelled. By the $\Delta t$ and $\Delta l$ you get the speed over that range. Simply use _Mathematica_ 's Image Difference here. >> >> **II. Long shutter time method with a glow ball** >> >>> Like in light-painting, use a fire-ball or glow-ball or light-ball. Now get one photo with long shutter time in a black room with only ball glowing. Measure the length of the glow over certain time. Programmatically, the task is to measure the length of the flight path. >> >> **III. Motion blur method** >> >>> A camera experiences a motion blur with a fast ball. An user suggested a motion-blur method but I could not understand it. Perhaps just sharpen and use the method I above. Two test images are here and here where the ball has travelled about 4 meters in 23 frames. >> >> **IV. Some other method to get the speed of ball from images or a video?**
