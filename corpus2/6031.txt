Consider the following snippet from the documentation on LocatorPane                 DynamicModule[{pt = {0, 0}},         LocatorPane[Dynamic[pt], Framed@Graphics[{}, PlotRange -> 10]]]      I would like to use a different shape for the LocatorPane, i.e. parallelogram, hexagon, rectangle ). ( In further processing they are 'translated' to a nice tiling. ) **Question: How can I limit the LocatorPane to a shape other than a square?** **EDIT:** From **kguler** 's Answer 'Locator in a Diamond' I made this so that it works with multiple locators.                  pts = RandomReal[1, {3, 2}];        g = Graphics[{Blue, Polygon[Dynamic[pts]], Opacity[.1], Disk[]},          PlotRange -> 1.25];         LocatorPane[         Dynamic[pts, (If[Apply[And, Map[Norm[#] < 1 &, pts]], pts = #,              pts = pts1]) &], g]      The limiting region is a circle here, but can be changed to any function that returns a Boolean. There is one remaining problem and I think that it is related to the problem I found here: LocatorPane, Dynamic and deleting locators
