I'm really lost here so I hope some can help me. I have to develop a phone application on every platform so i tough of using phonegap. Seems pretty nice. I have a web application coded in classic Asp and it's this webApplication that i need to strip down to be a phone app. At first at thought it will be simple, my classic Asp render some html so phonegap is able to put it as an app. But it's not that simple, because in my asp I have some code that is rendered server side, I've talked to some who tell me that some html could call the asp pages and this html could be used in phonegap. Don't think it's possible ... Well if someone could help me here, maybe i've said wrong thing in my little text dont hesitate to correct me :) My solution (i think) : code some webServices in asp.net that will use the same database as my asp classic web application. And some html and jquery will call the webservices and those html and jquery will go trough phoneGap Well thanks for the help and saying what you think about it ! :) **Simple question : What is the best way to transfer an asp classic web app to a multiplatform phone app ?**
