I'm writing a little package in Mathematica for geology where a particular stone may be approximated as an hemisphere. Anyway this is a rough estimation because a real hemisphere has its height as loong as its radius. Instead, a reservoir stone (for an hydrocarbon) has often a form of a section of an hemisphere, its height is lower than the radius. For example, I can have an hemisphere with radius long 5 km and height of only 3 km and I can plot it like that:               semisfera[x_, y_, raggio_] := Sqrt[raggio^2 - (x - raggio)^2 - (y - raggio)^2];      plotsemisfera = Plot3D[semisfera[x, y, raggioSfera], {x, 0, 2  raggioSfera}, {y, 0, 2  raggioSfera}, PlotRange -> {0, 3}, AxesLabel -> {"lunghezza km" , "larghezza km","profonditÃ  km"}, PlotLabel ->  Style[Framed["Referenced Theorical Hemisphere"], 22, Black]]      and I get the following graphic: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/O5pSO.jpg) you'll agree with me that is a section of ah hemisphere without the top part, won't you? Sometimes it may happen that the height is << radius. In my case, my geology student worked on a stone with radius of 5km and an height of only 0.2 km. If I try to plot this as I've done before, I get a very awful graphic, here: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Zo3eb.jpg) So, I'd just like to know if there is a way to plot a more precise graphic, without all that irregular part at the base of the hemisphere. The centre of the "hemisphere" should be in = <0,0> Maybe it could be something like that: ![enter image description here](http://uploadpie.com/eAVvq) but I really don't understand why for low values of the height the base of the hemisphere is so jagged! How can I plot that? Thank you
