We are required to make a package diagram for our senior project. Since our project uses MVC patter design, we created an MVC class diagram, now, our problem is in creating the package diagrams from our class diagram. Is it possible to have packages with MVC at the same time? so it would be something like this: Package: Account   * Account Model   * Profile Controller   * Registration Controller   * Profile View   * Registration View These are the controller that cannot exists without the Account model, so I included them. Thanks in advance!
