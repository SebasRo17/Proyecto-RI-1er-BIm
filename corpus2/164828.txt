When I was at high school I used visual basic 6 and I think it was pretty good. Then I came to the university and began to use c/c++ java python etc.. I didn't find a reason why people laugh at visual basic, is it because of its syntax? or something else? **UPDATE:** all of you have gave fantastic answers, but tdammers's answer is what I'm wondering at first. Thanks a lot for all your help:)
