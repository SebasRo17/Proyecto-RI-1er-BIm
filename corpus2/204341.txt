When a program doesn't compile, error messages are sometimes esoteric. Often a simple Google search leading to a site like stack exchange solves the problem. Now why can't we automate this? How about a Siri for coding? By Siri, I mean an intelligent personal assistant. Not talking about speech recognition here. I wonder if there is anybody out there (startups/ research labs) building a cool product like this. It will cut down debugging time drastically.
