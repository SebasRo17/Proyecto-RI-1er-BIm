I would like to use `ListPlot` to plot some points. I would like the `PlotMarkers` to be open circles. I can use `PlotMarkers -> Graphics[Circle[]]`, as in the following example, but the circles are too large. Is there a way that I can specify the size of open circles to use in `PlotMarkers`? Thanks for your time.               myData = {{0, 3.0}, {10, 3.1}, {20, 3.2}, {30, 3.0}, {40, 3.0}, {90, 3.0}};          ListPlot[myData, PlotRange -> {{-1, 101}, {2.9, 3.3}}, Joined -> True,       Mesh -> Full, Frame -> True, PlotStyle -> Directive[Red, Thick],        PlotMarkers -> Graphics[{Red, Thick, Circle[]}]]      ![PlotMarkers](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YzEiw.gif)
