Assume we have two projects and one or more teams (one team doing the projects in serial or two teams doing the projects in parallel). If Team A decides that a task is 8 story points and Team B decides that a task on their project is also 8 story points, does that say anything about the relationship between the two tasks? Or is there no relationship between the complexity of the two tasks?
