I've been building some classes and functions in a static library which has the familiar printing of text messages to `stdout`:               cout << "Hello World!" << endl;      I've been developing this library for use in a console application but I'm considering also trying to make a GUI version, because it will be both useful and highly educational (for me). I wonder how is it possible to make output in a library sent to both `stdout` and GUI controls (like a status bar or a popup window). Since such messages are all sent (in my case anyway) to one destination (cout) could some sort of redirection be possible? I've always presumed something like this may be possible as people often release command line and GUI versions of their programs.
