We recently experienced a deployment issue where it turned out that the version objects were not in sync in one of the environments. We have a large database group and different teams have different responsibilities and ownerships - I might code on schema X, Y, Z but I also will have dependancies on objects owned by other groups. This is the same no matter what technology - java libraries having different versions and what not. My aim is to have _something_ be in a webpage or a database table or something that I can see that for object A I have version X installed in Production, X + 1 in UAT and QA, and X + 2 installed in DEV. How do other folks handle this? How do you pick up version changes? Do you rely on SCM? Build numbers? Hash value of the source code? I'm interested in managing version consistency across technologies - java to db for instance.
