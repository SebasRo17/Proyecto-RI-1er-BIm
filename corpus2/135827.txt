The "GPL How to" has the following to say about applying copyright notices of code copied from other programs: > If you have copied code from other programs covered by the same license, > copy their copyright notices too. Put all the copyright notices together, > right near the top of each file. I did a _total_ refactoring of a C# library, which itself was a port from Visual Basic (VB) code. The original VB code is currently released under the Microsoft Public License (Ms-PL), but originally under GPL. The C# library is GPL, continuing work on the older VB library. Basically I only used the same 'technique' they used. I don't care making the library GPL, so that's not the issue. (From this answer I gather my library might be considered a derivative work.) I do however find it cumbersome having to copy the previous copyright notices in every source file. I would rather only reference them in the README file. This question discusses the need to add notices to _every_ source file, but there's no consensus between the answers. Therefore I'd like to add the license to every file as a safety measure. Do I have to include copyright notices **of the projects on which my library was based** in all source files as well?
