I tried many different approaches, but I could not solve the following problems, I appreciate your help: What is the best way to read many data files? I mean we have `file1.dat, file2.dat, file3.dat …`. and I would like to put them in a loop and by using the readlist, import the data, something like what we do in C and `sprintf` or in bash scripting. I have seen that there is a package which can handle `sprintf` functionality in Mathematica, but I am looking for simpler solution something like this: (I just used `$` sign to show what I mean, like bash)               Do[d$i = ReadList["/path/file$i.dat", Number, RecordLists -> True], {i, 1, 5}]      Can I create a variable like `d$i` inside the above loop over i? which creates `d1, d2, …`, and so on, after running the loop? How can I remove the curly braces from `Mean` output? I have a single list and the Flatten does not remove the curly braces.               tt = {1, 2, 3, 4, ...}      Flatten[Mean[tt]] = {1234.1234}
