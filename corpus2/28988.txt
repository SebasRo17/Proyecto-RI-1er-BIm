It showing the following Window, Once I run the `SystemOpen[path]`. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/JVtfm.jpg) I click on `Run` button.after it's not showing anything. for my conformation, Manually I double click on `.exe` file. it's working fine. but `SystemOpen[]` was not working. case 2: I created `.bat` file with the following code                  cd C:\Users\Infratab Bangalore\Desktop\Rod's        Infratab1-2.exe      Now I open `.bat` file using same function `SystemOpen[]`. here it's working great. How can I fix `case 1` problem. If anybody knows suggest me. Thanks.
