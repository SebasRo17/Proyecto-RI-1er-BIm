I was thinking about the best way to include Mathematica code in a LaTeX document with a nice syntax highlighting. I have tried the packages listings and minted (with pygments), which both claim to include Mathematica syntax highlighting. There is also a separate Mathematica lexer for pygments on github. Having looked at the output from these packages, I'm not entirely happy. I was hoping to obtain a result resembling as closely as possible Mathematica's native syntax highlighting or the highlighting used here on mma.SE (is that halirutan's prettify extension?) My question is: What are users' preferred ways to include Mathematica code in LaTeX files that preserve syntax highlighting?
