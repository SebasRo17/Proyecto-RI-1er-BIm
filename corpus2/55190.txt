I'm using Mathematica v9 and am trying to draw a graph by using it's incidence graph, but it won't draw it, which occurs an error "is not a valid incidence matrix.". But I've checked my matrix, and it's totally fine. I tried three matrices but error comes out every time. Here are my matrices in input forms. $6\times11$ incidence matrix:               ({{1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},       {1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0},       {1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1},       {0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0},       {0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0},       {0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1}})         $9\times12$ incidence matrix:               ({{1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0},       {1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0},       {1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1},       {0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0},       {0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1},       {0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0},       {0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1},       {0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0},       {0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0}})      And here's a screenshot of my codes and their errors. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gKXzt.png) How do I fix this?
