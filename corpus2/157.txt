I am regularly annoyed by the fact, that a neatly arranged `Print` statement gets ruined by a large piece of data, which - instead of linewrapping "in place" - is pushed below the preceding label. See example:               Print[       "test line 1...............: ", {1, 2, 3}, "\n",       "test line 2...............: ",        Pane[Table["testestestestestestestestest", {10}], 800], "\n",       "test line 3...............: ", {1, 2, 3}       ];      which produces the following output: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0sxaS.png) **Question** Is it possible to tell the `Pane` object to wrap its content in a way that does not force the _Table_ to shift to the next line, but is linewrapped in- place (i.e. right next to " _test line 2_ ")? Of course I can specify an explicit width for `Pane`, but since I don't know how big is my screen (user's screen), how large in pixels is the label text (" _test line 2_ "), and many other factors, it just seems useless to give a magic number that should cover all situations. `Full` and `All` does not work either. Any idea?
