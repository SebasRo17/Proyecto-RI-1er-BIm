I just got an copyright infringement notice that says my app infringes on the usage policies of the services my app uses. However, this mail does not come directly from the company that runs the website I pull information from. The mail comes from a company that has some paid apps in the same category on the app store (mine is free), so they obviously want me gone. My question is, can I just ignore this mail until I hear directly from the company that runs the website? Judging from their (the company that contacted me) website, they have no connection what so ever to the company that I fetch information from.
