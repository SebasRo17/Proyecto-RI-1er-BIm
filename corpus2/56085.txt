We have recently moved to a scrum process and are working on tasks and user stories inside of sprints. We would like to do code reviews frequently to make them less daunting. We are thinking that doing them on a user story level but are unsure how to branch our code to account for this. We are using VS and TFS 2010 and we are a team of 6. We currently branch for features but are working on changing to branching for scrum. We do not currently use shelvesets and don't really want to implement if there are other techniques available. How do you recommend we implement code review per user story?
