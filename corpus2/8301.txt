In my experience, software developers tend to wear multiple hats and fill multiple roles with different responsibilities. From not only coding, but sometimes also writing SQL, designing the user-interface, designing the database, graphics manipulation, to even QA testing. **If the primary role is to write software/code, what roles should the developer not take on?** Are there any? The intention of this question is not because a developer is incapable of filling another role-- but having the additional role actually _works against the primary role_ , or should really be a dedicated role of someone who does not primarily program.
