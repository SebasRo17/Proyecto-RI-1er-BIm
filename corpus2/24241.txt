I have some data that I would like to plot as a bubble chart. The data is formatted as {{val1_mean,val1_sd,val2_mean,val2_sd},{val1_mean,......}}. What I would like to do is plot a bubble chart where the x/y location of the bubble is val1_mean,val2_mean and the width/height of the bubble is val1_sd,val2_sd. So far I've been able to do circular bubble charts with the inbuilt function but am a bit lost as to how to make the bubbles ellipses instead of circles. Here's the code I've written so far;               bubleData={{1.88308*10^6, 1024.85, 149446., 6636.62}, {1.98345*10^6, 15022.5,      126966., 7071.75}, {1.94677*10^6, 9281.83, 131930.,      7435.15}, {1.88308*10^6, 1024.85, 127423., 8718.36}};     BubbleChart[bubbleData[[All, 1 ;; 3]],ChartStyle -> Directive[Opacity[0.5]]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/iE8CY.png)
