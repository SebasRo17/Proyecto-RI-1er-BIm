So I got started with a real project of mine on GitHub and things are going pretty well and ideas are flowing a lot faster than I initially thought. In order to keep things organized, I setup some branches so I can develop different features separately. Now when I push my branch to GitHub, I have that section where I have two buttons : `Pull Request` and `Compare` with the name of the branch I recently pushed to. I understand the purpose of the `Compare` button but I don't get why I would want to create a pull request on my own repo. Can someone explain me why I would do that? Is it useful to make pull request on my own repo if I am the only developer?
