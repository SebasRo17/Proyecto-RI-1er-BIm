I have a simple form for the user to sign up to my site; with email, username and password fields. We are now trying to implement an ajax validation so the user doesn't have to post the form to find out if the username is already taken. I can do this either on **keyup** event or on text **blur** event. My question is, _which of these is really the best way to do?_ ## Keyup From the user POV, it would be good if the validation is done as and when they are typing, _(on key up event)_ \- of course, I am waiting for half a second to see if the user stops typing before firing off the request, and user can make any adjustments immediately. But this means I am sending way more requests than if I validated the username on _Blur_ event. ## Blur The number of requests will be much lower when the validation is done on blur event, But this means the user has to actually go away from the textbox, look at the validation result, and if necessary go back to it to make any changes and repeat the whole process until he gets it right. * * * I had a quick look at google, tumblr, twitter and no one actually does username validations on keyup events, (heck, tubmlr waits for the form to be posted) but I can swear I have seen keyup validations in a lot of places too. So, coming back to the question, **will keyup validations be too many for server, is it an unnecessary overhead? or is it worth taking these hits to give user a better experience?** ps: all my regex validations etc are already done on javascript and only when it passes all these other criteria does it send a request to server to check if a username already exists. (And the server is doing a `select count(1) from user where username = ''` \- nothing substantial, but still enough to occupy some resource) pps: I'm on asp.net, MS SQL stack., if that matters.
