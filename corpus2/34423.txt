I need to calculate solution of Bessel-like equation having general form: $\frac{d^2F}{dr^2}+\frac{1}{r}\frac{dF}{dr}+Q(r)F(r)=0$. Problems come from the points near $r=0$ leading to numeric errors. For example, simple Bessel equation can be solved using DSolve:               DSolve[{y''[x] + 1/x y'[x] + y[x] == 0, y[0] == 1, y'[0] == 0}, y[x], x]      with output:               {{y[x] -> BesselJ[0, x]}}      However same equation using NDSolve produces errors:               sol = NDSolve[{y''[x] + 1/x y'[x] + y[x] == 0, y[0] == 1, y'[0] == 0}, y[x], {x, 0, 10}]          Power::infy: Infinite expression 1/0. encountered. >>     Infinity::indet: Indeterminate expression 0. ComplexInfinity encountered. >>     NDSolve::ndnum: Encountered non-numerical value for a derivative at x == 0.`. >>      The question is: how to overcome erros in NDSolve routine and get numeric solution?
