I am a newbie programmer and I recently started learning about exception handling in Java. I know what try, catch and finally blocks do, but I really need to understand how to use them well and where to handle something in the call stack... I have a project right now that involves I/O and all I'm doing is handling the exception in the lowest possible method in the call stack. I'm sure my exception handling can be improved, so I'm asking you guys how you think of exception handling? How did you guys get good at this and how can I better wrap my head around this idea?
