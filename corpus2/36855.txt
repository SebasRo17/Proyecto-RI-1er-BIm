This is what I have done so far. The points are of angles-of-deviation and wavelengths from my physics lab experiment.               V = ListPlot[       {{589.3, 53.50}, {435.8, 56.02}, {535.4, 54.52}, {546.1,          53.57}, {577.0, 53.13}, {690.9, 52.10}, {402.6, 55.72}, {447.2,          55.02}, {492.2, 54.53}, {501.6, 54.83}, {587.6, 53.03}, {667.8,          52.83}, {706.5, 52.05}        }, PlotRange -> {{400, 710}, {50, 60}},        AxesLabel -> { wavelength, deviation}, PlotStyle -> Red,        GridLines -> Automatic]      ![this is what i have done so far. ](http://i.stack.imgur.com/v8Q2y.jpg) I am trying to find the best fit line of these points. I know it is some type of exponential function. But I can not figure out how to do it. Please help me out.
