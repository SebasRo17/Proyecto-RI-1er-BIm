I've read a bit on denotational semantics (DS) and I'm very intrigued about the process of designing computer programs where types and functions have strong and clear mappings to mathematics. Are there any resources that discuss designing programs based on DS in detail? I've seen a few superficial treatments of the subject. I'm conversant in Haskell, Scala, Common Lisp, and a bit of Scheme so any resources that use those languages would be greatly appreciated.
