I am developing a system for mailing which has a account id/password to login and I need to store the smtp server account and password for sending mail. Since the mail is auto send I can't request the user input password/id each time when sending. Therefore, is storing the user account id/password (system b password) in my system (system a) insecure design? How can I improve this?
