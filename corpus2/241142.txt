If I have a class with only only public method. When I use this class, is it good to use unnamed object to invoke its method? normal:               TaxFileParser tax_parser(tax_file_name);     auto content = tax_parser.get_content();      or unnamed object version:               auto content = TaxFileParser(tax_file_name).get_content();      Because I've told that we should avoid temporary as possible. If `tax_parser` object is used only once, can I call it a temporary and try to eliminate it? Any suggestion will be helpful.
