I have been given an online task in which I am supposed to develop a service which is based on some other class/service which has not been implemented yet but I have a rough API for that and the results return by my class would be used by some other class/service I am not sure what would be the best way to return this. I mean shall I have some dummy/mock implementation for the service I am expecting or using in my class and also for the service that would use the result returned by my class or is it Ok to just develop my part and assume things based on the rough API spec. For example : I am in Team C and have to implement CService service. My class will call Team A's AService service (this is not implemented yet but I have a rough spec for this) and the results returned by my class would be used by Team B's service.
