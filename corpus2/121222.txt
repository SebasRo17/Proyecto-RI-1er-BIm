I am working on site which have a lot of configuration and security settings and I have to check either clients browser is on trusted zone or not using JavaScript. Is it possible to determine whether my web site is being accessed as a trusted site? The reason I'd like to do this is that some functions won't work unless the site is being accessed as a trusted site, and I'd like to be able to warn users. Is there any solution ?
