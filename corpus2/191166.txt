I had legacy code that was originally build for some quite old version of compiler. We are talking about native code, not managed. Now it is ported to almost newest version of the compiler. Every compile error was fixed and now the product is properly compiling and running. But:   * although it compiles and even runs... how can I be sure is is working as expected?    * can I be sure that underlying runtime does not change in a way that it introduces new and unexpected runtime bugs?   * what are best practices when upgrading to newer version of the compiler?
