I hope this wouldn't be closed especially since I think a lot of people can benefit from this question that are in similar positions to mine. I'm been programming for a long time (since I was about 13/14, now I'm 22) and now I'm in that stage in life when I'm thinking whether and what to study. Since I'm programming for a long time I'm pretty certain that I will not pursue a degree in Computer Science/Software Engineering because I think a lot of the material will be about things I already know. Even if it will benefit me, I think I will lose a lot of motivation because I will be bored in class and I will always think to myself that "I'm wasting time" or that "I'm not really gonna use the material that is taught in this class". Science really interests me, especially Physics, but Chemistry/Biology is also interesting to me. and it's also possible to study two together like a BSc in Physics and Chemistry or Chemistry and Biology, which are both offered at the university I want to go to. So the question is, what Science degree can benefit me the most in a career as a programmer? Are there fields that incorporate software engineering and Physics/Chemistry/Biology and that have a lot of demand? or are expected to have a lot of demand? Are there any specific careers that you know of that incorporate software engineering and Physics/Chemistry/Biology? This is not a question of whether to study or not, this is a question of "if I decide to do a Science Degree that isn't Computer Science/Software Engineering, but which will benefit me as a programmer or widen my range of opportunities, which one do you recommend?"
