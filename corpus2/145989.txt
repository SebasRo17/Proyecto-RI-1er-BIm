> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Is there a language that transcompiles to C with a better syntax? There are many language implementations which compile to C. However, most of them have some language specific runtime requirement. For example, Gambit-C and Vala both compile to C. Gambit-C depends upon a garbage collector. Vala depends upon the GObject system. Are there languages which compile to C which have no dependencies beyond standard C libraries such as libc?
