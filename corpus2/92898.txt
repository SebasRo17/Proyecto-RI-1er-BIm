I am a fairly new developer. Professionally I have programed in C# for two years as an intern and 6 months as a junior developer. A friend of my family needs help with a project that is written in VB.net. I have never used VB.net, so I am a little worried there. But, the real question comes in the fact that once I looked at the documents for the project I have a feeling that nothing really good will come from it. I have a feeling that it will cause more stress then I would like to have in my life currently. How do experienced developers make the decision of whether to take the project or just let it go? What are some good metrics to make the decision easier? **Edit** This actually seems like a very large ERP that he would like me to work on and I don't believe that he knows anything about programming so I don't think the fact that I am very junior has even crossed his mind.
