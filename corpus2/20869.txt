Using _Mathematica_ , I need to define a function of one integer variable that generates the same real number in the range 0 to 1, if it is called with the same argument, but gives a different real number if its argument is changed. For example :               Func[1] = 0.12675,     Func[2] = 0.11213,     Func[2] = 0.11213,     Func[1] = 0.12675,     Func[3] = 0.02561,      and so on. How can I define such a function? ### Edit A more precise statement of the pseudo-random nature of the function `Func`. The function should generate new numbers for each _Mathematica_ session. So after thousands of sessions, the values `Func[1]` are uniformly distributed on the intervall 0 to 1. For a given session, `Func[1]` generates the same number again and again. But in the next session, `Func[1]` would be a different number. Otherwise, the generated numbers couldn't be considered as "random" if they are always the same.
