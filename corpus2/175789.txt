So here's the confusion, let's say I declare an array of characters               char name[3] = "Sam";      and then I declare another array but this time using pointers               char * name = "Sam";      What's the difference between the two? I mean they work the same way in a program. Also how does the latter store the size of the stuff that someone puts in it, in this case 3 characters? Also how is it different from               char * name = new char[3];      If those three are different where should they be used I mean in what circumstances?
