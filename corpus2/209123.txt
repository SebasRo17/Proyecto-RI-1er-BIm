I was making a Python program to measure the growth of codereview.SE. My approach was to get the "Site stats" shown on the front page and store them on my hard drive. I plan to do this once every day. So far I have made enough to get the stats and append them to a text file. The python script can be viewed on github. The format I am using is the following               22-08-2013          questions 9073     answers 15326     answered 88     users 26102     visitors/day 7407          22-08-2013          questions 9073     answers 15326     answered 88     users 26102     visitors/day 7407      I just ran the script twice to get the format I would be using in the file. Initially this seemed good to me because I would be storing it myself and the format would be the same so it would be easily parsed but not I am not sure. It seems that using a database should be a better here because that way retrieving data should be easier. Just a note, I have never used any database and have no knowledge of SQL, MySQL or any other variants of RDBMS. So this brings me to the question. When should a database be preferred for storing the data over storing the data in a text file? Are there some pointers that I can look for when making decisions about whether I need a database or simple text files? PS: If better tags can be added please do so. I had some doubts about the tags which could be added.
