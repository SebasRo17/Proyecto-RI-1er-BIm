Java has been one of the most (the most?) popular programming languages till this day, but this also brought controversy as well. A lot of people now like to bash Java simply because "it's slow", or simply because it's not language X, for example. My question isn't related to any of these arguments at all, I simply want to know what you consider a design flaw, or a poor design choice in Java, and how it might be improved from your point of view. Something like this.
