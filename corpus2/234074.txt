I have 3 classes: a JButton extension, FButton; a JTextField; and a JPanel extension, FPanel, that would contain one instance of both. The FButton is supposed to open a file, and make the file name and directory for the file available. The JTextField is meant to display the file name and directory provided by FButton. I figured FPanel should be the one containing the file name and directory. If I make FButton and JTextField private classes of FPanel, problem solved with public variables. How about if I want to separate them into a public FPanel class, a package visible FButton class, and a package visible JTextField class, within the same package? **How can I make the file variables available to all classes in the package?** Should I be doing it that way?
