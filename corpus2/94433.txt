I'm starting a new game website. This is a project to help me learn additional technologies. My background is very much Microsoft and Apple technologies / languages / IDEs. This project I would like to use some Google technologies. The game website will be a simple site; html5 game board; muliplayer; for the sake of simplifying my example let's just say it is a poker game. Everyone sits at the table and the game begins; it is turn based etc. I've been thinking that the best route to go would be html5 w/ websocket communication back to the server. I'm also very interested in using GWT. So I figured a website built using GWT + HTML5 Gameboard would be the client side. Now for the server side; I did some research and I found a bunch of things like Jetty, jWebSockets, Atmosphere; etc. My thinking at the moment is that the server side would be hosted on Jetty (is Atmosphere worth using for server encapsulation?) and would basically be a WebSocket server. Does all this stuff make sense? Am I completely off base here?   Are there examples of this out there to help me along the way? I'm also interested in gaining information about how to host something like this? Any services out there that would host both the socket server and the website on one box? Is this the right thing to do? Anyway definitely looking for experienced knowledge on this topic to help my studies into this new area (google technologies).
