I have worked as a software engineer for more than 6 years. Recently, my boss has asked me to build and manage a virtual team. While I'm glad I can do some management work, I don't think it will be easy to do the management. My team members are only part-time on this project, they come from several teams, and their direct manager is not me. They want to be given technical work but my boss wants us to organize some activities. I'm trying to work out how to balance these two conflicting requirements. Overall, my team manages several parts of an internal BBS which features topics about innovation. Unfortunately, the BBS is not very popular and few colleagues want to spend more than a second on it. They say that they are too busy, but more likely it is an excuse, probably because the BBS is not user- friendly. I don't know why BBS is so important. However, my boss likes the BBS and want my team to make it better. Personally, I don't know why this BBS is so important. Overall, I need some guidance about how to approach this.
