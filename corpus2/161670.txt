I've spent the last year becoming really comfortable with MySQL, but due to its increasing trendiness and my desire to homogenize my web-apps with Heroku, I'd like to start using PostgreSQL for my web apps instead. There are a resources out there for learning PostgreSQL, but I don't really want to have database concepts explained to me from scratch again, and I don't want to have to re-learn all the stuff that's pretty much the same. What are the critical differences that I need to understand - syntactical and conceptual - between MySQL and PostgreSQL that will affect me on a day-to-day basis?
