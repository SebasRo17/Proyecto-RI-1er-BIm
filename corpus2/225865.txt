I am starting to work on a new commercial software project that may use elements of "open source" code. I have been instructed to ensure that I only use code which is licensed for commercial use and although we _may_ decide to make it open source in the future it should be _required_ to be open source. So this clearly prohibits the use of any true copyleft licensed code. But this got me wondering; are there any standard "open source" software licenses that _allow_ commercial use, but _do not_ allow redistribution of source? I have intensionally used quotes around open source as I am aware that any licenses that fit this criteria cannot be compatible with the accepted OSI definition of open source.
