I have started to learn to program. I am interested in it and dont mind how long it takes to learn. But I am using books to start out and I find that there are some things I get and some things I have no idea. I can understand the code when I see an example but I feel completely lost if I were to go out and do something on my own. I have barely any experience: maybe 20 or so hours, which I understand is absolutely nothing.   * When does everything come together?   * What are some best ways to learn that anyone else has found?   * Are there any good projects people have done that have been a great learning experience?
