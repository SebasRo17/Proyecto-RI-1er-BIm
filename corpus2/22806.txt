**Question** Given a set of points in the plane, how can you create a planar graph in the standard graph representation of _Mathematica_ (version 9 or higher), from these points? **Background** A planar graph is a graph embedded in the plane in such a way that the edges intersect at vertices only. This is an example of a planar graph:               g = GridGraph[{3, 3}]      ![GridGraph](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KvH1H.jpg) It is stored in the standard _Mathematica_ representation for graphs. You can also draw a planar graph from a set of points in the plane with `ComputationalGeometry`PlanarGraphPlot`:               Needs["ComputationalGeometry`"]         pts = RandomReal[{0, 10}, {10, 2}]     PlanarGraphPlot[pts]      ![Delaunay triangulation of points](http://i.stack.imgur.com/MWlL2.jpg) However, the output is **not** in the standard representation for graphs.
