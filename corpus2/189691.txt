All of a sudden the need for proper formal documentation has become a thing in our organization. A lot of work I do are enhancements and addition to an existing system. Generally a quick fix or a new method, etc. I am just not sure what kind of diagrams I should/could use for small projects. For instance I am adding a new functionality to an existing system that verifies format of a field and they want proper "Component design description with diagrams" for a simple regex that verifies format of one field. In the past we only did pseudocode and that was enough for such projects as the system is somewhat legacy with very little original documentation.
