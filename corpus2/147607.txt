I have loaded a .RAW file into a 2x2 array in my class. The way I am rendering it works fine but I am struggling to get the camera to move on top of the terrain. The terrain renders from 0,0,0 (x,y,z) as that is where I put my camera. My camera class allows to the "camera" to move through the scene. I want to be able to "walk" on top of the terrain with some basic collision detection (if possible). Any tips on where to go for this or any tips?
