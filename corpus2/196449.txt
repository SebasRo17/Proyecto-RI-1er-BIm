We have a project that keeps recurring. The client expects us to run a website twice a year and this is happened for the last year and a half. I took the last working copy and based our latest website on it. Now, a co-worker has suggested that next time we should start from scratch instead of fighting against legacy code. I have already started refactoring the existing code and so have the other developers who were on the project. The code is cleaner than before and it meets client needs. The refactoring was ongoing while we developed new features. What are some good reasons to advise against starting from scratch?
