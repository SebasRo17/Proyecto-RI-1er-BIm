Recently, I had to create a program to send messages between two winforms executable. I used a tool with simple built-in functionalities to prevent having to figure out all the ins and outs of this vast quantity of protocols that exist. But now, I'm ready to learn more about the internals difference between each of theses protocols. I googled a couple of them but it would be greatly appreciate to have a good reference book that gives me a clean idea of how each protocol works and what are the pros and cons in a couple of context. Here is a list of nice protocols that I found:   * Shared memory    * TCP    * List item   * Named Pipe    * File Mapping    * Mailslots    * MSMQ (Microsoft Queue Solution)    * WCF I know that all of these protocols are not specific to a language, it would be nice if example could be in .net. Thank you very much.
