I would like to plot some functions in a family such as the following set of functions:               Table[(n/(1 - 2 x))^2, {n, 1, 29}]      And this works wonderfully:               Plot[Table[(n/(1 - 2 x))^2, {n, 1, 29}], {x, 0, 1}, PlotRange -> {0, 29^2}]      But now When I try to generalize this things go wrong:               Plot[         Table[               (n/(Numerator[1/2] - Denominator[1/2] x))^2,                {n, 1, 29}         ],          {x, 0, 1},          PlotRange -> {0, 29^2}     ]      This plot does is not what I expected. For some reason this gives me what I would expect to see for:               Table[(n/2(Numerator[1/2] - Denominator[1/2] x))^2      So I decided to see if there was a problem with the table:               t1 = Table[               (n/(Numerator[1/2] - Denominator[1/2] x))^2,                {n, 1, 29}         ];     Plot[t1, {x, 0, 1}, PlotRange -> {0, 29^2}]      Well that gives me what I expect. So it seems to me that for some reason using the Numerator and Denominator functions cause a bug the plotting somehow. Over the years I have learned that often 'bugs' are really just a disconnect between my understanding and how things really work. But I am very confused on why the following produces alternating red and blue lines:               Show[         Plot[             Table[(n/(1 - 2 x))^2, {n, 1, 29}],              {x, 0, 1},              PlotStyle -> Blue         ],          Plot[             Table[(n/(Numerator[1/2] - Denominator[1/2] x))^2, {n, 1, 29}],              {x, 0, 1},              PlotStyle -> Red         ],          PlotRange -> {0, 29^2}     ]      They _should be_ the same plot, or am I missing something? Why would this be different?               t1 = Table[(n/(1 - 2 x))^2, {n, 1, 29}];     t2 = Table[(n/(Numerator[1/2] - Denominator[1/2] x))^2, {n, 1, 29}];     Show[         Plot[t1, {x, 0, 1}, PlotStyle -> Blue],          Plot[t2, {x, 0, 1}, PlotStyle -> Red],          PlotRange -> {0, 29^2}     ]
