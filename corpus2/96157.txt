Having international certificates from giant companies like Microsoft, Cisco, etc. can be a great help to your career. Also if you have a decent amount of experience, you're fine getting a job. How about free, but active membership of W3C? They don't give you certificates. You just become a member, think about recommendations and proposals, participate in decision-making process and that's all. Does W3C membership help future career?
