I know what an "applicative Functor" is, but I've been reading papers recently that refer to other "applicative" things, particularly "purely applicative data structures". The trouble is, I'm not sure precisely what "applicative" means in this context, and Google has so far failed me. I can get a general English (ie useless) definition of "applicative", but as soon as I add "computer science" to the search all I get is definitions of computer science. I have a vague sense that this relates to keeping them pesky effects in their place, but I could use a precise definition. I found this - http://foldoc.org/applicative \- but I'm not sure "applicative language == functional language" really helps.
