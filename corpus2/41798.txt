The following code               BarChart3D[      Map[Labeled[#, Text[Style[#, Black, Opacity[1.], Bold, 20]],          Above] &, {{1, 0, 2}, {0, 0, 2}, {2, 1, 0}, {0, 2, 1}}, {2}],       ChartLayout -> "Grid", BarSpacing -> Large,      ChartElements -> Graphics3D[Cylinder[]],      ChartStyle -> Directive[Opacity[0.3]],       AxesLabel -> {None, None, None},      Ticks -> {None, None, {0, 1, 2}},      ChartLabels -> {Placed[{"O", "E", "R", "N"}, Axis], {"D", "N", "A"}},      ViewPoint -> {1.3`, -2.4`, 2.`}]      Works an place labels near axis. And what's interesting is that as you move the box, i.e. change the ViewPoint, with your mouse, the labels change accordingly. ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5SBcH.png) So, there is something happening at the UI level with that positioning; and I couldn't find an option to place labels that worked for longer text. I need this ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mBlZE.png) to have labels properly placed. The chart labels are:               ....     ChartLabels -> {        Placed[{"Osteo", "Ewing", "Rhabdo", "Neuro"},  Axis],        {"Dele", "Norm", "Ampl"}}     ....      So, how to tell _Mathematica_ to place labels on `Axis` but aligned properly? **Note:** `Placed[...,Axis]` is the default; so I put it above just in case that rings a bell to someone.
