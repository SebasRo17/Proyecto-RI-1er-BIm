I'm a new guy in this company and I've been tasked to research on possible workarounds with the browser behaviors to cater to the demands of our client. A little background; what they want is to display a 'custom' dialog whenever a user would like to navigate away from a page (not the browser default) that has a form, just as how facebook does it. I've found a workaround with the `Back` button in the form of browser states and have it integrated in my local build of the web app. Works like a charm, though I'm not convinced this is good practice. (more of a trick if you ask me) The problem is the `Refresh` event. All my research (here's one) tells me I should give up. Sigh... So I'm looking for a way to convince my superiors that this it's a bad practice to override browser behaviors or how it's virtually impossible to override the refresh behavior; diplomatically as much as possible. (if I could do citations on articles that would further prove my point, that would be great) Or do I continue looking for possible workarounds in the internet? (too much research effort but not much accomplishment if you ask me, but hey, what do I know?)
