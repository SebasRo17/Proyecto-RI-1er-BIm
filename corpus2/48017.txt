I'm trying to graph a series of planes as a solid object in _Mathematica_. I first tried to use the `Plot3D` options as well as the fill options to plot a $3D$ volume, but was unable to find a working result. The graphics I'm trying to create will show the deviation between the $z$ axis and the radius from the origin of a $3D$ cuboid. The current equation I'm using is this:               Plot3D[Evaluate[{ Sqrt[(C[1])^2 + x^2 + y^2]} /. C[1] -> Range[6378100, 6379120]],               {x, -1000000, 1000000}, {y, -1000000, 1000000}, AxesLabel -> Automatic]      Where `C1` was the original $z$-value at each plane and the result of this equation is $\; z+(r-z)\;$ for any point on the $(x,y)$-plane. Output for more manageable range looks as follows ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/svwNk.jpg) However this method is incredibly inefficient. Because this will be used to model large objects with an original $z$-values of $>6,000,000$ and heights above $1000$, _Mathematica_ is unable to graph thousands of planes and represent them in a responsive method. Additionally, because the `Range` of `C1` only includes integer values, there is discontinuity between these planes. Is there a way to rewrite this using different _Mathematica_ functionality that will generate a $3D$-plot that is both a reasonable load on my system and is a smooth object? 2nd, What can I do to improve my perforamance? when computing the above input for $>30$min, _Mathematica_ was only utilizing about $30$% _CPU_ and $4$_GB_ of ram with a light load on my graphics card as well. This is only about twice as much as Chrome is using right now on my system. I attempted to enable _CUDALink_ , but it wouldn't enable properly. Would this offer a performance boost for this type of processing? For a reference, my system build is: $16$_GB Ram Intel i7 4770K_ running at stock settings _Nvidia GeForce 760GTX 256 Samsung SSD_ I'm running _Mathematica 9_.
