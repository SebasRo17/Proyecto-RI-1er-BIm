Here is a simple example that illustrates the problem I am having For short time periods it works fine:                   func := (Pause[1]; Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 5}]);         DynamicModule[{result = Null},  Column[{Button["Press", result = func], Dynamic[result]}]]      But if I change the pause to be 10 seconds it doesn't show the plot                   func := (Pause[10]; Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 5}]);         DynamicModule[{result = Null},  Column[{Button["Press", result = func], Dynamic[result]}]]
