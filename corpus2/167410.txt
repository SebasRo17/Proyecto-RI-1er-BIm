I'm working on an application that creates HTML log files. I'm tired of having to manually reload and scroll to the bottom in the browser to see the latest entries. A solution that does not really satisfy me is using the Firefox plugins ReloadEvery and ScrollyFox. In many situations reloading frequency and scrolling speed are just to slow. Of course I could actually use tail, but I would prefer a rendered HTML page. Do you have any suggestions? Firefox extensions are preferred, but any other tip is appreciated, too.
