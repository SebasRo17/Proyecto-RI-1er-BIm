Normally, `LocatorPane` detects any single click as in the following example:                   DynamicModule[{pt = {1, 1}/2},           {LocatorPane[Dynamic[pt], Graphics[{Gray, Disk[]}]], Dynamic[pt]}]      My goal is to redefine the behaviour of `LocatorPane` to detect only double clicks (i.e., the value of `pt` is returned only when the user double-clicks in the `LocatorPane`) I tried the following definition, but with no success!               doubleclickPane[pt_, back_, opts : OptionsPattern[]] :=        DynamicModule[{ptt = pt},         Deploy @ EventHandler[           LocatorPane[Dynamic@ptt, back, ,Evaluate[FilterRules[{opts}, Options[LocatorPane]]]],           {"MouseDown" :> (             ptt = MousePosition["Graphics"];              If[Mod[CurrentValue["MouseClickCount"], 2] == 0, pt = MousePosition["Graphics"]]           )}         ]       ]
