I have a buddy who's expanding/overhauling a modestly successful web-based game that he runs. He's not exactly a newbie with the language it's written in, PHP -- he's been doing this for years. But he IS a novice when it comes to general software development principles. This is a one-man operation (so he doesn't have any superiors/co-workers to bounce ideas off of), and he's never had formal training or a day job as a developer. He'd like the overhaul to be more modular and use concepts like object- oriented programming (both to make the code base easier to maintain and because that stuff sounds really cool), but he's having some trouble with the basic concepts and how to apply them to his project. I'd like to help, but there's only so much one veteran nerd can do in his free time. What's the best on-line resource for something like this, a place where he could go to ask a lot of questions and get patient answers? StackOverflow.com is obviously not the best fit; he'll be asking a lot of questions that are, to a veteran, 101-level stuff, and having your questions closed/deleted as redundant/off-topic/not-a-real-question is discouraging as hell. If this guy was your friend, where would you send him?
