I don't fully understand reactive extensions, but my inital reading caused me think about the ETL code I have. Right now its basically a workflow to to perform various operations in a certain sequence based on conditions it find as it progresses. I can also imagine an event driven way such that only a small amount of imperative logic causes a chain reaction to occur. Of course I don't need a new type of programming model to make an event driven collaboration like that. Just the same I am wondering if ETL is a good fit for potentially exploring Rx further. Is my connection in a valid direction even? If not, could you briefly correct the error in my logic?
