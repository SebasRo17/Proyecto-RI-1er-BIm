This should be an easy question for anyone familiar with 3D animations. I have a 2D shape denoted by the equation                      ((x-1)^2+y^2) ((x+1)^2+y^2)==1      and I want to illustrate its relation to a Horn Torus. To do this, I would like to rotate it about the $z$-axis in 3-space and have an outline of the shape be created behind it. I appreciate any help you guys can give me.
