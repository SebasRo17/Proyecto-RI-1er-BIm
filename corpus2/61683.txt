I searched for a standard format for using a date/time as part of a file name and was unable to come up with anything. My question is two parts: **Is using time stamps ~~to enforce unique~~ in file names a poor practice?** I could get the time from the creation date and serialize the file names (file0001.bak, file0002.bak, etc) but just including the time stamp lets perform file operations such as `mv 2011-01* somewhere/`. Is there a downside to using this type of naming system? The format I am using is `YYYY-mm-dd_HH-MM-SS`. **Is there a better format I should be using?** With this format should i be concerned with file system compatibility, str_to_date_parsing concerns, etc? Thanks! edit: I might have wanted to leave out the **enforce** uniqueness bit since it's a single user generating backup using a cronjob (there shouldn't be any concurrency problems).
