When I plotted an undefined function, Mathematica also spends considerable time to process it. It returns a blank figure necessarily. What confuses me is where the `Plot` spends the time. For example, assuming that I forgeted to define the function `f`, I execute the code below. After a moment, I will get a blank graphics.               Plot3D[Im@f[1/4, u + I v], {u, -2, 2}, {v, -2, 2}, Mesh -> None,              PlotStyle -> Directive[Opacity[0.7], Orange], ImageSize -> Large, PlotPoints -> 50]      During this moment, what happened to Mathematica?
