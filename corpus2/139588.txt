I recently did a little "tool roundup": If I were to program a website in Scala and Coffeescript, what frameworks would I go for? I came across this great presentation: http://www.slideshare.net/mraible/html5-with-play-scala-coffeescript-and-jade- devoxx-2011 The only problem is that I couldn't find a complete version with commentary. Thus I'm left wondering: Why would anyone combine Scalate and Jade ? The presentation is very inspiring and refers to a lot of interesting resources. Nevertheless there's little information how they get along. I always thought both Jade and Scalate were essentially a way to dynamically generate HTML5 and in fact shared the same "territory". my question: What are the benefits of using both Scalate and Jade ?
