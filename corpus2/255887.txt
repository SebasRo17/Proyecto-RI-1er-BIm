In the Cambridge University Computer Science curriculum booklet of 2012-13 under the module entitled 'Foundations of Computer Science' it states: > The main aim of this course is to present the basic principles of > programming. As the introductory course of the Computer Science Tripos, it > caters for students from all backgrounds. To those who have had no > programming experience, it will be comprehensible; to those experienced in > languages such as C, it will attempt to correct any bad habits that they > have learnt. They seem pretty sure that one who has learned a little C, has formed 'bad habits' in the process. I wish to learn C for I am interested in reading and writing Kernel source code. How do I learn C without forming 'bad habits'?
