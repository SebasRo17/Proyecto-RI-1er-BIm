I want to Find the fourier transform of this graph. {ListLinePlot[hari, PlotRange -> {{0, 200000}, {-1.5, 1.8}}]} ![I want to Find the fourier transform of this](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IFKFx.jpg) And when I Put: ListLinePlot[Abs[Fourier[hari][[2 ;; 100]]], PlotRange -> All, DataRange -> {2, 100}] The result show me this. ![I don't know what i am doing wrong here.](http://i.stack.imgur.com/txqfV.png) And i don't know what i am doing wrong here.
