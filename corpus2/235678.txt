I'm currently working on a big vb6 project and since I'm not the leader of the team (we're just 2) but I'll be in the near future I've started wondering about improving the code and the data structure. There are 5 poorly coded projects with a total of 60-70 forms. The code is really bad, I've tried to improve it with the use of functions to avoid repetitions but it's still awful. It would take me a lifetime to just describe all the stuff that are wrong. The database is even worse, there are 5 .mdb (access 2003) badly designed, the person who created them doesn't know what normalization is and so Index are random, no relationship between table (some table that should be related are on different Dbs...) and so on. I feel bad for users that use this thing and whenever they type in something wrong they need to relaunch the application because there is no control on errors. Beside that it's slow as hell (DBs are on a local server, the apps are local). Where should I start? I was thinking about getting rid of Access, but what's the point if the structure has been conceived so badly?
