Say I have the following:               dataList = {{"One", 1}, {"Two", 2}};     PieChart[         #[[2]] & /@ dataList,         ChartLabels -> #[[1]] & /@ dataList,         PlotLabel -> "Test plot"     ]      But while the pie chart is displayed with the correct distribution, the chart labels are not displayed. This is because the output of               #[[2]] & /@ dataList      is               {One, Two}      not               {"One", "Two"}      I have also tried the following:               ChartLabels -> ToString[#[[1]]] & /@ dataList      but the outcome is the same as before. Thanks in advance for your help.
