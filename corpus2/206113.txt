I can write PHP application in linux platform.   However, I getting a request to explore the idea to run PHP application into .NET. I have zero .NET knowledge.   So wondering, is it possible? Is it advisable? Implication ? Or maybe I should just install a .NET to playaround first? In short, zero code changes, except setup the PHP environment in .net. Also, wondering, will this benefits from .net security? The reason why I explore this idea is because Singapore government website must run on .NET (and I intend to save few bucks by not hiring dot net developers). I think the idea of application must run on .NET is absurd (a joke to me), just showing one of the "world-class" standard in Singapore :)
