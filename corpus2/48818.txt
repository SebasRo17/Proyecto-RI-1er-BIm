I am not very familiar with mathematica but I know the basics so I thought I give it a try. For a project I have to animate rectangles moving around in 2D (later also 3D). The data come from a C simulation I wrote so I can change the output as I want, but for now I have **N** files each looking like this:               t       x-coordinate      y-coordinate     length     1           1                 3              10     2           5                 3              10     3           10                3              10     ...         ...               ...            ...      the thickness of the rectangles should be const over time. How would you approach this? I found the help on importing data and making animations rather confusing so far. Please help me.
