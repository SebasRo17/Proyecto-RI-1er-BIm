When we are in console mode or working with a notebook we can get brief help about a function just by shift-entering `?function` I would like to have a list like the following               {Map, Function, List, Transpose, Outer, Sequence, Apply, Tuples, \     Distribute, Thread, Equal, Fold, Slot, Reverse, Plus, Times, Total, \     MapThread, Inner, ReplaceAll, Rule, Composition, Through, Nest, \     ToExpression, ToString, Row, Part, Range, ComposeList, Compose, \     SlotSequence, Flatten, FoldList, NestList, Hold, Release}      and get a list of strings containing the corresponding help(s). `?` cannot be mapped to a list of course so i am trying to find another way. `?` works with Wildcards like `?*Plot*` so i suppose it accepts some kind of pattern matching. Any ideas ?
