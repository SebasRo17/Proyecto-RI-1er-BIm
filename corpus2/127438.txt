I'm doing some general research for a potential SaaS project. The solution we are considering creating will need data integration capabilities with various enterprise systems. I understand that SaaS adds complexity to enterprise integration since it lives in the cloud and outside of the firewall. I've read a few articles that describe approaches for enterprises to integrate data with SaaS solutions. Integration approaches range from the primitive FTP transfers, custom point to point integration, to a vast and growing range of commercial solutions (appliance, cloud-based, and EAI). These articles are focused on the customer perspective. In other words they are intended to help enterprises better understand their options for integrating with SaaS providers. **Can anyone provide some insight and advice from the SaaS provider perspective when it comes to making their solution as easily integratable as possible?** I assume the SaaS provider needs to create and publish web services API's and RESTful interfaces. Any other advice or resources would be most appreciated. PS: I realize saying "need to integrate with various enterprise systems" is incredibly vague.
