I got this termÂ¹ as a partial result $\qquad\displaystyle T = -1 + (-1)^{\frac{1}{3} \cdot (1 - 2 n)} - (-1)^{\frac{2}{3} - \frac{4 n}{3}}$ which Mathematica refuses to (full)simplify further, even assuming that $n$ is a positive integer. By inspecting a plot and verifying by `FullSimplify[T , Mod[n, 3] == k]` for `k = 0,1,2`, I get that $\qquad\displaystyle T = \begin{cases} -3, &n \mathbin{\mathrm{mod}} 3 = 2 \\ 0, &\text{else} \end{cases}$. Is there a way to tell `(Full)Simplify` to prefer case distinctions with simple cases over (complicated) closed forms, or extract a piecewise definition with another function? Preferably without knowing the case conditions a priori, of course. * * *   1. `-1 + (-1)^(1/3 (1 - 2 n)) - (-1)^(2/3 - (4 n)/3)`
