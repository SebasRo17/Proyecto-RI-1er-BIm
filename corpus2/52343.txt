I would like to generate set of four axis relating wavelength, wavenumber, energy and frequency in an arbitrary range. Like in this image but without the labels such as "RADAR". ![example of ruler](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pd0oF.gif) The selection of the nice numbers could be done similar to plots with two x-axis with different units but without an ordinate "y axis".               range = {Quantity[0.1, "THz"], Quantity[10, "THz"]};     ticksmeV = FindDivisions[QuantityMagnitude@UnitConvert[Quantity["Planck's constant"] #, "meV"] & /@ range, 10]      > {0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45} and so on. But I'm not clear how to put this in a graphic with correct scaling. What would be the best way to do this both in linear and logarithmic scaling? **Edit** Based in the answer by @ubpdqn I have done this:               rangeTHz = Quantity[{0.1,10}, "THz"];     rangemeV = UnitConvert[Quantity["Planck's constant"] #, "meV"] & /@ rangeTHz;     range\[Lambda] =  N@UnitConvert[Quantity["Speed of Light"]/#, "micrometer"] & /@ rangeTHz     rangeWn = N@UnitConvert[#/Quantity["Speed of Light"], "Wavenumbers"] & /@ rangeTHz     TableForm@Table[HorizontalGauge[Null, k, GaugeFrameStyle -> Transparent,  ScalePadding -> {0, 0}, ScaleDivisions -> 10, GaugeMarkers -> None, GaugeLabels -> Placed[QuantityUnit@First@k, Top], ImageSize -> 600, GaugeFaceStyle -> Transparent, LabelStyle -> 16,  AspectRatio -> 1/15], {k, {rangeTHz, rangemeV, range\[Lambda],      rangeWn}}]      > ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/syGMH.png) but the problem is that the Wavelength scaling should be inverted. How can I fix that?
