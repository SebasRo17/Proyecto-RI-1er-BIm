An ongoing purely recreational project. I got my introduction to image processing with this Rotating perspective... question and had a lot of fun with it. Now I want to take it to the next step. The great solutions to the earlier question led me to the following image as quite a small JPEG: ![collage](http://i.stack.imgur.com/oPQMH.jpg) Now, I hope to create a poster of the image that I can have printed at say 4' horizontally. To do this I need a JPEG which will have at least a 4' horizontal dimension with a resolution of at least 300 dpi. The artist created the original collage from pieces of cut colored paper - each piece a completely saturated color. The entire collage only has 10 or 11 colors. I can pretty easily identify RGB values for each. Also, the shapes that look approximately rectangular should all show as actual rectangles. The artist originally used full sheets of the colored paper. If you copy the above image into _Mathematica_ and zoom in on it even a little like this: ![zoom of collage](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YzHof.png) you'll see that it doesn't have crisp straight edges and many of the colors appear modulated rather than saturated. This will only get worse the more one blows up the image. To enlarge this up to 4' wide I need a way to address all of those issues. Call the attached JPEG `i = Import["http://i.stack.imgur.com/oPQMH.jpg"];`               ImageResize[i, 5000]      gets me pretty close to the size I need.               ColorQuantize[i, 11]      ![collage2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Vh6jO.jpg) begins to get me towards the saturation of color that I want. But these approaches don't get me all the way. Do I need to try point operations and/or transformations of some kind? Do I need to breakout grey scales for each of the RGB values? Would some kind of mask help? Something so I break the problem down into smaller pieces. Any guidance appreciated. * * * P.S., I have the original artist's full cooperation and permission in this little project. If anyone wants to make a print of the final product and display it he'd love to see it out in the world and enjoyed.
