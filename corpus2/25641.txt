What is the relation of memory usage of a SparseArray   and the number of its occupied positions? Let's say you build a 100.000.000 by 10 element SparseArray.   And fill the two position 1/1 and 100.000.000/10 with a value.               num = 999999;       idSparse = SparseArray[{{1, 1} -> num, {100000000, 10} -> num}]        There are two elements in the Array. Memory usage is:               ByteCount[idSparse]       400000968        Disk usage is:               Export["idSparse.rsa", idSparse];       FileByteCount["idSparse.rsa"]       380
