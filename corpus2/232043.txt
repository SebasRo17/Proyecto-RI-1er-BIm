I've been reading 'Introduction to Evolutionary Algorithms'. This method is stated, but not described, and I can't find anything more specific online. p44/45 of 2nd Ed for reference. "adding to the current gene value an amount drawn randomly from a Gaussian distribution with mean zero and user-specified standard deviation" Would be great to get the step by step, from initial to mutated value, including how Gaussian distribution works (or a link to something that could fill that gap). Thanks!
