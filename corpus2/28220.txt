I want to draw a series of normals to a curve, where the curve has been parametrized by a single angle, i.e., the polar angle. The curve is actually sinusoidal perturbation of a circle of radius 1/2, and the magnitude of the perturbation is given by `amp`. I have the `normal` function calculated in the code below already. I want to be able to draw normals to the curve at different points on the curve. How do I do this?               orad       = 1/2;     amp        = 0.05;     numpetals  = 7;           (*Polar information of interface*)     r[th_]  := orad + amp * Sin[numpetals*th];     rp[th_] := amp*numpetals*Cos[numpetals*th];          (*Cartesian information of interface*)     x[th_]  := r[th]*Cos[th]; (*X-coordinate of the interface/*)     y[th_]  := r[th]*Sin[th]; (*Y-coordinate of the interface*)          (*Speeds of traveral*)     xp[th_] := rp[th]*Cos[th] - r[th]*Sin[th];     yp[th_] := rp[th]*Sin[th] + r[th]*Cos[th];          (*Outward unit normal to the curve*)     normal[th_] := {yp[th], -xp[th]}/Sqrt[xp[th]^2 + yp[th]^2];
