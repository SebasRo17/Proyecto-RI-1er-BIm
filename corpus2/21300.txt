My goal is to read `list0.dat`, filter the data with a function `f`, and then write the transformed data to `list1.dat`, as in the following:               input = <<list0.dat;     output = Map[f[#]&, input];     output >> list1.dat;      However, `input` and `output` are both very large lists. (The format is just the usual anlytical expression.) So "No more memory available" always appears. How can I deal with this problem? I need some suggestions for memory control and how to export the transformed data to an external file in real time.
