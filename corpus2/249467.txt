We are working with some screens whose in the production process change their state from a transparent state to a colored state. This colored state is achieved to block light transmittance. In this process where the screen gets tinted, this tint must be applied homogeneously. This is a very important point of the process. To check this homogeneity, I've been asked to develop a mobile app (Android) in which using the camera I could check if the tint is applied homogeneously. I'm an android programmer so the knowledge about android is not a problem. But I've never worked with images this way so I ignore if such a thing like this could be done. My first idea is to develop an app which using the camera takes a photo, this is the easy part. After this, I should process the image some way that I could identify non homogeneous parts, maybe convert the image to grey scales and check for clearer or darker tones. I'm not asking about how should I programm that, as this is just a first idea on how could I achieve this, what I'm asking help for is to know how could I do that kind of image processing that could detect homogeneity.
