I am trying to acquaint myself with different types of languages to understand the areas in which each one of them is extremely good at. So far, I have dabbled into C - a procedural language, C++ & java - static typed Object Oriented languages and groovy - a dynamic typed Object Oriented language. Every programming language has probably been started to answer a need. And I presume every language is extremely good at at least one thing because of which it becomes a standard in a specific area or field. Like C, C++ have become standard in areas like browser or game development. Python in the Linux world for its easy scripting ability, Java in the enterprise world, etc. Now I am interested to learn a functional programming language like Clojure or Lisp. So, where are functional programming languages used in real world scenarios? I don't think that one would use Clojure or Lisp for developing applications or UIs. So on what kind of projects should I indulge into after going through the basic tutorials and learning resources to get a brief understanding about the implementation of functional programming? And do you strongly recommend on One language in specific, like say clojure?
