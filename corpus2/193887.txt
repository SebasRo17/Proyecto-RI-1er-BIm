Being new to node js magic world, i'm wondering how does a web application's setup look like on a real production server? So far all tutorials, create the js file that is started from a console...and that's it. Anyone has created a real world web app that uses node js in the back end? Can you please describe how is it setup, and how reliable this infrastructure is ? I'm coming from the asp.net and php world that require heavy web servers...and can't have a clear idea about node stuff.
