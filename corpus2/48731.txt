by a mistake I have deleted the nb file by which the CDF was generated. All required definitions were in one cell. If I remember the code looked like this:               Grid[{{Button[..],..},        Dynamic[ ParametricPlot[..,Initialization:>{functions definitions}]]]      and later I selected the output cell and saved the selection by: `File > CDF Export > Standalone`. I can open the CDF in a text editor but it is highly unreadable and is difficult to extract all the math commands.
