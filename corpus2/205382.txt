If I include an open source library in my project that is licensed under the MIT license, but contains BSD-licensed code that requires attribution (correctly attributed inside the project), is it my responsibility to attribute it again if I decide to use that library? Normally this is not a problem (I would just credit everyone regardless of the license) but on a mobile platform there is not a lot of real estate or efficient ways to show / bundle these licenses.
