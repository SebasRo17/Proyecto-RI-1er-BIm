I followed same things what they mention,still it's not working. enter link description here I have all permissions,but I tried the following two ways. case 1: I placed `WebMathematicaDocumentation` folder in `FileNameJoin[{$InstallationDirectory, "AddOns", "Applications"}]` directory case 2: I placed `WebMathematicaDocumentation` folder in `FileNameJoin[{$UserBaseDirectory, "Applications"}]` directory. How can I resolve this ? Thanks in advance
