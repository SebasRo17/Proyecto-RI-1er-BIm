In Java, by convention getter and setter for boolean fields will be `isField()` and `setField()`. This works perfectly fine with field names that are adjectives like `active`, `visible`, `closed`, etc. But how do I name a field that has meaning of a verb, like `haveChildren`? Add _ing to the verb (havingChildren), maybe? Edit: to clarify, I don't have control of the method names (getter and setter), they are auto-generated by the IDE. So what I need is an appropriate field name so that when the IDE generate a getter for it, it make senses. For example, hasChildren is a perfect field name, but when the IDE generate the getter for the field it would be isHasChildren. How do I solve this?
