I am trying to develop a selenium application (using c# win forms). So, while the application starts, the users will enter an app name in the text box. I have many fields such as cost, validity etc corresponding to each app. Example webpage:               description  appname  cost  validity  xyzattribute     --------------------------------------------------     some desc     app1     10      30     someattribute      I want selenium to search the entire page for that given app name and if it finds any, I want selenium to retrieve all the attributes (cost, validity) and store those in a variable. How can I achieve this? Please note that none of these fields have a unique attribute (such as name/id/any other).
