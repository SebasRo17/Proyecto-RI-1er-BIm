I have come across numerous older posts that highly recommend the following language agnostic programming books:   1. **Code Complete** by Steve McConnel   2. **The Pragmatic Programmer** \- Andrew Hunt and Dave Thomas   3. **Programming Pearls** \- Jon Bentley   4. **Refactoring** \- Fowler, Beck, Brant, Opdyke, Roberts   5. **Design Patterns** \- Gamma, Helm, Johnson, Vlissides   6. **Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability** \- Steve Frug I found these recommendations on Jeff Atwood's Coding Horror and Scott Hanselman's Blog and mostly the same recommendations on other sites as well. If I read these book today, are they still relevant and will they improve my code, expand my mind, thinking abilities and generally make me a better programmer? Are some timeless, while others are not? Are there other brilliant books, I have missed, that will be useful today?
