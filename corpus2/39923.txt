Design patterns help developers to improve the quality of their design, but only GOF patterns are very known, and paterns like GRASP that gives a good concepts like Information Expert,low coupling and high cohesion are less known. I think that GRASP patterns could be a good introduction to patterns for students and developers, they will master GOF patterns better if they knew GRASP patterns.
