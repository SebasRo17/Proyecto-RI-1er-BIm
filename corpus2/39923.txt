I have `2N` items and I need to form `2N` sets each with `N` items. The items should be evenly distributed. I don't know how to define this rigorously, but the number of common elements among any two sets should be minimized and equal to at most the average value. Also, each item appears in `N` and exactly `N` sets. For example, when `N=2`, valid sets can be `(1,2),(1,3),(2,4),(3,4)` **Edit** It is difficult to write down for `N=4`, but I'll try to: `(1,2,3,4),(1,2,5,6),(1,3,7,8),...` --- edit --- [Feel free to reword and/or remove this. DL] The result should be 2n subsets of {1,2,...,2n}, with each subset having n elements. Requirement 1: Each of the elements 1,2,...,2n exactly twice (probably this needs to be exactly n times, to get the numbers to work out). Requirement 2: Minimize the maximal intersection size of any two subsets, subject to requirement 1. --- end edit ---
