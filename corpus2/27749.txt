Table[ContourPlot[y^2 (10-x)==x^3,{x,0,.1},{y,-.1,.1},PlotPoints->5],{k,1,150,10}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bcueX.png) How to get the smooth graph? When `PlotPoints` is larger than 500, performance is too slow, however still not good. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1jCCD.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/LA7xI.png)
