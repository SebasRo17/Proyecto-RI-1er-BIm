And I don't mean Autocomplete or automatic code snippets as inserted by modern day editors, or polymorphic code. But what is the state-of-the-art in programs that can go through given inputs and types and information of the desired outputs and output a valid piece of code in a language of choice. I am aware of Genetic Programming, Gene Expression Programming but I don't know of any other efforts. Also googling doesn't turn up much. Is anyone aware of any advancements on this front? Edit: When i say "output a valid piece of code", I mean an AI or something similar working out the logic and the flow of control and implement it in an imperative language. Imperative language only, since that's the tough part. Nevertheless, if you know of any new languages being developed to support this kind of idea, please do mention, as maybe our current set of languages are not suitable for the kind of early AI we may first chance upon.
