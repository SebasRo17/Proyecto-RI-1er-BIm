This is a slightly more involved variant of this recent question. By sheer coincidence I happened to have been building a Wordfeud (Scrabble clone) game in Mathematica. ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/RHMKk.png)   _My interactive Wordfeud board in Mathematica_ I used `DictionaryLookup` with `StringExpression` to find matches corresponding to my hand (7 letters) and the fixed letters in the same row on the board that can be used. With 15 characters on a row that would be a maximum of 8 extra letters at fixed positions. I believe Mr.wizard's solution of generating all permutations would be unbearably slow in this case. I wonder whether the mma.se community has better ideas for this variant. Being far removed from my own MMA installation I can't currently post what I've got so far, but will do so this weekend. My solution typically took somewhere around 10-20 secs if memory serves, which is a tad slow. The next step-up in complexity would be having to deal with all potential words crossing your row. Extra points if you have ideas to tackle that efficiently.
