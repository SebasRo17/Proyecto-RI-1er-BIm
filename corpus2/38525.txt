I am using Mathematica 9. In the Help help file is the built-in function Backtrack. In order to use it the Help file says: To use Backtrack, you first need to load the Combinatorica Package using `Needs["Combinatorica`"]`. However, when I try to do this I get > General::compat: Combinatorica Graph and Permutations functionality has been > superseded by preloaded functionality. The package now being loaded may > conflict with this. Please see the Compatibility Guide for details. The "Compatibility Guide" doesn't seem to help. Can someone tell me exactly what is going on here?
