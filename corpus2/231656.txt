I'm not sure if this is a subjective question, I hope not but I'm not proficient with LLVM so I'm just wondering: how come it's become so popular and so widespread used in the industry? Were the optimization algorithms used in gcc/icc/msvc just worse than the LLVM ones? Is it possible that a university project managed to outperform such known and long-standing compilers? I know that LLVM is modular, but can then a design be the cause of that much success? I can't understand the real reasons behind that, this is also probably related to a subjective question like "is the success of a software always related to a new or semi-new algorithm that speeds something up?" but I'd like to get objective reasons to my first question if possible
