**Autocomplete driven development** is the issue. How do I feed autocomplete hints to IDEs, when I'm using scripting languages which provide magic methods? I'm not using an IDE usually. But it's obvious that many developers rely on them, and some percentage of them rely on autocomplete hints from the IDE. Now Eclipse and Netbeans both have support for PHP and Python. But they are of course unable to see class methods and attributes which are provided through `__get/__` or something. Whereas magic methods sometimes provide a nicer and more flexible API (and/or save coding). Anyway it's obviously an issue if you want to make the API visible to autocomplete programmers. So how can it be done? Is there an XML format for this? I know Eclipse is pretty xml-happy, but couldn't google up anything useful about that. How about Netbeans or other IDEs, is there any standardized scheme to signal autocomplete infos to code editors? (Would be nice if you could hobble in class methods and attributes, but also signal type hints for commonly used variable/object names.)
