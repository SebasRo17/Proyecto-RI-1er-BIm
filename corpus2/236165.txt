I took on a new project, and the task is to redevelop an existing application. I have been already working on the redevelopment for 6 weeks. I originally bid a fixed price for the first phase of development, despite the fact that the specifications they provided me with were pretty vague. It turns out what was supposed to take me only 4 weeks (which is what I based the bid on) ended up taking 6 weeks. In addition, there's still yet some work to do on the first phase, but the client has said they will pay me for the first phase anyway as it's taken longer than anticipated, and because I handled a bunch of extra, undocumented work. As you can see, I am finding fixed price challenging with this project. My question is what is the best way to bill for large programming projects you will be doing remotely? I have been considering hourly, daily, weekly and monthly. I sure find it challenging to accurately predict the amount of time something will take.
