Do you find writing dead code useful? Some says "If you have 2 logic to do some operation then instead of making other logic code commented or removing code make it dead code as it will not affect the operation." Example:-               if(true){         // logic - 1     } else {         // logic - 2  // dead code     }      Is it true? * * * I usually do not write dead codes instead I just remove the second logic.
