I have some familiarity with Mathematica, but have no experience with any Boolean computation. Suppose we have the Boolean formula $(x_1 \lor x_2) \land (x_2 \lor x_3)$. This can be simplified by applying rules of Boolean logic, as follows. $$\begin{align} &(x_1 \lor x_2) \land (x_2 \lor x_3) \\\ &= (x_1 \land x_2) \lor (x_1 \land x_3) \lor (x_2 \land x_2) \lor (x_2 \land x_3) \\\ &=x_2 \lor (x_1 \land x_2) \lor (x_2 \land x_3) \lor (x_1 \land x_3) \\\ &=x_2 \lor (x_1 \land x_3) \end{align}$$ Can formulas of Boolean variables be computed in Mathematica 9? Can Mathematica apply rules of Boolean logic to make simplifications like as shown above?
