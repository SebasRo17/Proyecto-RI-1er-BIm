Sorry if this is a duplicate, I looked. We're moving to Git. In Subversion, I'm used to having \trunk, \branches and \tags folders. With Git, switching between branches will replace the contents of the working directory, so am I right to assume that the way we used to work just doesn't apply with Git? My guess is that I'd have a repo folder with maybe a gitignore and readme.txt, then the folders for the projects that make up the repo, and that's it.
