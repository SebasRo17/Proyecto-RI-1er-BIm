I have a bunch of ideas around questions I can ask a potential candidate for a ScrumMaster position, but I wanted to reach out to the awesome community as to interview questions/exercises to do for a potential ScrumMaster role:   1. What questions would you ask?   2. What exercises would you have them do?
