I was wondering how one would go about nesting multiple functions of, say, two variables. The problem comes from trying to implement the Chirikov standard map without using "for" cycles. I found a demonstration project that did it, but I couldn't figure out the code. I would appreciate any kind of help, thanks. Just for the sake of information, the Chirikov standard map can be defined as $$\begin{aligned} y' &= y + \varepsilon \sin(x) \\ x' &= x + y' \end{aligned}$$
