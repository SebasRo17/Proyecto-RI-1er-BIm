I work with a lot of dynamic data in `{{date, datum}. . .}` format,               datedatalist={{{2001, 1, 1}, 45.2}, {{2002, 1, 1}, 132.}, {{2003, 1, 2}, 121.1}};      and I have historically attached a header to each object in a format like               datedataObject={{header version, data series name, type (value, % change, etc.)}, datedatalist};      I can see advantages to using Mathematica's TemporalData[] type, and to using MetaInformation[] for recording the header. I would set this up with something like               newObject = TemporalData[datedatalist, MetaInformation -> {"name" -> "whatever", "type" -> "value"}];      and extract header items with, for example               newObject["name"]      But this leaves me with two puzzles,   1. How do I add MetaInformation after the object has been created? and   2. How do I change existing MetaInformation?
