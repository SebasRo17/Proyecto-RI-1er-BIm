In the last 4 months I've been able to manage a team and step away from the coding for a bit. I've been planning the system in full (both System Analysis and project managing, alongside action and data diagramming) writing the technical documentation, the code's architecture, keeping track of the other guys doing the actual coding, QA, bug reports and dealing with clients. I had to take two days' training on node.js just to see if it would be suitable for a project we were considering. Is there a name for this job? Project Manager and Systems Architect don't quite seem to have the same stuff, and IT manager seems way off. I only want to know so that I can get some qualification towards it and try to move into this kind of work full-time.
