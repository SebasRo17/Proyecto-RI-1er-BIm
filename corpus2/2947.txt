I need to integrate an expensive likelihood `L[x]` over its n-dimensional domain. I know that `L[x]` is decently approximated by a gaussian likelihood `G[x]`, which is very cheap to evaluate. In particular, `L` and `G` share the same maximum. The approximation, however, is not good for the integral I need. I've already got a good performance boost by restricting the integration to the 4-sigma Ellipsoid predicted by `G`, as discussed in NIntegrating within an Ellipsoid. I would like to ask now if it is possible to feed NIntegrate with the information that `G` is a decent approximation for `L` so that the sampling in NIntegrate is done in a more efficient way.
