I've been trying to find information online about where WWF 4.5 fits with in an architecture based around an enterprise message queue using central broker(s) (RabbitMQ in particular). It seems like responsibilities overlap a bit since WWF offers the ability to pause-and-resume (persist/restore) workflow instances. I'm wondering if I'm erroneously equating this pause-and-resume WWF functionality to the general message queuing concept. Having looked at MassTransit, in particular a code listing of a sample Saga showing parallel code "activities" that then "combine" when completed... it seems like WWF excluding the pause-resume functionality in this context, is better compared against MassTransit.. is this an accurate assessment?
