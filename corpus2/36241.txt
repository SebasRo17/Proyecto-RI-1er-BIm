I would like to hear opinions from people who have used a language that compiles to php. One such language I know is Haxe. Other ones I've read about are Kira and Pharen. How well do these languages integrate with PHP? Is it relatively easy to write a plug-in for a PHP CMS in them? How mature are their implementations and tools? Would you recommend them to someone who has to use a php cms but hates php?
