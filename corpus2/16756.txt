I want to count degeneracies in a list called `spectrum`. The list contains numbers of double (~ 15digits) precision. So it makes no sense if the noise below this precision is taken into account since it falsifies the result of degeneracy counting using `Tally[]`. So I applied `SetPrecision`.               degList = Tally[{#1, SetPrecision[#2, 15]} & @@@ spectrum];      But I still get e.g. {-0.047063080371693544`, 4} {-0.047063080371693294`, 4} (last number is the degeneracy level) which should be seen as equal numbers but are counted by `Tally[]` as different ones. What am I doing wrong?
