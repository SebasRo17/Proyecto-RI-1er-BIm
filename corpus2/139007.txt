A while ago I made Conway's Game of Life. I'd like to make something similar (in C++), where each cell would exhibit behaviours such as:   * Movement   * Reproduction   * Killing of other cells (moving onto another cell, for example) Over time, the cells would 'learn', and I'd (hopefully) end up with a set of behaviours that are beneficial to the ecosystem as a whole, rather than the individual cell. I'm 100% sure that this isn't new, but I don't know:   1. What technical terms cover what it is I'm trying to do (what keywords cover my aim such that I can search for other implementations),    2. Resources, preferably online, although dead-tree style is also good, which would be beneficial reading for this type of programming.    3. How I should implement this (#2 would help with this); I can modify my cells to do some things (moving, for example), but I'm not sure how I should implement the learning; should I be using a genetic algorithm or is some other type of evolutionary algorithm better suited?
