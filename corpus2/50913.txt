I want to plot a big 2D array of experiment data. I need plot axes and tick labels as well as a bar legend using `BarLegend`:               ArrayPlot[      Array[RandomInteger[100] &, {100, 100}],      PlotLegends -> Placed[Automatic, Below],      ImageSize -> 200,      PlotLabel -> "Test",      FrameLabel -> {"Axes", "Dimensions"},      FrameTicks -> Automatic,      BaseStyle -> {FontSize -> 14}     ]      The output I get is ![output of the test script](http://i.stack.imgur.com/m5eI4.png) I am not happy with the size of the `BarLegend`. I would like to have the `BarLegend` with the width and horizontal offset of the actual plot. It properly scales with the image size, if I don't use the `PlotLabel`, `FrameTicks` and `FrameLabel` but I need all of them. I would be happy also with the solutions, which does work in general case, but needs adjusting some number by hand. So far I have figured out, that I can change the horizontal offset with `PlotLegends -> Placed[BarLegend[Automatic, LegendMargins -> {{20, 20}, {0, 0}}], Below]`, but this does not make the legend smaller. As the `BarLegend` does not return `Graphics`, I can not just use `Scale[BarLegend["BlueGreenYellow", LegendMargins -> {{20, 20}, {0, 0}}], 2]` etc. Side note: For plotting experiment data I use `ArrayPlot` instead of `ListContourPlot` and similar because they get very slow for big arrays. And at least `ListContourPlot` suffers from the same problem.
