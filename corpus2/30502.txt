Simple question: Is there any built in function for images that acts similar to imagesc in matlab, i.e. take grayscale image scale it to use full [0,1] range and then use some kind of colorgradient to plot the image? The one thing I use right now is to first use `HistogramTransform` to scale to full [0,1] range then obtain image data via `ImageData` and then use `ArrayPlot` with appropriate `ColorFuntion`:               ArrayPlot[image // HistogramTransform // ImageData, ColorFunction -> "TemperatureMap"]      Of course this works just fine, but I am curious if I overlooked some procedure operating directly on images.
