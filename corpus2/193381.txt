In a lecture, the lecturer described the following model : E - entry (the preconditions to a task).   T - task - doing the task   V - verifying the tasks quality   D - Delivering the tasks   X - Exit.   or ETVDX If anyone is familiar with this 'generic compliance model', how does it fit into software development exactly? I presume it's equivalent to the waterfall model of negotiating requirements > defining/decompose stage > estimating effort > estimating resources > developing schedule.
