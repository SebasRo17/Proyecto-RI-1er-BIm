Which commands can you put in `KeyEventTranslations.tr` ? There is an extensive list of FrontEndTokens, but what else can you use? Why something like this doesn't work:               Item[KeyEvent["r", Modifiers -> {Command}],      FrontEndExecute[{         FrontEnd`KernelExecute[ToExpression["Quit[]"]],         FrontEndToken[SelectedNotebook[], "EvaluatorStart", "Local"]      }]     ],      With `FrontEnd```KernelExecute` one could put any command there, but what's the trick? ## Edit (some more observations) This does work in `MenuSetup.tr`, like explained here (and of course in the current session). Menu items can be executed by a Kernel or FrontEnd. However, for each item there can be only one MenuEvaluator, so after quitting Kernel the rest of commands will not be executed. Also, for some reason, `KernelExecute`, when started from Menu or a button (not from a Cell), is not only queued to Kernel, but has priority!
