Lets say you got some piece of code and you have no idea which language it was written in. What are the unique "signature" syntax constructions for each programming language that you can use to quickly determine code origin? _(PS. Mentioning only one language in an answer probably would be a good idea. Having more than one answer for the same language is fine, lets vote for the best one)_
