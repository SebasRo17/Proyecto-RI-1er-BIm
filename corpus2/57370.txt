There has been numerous posts about developers that prefer a dark color scheme in their IDE. Most of the themes at studiostyl.es are dark themes. Back when I had a single monitor, I did enjoy using a dark theme since it was easier on the eyes. But now that I utilize multiple monitors, I find dark themes actually hurt my eyes. Most of the time I have my IDE open on one monitor and a browser/email/documentation open on my other monitors. Only my IDE has a dark theme and most of websites/documentation have a white background. This forces my eyes to constantly adjust between my dark IDE and the white website, which puts strain on my eyes. I'm sure I'm not the only person who tries to use a dark theme for the IDE and have multiple monitors. How do other people deal with this issue?
