I am plotting n spectrum using:                 FileNameSetter[Dynamic[xx]]       v = Table[Flatten[Import[ xx[[i]] ], 1], {i, 1, Length[xx]}];       ListLinePlot[Table[v[[jj]], {jj, 1, Length[v]}],        PlotRange -> Full, AxesOrigin -> {0, 0}, PlotStyle -> Thick]      where `v[[jj]]` represens the data that I am plotting. The problem with that approach is if `v[[1, x]] < v[[jj, x]]`, I cannot view the first spectrum. Below is part of the result that I got. It has two graphics, but it is almost impossible to see the blue one. I would like to overlay all the graphics in such a way that I can see all, like showed in this post, but in an easier way, since I cannot understand `viewport` and all that. Is there a simpler way to do this? ### Edit Here is an example of data: Spectrum1 Spectrum2 I did some modifications in the code, so now it is more general:                 FileNameSetter[Dynamic[xx]]       v = Table[Flatten[Import[ xx[[i]] ], 1], {i, 1, Length[xx]}];       ww = {};       color = {Blue, Red, Green, Black, White, Gray, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Brown, Orange, Pink, Purple};       With[{opt =            Sequence[PlotRange -> {{500, 3000}, {0.9, 10000000}},           ImagePadding -> 35, ImageSize -> 1000,            BaseStyle -> {18, Bold}]},         For[jk = 1, jk <= Length[v], jk++,         If[jk != 1,           ww = Join[              ww, {ListLogPlot[v[[jk, 1000 ;;]], PlotStyle -> color[[jk]], Frame -> {{1, 0}, {1, 0}}, Joined -> True, opt]}],           ww = Join[ww, {ListLogPlot[v[[jk, 1000 ;;]], PlotStyle -> color[[jk]], Frame -> {{1, 0}, {1, 0}}, Joined -> True, opt]}]            ];          ];         Overlay[ww]         ]      An advantage is that I can overlap 11 graphics together with the same scale (I put the scale but hand, but in principle it is easy to modify that). I have still two problems:   1. I can't label the axes;   2. I can't put a legend without loosing the same scale for all graphics. Any suggestions?
