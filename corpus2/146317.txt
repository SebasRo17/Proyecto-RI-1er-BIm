I'm integrating EASTL into my game programming framework. I did some changes to it since I have my own memory management sub-system and now I'm wondering what I need to do to not break the license under which EASTL was released.

Since I will probably be releasing the source code on GitHub at some point, but do not plan on releasing any binaries without source code, can I just add something similar to my own source files and be okay with this? Will something like the following do?               /*      * Copyright (c) 2012 Bartlomiej Siwek All rights reserved.      * Based on EASTL (https://github.com/paulhodge/EASTL) - copyright information follows.      */          /*      * Copyright (C) 2005,2009-2010 Electronic Arts, Inc.

This is a repost of a legal-like question from StackOverflow where it was found off-topic. If this is off-topic here as well, please tell me where I can ask such question?
