My problem seems to be very strange. I've created a CDF file and am trying to upload it to a Google site, and I've been almost completely successful! My only problem is that I cannot correctly view/interact with the CDF on my Mac. If I view in Safari, I cannot interact with the CDF, and if I use Firefox I can, but the CDF flashes near the top and bottom. However, if I view the exact same webpage on my desktop (running Windows 7), everything works fine across Firefox and Chrome! It seems that I've narrowed the issue down to spacing. If I take my original `.nb` file and save it as a `.cdf`, I preserve the spacing that I inteded to have, but I encounter the website embedding issues. However, if I run the "deploy as HTML" option, my spacing shrinks and becomes more compact, and my Mac browsers can handle the CDF. Problem is, I want to keep the spacing. Also, I am trying to give the embedded CDF a pixel size of 800x800. Any ideas? The two files can be downloaded from here:   * Spaced webpage   * Compact webpage
