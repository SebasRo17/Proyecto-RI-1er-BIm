Java is designed in a very OO approach, and somewhat even 'forces' programmers to program within the OO paradigm (which can be considered good or bad, a matter of opinion). However while _almost_ everything in Java is a class or an object, primitive data types (`int`, `double`, etc) are not. While I see no advantages to this, there are disadvantages. For example, when a method wants to take in as a parameter 'any value', it usually declares the parameter of type `Object`, the supertype of all classes in Java. However if the programmer wants to input an `int` to the method - a perfectly valid value - he/she has to 'box' the value in an instance of the `Integer` class, created specifically for these kinds of needs (as far as I understand). My question is: why aren't primitives in Java classes, like everything else?
