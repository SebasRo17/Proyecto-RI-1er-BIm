I have a print operation to perform for my customer documents. I need the other standard operations to be performed as well, like add,update, delete. so, I have following:   * For creating new customer:   URI = /customer/{id}, type = POST, Methodname = CreateCustomer()   * For updating:   URI: /customer/{id}, type = PUT, method = UpdateCstomer()   * For Delete customer:   URI = /customer/{id}, type = DELETE, Methodname = DeleteCustomer()   * For View:   URI: /customer/{id}, type = GET, method = GetCustomer() Now, if I need to print a document for that customer, I need a print function. My URI may look like this: /customer/{id}, type = POST , method = PrintCustomer(). But I have used that URI and POST type for CreateCustomer. I wanted the URI to look like this: /customer/Print/{id}, type = POST , method = PrintCustomer(). But I cannot have "Print" verb in my URI. Whats the best way to do this? I thought about /customer/document/{id} as the URI... but I will run into the same issue. I would have the CRUD operations on the "document". So, again I run out of what I would used for "print". Please advise.
