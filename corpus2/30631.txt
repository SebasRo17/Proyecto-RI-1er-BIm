I'm designing a small demonstration that helps to visualize the reason behind shaping an electrode that is used to probe a surface:               tip[rg_] := {EdgeForm[Thin], FaceForm[White],Polygon[{{0, 4}, {0, 0.2},        {0.5 - rg, 0}, {0.5 + rg, 0}, {1, 0.2}, {1, 4}}],        FaceForm[Black], Rectangle[{0.4, 0}, {0.6, 1}]};     box = {EdgeForm[Thin], FaceForm[Blue], Rectangle[{-3, -1}, {3, 3}]};     surface = {FaceForm[Green],        Polygon@Partition[Flatten@{{-3, -1}, {3, -1},            Table[             BezierFunction[{{-3, 0}, {0, 1}, {2, -1}, {3, 0}}][x], {x, 1,               0, -0.05}]}, 2]};     Manipulate[Graphics[{box, surface, GeometricTransformation[         GeometricTransformation[tip[rg], TranslationTransform[{a, b}]],         RotationTransform[t Degree, 0.5 + {a, b}]]},        PlotRange -> {{-3, 3.1}, {-1.1, 3}}],      {{a, 0, "Left/Right"}, -3, 2}, {{b, 2, "Up/Down"}, -0.5,        2}, {{t, 0, "UME tilt"}, -15,        15}, {{rg, 0.4, "UME sharpness"}, 0.11, 0.5}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HLRG6.png) I would like the demonstration to show some type of visualization (perhaps just a big red "CRASH warning" text) whenever the tip graphic is positioned below the surface graphic, but I do not know how to construct a conditional statement that compares the multiple points in each graphic object. I'm happy to alter the structure of either the surface or tip objects if that makes the problem easier to solve.
