I've been using MVC/MV* since I started actually organizing my code years ago. I've been using it so long that I can't even think of any other way to structure my code and every job I've had after being an intern was MVC based. My question is, what are the downfalls of MVC? In what cases would MVC be a bad choice for a project and what would be the (more) correct choice? When I look up MVC alternatives, nearly every result is just different types of MVC. To narrow down the scope so this doesn't get closed, let say for web applications. I do work on the backend and front-end for different projects, so I can't say just front-end or backend.
