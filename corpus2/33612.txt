When I use RowBox for MakeBoxes the order of the elements is changed for TraditionalForm, if there is a plus (+) in the list of elements.               MakeBoxes[x, form_] = RowBox[{"b", "+", "a"}];     MakeBoxes[x, StandardForm]     MakeBoxes[x, TraditionalForm]     (* Out[2] = RowBox[{"b", "+", "a"}]        Out[3] = RowBox[{"a", "+", "b"}] *)      Sometimes Mathematica really makes me wonder. Does this only happen when there is a plus in RowBox? Is there any way to fix this?
