I am thinking about writing a GAE app but am a little hesitant because the EULA gives Google full rights to change their APIs anytime they want, for any reason. Obviously, they'd be out of business quick if they just 'upped and refactored their entire APIs, so I have to imagine they have some kind of notification system, perhaps even an RSS feed, etc. to notify developers well in advance of looming changes, or new features coming out in future releases. However, for the life of me I can't seem to find any trace of the existence of such a notification system. Perhaps the Google forums is the only place to get such updates? I guess I'm asking any battle-worn GAE veterans for re-assurance that there are reliable ways of getting notifications about policy or API changes from Google such that I could react and make the necessary app changes without production breaking or impacting any clients.
