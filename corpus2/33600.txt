I've tried searching here and in the WRI documentation, but I haven't found what I'm looking for in either place. I'm defining a `dx` operator to act as a shorthand for `D[#,x]`, based on this question. In my case, I want _Mathematica_ to produce an output form with the text `d/dx` _expression_ `= [...]`, where by `[...]` I mean the actual symbolic meaning of my `dx` operator (i.e., `D[#, x]`). I have tried this:               Format[dx[a_] := "\!\(\*FractionBox[\(d\), \(dx\)]\)"  a  "="  D[a, x]]      I've also tried               Format[dx[#], TraditionalForm] :=        DisplayForm[         RowBox[{FractionBox["\DifferentialD]", "\[DifferentialD]x"],         #, "=", D[#, x]}]];      and various other similar things, none of which produce the correct expression. I would appreciate help with getting this right.
