Few days back, I faced two interviews. It's obvious that they are going to ask about the different techniques I have learned. So, I gave them link of my tutorials while giving telephonic interview (Skype). In short, I explained the things using my blogs which they wanted to know. Say for example, Q: What challenge did you face earlier and how did you solve it ?   A: I got stuck when client insist me to have customized moviePlayer in iPhone, I came out to an solution. I have given complete brief of that technique here. After this conversation, this was their response: > We are happy to see you active in such manner. But our company has some > rules and regulations. You are not allowed to post anything regarding our > project. If you are willing to obey our rules, we are happy with that and we > will hire you. I just couldn't understand why knowledge sharing is strictly prohibited? I am fully agree that if company is developing new APIs, or new technologies I should not publicly discuss it. But my blogs are about some techniques sharing. Why am I forced to shut down my open-source sharing if I want to join that company? I also explained them, If no one is going to share their knowledge, how are you going to learn such things? I gave examples like these:   * If Ray Wenderlich doesn't post about game development, how am I gonna learn game development basics for iPhone / iOS?   * If Jon Skeet is not allowed to give answer on Stack Overflow, how am I gonna learn superstitious things? **Summary** :   1. Why do company think like that "Our developer share our company's details?"   2. Why do company think like that "It's their own property, If we do some research regarding development on office? " (need brief, I can elaborate more, just comment for that, I will edit question). **Edit** : Well! I am sharing techniques in small pieces & functionalities. I am not sharing whole project. Similarly, I am also doing some research work at my home & share about my technical experience. What is the reason behind interrupting someone's life. Its all about sharing the stuff that you have learned & it's strongly not about sharing companies client details or company projects.
