_The C Programming Language_ by Ritchie says that: > The library routine `sqrt` expects a double type and will produce nonsense > if inadvertently handled something else. So if `n` is an integer, we can use > `sqrt((double) n)` to convert the value of `n` to double. But the following code works fine on my system:               printf("%f",sqrt(9));      Then also it is giving the same result as `sqrt((double)9)`. Why is my compiler not following the book?
