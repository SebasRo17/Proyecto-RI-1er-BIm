I have an expression from which I'm trying to create a plot that I can manipulate. The expression contains `Abs`, and I only want to have it evaluated for reals. What happens when I manipulate the plot is that it is appears to render even when `Abs` is taking on a complex value, which is something I want to prevent. Is there a way to restrict the rendering only when a Real number is produced, and ... I don't know ... show a blank plot otherwise. ### EDIT example function               e1 = Abs[Sqrt[delta*Cos[theta] - b]]     e1 // Manipulate[Plot[#, {theta, 0, 2 Pi}], {b, 0, 2}, {delta, 0, 2}] &
