`ImageCapture[]` has an option `Device->` for specifying which camera to use, but `CurrentImage[]` takes no options and no relevant arguments. Changing `$DefaultImagingDevice` might or might not work, but it would be a pretty awkward solution for a program that needs to frequently take frames from different cameras quickly. Is there a way to use `CurrentImage[]` with more than one camera? If not, is there a better workaround?
