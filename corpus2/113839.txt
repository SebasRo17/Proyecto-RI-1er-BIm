My non-technical manager just paid for a license to use a tool which designed to pick mentions of your brand name at blogs, "social media", comments, etc. and gauge the sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) of the post. What he wants me to do is use it to do a task which can only be achieved with a certain level of natural language processing and hence shows up unrelated results for whatever query you can try. I want to be able to explain to him that this tool is designed for task X and what we are trying to do is task Y. Y cannot be modelled as X. And all the success of the tool he cites as proof is proof of X which is not Y.
