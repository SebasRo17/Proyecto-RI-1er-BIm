Using math 9.0.1 on a MacBook Air, I see a sudden increase of `Timing` by a factor of thousands when I sum over 250 elements of a matrix rather than over 249. So for instance, this table contains sums from 1 to 249 and it takes 0.0002s               Clear[vec, time];     vec = Table[i, {i, 100}, {j, 100}, {k, 300}];     time = Timing[     Table[Sum[vec[[i, j, k]], {k, 1, 249}], {i, 1}, {j, 1}]][[1]]; time      while if I go from 1 to 250               Clear[vec, time];     vec = Table[i, {i, 100}, {j, 100}, {k, 300}];     time = Timing[     Table[Sum[vec[[i, j, k]], {k, 1, 250}], {i, 1}, {j, 1}]][[1]]; time      it takes 1.4s. The huge increase occurs regardless of the content of `vec`, regardless of the upper limits of i,j, and it does not depend on whether I go from 1 to 250 or from 2 to 251, provided it's at least 250 entries. So if I sum from 2 to 250, it's back to 0.0002s. It depends instead on the size of `vec` (that is why I create a much larger matrix `vec` than actually needed in the sum). Can anybody reproduce this behavior? Any suggestion?
