We know that if we have a function $f(x)$, and we call $g(\omega)$ its Fourier transform, then the Fourier transform of $x f(x)$ is $$\imath \frac{\mathrm{d} g(\omega))}{\mathrm{d}\omega} $$ and viceversa, ${\mathrm{d}f(x)}/{\mathrm{d}x}$ becomes $\imath \omega g(\omega)$ How can I transform an operator, for example $$L(u):= u+x^2 u+\frac{\mathrm{d}u}{\mathrm{d}x}$$ so that it automatically transforms the variable $x$ in a derivative, and $x^n$ in a derivative of order $n$, and viceversa? * * * The specific problem I'm solving is the following:               ds[u_]:= A.{D[u,s],D[u,a]}.{1,0}      da[u_]:= A.{D[u,s],D[u,a]}.{0,1}   (*where A is a constant matrix*)     G1[t_,x_,y_]:= G0[t,x,y] Integrate[K[tt,x,y],{tt,t,T}]      where `G0[t,s,a]` is a function already defined and `K[tt,x,y]` is a polinomial in the variable $x$ and $y$ (so its integral is still a polinomial in $x$ and $y$. I know the inverse Fourier transform of `G0`, that is `F0[t,s,a]`. What I need is to do is to substitute all the the $x^n$ terms in the polinomial with the operator `ds[u]` applied $n$ times and similarly, $y^m$ with the the operator `da[u]` applied $m$ times. thanks
