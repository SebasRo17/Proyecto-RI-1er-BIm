So, I'm sitting here, chewing on a couple of novel data structures. I'm thinking of coding them up, but I'ven't got any professional use for them at the moment. Nonetheless, they solve interesting problems, and deserve reference implementations. So, I'd like to publish them, ideally in a peer- reviewed journal, so there's at least an off-chance someone will run into them and get some use out of it. But I can't for the life of me figure out how I'd even start to go about such a process, and none of my old professors seem to be in a position to help. Can I get a primer on how to go about getting something published in a moderately reputable journal?
