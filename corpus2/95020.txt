I am working on a website theme. I want to use a repeating background on the `<html>` node so I can have another background overlapping it on the `<body>` node. Otherwise, I would add the first background to the `<body>` node and then have the second background on a nested `<div>` with 100% width/height inside it. I am going for a full-browser repeating pattern that will be visible no matter how the browser is resized. See my examples. Desired:               <html> <!-- background: url("...") repeat; width: 100%; height: 100%; -->       <body> <!-- background: url("...") repeat-x; width: 100%; height: 100%; -->      Not allowed by specification? Not a good idea because of browser quirks? Work- around:               <html> <!-- width: 100%; height: 100%; -->       <body> <!-- background: url("...") repeat; width: 100%; height: 100%; -->         <div> <!-- background: url("...") repeat-x; width: 100%; height: 100%; -->      It is working in FF5 and IE7/8/9. But is there is a specification that says to not add style to the `<html>` node? Is there a particular browser I should watch out for, such as IE6, that will cause me to revert to the alternative if I try this? **EDIT:** I am using a proper `<!DOCTYPE html...>` declaration (XHTML 1.0 Tansitional). The width/height on the `html` node is mostly for clarity of my background pattern's intentions. (Thanks @veryfoolish) **EDIT 2:** I know CSS3 supports multiple backgrounds per node and @merryprankster's comment shows me how to simulate that with CSS 2.1 (thanks!), but I really need to know if HTML/CSS according to specification restricts anything "visual" on the `<html>` node, which in practice is generally used as an invisible box surrounding the `<body>` tag. Is there a reason why no one takes advantage of the `<html>` node's guaranteed existence, by applying CSS styles to it (not just cascaded properties, like `font-size`)?
