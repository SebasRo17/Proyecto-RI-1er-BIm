I'm building a sqlite database for an android app which will hold a list of items, each of which have different characteristics. Some of the characteristics are available for all objects, some are only relevant for a subset of objects. For example, all my items have a name, a description, an image. Some items will also have an expiration date, others wont. Some will have a size, some wont. Etc... How should I build my Database, as I don't know how many characteristics may be added in the future, and knowing I should be able to filter the list by any characteristic ?
