Why does the following simple code never come to an end (at least with version 8)               n = 5;     mat = SparseArray[{i_, i_} -> 1, {n, n}, -1/(n - 1)];     MatrixRank[mat]      when the following clearly doesn't cause any problem?               n = 5;     mat = Normal@SparseArray[{i_, i_} -> 1, {n, n}, -1/(n - 1)];     MatrixRank[mat]      The same issue appears to exist with `Det` instead of `MatrixRank`.
