I am trying to solve a PDE of a reaction diffusion equation, and while I'm getting a decent looking solution, I am also getting inconsistent BC / initial conditions warnings and wanted to check if my logic and coding was ok, or whether it's utterly wrong. I set up the equation like so;               Do2 = 2*10^-9;     a = 7.5*10^-7;     ko = 1;     omega = 3.0318*10^7;     ro = 150*10^-6;          eqn2 = D[P[r, t], t] - Do2*(D[P[r, t], r, r])  + a*omega*((P[r, t])/(P[r, t] + ko));      I then specify my boundary and initial conditions; so initially, in the region from 0 to $r_{o}$, $p = 0$ all across. So I write;               iv = P[r, 0] == 0;      Now, the boundary conditions - at $r = 0$, then is a steady concentration of oxygen diffusing into the region towards $r_{o}$ which is slowly being consumed at the rate $\frac{ap}{p + k_{o}}$, being reduced to zero at $r_{o}$. So I give my boundary conditions (which I believe are Dirichlet BCs) as;               bcs = {P[0, t] == 100, P[ro, t] == 0};      To solve and plot this I write               s11 = NDSolve[{eqn2 == 0, iv, bcs}, {P[r, t]}, {r, 0, ro}, {t, 0, 500}]     Plot3D[P[r, t] /. s11, {r, 0, ro}, {t, 0, 1000}]      Which plots something that looks relatively like what I'd expect - however, it warns me that the boundary conditions are inconsistent - am I plotting what I think I'm plotting, or is there something remiss is my code or logic? I should also add that my guess of $r_{o}$ is likely an underestimate - however, if I increase it to say, $r_{o} = 200*10^{-6}$, I get an error stating * _"Warning: scaled local spatial error estimate of 17.41130212282342`at t = 500.` in the direction of independent variable r is much greater than the prescribed error tolerance. Grid spacing with 25 points may be too large to achieve the desired accuracy or precision. A singularity may have formed or a smaller grid spacing can be specified using the MaxStepSize or MinPoints method options"_ I wonder if this is because the condition is unrealistic (ie: all the oxygen would be consumed by the point and is couldn't be a true boundary) or something more subtle I'm missing?
