Is it possible to give up an iphone application rights to another person or company? I mean, you make an application, you sell it for a while, and then you don't need it anymore and you give or sell it to another person or company to continue develope it. And in this case, how persons who already bought a copy of it can continue to receive next updates? I hope I'm clear.
