I would like to create a notebook element that can replace itself. Here's an example to illustrate:               Panel[Column[       {Style["This is a panel", Bold],        Button["Press me!",         SelectionMove[EvaluationNotebook[], All, EvaluationCell];          NotebookWrite[EvaluationNotebook[],           "\"Now I'm just a piece of static text.\""]]}]]      This code will create a little panel: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/AUxce.png) If we press the button, the panel will get replaced by a piece of static text (i.e. not a dynamic expression that's shown as text, but just plain old non- dynamic text). ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KFkrB.png) Well, in this implementation actually it's not the panel that gets replaced, but the complete cell containing the panel, and that's my problem: I need _only the panel_ to be replaced, so this will work even if the panel is just a subexpression in a larger expression. **How can we create an UI control that is able to replace itself with an arbitrary expression in the notebook?**
