I'm an intermediate Mathematica user and the _select_ function presented on Data Table Manipulation in Mathematica: Step 2 was very useful in helping me manipulate a 36Mb data file - 13 columns and 180k rows. The challenge I'm having is writing a similar function that will remove rows based on selected column entities, returning the subset of data as a new data table. Any assistance will be appreciated. Thanks.
