I have a table of numbers with a few thousand entries, and I'm trying to find the first index that is less than a particular value. An example of the table I'm working on is as follows:               dr = {6.34152*10^8, 6.32076*10^8, 6.29998*10^8, 6.27921*10^8, 6.25843*10^8, 6.23765*10^8, ...}      What I'm trying to do is find the first entry that is less than `5.77*10^8`. I've tried the following:               SOIdr = Position[dr, First[dr] < 5.77*10^8]      But have had no luck thus far. Any help would be appreciated, thanks guys.
