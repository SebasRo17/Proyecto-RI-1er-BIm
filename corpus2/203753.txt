For the last 5 years I have developed as a lone developer. The business gives me the requirements, timescales etc and I do the rest. I choose which technology best fits the requirements, I decide on the architecture, I do all of the coding, releasing, testing and supporting. I have been looking at moving as I feel I am missing out on agile experience, team interaction and exposure to some practices. I was at an interview today and I was asked how I would feel having less control over the code I write as they have architects and project managers. I hadn't really thought about it to be honest and now I am wondering. I know what I stand to gain by moving, interaction with other developers, exposure to agile/scrum and also exposure to new technologies. My question here is, what do I stand to lose? I know I will no longer choose what technology I am using but just how little control will I be restricted to? How can I prevent myself from becoming someone elses code monkey who just has to write whatever they are told? I haven't experienced a set up with architects, BAs, projects managers etc so I am unsure what to expect. The teams are around 2-3 developers with an architect and/or lead developer.
