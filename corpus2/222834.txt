I spent the last 5 months working my regular job (qa) and developing an android application in the evenings. Now we were in two week vacation for Christmas and I spent the whole time developing my application and now I feel exhausted, I just cant get myself to sit down and start writing code again. It just feels like a huge mountain of weight that I have to lift, even thinking about it. Is this normal? Will this get worse with time? Im in the IT industry for 9 months now, 6 of them, like I said were very intensive. 25 year old. Also, I think its important to mention that I learn extremely fast and intensively and I get ahead of myself all the time. Am I going to burn my potential off? PS: Why would someone downvote my question? what wrong or bad have I done? Which rule have I not obeyed?
