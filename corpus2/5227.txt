How do I evaluate a conditional expression in order to convert the solutions that are in terms of $x$ to a new variable $c$ depending on $x$? The conventional method I have been using with eliminate doesn't work in this case, because the solution is not a simple inequality, but rather conditional.                f[x_] := x^2 + c;      g[x_] := f[f[x]];      y = Solve[g'[x] == 1, x, Reals]      output is:               {{x -> ConditionalExpression[Root[-1 + 4 c #1 + 4 #1^3 &, 1],      c > -(3/4) || c < -(3/4)]},       {x ->  ConditionalExpression[Root[-1 + 4 c #1 + 4 #1^3 &, 2],  c < -(3/4)]},       {x ->  ConditionalExpression[Root[-1 + 4 c #1 + 4 #1^3 &, 3],  c < -(3/4)]}}           Eliminate[c == -x - x^2 && x == y[1], x]
