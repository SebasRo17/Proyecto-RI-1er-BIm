I am using ListDensityPlot to output the results of a physical simulation. I've passed both an array of values and coordinates coupled with magnitudes to ListDensityPlot. Although I expect identical functionality it seems the points are interpolated differently. I've recreated the problem in a very simple case in this code:               ListDensityPlot[{{1, 1, 2}, {2, 1, 2}, {3, 1, 1}, {4, 1, 1}, {1, 2, 1},                       {2, 2, 1}, {3, 2, 1}, {4, 2, 1}}, InterpolationOrder -> 1]     ListDensityPlot[{{1, 2, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 1, 1}},      InterpolationOrder -> 1]      Toggling the third element of a list in the first function call from 1 to 2 causes a change (since all are 1), and changing any element in a list in the second function call from 1 to 2 does the same. The input in the first call should be identical to that in the second. However, it seems that ListDensityPlot is using a different algorithm for smoothing in each case. I have tried altering the order in the first call, but this changes nothing. Am I missing something or is this a known feature that I will have to work around?
