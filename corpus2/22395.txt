We have a trac server setup that works with the svn commits, so we can do things like "fixed #183" in the commit messages, and reference the changes involved. Right now I have eclipse with subclipse + trac plugins, and it works pretty well. But **I don't have internet all the time** and it becomes very difficult to commit to an inaccessible svn server. I would like to use some type of local repository for commits, and then push commits all at once, but individually to server. **Changing svn / trac isn't an option at this time**. Other developers can touch the svn server directly. Is there a way to cache the commits locally, and then send them when I have internet again? Take in mind that I can't just do one big commit of all my changes because it makes it a nightmare since I can't selectively merge. Basically is there **a way to do this with git/bzr/mercurialand still use svn/trac** as intended? I'd be willing to do some scripting, but I don't know where to start.
