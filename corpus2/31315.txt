I have a list of data and want to make a curve like the one below which I made in solidworks. The problem of this curve is, that I don't know how to put it in a box with coordinates. ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/djJVR.png) The best I could get in _Mathematica_ are points connected with lines, which is not good enough. My code is:               Graphics3D[       {Red, Line[pot], Black, AbsolutePointSize[6], Point[pot]},        BoxRatios -> {3, 2, 1.5}, Axes -> True, ImageSize -> 450]      And this the image it produces: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5KLfT.png) Is there a solution?
