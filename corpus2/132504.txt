I was wondering if this was a good question to ask a possible employer when interviewing for a developer position: > What is the greatest strength and weakness of your development team? We all get this question when we are in an interview, so why not ask them in return? I think it is a very good question because we could find out about the team, and how this strength or weakness could affect us, but I don't want to annoy the interviewer. Is there any downside to asking this question when interviewing for a developer position?
