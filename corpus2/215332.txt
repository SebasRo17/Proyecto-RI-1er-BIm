We just completed developing a web app for a client. And like I usually do, I added developed by "My Company" at the footer at a very small insignificant size. I sent the client an End user license stating some of the following in summary               you can't resell, redistribute, etc without our notice     ...     you can't remove the attribution or design credits      the client got back to me and complained, telling me now that he was also developing for someone, and that 'I can't add my attribution' without his/her consent, but? Although I sign a NDA within summary states that I cannot disclose the software to anyone else. There was no agreement before the project that am not to add design credits or attribution. I know every software I install have that, and so is every products from companies, mostly technological products. How does this work (adding design credits)?
