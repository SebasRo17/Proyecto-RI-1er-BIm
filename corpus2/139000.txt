I want to make small web apps containing little games (multi-user dungeons, tower defense games, and roguelikes) or talent calculators for MMOs etc. After some research I have had people say that ASP.NET MVC would be perfect for these tasks. After looking at it I am unsure as to whether or not this is the right path to to achieve these goals. Which technology would be best to create small, web based browser games?
