We have started using Agile/Scrum in a team of 4 developers. We did our story estimations and ordered the stories Primed stories in the product backlog. We started with the point based estimation on the complexity from 1 to 5, instead of usual 1,2,3,5,8,13.... and so on After working on a couple of the stories we felt that some of the stories that was estimated at 4 point should only be 2 while the other which were estimated at 2 are a lot more complex and should have been estimated as 5. I would like to know:   * Is it Ok to change our story estimates in the middle of the iteration?    * Is it Ok to use the current estimation points from 1 to 5, instead of usual 1,2,3,5,8,13.... and so on Although I personally feel that it should be no for both the cases but I need to back myself up as my own understanding is not very clear.(Any good ref material would be good though!)
