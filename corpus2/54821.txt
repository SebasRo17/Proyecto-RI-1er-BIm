I have a SSM ( State Space Model ) and I want to calculate its optimum gains unisng `LQOutputRegulatorGains[]` command. When I run the code, it solves the equations and give an answer, but this error also appears :                   RiccatiSolve::ncsol: Cannot compute a stabilizing solution to the matrix equation.>>      What's wrong with it ?! And is it possible to change the method which `RiccatiSolve[]` command uses to solve the equation ? It is good to mention that `RiccatiSolve[]` uses two methods : 1.Eigensystem 2.Schur. I don't know how to change the `RiccatiSolve[]` methods in the `LQOutputRegulatorGains[]` command. Thank you in advance.
