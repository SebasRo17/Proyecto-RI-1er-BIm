I have a plot where I would like ticks shown on both the axes and the frame, with them labeled separately. I have custom labels for the frame and want the horizontal axis labeled with ticks automatically. Despite setting both the `Ticks` and the `Frame` properties, I cannot get the ticks to show up on the axes. Is there a way to do this without drawing the ticks manually or something like that? My example is shown below, I am able to get automatic ticks on the top of the frame, but these are not labeled either.               Plot[xt[t], {t, 0, .5*10^-3},        Ticks -> Automatic,        FrameLabel -> {{"x [m]", None}, {"t", None}},       Frame -> True,       FrameTicks -> {{Automatic, None}, {{{0, "t'"}, {.0005, "t'+5 ms"}}, Automatic}}]      ![Plot with no axes ticks](http://i.stack.imgur.com/NXyHc.png)
