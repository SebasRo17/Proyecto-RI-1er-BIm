I am looking to do a personal project on a web application. on my methods section I'm finding it difficult to choose just one Agile Method so here is the list I am trying to combine those or just a few of those to one method that works best for me.   * Scrum (I noticed for this one it requires a team of minimum of seven)   * XP (Extreme Programming)   * Crystal   * FDD (Feature dive n development)   * DSDM (Dynamic System Development Method)   * Adaptive Software Development   * RUP (Rational Unified Process) for example I was thinking something like split from scrum simple design (KISS) from eXtreme Programming only 19 weeks for this project so DSDM and TIMEBOXING USE cases etc.?
