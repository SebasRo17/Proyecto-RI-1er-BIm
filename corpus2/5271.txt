I have a matrix consisting of the following data:               Needs["HypothesisTesting`"]     data = {{11, 206}, {32, 1374}}      How would I make a chi-square independence test with a level of 5% of significance out of this? When I try the following:               In[9]:= ChiSquarePValue[data, 0.05]      I get this a very little value out of it.               Out[9]= OneSidedPValue -> 1.89247*10^-303      However, the correct answer would be something around `0.017` or `1.7%`.
