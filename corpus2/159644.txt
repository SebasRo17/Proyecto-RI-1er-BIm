Sometimes I use plugins and 3rd party libraries, and one thing that drives me crazy is when these libraries are not versioned. So, if I download it, make some mods to it, I am the only person in the world who can benefit from it... well, until I version it myself. My question is simple: if a library I find online has an MIT License, would it violate the license if I download it, modify it, and put it on github? I'm not trying to pass it off as my own, I'm just trying to help the community benefit from my work. A lot of libraries are pretty nice, but for some reason they aren't versioned... Thanks!
