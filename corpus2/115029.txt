I'm developing a multi-tier application. We separate our project into three logical layers: client, service and data access. However, almost all methods in the service layer don't do anything except returning table/view from DAL to the client and then the client continues processing data. More than 50% of the returned data is bigger than it really needs to be. For example the client needs a username and an email-address but the service layer returns way more data. This is the coding standard in my team. I tried to change this by shaping classes that return what the client really needs but they wanted me to change it back after I had done it. I'm curious what are the pros and cons of doing things that way?
