I've taken a software development role in an engineering company(all software developed is for internal use only). The company has about 60 individual projects from past developers. The problem is that all past developers are gone and no one knows why about half of the software was built, who uses it, or even what some of it does. We use SVN, but no past developers wrote comments or did any sort of documentation. Assuming I figure all of this out, is there some program/system/method that could be used to keep track of all this information? The company is leaning toward Excel, I'm assuming there's something better. Would it just be better to write up documentation in a Word Doc and commit it to svn so it's right next to the code?
