I am developing a WPF application and I need some clarity on printing in WPF and MVVM (I am using MVVM-Light). I want to create standard looking reports for my application and I don't want to have to code each one from scratch. But I want to write this solution myself, without stuff like crystal reports etc. But I am open to other open source examples of course. 90% of my reports will be generated from datagrid itemsources. I want to have a report footer and header and then the "records" that get paged in a content section. **My idea is:** use Fixed document as report wrapper (with header and footer properties), use a listview for records in report content, and generate report to xps that gets opened in document viewer for user to review and print etc. But I have never created reports from WPF before and it looks like there are lots of options and no clear best practice. I am looking for some suggestions or advice on which direction to go from someone with some experience creating custom reports in WPF and keeping MVVM. What was you strategy?
