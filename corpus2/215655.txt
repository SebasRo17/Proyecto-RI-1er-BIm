I have a main activity that contains many buttons. I don't want to have a list of buttons like this. I know this looks bad, only cause I threw this together to show you what I have. As you can see, I really don't even have enough room. I don't want a `scrollView` in my main Activity. Does anyone have suggestions on building my activity to look sleek and simple? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/JrZbM.png)
