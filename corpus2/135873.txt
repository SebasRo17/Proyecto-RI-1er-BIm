> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Ideas to get you programming mojo back? Its almost 10 years for me working in Java based applications (mainly on Web). Sometimes I feel really bored of the regular work...same old problems, similar challanges etc. Since I work for a company that provides services to different customers, I change my domain from time to time, I get to know about some new things, but ultimately all are web applications and I really find nothing interesting after 6-8 months in a new project. I would like to know from experts, how do you make working in same technology interesting?
