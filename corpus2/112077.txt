We're currently modifying out development process and I'm wandering if we should try to keep a 100% of our commits peer reviewed. What is your experience regarding code reviews?   * Do you tend to spend "a lot" of time on them (say 1/2 hours per day), or just skim over for 5/10 minutes max?   * Do you have a fixed amount of time to spend per day/week/sprint/project ?   * Most importantly do you think that the target should be for 100% of the code to be peer reviewed or that 100% is not necessary?
