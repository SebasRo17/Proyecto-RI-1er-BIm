A few days ago, I was talking to a Software Engineering PhD candidate and at some point she said to me: > Keep your classes and methods as small as possible And I wonder if this is always a good practice. I mean for example, is it worthy to have a class with only 2 attibutes in it? For instance, In some methods I need pairs of integers to work with. Should i write a "PairOfIntgers" class? Could this way of thinking "break" the code in too many pieces?
