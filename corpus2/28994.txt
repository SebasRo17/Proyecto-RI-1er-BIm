I am looking for the _most general possible way_ to suppress the display of minor ticks in Mathematica plots.1 More specifically, I'm looking for _the equivalent_ (or _near-equivalent_ ) of a fictional `MinorTicks->None` option/setting (and its usual "partial variants", such as `MinorTicks->{None, Automatic}`, `MinorTicks->{Automatic, None}`, etc.). This fictional option/setting is one that could be passed to any Mathematica function that accepts a `Ticks` option, and would have the sole effect of ensuring that the results do not include minor ticks along the element(s) indicated through the options argument (but may still include the usual major ticks, of course). Note that I don't expect to get, literally, an implementation (somehow) of a `MinorTicks` option! I'm looking for something _equivalent, or nearly so_ , both in functionality and convenience. (If this description of the question is clear enough, the remainder of the post may be safely skipped.) * * * I can imagine at least three possible ways to answer this question. (But there may be other solutions I have not thought about!) The simplest one, of course, if such an option already existed (e.g. maybe some obscure/undocumented variant of `Tick`, or some trick with the existing options that would have the net effect of suppressing minor ticks), would be just to post this information. (This is the type of solution that strikes me as most likely, and, as it happens, for me also the most preferable.) The second one would be if there were some _freely downloadable_ package that implemented a similar functionality. The third one (which I realize is highly implausible) would be to post, or point me to, a modification of the source code for Mathematica's function for generating ticks (or for a sufficiently close mimic of it) in which all the parts where all the minor-tick-generating code have been disabled. (I realize that this may be too much work; it would suffice, however, just to point me to the source code of the function for producing the default ticks, and that I can use as the starting point for implementing a `noMinorTicks` function.) * * * 1 Just to be clear, I am interested only in solution that require only "standard" Mathematica (or possibly _freely available_ add-on packages).
