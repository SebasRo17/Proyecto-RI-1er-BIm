I believe this is a question of more list manipulation than plotting, but I hope you could help me. I solve numerically a system of equations of 3 variables, take only real solutions where one of the parameters is within the unit circle and evaluate its stability for different cost parameter C as               costValues = {};     solutionValues = {};     stabilityValues = {};     Do[     (*real steady state solutions where m is within the unit circle*)     ssOut = Select[NSolve[{x == xEq, p == pEq, m == mEq} /.{C -> costVal}, {x, p, m}],      Element[{x, p, m} /. #, Reals] && 0 < ({x, p, m} /. #)[[3]] < 1 &];     (*calculate eigenvalues for the Jacobian for each solution*)     eigenValues = Table[N[Eigenvalues[jacobian /. {C -> costVal} /.solution]], {solution, ssOut}];     (*check how many eigenvalues are within the unit circle*)     stability = Table[Length[Cases[eigenValue, x_ /; -1 < Re[x] < 1]], {eigenValue,  eigenValues}];     (* append the results to the lists *)     AppendTo[costValues, costVal];     AppendTo[solutionValues, ssOut];     AppendTo[stabValues, stability];     , {costVal, 0, 1}]      My result lists look the following               costVals= {0., 1};     solutionValues= {{}, {{x -> 28.8952, p -> 0.059159, m -> 0.010203}, {x -> -28.8946,      p -> -0.0577157, m -> 0.010203}, {x -> 28.8886, p -> 0.0432996,      m -> 0.010203}, {x -> -28.888, p -> -0.0418563, m -> 0.010203}}};     stabValues= {{}, {3, 2, 1, 1}};      Of course, there could be many more costVar values. The point is, that for each costVar value I could have a number of solutions with different stability values. I would like to plot on separate diagrams different solution values x, p and m against the costValues and with a condition that if a stabValue is equal 2 the color should be green (stable) and if not then it should be red (unstable). So for example above, on horizontal axis I would like to have values 0 and 1 and on vertical axix for instance for variable x I would like to 0 points for costVal=0 and 4 points for costVal=1 where the second solution should be marked green and the other red. I spent a couple of days on that without a success, do you have any idea how to do that efficiently?
