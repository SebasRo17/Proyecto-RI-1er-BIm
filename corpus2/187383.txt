I am in the early stages of planning for an input device which will consist of some as-yet-to-be determined number pf physical controls. From previous experience with such devices I have found that it would be extremely advantageous to have the device return data about the state of all controls in response to a query from the system, as opposed to reporting changes as they occur. Assuming an acceptable poll frequency of 1000 queries per second or higher, is the embedded hardware sufficiently advanced to support this? Would a driver for such a device be excessively resource-intensive? What would a good ballpark estimate for the ram/cpu required on both the "server" and "client"?
