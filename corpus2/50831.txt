The other half of this question: How do Programmers in the East see programmers in the West? * * * The eastern part of the world (India/China/Philippines ) mainly provide outsourcing services to the western world (USA and Europe). Do you have the experience of working with offshore teams? If yes, how was it? Do you hold any generalized ideas or opinions about the programmers from the East (e.g. Are they cooperative, do they deliver on time or do they do quality work?). What are these based on?
