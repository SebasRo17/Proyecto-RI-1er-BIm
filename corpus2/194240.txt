I have started to study design patterns using some course in pluralsight and the gang of four book. While I feel I understand what I have studied so far, I think it would be very helpful if I would have some way of practicing them. I know that I will get the chance in time but I feel I would get a better understanding of each design pattern if I would do some exercises for each of them. What I would like is if someone knows any websites or documents that provide exercises for implementing design patterns. I am particularly interested in ones where the author provides some source code and the problem that has to be solved and I have to implement a design pattern to solve it. I am not interested in examples and theory; I already got that covered from what I am reading.
