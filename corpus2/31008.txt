When I try to solve the integration f(x) as following (type it in the Mathematica) $ f(x)= \frac{1}{Ï€} \int_{-1}^{1} \frac{\sqrt{1-y^2}}{(y-x)}dy $, I met some boundary problems. I have searched some basic command like NIntegrate or PrincipalValue, but it dose not work. I think these commands just for finding a value of integration, but not for calculating a function. Can anyone provide any suggestion?
