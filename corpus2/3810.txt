When deriving functions using `Re`, `Im` or `Arg` (and probably some other functions as well), Mathematica gives nonsensical results, e.g.               Assuming[Element[x, Reals], D[Re[Gamma[I x]], x]]     (*     ==> I Gamma[I x] PolyGamma[0, I x] Re'[Gamma[I x]]     *)      Of course the wanted result would be `-Im[Gamma[I x] PolyGamma[0, I x]]`. Now in this case, it is easy to resolve, but often those functions are deeply inside a complicated expression. Therefore my question is: Is there any way to get reasonable derivatives for real functions of real parameters which involve `Re`, `Im` etc. of complex expressions depending on those variables?
