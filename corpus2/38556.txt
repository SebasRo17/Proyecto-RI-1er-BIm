I'm trying to get _Mathematica_ to look in a different, version-tracked folder for the 'TextResources' files that it uses to build the Front End. I've prepended my version-tracked folder path to the `$FrontEnd` option `PrivatePaths`, both from the Options Inspector and using SetOptions. Both of these methods make _Mathematica_ use my version-tracked files the next time I restart the Front End, but it quickly reverts to the versions at `$InstallationDirectory\SystemFiles\FrontEnd\TextResources\Windows` within one or two Front End restarts. I'm not certain what triggers this switch back to the default directory, but I'd really like to stop it from happening so that I can reliably and persistently use my customized, version-tracked instances of the 'TextResources' files. How might I accomplish this?
