Suppose I write a Mathematica script, called test.m, like the following:               Print["Hello, World!"];     test = ToExpression[$CommandLine[[-1]]];     Print["I'm alive!"];      and then I try to call that script from the command line like so:               math -script test.m a";Print[LOLOL];Quit[]"      I get the following output:               "Hello, World!"     LOLOL      Naturally, this scares me. I'm hoping to have a way to interpret command line arguments in a secure way. Can anyone help?
