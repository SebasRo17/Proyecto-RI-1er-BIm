Does anyone know of an existing name for a bug that disappears the moment you call someone over to look at it? It's a funny phenomenon, but it has happened from time to time that I'm working on a bug that consistently appears, but as soon as I call over a colleague to look at it with me, the buggy behavior stops and doesn't reappear. This is distinct from any of the other oddball bug names I've found, such as heisenbug or mandelbug, in that it's definitely there, even when attempting to study it, until it's shown to someone else. My coworker proposed the name "Calvinbug" for this phenomenon, after Calvin & Hobbes. Thoughts? And no, I'm not crazy. :)
