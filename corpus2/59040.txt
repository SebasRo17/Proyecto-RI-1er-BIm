The next two nonlinear equations are cumulative ratios of a production system. The mathematical model includes two essential parameters (n, tau) that can be obtained by solving this system. I'm trying to solve it in Wolfram Mathematica 10 (WM10). But looks like it cannot give the right solution. The equations are:               f21[n_?NumberQ, tau_?NumberQ] =       Gamma[1/n] - Gamma[1/n, (23.5/tau)^n])/       (Gamma[1/n] - Gamma[1/n, (11.5/tau)^n]);     f31[n_?NumberQ, tau_?NumberQ] = (       Gamma[1/n] - Gamma[1/n, (35.5/tau)^n])/       (Gamma[1/n] - Gamma[1/n, (11.5/tau)^n]);      These ratios have the correspondant values.               r21 = 1.563;      r31 = 1.985;      n must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1, and tau must be greater than 0. These search limits can be established as:               nlow = 0.1; nhigh = 1.;     taulow = 0.1; tauhigh = 20.;      Of course, in order to solve the equations, those must be in a consistent manner and equaled to zero. Something like this:               f21[n, tau] - r21 = 0     f31[n, tau] - r31 = 0      But the problem comes here, when your write this code and try to solve the system through FindRoot nothing comes as a solution, WM10 says: "no interpretations available". Furthermore, the introduced equations seem to have been accepted as such by WM10.               FindRoot[{f21[n, tau] - r21, f31[n, tau] - r31}, {n, 0.5, nlow, nhigh}, {tau, 5., taulow, tauhigh}]      I'll appreciate any comment in order to help the solution of this problem. Thank you. Best regards.
