I have been placed in a recent position where my job title does not adequately represent what my current duties entail. I am worried that this classification will affect me later in my career as the job title does not specify 'programmer'. How important is the job title while maintaining a career when compared to the experience and knowledge I am receiving while working? Should this be something to fret over or will a simple explanation be sufficient when transitioning to another workplace in the future?
