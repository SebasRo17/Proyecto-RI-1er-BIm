What shall be the relationship between the receptions of a class (was classifier before Aadaam correction) and the AcceptEventActions in the activity describing the behavior of its instances? I understand the former is related to signals reception of the type while the latter is related to runtime ReceiveSignalEvent events of the class instances (objects). But it is not totally clear to me how to express consistency among these constructs. I am defining a set of M2M and M2T Transformations (by means of QVT and MOFM2T). However independently of what I am trying to do I am curious to know what is the correct syntax for such models.
