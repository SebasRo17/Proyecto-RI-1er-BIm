If I begin my career (first job) with developing on the iOS platform, does that lock me in into iOS and Mac OS X development only? By locking me in I mean will that create barriers for me to switch technologies as I would be mainly working with Objective-C. If yes, does that make my career choices limited? I'm interested in comparing this with Android development, which if pursued will leave me with Java skills (correct me if I'm wrong) which I can use elsewhere.
