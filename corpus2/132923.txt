We have a situation in our team in which one member prefers his own ideas no matter what problems it has. When confronted with issues about a specific design he made - this teammate can get very protective and does not see the problems. In a result, this is a serious Software design issue for our team, because in the end some of the teammate's design will fall through to the end-design, and it will damage our software. Should we confront the teammate about his overall behaviour? Should we go the boss and tell him we can't deal with it and it's hurting our design?
