I've had discussions with other programmers on interfaces (C#). I tried to use the analogy of interfaces being like a contract between programmers. Meaning that when you design to an interface, you are designing to a "thought out plan". This didn't fly. The other programmers (limited experience) couldn't get the concept. Or worse, refused to participate. How do you explain to people like that there **are** reasons to use interfaces? Thanks
