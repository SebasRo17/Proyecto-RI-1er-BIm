You know what they're asking for. You know what they really want. However, technically the way they wrote it is with a litmus test of requirements that don't match what they want because they don't understand what they're asking for. Should it be a part of our job to match the spirit of the requirements, or match ridiculous requirements with this gut feeling that the requirements will change once they see the final result? I feel it's more ethical to determine what the user really wants, and find a solution with requirements as a guideline, but often I find others lose patience too much and just wants to give them what they technically ask for.
