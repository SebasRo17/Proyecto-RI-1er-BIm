I always see sites that only keeps fresh content on the home or subsections, and the rest of the content is kept in a separate section called 'archive'. Recently I have also heard that NoSQL DB's like MongoDB are good for archiving (which makes me think this is related to performance) So why do sites archive their content? What's the benefit over say, a simple paginator through which you could reach all the content? Is archiving done for performance? Or SEO? Or just user experience?
