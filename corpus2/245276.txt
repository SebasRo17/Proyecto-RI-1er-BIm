A common pattern I come across is a backbone collection which is initially seeded from a database. However, the user can also add to the collection. When the user does add to the collection, these should be reflected in the db. Usually I would bind some kind of server call to the collection `add` event. However if I do that, the call will be made even during the initial seed. I only want it to be called on _new_ data. Whats the right way to tackle this problem?
