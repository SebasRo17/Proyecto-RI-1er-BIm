Rather than craft my own stylesheets for documentation, I'd like to emulate (copy? ape? borrow?) the Wolfram style. Here is a very small example (type this in the help-box, which you get by pressing `F1`)               Quaternions/ref/UnitQuaternionQ      Here is a very large example               ContourPlot3D      I have zero experience creating styles, and I have only the most foggy understanding of how Notebooks work. I have gotten this far: If I scrape over the orange-and-yellow text at the top of the `UnitQuaternionQ` example, the cell just underneath the heading, then press `Command-Shift-E` or use the `Cell>Show Expression` menu item, then I see this magnificent bouillabaisse:               Cell[BoxData[GridBox[{        {"", Cell[TextData[{          Cell[BoxData[           RowBox[{"UnitQuaternionQ", "[",             StyleBox["q", "TI"], "]"}]], "InlineFormula"],          "\[LineSeparator]gives ",          Cell[BoxData[           TemplateBox[{Cell["True"],"paclet:ref/True"},            "RefLink",            BaseStyle->"InlineFormula"]], "InlineFormula"],          " if ",          Cell[BoxData[           StyleBox["q", "TI"]], "InlineFormula"],          " is a unit quaternion and ",          Cell[BoxData[           TemplateBox[{Cell["False"],"paclet:ref/False"},            "RefLink",            BaseStyle->"InlineFormula"]], "InlineFormula"],          " otherwise."         }]]}       }]], "Usage",      GridBoxOptions->{      GridBoxBackground->{       "Columns" -> {{None}}, "ColumnsIndexed" -> {}, "Rows" -> {{None}}, "RowsIndexed" -> {}}},      CellID->16193]      This gives me a lot of clues, but also a large number of things to look up, understand separately, and then piece back together, namely `Cell`, `GridBox`, `TextData`, `BoxData`, `RowBox`, `StyleBox`, `TemplateBox`, `paclet`s as URIs, and everything they depend on. I also find out that when I paste that expression into a new notebook and do `Command-Shift-E`, I get errors, most of which imply that there is a missing stylesheet. From this I infer that notebooks have a secret, implicit "style sheet" attribute, but I don't know how to set it or get it in a general way. When my mouse-focus is in the help box, the `Format` menu does not contain an obvious way for me to snip, copy, borrow, ape, or otherwise access the style sheet. I tried looking for an author's guide in the documentation, but a few quick searches didn't turn up anything on-point.
