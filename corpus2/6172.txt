Is there a way to update dynamic variables through a function. I was looking back at one of the answers from Heike where she showed me how to make my custom `Manipulate`. What I'm finding very annoying is having to copy and paste code for every variable I have to update. Consider this:               Panel[         DynamicModule[             {             a = 1, b = 100,             c = a + b + 1, d = a - b + 1             },              Column[{                 Grid[{                     {                     MyControl[Manipulator[Dynamic[a, (a = #; c = a + b + 1; d = a - b + 1) &], {0, 1}],"a", Dynamic[PaddedForm[a, 5]]],                     MyControl[Manipulator[Dynamic[b, (b = #; c = a + b + 1; d = a - b + 1) &], {100, 200}], "b", Dynamic[PaddedForm[b, 5]]],                     }                     }, Alignment -> Left],                 {Dynamic@c, Dynamic@d}             }],             Initialization :> (                 MyControl[manip_, left_String, right_] := Row[{Style[left, "TI", 14], manip, right}, Spacer[1]];             )         ],          ImageSize -> {600, 100}     ]      This allows me to change `a` and `b` and every time I change them `c` and `d` get updated and they are displayed: ![screenshot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WTaiR.png) Question, is there any way to remove the redundancy of the code? I would love to have a function which updates all the variables, in this case, `c` and `d`. For instance I want something like this:               Panel[         DynamicModule[             {             a = 1, b = 100,             c = a + b + 1, d = a - b + 1             },              Column[{                 Grid[{                     {                     MyControl[Manipulator[Dynamic[a, (a = #; updateVars[]) &], {0, 1}],"a", Dynamic[PaddedForm[a, 5]]],                     MyControl[Manipulator[Dynamic[b, (b = #; updateVars[]) &], {100, 200}], "b", Dynamic[PaddedForm[b, 5]]],                     }                     }, Alignment -> Left],                 {Dynamic@c, Dynamic@d}             }],             Initialization :> (                 MyControl[manip_, left_String, right_] := Row[{Style[left, "TI", 14], manip, right}, Spacer[1]];                 updateVars[] := (c = a + b + 1; d = a - b + 1);             )         ],          ImageSize -> {600, 100}     ]      That way, if later on I introduce something else that needs to be updated every time I move a single sliders then I can just add it to `updateVars`. Unfortunately, the above does not work. Anyone knows how to make it work?
