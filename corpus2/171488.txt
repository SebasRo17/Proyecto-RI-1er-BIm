This is the first time I got one customer and I am developing one application for him in c#.net and winforms. I want to distribute .net framework with my application since customer may not have it installed so I want to give it with my application so that while installing it will see if framework is installed or not and install it accordingly. I want to know, if I want to distribute this application to this customer as well as several other customers in future, which things or licenses I need to purchase like .net framework, visual studio etc. You can consider that I am going to start my small software firm and going to make more of such applications and sell them to various customers.
