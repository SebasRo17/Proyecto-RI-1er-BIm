I'm trying to make a visual proof on the irrationality of $\sqrt{2}$. At the moment, I've created a figure to show that $b^2$ elements always constitute a square: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1A373.png) And I want to show that it's not possible to make a square with $2b^2$ elements but showing all possible trials of mounting a square with these number of elements. My guess is that I'll need something that allows me to contruct arbitrary partitions:               {a,b,c} â†’ {{a},{b,c}}, {{a,b},{c}}, ...      Such that their union is always equals to `{a,b,c}` but I have no idea on how to do it. I've tried a few times with `Subsets` and `Partition` but I got no success until now.
