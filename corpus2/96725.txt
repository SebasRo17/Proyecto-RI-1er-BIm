A client has asked me to update his web app. At the last minute, he has expressed some concern about allowing me access to his database (and thus to sensitive client information), because this is the first time we have worked together and he doesn't know me. As far as I know, there is no way for me to work on this project without having full access to his database. I need to make updates to the database for one thing (adding columns, creating new tables etc). And I need to test the live app when I've updated it and I would be concerned not to have full database access. Is there a way I can work on his project without having access to his sensitive info? Many thanks
