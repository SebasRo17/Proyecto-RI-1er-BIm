Let's say I have artifacts "mylibrary-5.2.jar" and "mylibrary-5.3.jar" representing the 5.2 and 5.3 versions of a library that our project creates and publishes for one of our other projects. Does Artifactory support having multiple "versions" of each of these artifacts to represent the different builds that were performed during a release to construct this artifact? For example, to produce the final version of the 5.2 release of "mylibrary" aka the artifact: **mylibrary-5.2.jar** , we went through 3 builds to get to a version that passed our integration environment's automated tests and our user acceptance tests. So there were three separate builds that produced three separate artifacts for release 5.2. We want to be able to retain and potentially recall these different build's artifact at a later date (for testing, etc). In order to do this, which of the following options would work?   1. Capture the artifacts as separate Artifacts, i.e. build-5.2-b1.jar (build 1's artifact), build-5.2-b2.jar (build 2's artifact), build-5.2-b3.jar (build 3's artifact), and build-5.2.jar (the final production release; which matches build 3)   2. Capture a SINGLE artifact named "build-5.2.jar" which has VERSIONS of the artifact which capture builds 1 through 3 and which can be recalled later, by version number.    3. Some other option we have not considered, but should
