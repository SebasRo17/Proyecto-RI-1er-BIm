I have set of points:               pts={{1.25, 9.75}, {2.5, 9.75}, {2.5, 9.25}, {4, 9.7}, {4, 9.2}, {4,        8.75}, {4, 8.25}, {5.5, 9.7}, {5.5, 9.1}, {5.5, 8.5}, {5.5,        8.0}, {5.5, 7.5}, {7, 9.8}, {7, 9.2}, {7, 8.75}, {7, 8.1}, {7,        7.6}, {9, 9.6}, {9, 9.1}, {9, 8.75}, {9, 8.2}, {9, 7.75}, {11,        9.8}, {11, 9.2}, {11, 8.75}, {13, 9.25}, {13, 9.72}};     ListPlot[pts]      and a bounding line:               x = {0, 2.5, 5, 10, 15};     y = {10, 8.27, 7, 7.5, 10};     b=Transpose[{x,y}];     ListLinePlot[b]      How to create a bounded diagram plot? When I use:               Needs["ComputationalGeometry`"]     BoundedDiagram[b, pts]      I get a lot of errors like:               Part::partw: Part 1 of {} does not exist. >>     Part::partw: Part 1 of {} does not exist. >>     Part::pspec: Part specification {}[[1,2]] is neither a machine-sized integer nor a list of machine-sized integers. >>     Part::pspec: Part specification {}[[1,2]] is neither a machine-sized integer nor a list of machine-sized integers. >>      Which don't really let me understand why it doesn't work. Voronoi diagram, convex hull or delaunay triangulation works just perfect on these points.
