Do you get the sense that Wolfram Alpha plays dumb sometimes? Like sometimes I can get it to obey a Flatten command by itself, or maybe Flatten _and_ Sort, but if I try to put that into a Table, it instead responds with the Mathematica documentation of the Table command. Wolfram Alpha also seems to me to be completely incapable of Plus@@ or Times@@ anything, though sometimes I can get Sum to work.
