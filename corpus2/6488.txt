u = 2/(1 + Z1) Sech[T/Z1 + 1/(9 Z1) Log[1 + Z1]]^2;     w = 2/(1 + Z2) Sech[T/Z2 + 1/(9 Z2) Log[1 + Z2]]^2;     Z1 = 5;     Z2 = 10;               Plot[{u, w}, {T, -15, 15}, PlotRange -> {0, 0.45}, Frame -> True,       Axes -> {False, False},       Epilog -> {Inset[         Graphics[{DotDashed, Line[{{0, 0}, {0.19, 0}}]}], {10, 0.41}],         Inset["z=0.1", {13, 0.41}],         Inset[Graphics[{Dashed, Line[{{0, 0}, {0.19, 0}}]}], {10, 0.38}],         Inset["z=0.2", {13, 0.38}]}, PlotStyle -> {DotDashed, Dashed}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ubVTa.png) When I want is to change the format of the plot into EPS, though some parts of the plot programed by using `Epilog` and `Inset` ( I mean `"_._. Z=0.1"` and `"_ _ _Z=0.2"`) change their forms and make the plot unreadable! How can I revise my program? I think I should use `Panel` but I dont know how!
