Here is a sample compiled function:               f := Compile[{x}, ConstantArray[0., 10]; x^2, RuntimeAttributes -> {Listable},             Parallelization->True,  CompilationTarget -> "C"]      Using with a single argument works fine:               f[10.0] = 100.0;      But using it in parallel gives an error message:               f[{10.0,20.0}]      > `CompiledFunction::pext:` Instruction 1 in «original function» calls > ordinary _Mathematica_ code that can be evaluated on only one thread at a > time. >> The problem is in the `ConstantArray[0.,10]`, which is not even being used. Replacing it with `Table[0.,{10}]` fixes the problem. Any ideas?
