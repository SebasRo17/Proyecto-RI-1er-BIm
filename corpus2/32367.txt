My objective is to work out commutators like this $$[f(x,y)\partial_x^2+g(x,y)\partial_x+h(x,y),a(x,y)\partial_x^2+b(x,y)\partial_x+c(x,y)]$$ or $$[f(x,y)\partial_x^2+g(x,y)\partial_x+h(x,y),a(x,y)\partial_y^2+b(x,y)\partial_y+c(x,y)]$$ by starting from simpler commutator identities, for example, using $$[\partial_x,f(x,z)]=f_x(x,z)$$ it is easy to derive $$[\partial^2_x,f(x,z)]=2f_x(x,z)\partial_x+f_{xx}(x,z)$$ and so on, until I get to the first two commutators that I want. But how can I do that with Mathematica? My difficulty is that I don't know how to teach Mathematica to use identities like the third equation to derive the fourth and up to the first two.
