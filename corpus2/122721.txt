When documenting software I traditionally write a plain text file (like a README.txt) which works well, but unfortunately cannot contain images like HTML can. Unfortunately images must be stored as separate files with a normal HTML document (using <a href=".../foo.png">) which give unnecessary clutter. The "Save a single web-page" in Internet Explorer use MIME HTML (MHTML) to save all resources within a single file. The requirement of having to use a browser to read it, is not a impediment these days. Apparently Opera and Word support editing these documents directly. We use git for our source code, hence the differences as seen by git between two edits of the same documents should not be large to avoid unnecessary disk usage and unusable diff's when looking at the document outside the MTHML editor. What is the best mainstream HTML editor for producing git-friendly MHTML files?
