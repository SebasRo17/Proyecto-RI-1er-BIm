I face various types of applications (web-based, GUI-based, command-line, etc.) on various platforms (Windows, Linux, etc.) to operate everyday. There is a great opportunity for me to automate tasks by scripting. But almost every type of application and platform has its **native** scripting language or tools (such as VBScript and PowerShell for Windows, Bash scripts for Linux, Selenium for web applications, and AutoIt for GUI applications, etc.). It kills me to learn and maintain so many scripting languages. I have a feeling that Ruby can interoperate with various platforms easily, and it is very expressive. So my question is:   1. It is possible to use Ruby to script everything?   2. If it is, what are the main disadvantages compared to the **native** scripting language of each platform?
