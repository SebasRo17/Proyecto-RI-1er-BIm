I suck at estimates. When someone asks me how long something will take, I don't even dare to make a guess since I will be completely off the mark. Usually I'm way too optimistic, and should probably multiply my guess with some large X factor... How can I learn to make better estimates? It's not taught at my uni, and even though we have deadlines for all laborations I never think about how long something will actually take. Which I should. For everyone's sake (especially mine).
