I would like to convert a number into base 2 and then use `IntegerDigits[]` on it. When using `BaseForm[i,2]`, the notebook only displays the output in a wrapper, but does not actually convert the number into a base 2 sequence. This causes problems when I want to use `IntegerDigits[]` on the base 2 number to get a list of the binary digits, e.g. `{1,0,0,1,1}`. It simply displays `IntegerDigits[10011 2]`. How could I solve this? Thank you
