~~At my company we are starting a course for free that will cover 4 modules (`HTML / CSS and W3C Standards, Javascript and jQuery, PHP, MySQL`) during 7 months. The main goal is to be able to train new possible employees and at the same time share knowledge with programming enthusiasts, although it is very personalized (8 - 10 people). The dynamic is: one 4 hours class (with a break) every week, and a big homework that includes investigation and practice. Also once a week students come to the office to work on real life examples and get help with their homework. This would be the third time we do this. We were no teachers when we started but feel satisfied in general with the results. However there is always room for improvement, we have noticed for instance some difficulty when trying to introduce programming for the first time (`javascript`) also when switching from event based to procedural (`php`) programming. My question is , are there any advices or guidelines based on experience that you can give us in order to improve the learning experience? What are resources that we should take into account for teaching web development from scratch?~~ > **UPDATE** : To make it a wider question, what are good dynamics (or > advices) that can improve the learning process in a web programming course?
