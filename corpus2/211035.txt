When you have a function that wraps another one in Scala. What do you call the nested function? I found this :               def factorial(i: Int): Int = {            def fact(i: Int, accumulator: Int): Int = {          if (i <= 1)             accumulator          else             fact(i - 1, i * accumulator)       }            fact(i, 1)          }      I usually use just _do_ because it is shorter, generic, and explicit. But is there a better way or a naming convention for nested functions?               def myFunction() = {            def do(i: Int) = {         ...       }       do(1)          }
