I'm developing an application for Android/Java. This application is a kind of password manager, so I'm storing encrypted passwords under the hood of a master password. There are a number of encryption algorythms DES/AES/BlowFish/TwoFish and so on. My intention is to develop application which is free of commercial copyright issues. So the questions are:   1. If I use built-in Java encryption API's (e.g. DES/AES)- does it mean that I will be free from possible commercial interests of DES/AES alike copyright holders?   2. Encryption algorythms sometimes are export limited, keeping in mind that I'm from Moscow/Russia - are there any implications of that fact? Any other thoughts would be helpful.
