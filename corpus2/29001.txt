I apologize for my unclear question, I will write it in a more detailed way. I first define:               g[τ_, ϵ_] := c /. FindRoot[2.` c^4 - 1.6931471805599454` c^4 τ -      0.8611473146305157` τ^2 +      0.25` τ^2 Log[ϵ^(1/6)/c^(       2/3)] + (1.` c^4 +         0.6732867951399863` τ) τ Log[τ] -      0.125` τ^2 Log[τ]^2 -      0.25` τ^2 Log[-0.6931471805599453` + Log[τ]], {c, 1000}]      The function I am trying to solve is as follows: ![!\[I am still learning how to type equations here, in order not to cause to many problems for you guys to read. I use picture to express my equtions](http://i.stack.imgur.com/R8m51.gif) ]1 I can plot $\zeta_2 (r)$ in the region $1<r<\tau/2$ for different values of $a, \tau, \epsilon$, where $a>0$, $\tau>2$, $10^{-7}<\epsilon<10^{-2}$. what I need to do is to find the smallest value of r satisfying $\zeta_2(r)=0$. I use Findroot to do it. but it does not work well all the way through the parameter region. The second question is that supposing we find the smallest value of $r$, which is $h[a,\tau,\epsilon]$, I need to do a integration, which is defined as:               w[a_, τ_, ϵ_] := Integrate[Evaluate[{Subscript[ζ, 2][r]^2} /. f[a, τ, ϵ]], {r, 1, h[a,τ, ϵ]}]      As a test, I choose $a=1, \tau=5, \epsilon=10^{-6}, h(a,\tau,\epsilon)=1.2$, but $w(1,5,10^{-6})$ does not return me a number. So how should I define $w$ to get a number? The last question is if I have got the right definition of $w$, set the derivative $D[w,{a,1}]=0$, and find $a$ in terms of $\tau, \epsilon$. I am getting stocked by doing the derivative of functions. Thanks very much. By the way, I hope this time that Mr.Wizard won't wasting time on revising my writing. I am really sorry
