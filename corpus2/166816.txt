There is an AGPLv3 based software (Client) that makes web service calls (using SOAP) to another software (Server - commercial, cloud based). There is no common code or any connection whatsoever between these two except for the web service calls being made. My questions -   1. Does the Server need to be AGPL too? I guess not - but would like to confirm.   2. Let us say the end point URL for the Server can be configured on the Client side (by editing an XML file) to connect it to different Servers (again, there is no connection other than the webservice calls being made) does it require any of these Servers being AGPL?   3. Are there any issues in running the Client as a DLL that is loaded by other commercial applications on users' desktops? Does it require these other applications also to be AGPL?
