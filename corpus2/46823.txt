I'm trying to turn `Off` an error in an expression.               myFunction[x_] = 1/x     myFunction2[x_] = Quiet[1/x]  (*1/x*)     myFunction[0]     myFunction2[0]      I do not want to use `:=`, I also do not want to Globally turn Off this error. I want it using `=` such that it looks like:               myFunction3[x_] = TurnedOffError[1/x]  (*TurnedOffError[1/x]*)     myFunction3[0]
