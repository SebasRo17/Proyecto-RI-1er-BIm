I have a tree:                   a        / \       b   c      / \     d   f        / \        g   h      And the pattern:                   x        / \       y   z      / \     q   p      As output I would like to have:               x: a     y: b     z: c     q: d     p: f      and               x: b     y: f     z: c     q: g     p: h      Is there any algorithm I could look at?
