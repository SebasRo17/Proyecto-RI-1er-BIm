I am looking to read a few bytes from `/dev/random` on OS X and Linux. The simplest approach fails on both operating systems (see below). Why? What is a workaround?               In[1]:= random = OpenRead["/dev/random"]          During evaluation of In[1]:= OpenRead::noopen: Cannot open /dev/random. >>          Out[1]= $Failed          In[2]:= BinaryRead["/dev/random", "Integer32"]          During evaluation of In[2]:= BinaryRead::nffil: File not found during BinaryRead[/dev/random,Integer32]. >>          Out[2]= $Failed
