I often hear that scala has a ability to pass function as a parameter to another function. I would like to know the difference between passing a value as a parameter vs passing function itself as the parameter. How the latter approach brings advantage to the programming. If functions are passed as the parameter how the object references are being created since functions are not tied to any objects.
