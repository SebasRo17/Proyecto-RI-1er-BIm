I hope it is appropriate to ask this question here. I was going to ask at stackflow. A very general question. There are loads of ecommerce web based applications about, such as prostores, eshop, exactabacus.com etc. It appears a lot of them already have atemplate ready (with few options). I am just wondering if there are developers out there that offer custom built ecommerce applications,for both b2c and b2b? Thanks
