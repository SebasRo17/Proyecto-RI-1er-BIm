How do Valve create games that run on Linux, Mac and Windows? I imagine they dont really write one version for each platform bec that would just be a nightmare.. or do they? I imagine it is written in a portable C++ code (or C#?) but I wanted to know more details about this. I've developed an app on Adobe AIR and considering on porting it to a diff language as Adobe abandoned linux support.
