Does putting the view logic inside the controller increase page load speed? Because I have a controller action calling a view which I am loading through ajax and I am getting a very slow response. Why is that happening? Does putting the view logic inside controller like...               echo "<div>View echoed</div>"      a good way to code? does this increase efficiency? I have writted a controller action like               class Ajax extends CI_Controller{        foo ($id){        $data = $this->model->get_data();//has joins in query        $this->load->view($data);      }     }      In view, I have used two foreach loops nested to get the table having about 100 rows and I load the view through a jquery ajax request to the url ajax/foo/1 My question clearly is whether it is a good practice to put view-logic into the controller for ajax calls? will it increase the speed my page will load. I am new to coding things very professionally. Is this a good and a professional method or any other alternative available.
