If so, can you tell me how learning a new paradigm changed your approach for solving programming problems even if the problem is in another paradigm/language/technology? I will really appreciated If you can tell me in a specific manner, how your X (ie: JAVA/C#/C++) programming skills improved by learning Y (ie: Scheme/Prolog/Lisp). Also, what paradigms do you suggest helps the most to become a good programmer? My experiences are only structured - OOP, imperative - procedural, and into some extent template meta-programming, but my goal is not to learn another language, but rather to learn different approaches for solving problems. Thanks!
