Suppose that I have a list               {{{2, 1}, {4, 3}, {2, 4}}, {{2, 1}, {4, 3}, {3, 1}},      {{2, 1}, {2, 4}, {3, 1}}, {{4, 3}, {2, 4}, {1, 2}}}      I want to make a new list that only contains the entries for which the first component of each pair does not repeat itself. So for example, the element               {{2, 1}, {4, 3}, {2, 4}}      would be eliminated since `2` appears in the first component of both `{2,1}` and `{2,4}`. Likewise, `{{2, 1}, {2, 4}, {3, 1}}` will also be eliminated. Is there a simple condition I can use with the `Select` function to do this? Thanks in advance.
