I am in my early 40s and plan to enroll in university this fall to pursue a long-postponed CS degree. I have been working as a developer for almost 20 years, but have found further advancement at this stage of my career difficult without a degree. Plus, I've always wanted to get one, I have a hunger for learning, and I'd still have 20 years ahead of me after graduation before retirement. I started at a junior college out of high school, but only completed about 16 hours, so I'm basically starting from scratch. I'm excited, but apprehensive. In high school, I was very good at math - took Trig/Pre-calc, etc. and did well. I scored high in math on the ACT/SATs. However, 20 years of database- driven application development has not required any higher math, and I know I am quite rusty. **What specific topics/areas in mathematics do I need to review and master over the next 6 months to give me a fighting chance in Calc I (and beyond) come fall?** Your help is greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time.
