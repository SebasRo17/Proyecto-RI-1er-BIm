My company is building a website with database. Programmer's used PHP 5.0. My Service Provider (shared) in the meantime upgraded to PHP 5.3.0. Fixes have been on going and seem endless... Do I move to VPS and install older PHP or should we rebuild with newer PHP? When working remotely with programers what is the protocol regarding delivery of all code? Please what is the industry standard? I need an independent to review their work. How should this be approached?
