I am getting errors like:               Part::partd:         Part specification standardBasis[[1]] is longer than depth of object.      with the following Manipulate expression:               Clear[  e1, e2, standardBasis, y]     e1 := {1, 0}     e2 := {0, 1}     standardBasis := {e1, e2}     y := 3     Manipulate[      p := {x, y} ;      Clear[j];      arrowsReference = Table[Arrow[{p, p + Part[standardBasis, j]}], {j, 2}]      , {{x, 1}, -10, 10} ]      The odd thing about it is that this only occurs immediately after starting Mathematica, on the source file that contains this manipulate. A second shift- enter on the expression after that works without complaint and I get the desired result. This appears to be related to the startup of mathematica using specific notebooks. The sequence I'm using is:   * go to windows explorer.   * double click on a .nb or .cdf file with this source.   * click enable-dynamics.   * get the error.   * shift-enter: error goes away. whereas if I take a notebook that is blank and already opened and then cut and paste this source into it, I don't get any errors about the `Part[]` expressions.
