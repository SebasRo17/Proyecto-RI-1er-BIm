I was reading Extreme Programming Explained, Second Edition and in the chapter 11 "The Theory of Constraints" the authors talk about the old and obsolete **"push" development model** and the XP way, the **"pull" development model**. It looks like a quite important concept, but it takes only a very small paragraph and two images that are mere illustrations of the "waterfall" and iterative process, nothing specific about these models except by the image caption. I searched and it doesn't go any further about it in the rest of the book. I couldn't find any further explanations or discussions about it in the Internet either. If the only difference about those is that one is **"waterfall"** and the other is **iterative** , them why push and why pull? Does anyone understand what is really the difference between those two and give some good examples?
