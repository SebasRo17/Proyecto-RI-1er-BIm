Some days ago I started working in an open source project. The project was from a famous organization and they have many projects, but unfortunately I found that no one is actively working in the project I've chosen right at now (although there are several people subscribed to the developer mailing list for that project). But I decided to work there as the project seems to be relatively easy and a good starting point for me, as I didn't work in a big project before. The team leader of the project welcomed me. I found out two bugs and then submitted the patches. I also asked them what kind of contribution they need from me for this project. But it has been three days and no one gave any reply. I want to work more, but I'm loosing my zeal as I'm thinking that I'm not getting proper attention. Is it a normal scenario? Or I'm really not getting proper attention? How much help and attention I can expect from the community?
