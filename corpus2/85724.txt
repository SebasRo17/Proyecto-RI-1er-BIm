I want to get my certification in .NET, which certification is the best for me? For the past 8 months I have been working in the .NET 3.5 and 4.0 frameworks. How can I grow myself by appearing this exams? I know that "certs != experience", but I still want to get certified. Right now I am working in PHP 5.3 and PostgreSQL but I want to switch directions because .NET pays a good salary package as compared to PHP.
