I'm working (slowly) on a small Flask project. One of my models is a class called `Post`, which is a lightweight `namedtuple`. `Post` objects are created by a `PostFactory`, because creating a `Post` involves hitting a database. The `PostFactory` holds the necessary database connection, so the `Post` objects can be serialized. What part of the model/view/controller division does a factory object naturally fit in? Is it part of the models, since it's tightly coupled with `Post` objects? Or is it a controller, since it manipulates models?
