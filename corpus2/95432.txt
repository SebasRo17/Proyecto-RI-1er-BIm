I am a C++ programmer and have worked on various web apps using Perl, Ruby, etc.. I have decent a knowledge of Java as well. The problem I face while applying for jobs is companies have specific requirements like, "Experience with C# 3.5/4. Should have experience experience building web apps with ASP.NET". What should you do in these situations?   1. Not consider these companies and look for companies with your expertise?   2. Just put that in your resume, and learn the technology before interviews? After all, how hard is it for a developer to wrap their brains around new languages?   3. Try to convince the employer in the cover letter that you are good at one thing but can a learn a new language a tool pretty easily?   4. Something else?
