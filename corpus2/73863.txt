As a software developer, one of my main tasks is to keep complexity under control. However, in some projects, there is a moment when the complexity level grows so high that it reaches some kind of "no return" point. Past this moment, you can never return the project to an acceptable level of complexity in less time than you would need to rewrite everything from scratch. Does this particular moment have a name in programmers dialect (something similar than the Godwin's law for trolls)? \--edit-- Sorry if I'm not clear. I don't think this "moment" has an official name, or is a serious metric. I was thinking about something in the spirit of the "Ballmer peak" in xkcd.
