I've heard that you shouldn't let search engines index your development server. The reasons given were:   * Duplicate content penalties   * Customers making purchases from an unsecured domain (if eCommerce) These issues may seem relatively minor and I'm not sure it would be enough to convince someone to put in the effort to lock down the server. Aren't there broader security concerns? What should be secured and why?
