This is what I want               Manipulate[ Plot[ Which[h < a, 1 - 1.5 h/a + 0.5 (h/a)^3, h >= a, 0], {h, 0, 8}],                 {a, 5, 10}]      Is it possible to rewrite it as something like the following?               f[h_] := Which[ h < a, 1 - 1.5 h/a + 0.5 (h/a)^3, h >= a, 0];     Manipulate[ Plot[ f[h], {h, 0, 8}], {a, 5, 10}]      Seems it doesn't work for me. Any suggestion is appreciated.
