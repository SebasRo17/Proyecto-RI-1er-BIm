I am trying to write unit tests in javascript for an application made in nodejs. What I want to know is - Say there is a class Vehicles which is dependent on another class Roads.   1. Should I mock the Roads class and send it as a parameter to Vehicles for unit testing? OR Should I just create a new object and send it as a parameter to Vehicles?   2. If I change the Roads class I will have to change the mocking every where?   3. Should I use a factory to create mocked objects?
