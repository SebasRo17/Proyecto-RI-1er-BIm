I have a question regarding the real value of having NCSA's certifications. Today I reach their site and I easily passed the JavaScript certification within minutes, but I never reach questions related to Literal Javascript Notation (Json), closures or browser specific APIs. This facts let me to doubt a bit of the real value of the test (and the proper certification you can have if you pay them $34), but maybe Im wrong and just earned a respected certification within the States for easy questions... in which case I can spend some time doing other certifications on the same site. Did you have an NCSA certification and think is worth having it in your resume, or you know of a better certification program?
