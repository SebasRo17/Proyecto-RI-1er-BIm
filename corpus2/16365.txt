Apart from the obvious questions relating to specific project work someone is working on are there any questions I should be asking a fellow dev who is leaving the company? So far I am thinking about;   * Locations of things on the server he uses that not maybe everyone does.   * Credentials he has set up that we wouldn't have needed.    * Client details he has not yet saved into our CRM system.
