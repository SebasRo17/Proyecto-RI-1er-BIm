I'm a programmer who understand html & css, but got no taste. My company decided to redesign our e-commerce website with new UI and move to ASP.Net MVC. They want a really good design, so they hire 2 designers to work with me, remotely. First designer to create design mockups (PSD/PNG) Second designer another one to slice the design into HTML/CSS/Images/etc.. Then, my part is to use the HTML/css as the template files (as View files in ASP.Net MVC project) Usually, even if the designer get involved in the project since the beginning, I still have to discuss many things with designer. sit together with the designer drawing something on papers and then see it directly the designer working with Adobe Fireworks, while the designer can ask if the change is feasible or not. Now I will work with designers, remotely, to redesign exisiting website. so, I will need to explain many things about this website with both of them, remotely. I would ask any of you who used to work with designer, remotely and have tips to share on how to make the collaboration more effective? Thanks :)
