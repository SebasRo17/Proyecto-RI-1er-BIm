I wish to get the list of inwards edges for a node. `IncidenceList` provides both inwards and outwards list. I can of course filter with `Cases` using the following way. But is there any better way or built-in function for the same?               InBoundEdges[graph_, x_] := Cases[IncidenceList[graph, x], _ \[DirectedEdge] x]      When I use the `InBoundEdges` function in one of my simulation functions I am getting _MaxFormatDepthExceeded exception_ , even for a smaller number of nested operations. I need around _10000 number of iterations_. Lets take an Example,               g = Graph[{1 -> 2, 3 -> 2, 2 -> 5, 4 -> 2, 2 -> 6, 1 -> 4, 3 -> 5, 6 -> 4}];     IncidenceList[g, 2]     IncidenceList[g, 2][[All, 1]]     InBoundEdges[g, 2]      Now `IncidenceList[g, 2]` gives               {1 -> 2, 3 -> 2, 2 -> 5, 4 -> 2, 2 -> 6}      but I only need `{1 -> 2, 3 -> 2, 4 -> 2}` which I can get with `InBoundEdges` written above. However it is not an efficient solution.
