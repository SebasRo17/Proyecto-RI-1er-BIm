When I can't remember an integral I usually just query wolfram and have it show steps. This was my naive attempt at trying to make a simpler function.                wolfram[query_] =       WolframAlpha[ToString[query], IncludePods -> "Input",        AppearanceElements -> {"Pods"}, PodStates -> {"Input__Show steps"}]      It doesn't work. I'm completely clueless :) More generally I'm asking: How would I create a permanent function to simplify something this... verbose ?
