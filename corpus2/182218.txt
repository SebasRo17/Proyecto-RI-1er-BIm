Sources usually mention that dynamically created variables are allocated on the heap, while functions' variables on the stack. Also the ones on the stack cease to exist automatically when e.g. the function which contains the variable exits. If I understand correctly, data fields of class are on the heap. I do not understand, what is meant by 'dynamic'? As I see it, when the code is running, anything being created is created dynamically on the fly, be it function variables or objects with variables inside them. I would be glad for simple explanation. Thanks
