When I'm writing code in the front-end, I find myself very often looking up the list of options of a symbol over and over again in the documentation center. In most cases you find there a list of available options, but sometimes not and you may end up typing `Options[Get]` in your current notebook. Even worse is the situation with `Attributes` which are extremely helpful especial when you do something with non-standard evaluation. In this case, I often just want to know _Does a function hold its arguments?_ or _Is this function listable?_ to give two examples. **Question:** Isn't there a one-click palette solution for this?
