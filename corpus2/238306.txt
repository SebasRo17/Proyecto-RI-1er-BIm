I've just spent hours debugging some code because I forgot (actually never considered it) that `TextView.getText()` returns `CharSequence` that may be in fact a mutable class... Shouldn't it return (immutable) `String` instead? I mean I can't imagine a situation when you want to share a state with a text field, at least not by default. Isn't that something that can be objectively called a design mistake in a library?
