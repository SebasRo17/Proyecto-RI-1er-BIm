I'm trying to find a way to plot the graph               g := Graph[{a\[UndirectedEdge]b, b\[UndirectedEdge]c, c\[UndirectedEdge]a,         a\[UndirectedEdge]d, d\[UndirectedEdge]b, d\[UndirectedEdge]e, e\[UndirectedEdge]b},d\[UndirectedEdge]c]      onto a sphere, so that it can be shown that although there isn't a crossing on the sphere there is when projected on the $\mathbb{R}^2$-plane. Here is something much like what I'd like to see: $\hspace{6cm}$![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5Ou0v.jpg) Further, how does one manipulate a graph? I mean, move the points around as you would in reality if the vertices were connected with rubber bands. This is what I'm doing as an alternative to not knowing how to manipulate graphs in Mathematica 8: ![Image](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pK53U.jpg)
