I have created a small web-app and want to deploy it. I have used struts2 and mysql for the database. The problem is that I do not have a static ip to run the app on my machine. Can anyone suggest me hosting services that host java pages and mysql? Since this is a project I am not doing for money, I would prefer free servers even if they are allowing usage for a short period of time.
