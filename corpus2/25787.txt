I am solving some equations in 4 variables, however, there are many solutions which are basically the same but changing relative signs of each other ... i.e. {x->-1,y->1} and {x->1,y->-1}. Nevertheless I am only interested in solutions with positive values for x and negative values for y. Is there anyway to implement this in NSolve? I was trying to add an additional equation               NSolve[eq1==a&&eq2==b ... &&y<0,{x,y}]      However, this is not working. Is it the wrong way tom implement it?
