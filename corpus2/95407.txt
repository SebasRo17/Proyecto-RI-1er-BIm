I have professionally working with Zend Framework for about a year. No major complaints. With some modifications, it has done a good job. I'm beginning to work on a side project where I want to heavily rely on MongoDb and Doctrine. I thought it might be a good idea to broaden my horizons and learn another enterprise level framework. There seems to be a lot a buzz about Symfony. After quickly looking over the site and documentation, I must say I came away pretty underwhelmed. I'm woundering what, if anything, Symfony has to offer that Zend doesn't? What would the advantage be in choosing Symfony?
