I'm programming a jQuery functionality for doing a search on articles while the user is typing in the search field. I implemented a bind in jQuery that at every `keyup`, it sets a `clearTimeout` and a `setTimeout` to the actual function doing the `post` to the server. This is because users can be writing something and I want to avoid multiple `post`s. I got "stuck" with: from the user interface point of view, what time should I set for the `setTimeout`? I tried different times (1s, 1.5s, 0.5s) but I have to admit the choice seems kind of random to me. This raised the broader question: Is there any reference or study that answers the question of what are the "optimal" times for dynamic web interfaces? I only now noticed that I've used more timers before (e.g. slides), that were also chosen "randomly". Putting in other terms, does anyone knows how to _justify_ why a given event in web interface has (or should have) a specific delta-time or range of delta- times? (I'm sorry if this question is not adequate to here, It seemed to me closer than SO.)
