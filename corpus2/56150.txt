Thanks in advance for anyone who read this. I have a peak profile `data` like this:               DD = 100; theta2B = 13.742; Lamda = 0.999047433;     ϕ[DD_, theta2_] := 2 Pi DD (Sin[theta2/360*Pi] - Sin[theta2B/360*Pi]) /Lamda;     profile = 1/ϕ[DD, theta2]^2 - Sin[2 ϕ[DD, theta2]]/ϕ[DD, theta2]^3 + (     1 - Cos[2 ϕ[DD, theta2]])/(2 ϕ[DD, theta2]^4);     data = Transpose[{Table[i, {i, 7, 20, 0.01}],      Table[profile, {theta2, 7, 20, 0.01}]}];     ListPlot[data, PlotRange -> All]      And I have _Gaussian_ , _Lorentzian_ , and _Hat_ functions like this:               GUA[x_] := PDF[NormalDistribution[13.742, fwhm1/Sqrt[8 Log[2]]], x]     LUA[x_] := PDF[CauchyDistribution[13.742, fwhm2/2], x]     HAT[x_] := UnitStep[x + fwhm3/2] - UnitStep[x - fwhm3/2]      Now I want to fit the convolution of `GUA[x]`, `LUA[x]`, and `HAT[x]` to above peak profile `data`. The `fwhm1` `fwhm2` and `fwhm3` need be defined from the best fitting. Does anyone know how to do this? Thanks very much. P.S. I searched the documentation centre and found that the function `Convolve` cannot generate an analysis formula of `GUA[x] * LUA[x] * HAT[x]` (* is convolution).
