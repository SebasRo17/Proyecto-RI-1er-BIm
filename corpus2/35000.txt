I need to plot a complex implicit function, `ContourPlot` in this case is not very convenient for me. Therefore, I want to plot my function using discrete points. I think this simple approach is convenient, both for me to understand and for those who I want to help. So let's plot the unit circle using `ListPlot`. I can do it in this way (I'm sure there is much simpler way):               y[x_] := y /. FindRoot[x^2 + y^2 == 1, {y, 0.01}]     data = Table[{x, y[x]}, {x, -1, 1, 0.1}]     y2[x_] := y2 /. FindRoot[x^2 + y2^2 == 1, {y2, -0.01}]     data2 = Table[{x, y2[x]}, {x, -1, 1, 0.1}]     ListPlot[{data, data2}, PlotStyle -> {Black, Black}, AspectRatio -> 1]      Now I want to set constraint on the solution of y, say `y < 0.5`. How could I do this by using `Select`?
