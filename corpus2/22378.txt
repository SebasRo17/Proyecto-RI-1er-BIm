Suppose I have                listA = {M, F}      and               ListB = {a,b,c}      I want to make a new               listC = {{Ma, Mb, Mb, Mb, Mc, Mc}, {Fa, Fb, Fb, Fb, Fc, Fc}}       Where I tell Mathematica how many copies of a particular element to make in listC. `Outer[]` seems like a good start but it returns the combined elements as a two item list. For example I get `{M, a}` instead of `M a`.
