Here is a typical issue: `Simplify[x + y, x = y]` produces `2 True`. Is there a way to detect operator `Set` in assumptions and issue a warning? **Update:** As Mr.Wizard suggested it is possible to write a wrapper for `Simplify` that will check the second argument. But since there are many built-in functions which use assumptions it will be cumbersome to overload them all. Maybe there is a more simple way?
