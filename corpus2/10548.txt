I tried to plot the region bounded by the three planes. This is supposed to give me a pyramid type of shape (actually two, but I am just taking one of them). The code is given by               RegionPlot3D[      x - Sqrt[2]*z >= 0 && Sqrt[2]*x + Sqrt[3]*y + z >= 0 &&        Sqrt[2]*x - Sqrt[3]*y + z >= 0, {x, 0, 12}, {y, -20, 20}, {z, -20,        20}, AxesLabel -> Automatic, Mesh -> None,       PlotStyle -> Directive[Yellow, Opacity[0.5]]]      I am getting kinkiness in the lines created by joining of two planes, ![plot of pyramid](http://i.stack.imgur.com/MfMsB.png) Is it a problem in my graphics card? However, I have checked in different machines and in versions 6, 7 and 8. I got the same situation in all of them. May be it is the similar kind of problem as posted here. I am not sure exactly what modification has to be made. Advanced thanks for any help.
