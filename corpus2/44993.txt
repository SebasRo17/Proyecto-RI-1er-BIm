Assume following code :               Do[        i1 = RandomInteger[{1, 5}];        i2 = RandomInteger[{1, 5}];        While[i1 == i2,  i2 = RandomInteger[{1, 5}]]         , {k, 1, 4}];`      This code makes two `RandomIntegers` which are `i1` and `i2`. I have used `While` loop to avoid making repeated Random numbers in each iteration. But I don't know how it is possible to avoid making repeated Random numbers in whole iterations. For example, following result is the answer after 4 iteration and it is not acceptable : > >      i1=1, i2=2 >      i1=3, i2=2 >      i1=1, i2=2 >      i1,4, i2=1 >   `i1=1` and `i2=2` are repeated twice after 4 iterations. I would be appreciated if someone could help me with this problem.
