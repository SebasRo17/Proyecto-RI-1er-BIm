I wish to construct a Normal Plot to visually test for normality of data. My data is: > {188,199,171,200,219,172,235,194,234,206} And needs to be plotted to look something like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BOPxa.jpg) Whereby the data points are sorted from low to high and then plotted against the mid-point of their probability bins. So, in this case there are 10 data points so 10 bins with mid points of 5%, 15%, 25% etc. For this data, you would then see the lowest value (171) plotted at (171,5%), the next value (172) plotted at (172,15%) and so on. Any ideas where I can find the answers?
