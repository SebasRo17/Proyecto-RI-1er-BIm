I'm not so hot on the maths for this but for what I understand... A graph g exists with v vertices and edges. g = (V,E); The spanning graph for this is an acyclic copy of this where all the vertices are present, and all the edges are a subset of the graph with the condition that each connection is distinct. Apparently the MST should have n-1 nodes. How can this be proven ? **Sources:** http://youtu.be/zFbq8vOZ_0k?t=25m1s http://www.gtkesh.com/minimum-spanning-tree/
