In an open source project, a number of other open source libraries have been included to implement needed functionality, some as libraries (LGPL), and some as source code (non-LGPL). The new BSD license was selected for the project. The included open source libraries are licensed under the new BSD, MIT, Apache, and LGPL licenses, but no GPL licensed code. How should these other open source libraries be credited?   Do all the library licenses need to be included in the main project license file?   Is it sufficient to just provide links to the project web sites in the Help->About dialog and documentation?   Is any credit _really_ needed?
