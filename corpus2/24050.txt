My problem is that I have two functions that are described as follows:               x1 =        x[t] /. DSolve[{55 x''[t] + 100*n x'[t] + (5/22)*n x[t] == 5, x'[0] == 1/8, x[0] == 0},          x[t], t][[1]]     x2 =        x[t] /. DSolve[{x''[t] + 1 == 0, x'[0] == 1/8, x[0] == 0}, x[t], t][[1]]      Variable `n` in function `x1` ranges from 1 to 8. I want to find which `n` enables `x1` to come as close to `x2` as possible without falling below `x2`. Or stated otherwise, what is the highest `n` that ensures `x1 > x2` at all times. A plot of the functions reveals that most of the action takes place between `t = 0` and `t = 0.15`. However, the curves are too close to each other to read the right `n` from my screen. I have been trying ways to calculate the difference with integration, solving and all types of manners for hours now, but I'm certain there must be an easier way to achieve this within _Mathematica_.
