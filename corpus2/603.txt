Most of the Mathematica users beyond beginner level will be aware of the phenomenon of _Packed Arrays_. The user-accessible functions related to packed arrays live in the `Developer``context and have been there for quite some time. I wonder what this means for their future use. Is `Developer`` more stable than `Experimental``? Can we expect this functionality to move into the kernel and what calling strategies could we adopt to minimize the effects such a move would have?
