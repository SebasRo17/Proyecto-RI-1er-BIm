When an application allows emails to be sent to it to either reply to comments or add todos, trimming those emails for just the relevant text becomes a problem, since there are many different standards. Many times you'll end up seeing things like this: > Hey Joe, good to hear from you. Let me know when you'll be back in town.   >  **_Posted by Bob, 30 minutes ago_** > > * * * > > I'll be back on the 13th. > > \--   >  Sincerely,   >  Joseph R. Roberts   >  Senior Partner > > This communication is confidential and is property of Whatever Law Firm.   >  **_Posted by Joe, 10 seconds ago_** Signatures are probably the most difficult to get rid of, and quoted text the easiest. I imagine any comprehensive strategy for trimming will be multi- facted, and ideally, learning. I think a good system should:   1. Remove quoted body   2. Remove quote headers ("On 15 October, Joe wrote:")   3. Remove signatures   4. Preserve anything that was typed manually. What steps would a system need to take to accomplish this, and what pitfalls should it be aware of? * * * This answer is a good example of a useful answer to a similar question
