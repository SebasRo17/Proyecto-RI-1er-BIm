We're using JIRA to keep track of issues in our software projects. One effect we noticed is that we often create a new issue but we don't knw yet when/if the problem is going to be fixed at all. So we invented a fake 'Distant Future' milestone which such issues get assigned to. As it happens, the pile of issues assigned to this milestone keeps growing all the time so it seems this is not a good approach. There are so many of them by now that it became quite a lot of work to review all of them for validity. Some of them became invalid since the component they are related to you was removed. Some of them were duplicated by other issues. Some of them have such a poorly phrased description that nobody really knows what they are about anymore. How do other software development teams deal with issues which are valid, but which might not get fixed anytime. Do you bother recording them at all? Do you assign them to the next planned version and then look at them again as the next release approaches? Something else?
