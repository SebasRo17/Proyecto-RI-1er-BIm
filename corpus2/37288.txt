After visiting one of the Wolfram presentations, I started writing code for my number theory research project in Mathematica because I found it to be faster than Sage. I downloaded Workbench and Mathematica, watched the video tutorials on the Wolfram website and read the tutorials in the manual. Then I started coding. After being at it for a week, I find the whole experience to be extremely clumsy as I can not figure out any reasonable workflow. What I do now is this: I open Workbench which in turn starts Mathematica notebook. I write a procedure spread over multiple cells in the notebook. When I am happy with the result, I copy the code into the workbench .m file where I make it into a function. Afterwards, I start using the function in the notebook to do my calculations or to use it in other procedures. I am very happy with the control I have over each step in the notebook and coding in workbench feels quite smooth. What really bugs me is the transition between the two. I just can not figure out how to achieve the smooth workflow I am used from IDEs like IntelijIdea in Workbench. Truth is, when I was downloading Workbench, I was expecting it to replace the notebook environment of Mathematica with more serious IDE. Yet it just launches Mathematica and the notebook each time I run the project anyway. So my question is this: What is the proper way to use Workbench to write code? Or is it just my inexperience that makes me think I am doing something wrong? The closest question I found was this: Working in a team in Workbench which talks mainly about version control (which I wanna look at in the next step as git does not seem to cut it). Links to articles or tutorials describing proper workflow in Workbench would be much appreciated as well.
