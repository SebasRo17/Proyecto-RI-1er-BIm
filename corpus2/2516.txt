I might be doing something stupid, but I can't see what it is. This simple example shows that I'm trying to hide the Box, but failing. (I tried it just once, in different positions, too.) The code is a little weird, so that might be the problem...               splot1 = SphericalPlot3D[        Cos[\[Theta]], {\[Theta], 0, Pi}, {\[Phi], 0, Pi}, Mesh -> None,         Boxed -> False, PlotPoints -> 80];          aGraphicsComplex = splot1[[1]];          Graphics3D[{Boxed -> False,        Lighting -> {{"Point", RGBColor[1, .9, .9], {2, 2, 4}}},        Boxed -> False,       aGraphicsComplex /. GraphicsComplex[pts_, objs__] :>          GraphicsComplex[          With[{r = 4 Sin[11 (ArcTan[#[[1]], #[[2]]] + #[[3]] )]},             {r, r, 2} #] & /@ pts, objs]}]      ![the box that won't go away](http://i.stack.imgur.com/z1XgV.png)
