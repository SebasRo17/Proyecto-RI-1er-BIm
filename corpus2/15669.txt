Borrowing `triangularArrayLayout` from here, I have:               triangularArrayLayout[triArray_List, opts___] :=       Module[{n = Length[triArray]},        Graphics[MapIndexed[         Text[Style[#1,             Large], {Sqrt[3] (n - 1 + #2.{-1, 2}), 3 (n - First[#2] + 1)}/            2] &, triArray, {2}], opts]]          n = 6;     s = 500;     coeffs = triangularArrayLayout[Table[Row[{"C(", i, ",", j, ")"}], {i, 0, n}, {j, 0, i}],         ImageSize -> s];     tri = triangularArrayLayout[Table[Binomial[i, j], {i, 0, n}, {j, 0, i}],         ImageSize -> s];     layers = {Overlay[{coeffs, Show[tri, TextStyle -> GrayLevel[.8]]}, Alignment -> Top],         Overlay[{tri, Show[coeffs, TextStyle -> GrayLevel[.8]]}, Alignment -> Top]};          Manipulate[layers[[u]], {{u, 1, " "}, {1 -> "binomial coefficients",         2 -> "Pascal's triangle"}}, ControlType -> RadioButtonBar]      but the vertical alignment is off: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fZooA.png) ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/L0LM5.png) This is the main issue, but I am also curious how to:   1. typeset the $C(n,r)$ as `TraditionalForm` (with the varying $n$ and $r$ values throughout)   2. typeset the $C(n,r)$ as $_{n}C_{r}$ (also with the varying $n$ and $r$ values).
