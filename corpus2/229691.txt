what is the main utility of Interface. we know that we can implement dynamic behavior using interface but i guess it is not only the utility. so i like to know when we have to write interface and when we need to go for abstract class. **show me 5 or 10 most important uses of interface in real life scenario.** another main use is coming to my mind that project manager or team lead will implement basic skeleton through interface and other developer follow it. so please guys show me with sample code few most important use of interface which we can do with abstract class or concrete class. **one guy told me like this way which is not very clear to me** interfaces are defined contracts between classes or structs, consumers can exchange the implementation by a different one as long as the same contract is met that is the method names and signature that compose a specification that classes and structs can work against rather than working against a concrete implementation. The important part about interfaces is to know when to use them and as a matter of fact it's quite simple, when you want two or more unrelated objects to have the same common functionality but not necessarily the same implementation you will want to use interfaces; otherwise, when you have related objects that have a shared functionality and implementation then you may consider to use an abstract class instead of an interface. **this thing is not clear specially** when you want two or more unrelated objects to have the same common functionality but not necessarily the same implementation you will want to use interfaces; otherwise, when you have related objects that have a shared functionality and implementation then you may consider to use an abstract class instead of an interface. it would be nice if anyone explains with sample code when to go for interface & when abstract class. show me few best important area which is always handle with interface with sample code or best interface uses with sample code.thanks
