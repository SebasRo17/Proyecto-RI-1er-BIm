How can I say in english, that programming language can be compiled to other programming languages? The example can be Haxe. On the website the language is decribed as "Multiplatform": > Multiplatform: Haxe can be compiled to all popular programming platforms > with its fast compiler â€“ JavaScript, Flash, NekoVM, PHP, C++, C# and Java > (soon) but multiplatform can be misunderstood as hardware or software platforms (win, mac, linux). So what is the most suitable word describing this ability?
