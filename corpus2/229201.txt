I have an old plotter that can't handle printing true spirals. I need help with developing an algorithm to approximate a spiral. Here's a LISP sub-script that I have written which uses semicircles of varying radii to draw a spiral:               (setq inner_radius 1e3)  ; The spiral grows from inner radius to outer radius     (setq coil_thickness 35) ; This is the half-pitch of the spiral, pitch is 70     (setq outer_radius (+ 2.4e3 (* 2 coil_thickness)))     (while (< inner_radius outer_radius)             (setq P1 (list 0 inner_radius))             (setq P2 (list inner_radius 0))             (setq P3 (list 0 (* -1 inner_radius)))             (setq P4 (list (- (- inner_radius) coil_thickness) coil_thickness))             (setq P5 (list 0 (+ inner_radius (* coil_thickness 2))))             (command "ARC" P1 P2 P3) ; Draws a 3 point arc through P1, P2 and P3             (command "ARC" P3 P4 P5) ; Draws a 3 point arc through P3, P4 and P5             (setq inner_radius (+ inner_radius (* coil_thickness 2)))     )      I am using `AutoCAD` to implement the script. The code here is a cop-out - I can implement a true spiral in `AutoCAD` but the plotter, which will plot this, is dated and is not able to handle a true spiral. It can handle just circle arcs and line segments. I am seeking a method which can implement a better approximation of the spiral. For instance, I tried thinking about quartcircles (instead of the semicircles I have used in the above sub-script) but couldn't come up with a viable scheme.
