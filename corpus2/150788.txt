I am a junior IT person and I am a bit short on experience and I am diploma graduate so which makes me lack knowledge in the eyes of the human resource department. so what I do is I read technical books like AJAX, SOA, RUBY and stuff like that. Now is it alright if I put that on my resume as a skill of mine without the expensive, somewhat unnecessary, almost boring formal education with them certificates to prove your knowledge?
