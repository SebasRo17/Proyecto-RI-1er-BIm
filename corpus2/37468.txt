I was hoping to incorporate an `If` function into a `Plot` option, as in               Plot[Sin[t], {t, 0, 2 Pi}, Filling -> Axis,       FillingStyle -> If[Sin[t] > 0, LightGreen, LightRed]]      or               Plot[Sin[t], {t, 0, 2 Pi}, PlotStyle -> If[Sin[t] > 0, Dashed, Thick]]      to no avail. Is it possible to pass an `If` to the plot options? I know that I can manually accomplish the effect via `Piecewise`, but I have more complicated applications in mind where I would not want to manually precompute the interval(s) on which my piecewise defined function would need to be defined.
