Consider the following:               list={1/First[{}], 1, 2, 1/First[{}], 3};     DeleteCases[list,_NumberQ]      I wanted to remove all cases, which did not match `_!NumberQ` (e.g. `1/First[{}]`), in the first place. But after `DeleteCases[list,_!NumberQ]` did not work, I tried it with `DeleteCases[list,_NumberQ]`, just to see whether that would work...didn't. What I am doing wrong?
