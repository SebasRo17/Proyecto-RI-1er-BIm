Are you aware of, or have you devised, any practical, simple-to-learn "in- head" algorithms that let humans generate (somewhat "true") random numbers? By "in-head" I mean.. preferably without any external tools or devices. Also, a high output (many random numbers per minute) is desirable. Asked this on SO but it didn't get much interest. Maybe this is better suited for programmers.
