Although I like VS2010's multi monitor support, I seem to have too many accidental window drags, where I unsnap a window without intending to. This behavior has made me still live in the mental model of vs200X's non-snappable windows. 1) Do you have a particular layout that works for general purpose work? 2) How have you optimised for specific scenarios (SQL, Debugging, Workflow, WPF) 3) Are you aware of any hotkey or utility that will jump to a particular window layout? 4) Are you aware of any way I can reduce the times I accidentialy undock a window?
