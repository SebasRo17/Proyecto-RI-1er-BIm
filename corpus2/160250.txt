I worked with JPA (Eclipselink implementation) and Hibernate. As I understand these two have great caching systems. I am interested in caching in a Web application and in order to better understand the process I'm trying to implement something on my own. Sadly, I cannot find any in depth documentation about this subject. I'm interested in things like high scalability, sharing memory on different machines and other important theoretical matters. Is there any tutorial or open project I could check out? Thank you! *LE: * I want to cache DB information in POJOs just like JPA or Eclipselink
