<body>         <!-- wrapper -->         <div id="wrapper">         <!-- title -->        <div id="title"><img src="title.png" alt="" /></div>             <!-- form wrapper -->        <div id="form_wrapper">              <!-- form -->         <form action="thankyou.php" method="POST">          <!-- ... ... -->         </form>         <!-- /form -->        </div>        <!-- /form wrapper -->       </div>       <!-- /wrapper -->      </body>      I can almost understand the `<!-- /wrapper -->` at the end, because it's so far from the start of the tag/pair... but seriously, what's the point of the opening comment lines? I wouldn't ask the question if I didn't see this _all the time_. I feel as if I'm missing something. Maybe there's some unwritten best-practice involved, though I fail to comprehend what it could possibly be. More than likely it's just obsessive-compulsive behavior. How do you guys normally comment your markup, if at all?
