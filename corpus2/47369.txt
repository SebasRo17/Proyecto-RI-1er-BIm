I have solved a system of equations using NDSolve just fine. From there, I can plot the solutions $u(x)$ and $v(x)$, as well as its derivatives, just fine. But, when I want to evaluate the energy density for v, defined as $E(x)=\frac{\alpha}{2}(\frac{\partial v}{\partial x})^2+\beta((v^2-1)^2+\epsilon_2v)$, as well as the total energy, $\int_{0}^{10}E(x)dx$, I run into the following problem:               NIntegrate::inumr: "The integrand energiephi6 has evaluated to non-numerical values for all sampling points in the region with boundaries {{0,10}}."      Here's the code:               eps = 1/4;     eps2 = 1/10;     eps3 = 1/10;     alpha = 1;     beta = 3;     a = 5.6294;     sol = NDSolve[{D[u[x], x,        x] == -(6 u[x]^5 - (8 + 4 eps) u[x]^3 + (2 + 4 eps) u[           x] + (v[x]^4 - 2 v[x]^2 + eps2*v[x] + 1)*2 u[            x]/(u[x]^2 + eps3)^2),      alpha*D[v[x], x,         x] == -beta (4 v[x]^3 - 4 v[x] + eps2)/(u[x]^2 + eps3),      u[0] == 0, u'[0] == a, v[0] == 1, v'[0] == 0}, {u, v}, {x, 0, 10}];     phi6n = Evaluate[v[x]] /. sol     phi6Dn = D[phi6n, x]     energiephi6[x] = 0.5*alpha*phi6Dn[x]^2 + beta ((phi6n[x]^2 - 1)^2 + eps2*phi6n);     energietotale6 = NIntegrate[energiephi6, {x, 0, 10}]     Plot[Evaluate[u[t]] /. sol, {t, 0, 10}, PlotRange -> All]     Plot[phi6n, {x, 0, 10}, PlotRange -> All]     Plot[phi6Dn, {x, 0, 10}, PlotRange -> All]     Plot[energiephi6, {x, 0, 10}, PlotRange -> All]      Thus far, all I could do was to identify this line as the culprit:               energiephi6[x] = 0.5*alpha*phi6Dn[x]^2 + beta ((phi6n[x]^2 - 1)^2 + eps2*phi6n);
