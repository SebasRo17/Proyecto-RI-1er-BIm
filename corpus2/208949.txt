So I'm using Node and ExtJS server-side/client-side respectfully. By using ExtJS, I'm moving a lot of the presentation logic client-side. Thus, something like MVC wouldn't make sense server-side since the view-logic is all client- side. At this point, my Node server's responsibilities are essentially:   * Act as proxy to persistent storage (MongoDB) for ExtJS stores   * User validation/sessioning with Windows Active Directory   * Hooking-in with existing Enterprise infrastructure (databases, Salesforce.com, etc). Well I know design patterns aren't the end-all-be-all, and conforming to a design pattern can in some cases impede progress, but I'm relatively new to web-programming in general. I'd like to use a pattern to start just so I don't make any major architectural decisions that will haunt me for the rest of the project. Is there a pattern will suited for my needs that I could lean-on?
