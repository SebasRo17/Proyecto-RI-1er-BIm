I'm working on a project involving data manipulation and it involves working with CSV files. I know that the files are properly formatted as when I import them into LibreOffice, all of the columns contain the information they are meant to. When I import the files into Mathematica (10.0) however, data from the 45th column (for example) shows up in the 1st column. I'm using:                   Import["filename.csv","Data"]      Does anyone know what the issue might be? Thank you~
