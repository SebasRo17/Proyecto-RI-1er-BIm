I'm a hobbyist programmer. Often during a period of working on a project, I find myself having a hard time to actually get to coding. I sit in front of my computer, sometimes open the IDE, and instead of continuing work on the project, I find myself watching YouTube videos (often programming related), browsing Facebook, reading questions on this site, etc. Also sometimes in the design phase of something, I think hard of different designs and solutions, come up with a cool solution which I get excited about, sketch it on paper, but eventually when I actually sit in front of my computer to implement what I designed, I don't program but rather do other stuff, or sometimes code a little bit. I do like programming a lot. And I also enjoy designing stuff and thinking of ideas. However often when I actually sit down to continue my current project, I have this lack of motivation to code. I have two questions about this:   1. Is this normal? **Are there other people - _that enjoy programming very much_ \- that experience the same problem?** Is this 'starting-to-work-bummer' feeling common?   2. How do you suggest I solve this? **When sitting down to code, should I just 'power through' this initial phase of lack of motivation, knowing it'll get more fun after I 'warm up' and get deep into coding?** **Or am I risking getting burned out and tired of programming by forcing myself into this when I lack motivation?** What do you suggest from your personal experience? **This isn't just a "do you sympathize with this?" kind of question. I'm asking in order to find a solution. Thanks for your help** _I don't think this is a duplicate. There are a lot of questions about lack of motivation, but this one in particular is about a specific feeling of lack of motivation when sitting down to code._
