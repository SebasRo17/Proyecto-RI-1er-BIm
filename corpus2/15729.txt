I'd like to configure some of my notebooks to assume all calculations using dates, times and locations (notably `AstronomicalData` , but others too) take place at the Greenwich Observatory. I know I can achieve this by unprotecting `$TimeZone` and setting it to `0`, as with                   $GeoLocation = {51.476786, 0.00000000};         Unprotect[$TimeZone];         $TimeZone = 0;         Protect[$TimeZone];      but worry that this might have some other consequences that would confuse date and time functions. Is it safe to do this? Does changing the value of `$TimeZone` have side effects I should avoid?
