In a multi server system, e.g. a load balancer, multiple web servers and a database server, where do you store the files / images users upload when each web server will need access? Before now I've just used a single web server, or maybe one web server and a MySQL database server. But if you have multiple web servers I guess you have a range of options for making sure resources like images and other user files are shared, such as:   * Storing them on the database server   * Or a server specifically for them   * Maybe mounting the same directory   * Or using a tool like rsync to synchronize the user uploads directories on each web server Or maybe you have a different solution? or there's a de-facto way of doing this that I'm not aware of?
