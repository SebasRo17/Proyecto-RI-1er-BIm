I recently got hired on as a new ASP.NET developer (C# code behind). When I arrived, I was told that they were moving to MVC 4, and so I bought two books on that. However, the other day I learned that they are NOT using Razor, but using WebForms. Most of the results via Google returned articles from before the WebForms view engine was apparently selectable as an option instead of Razor, but my question is this:   * Is it possible to learn MVC through WebForms, and not Razor? By possible, I mean is it "worth the time", or should I stick with Razor (as covered in both of my books) and slowly adapt that knowledge to WebForms?   * Are there any drastic changes that need to be understood when learning MVC from the WebForms perspective? Thank you for your time.
