I was surprised to see `Graph` objects are atomic. Is there a way (through documentation or programmatically) to find all atomic heads? The ones I know of are:               Integer     Rational     Real     Complex     Symbol     String     SparseArray     StructuredArray     Image (* since v9 *)     Image3D     Graph     ColorProfileData     Association     MeshRegion     BoundaryMeshRegion      Are there any others? ## Others mentioned in the comments               Internal`Bag     System`Utilities`HashTable     System`RawArray     BooleanFunction     Dispatch (* since v10 *)     Dataset
