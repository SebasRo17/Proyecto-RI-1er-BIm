I am developing a Windows application and I want to store all the text for labels, radio buttons, buttons, check boxes and column headers of grids at one place. I have tried using a class file, an xml file, a database table and a resource file. I found that a class file is the best way to store all these texts, but I want to know is there any alternative way? If I am using a class file then I will have to recompile the project if any text changes. Will a resource file work properly for large amounts data? What about a dictionary or storing data in variables?
