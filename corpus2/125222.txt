> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Are certifications worth it? I'd be glad to hear your opinions on which programming certificates are the most widely recongnized in the industry and how useful are they actually. I've googled a lot this question but I've never asked here and I'd like to gather as many opinions as possible before applying for any. I'm interested mainly in developing business application. I have knowledge in Java, SQL, PHP, some C#. Thank you in advance!
