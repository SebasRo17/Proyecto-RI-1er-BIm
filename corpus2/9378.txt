Has anyone else had trouble in relocating page breaks in a long document? In a ~45 page long document I wanted to keep certain things on the same page. The system worked on the first three or four changes although it took a rather long time on each adjustment. On the next change the program seemed to lock up in a loop. The text on the screen vanished and the program was unresponsive. The CPU meter indicated MMA was working rather hard. I had to Alt F4 to get out. I repeated the problem twice. Other than breaking the document into small pieces does anyone have a suggestion?
