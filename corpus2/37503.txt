I'm trying to plot a flip bifurcation diagram for a dynamical system of equations as follows:               x'[t] == v[t]     v'[t] == x[t] - A x[t]^3 + R*Cos[\[Omega]*t] - B v[t]      but am having trouble writing the code to get a bifurcation diagram to plot. I have numerical values for A,B, & Omega, and am trying to plot the diagram for R. Other similar questions and references online don't seem to be helpful (either not nonlinear or not a system of equations).
