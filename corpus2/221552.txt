I know nothing about gui programming. I try to learn. I have simple question... For example, I have small program. I have class that extends JFrame with main Window (MyWindowClass) and my "logic" class (MyClass) that do something (for example calculate something and I want to display it in window). Should I implement this like:               class MyClass {         // ...         // ...         MyWindowClass window;     };      Or like this:               class MyWindowClass extends JFrame {        // ...        MyClass c;     };      I don't know which class should be an owner and which class should be have main method... Please help me... I try to write in Java (Swing) but this is general question I guess.
