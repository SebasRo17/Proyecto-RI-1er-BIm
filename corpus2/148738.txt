I have several websites that I help manage. When running on my local machine (under iis7), the websites run on under a folder on my machine d:\WebRoot\TheWebsiteName and run as htt://localhost/TheWebsiteName, but when they are deployed they run as http://www.TheWebsiteName.com (also running under iis7) Currently I am handling the path to the website resources (images, javascript, etc) via code. But I was wondering if there was a better way to handle this rather than writing specialized code in the website. Thanks!
