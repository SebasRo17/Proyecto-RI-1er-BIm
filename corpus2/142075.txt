Which is a better option?   It's not always that when you have something creative your code is going to look ugly.   But at times it does go a bit ugly.   e.g.               if ( (object1(0)==object2(0) &&          (object1(1)==object2(1) &&          (object1(2)==object2(2) &&          (object1(3)==object2(3) )         retval = true;     else         retval = false;      is simple and readable               bool retValue = (object1(0)==object2(0)) &&                      (object1(1)==object2(1)) &&                      (object1(2)==object2(2)) &&                      (object1(3)==object2(3));      but having something like this will make some newbies scratch their heads. So what do I go for? including simple code everywhere might sometime hamper my performance.   What I could think of was commenting wherever necessary but at times you get too curious to know what is actually happening.
