After reading this post about ideal programming language learning sequence, I am wondering what would have been the answers if the question was performance -instead of learning- oriented ? Since there are many programming languages I chose to ask the question for OOL to be the least subjective. But any thought or comparison about no-OOL are appreciated :D If we omit the programming effort, time and costs. What is your ranking of the most powerful object oriented languages ?
