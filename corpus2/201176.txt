I am making a voxel game like Minecraft. I am able to load chunks using multithreading with the code...               for (int x = 0; x < WorldSettings.WORLD_WIDTH_IN_CHUNKS; x++)     {         for (int y = 0; y < WorldSettings.WORLD_LENGTH_IN_CHUNKS; y++)         {             chunks[x, y].BulidVertexData();             Thread.Sleep(50);         }     }      this works fine, it starts by loading the far away chunk and loads them back and forth like a windshield wiper that gets closer, but I would rather have it load in a circle around the player by loading the near chunks first. Any ideas?
