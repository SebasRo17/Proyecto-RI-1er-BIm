I have recently installed Visual Studio 2010. By default it has a nice layout, and when I open files, the tabbed windows for those files appear where I like them to appear: source code on the upper half of the screen, compiler output, test status, trace windows on the bottom half. But, after a period of using it, I fat finger something, and then the window positioning logic goes haywire. One of the tabs gets undocked, and then after I redock it, nothing else operates like it used to operate. So maddening! It opens source code on the bottom, it opens other windows in unpredictable places. I undock and redock the windows where I want them, and the next time I open them, they go to the wrong place again. WTF? Even the "start page" gets moved. This is what it looks like when I start up: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8sKDn.png) I know I can do the `devenv /resetsettings` thing to restore to the original, and I have done this (Several times), but really I would like to know:   1. How is this happening? What am I doing to cause this behavior? How can I avoid it?    2. Can I undo it - get it to behave sanely again - without stopping visual studio, and restarting with the /resetsettings switch? What are the magic mouse clicks to make it revert? I know it's challenging to describe UI gestures, but if you have hints, I'd love to hear them. Does anyone else have this problem?
