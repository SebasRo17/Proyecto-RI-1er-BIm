I am thinking of using non-recursive locks; I have found them to be having performance superiority over the standard recursive locks (e.g. SimpleRWSync). I have mainly been using critical sections but in highly threaded environments, locking was producing significant delays.   1. What are the benefits and/or pitfalls?   2. Do the non-recursive ones make coding harder comparatively?
