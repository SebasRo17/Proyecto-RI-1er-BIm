I don't have the command for inserting citations described in the documentation: "Insert > Citation> Bibliographical Reference" is not present in my menus: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QZg4E.png) That's the entire contents of my "Citation" menu: no "Bibliographical Reference" item anywhere to be seen. How do I restore this item to my menus? What could I have done that would have removed it?
