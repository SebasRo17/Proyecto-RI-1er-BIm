I have long code which goes through iteration process. some times I get error messages. I want to get the iteration numbers (or any kind of output indications) when errors happen. for example, how can I print something when error happen in this simple example:                  Do[{i/i, 1/(i - 5)}, {i, -10, 10}]      here, there are two errors when i=0 & when i=5, how can I output the values of i when the errors happen. I have different kinds of errors so I want to get the output if any kind of error happen. thanks.
