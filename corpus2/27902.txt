I have a 3D model, say the Stanford bunny, which is available in _Mathematica_ examples.                Import[ "http://exampledata.wolfram.com/bunny.noff.gz" ]      Also information such as the 3D coordinate of vertices and the normal at each vertex is available. Now I'd like to divide the whole thing into $n$, say 10, non overlapping patches. Something like the patches on a football. Patches must contain more or less same number of points, but this is a soft constraint. I see there is a function `FindShortestPath` in _Mathematica_. Maybe that function can help me? Since I am a new user I am not sure how I should approach the problem.
