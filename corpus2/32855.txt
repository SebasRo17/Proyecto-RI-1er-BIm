If I have a list of strings Like:               text = Select[       StringSplit[        StringReplace[         StringTake[ExampleData[{"Text", "AliceInWonderland"}], {25, 997}],          Alternatives @@ Characters["<>?;'|:\"()-_!&"] -> " "], "." | ","],        StringLength[#] > 2 &]      > {"Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the > bank"," and of having nothing to do"," Once or twice she had peeped into the > book her sister was reading"," but it had no pictures or conversations in > it"," and what is the use of a book"," thought Alice"," without pictures or > conversations So she was considering in her own mind as well as she could"," > for the day made her feel very sleepy and stupid "," whether the pleasure of > making a daisy chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking > the daisies"," when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by > her"," There was nothing so very remarkable in that"," nor did Alice think > it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself"," Oh dear > Oh dear I shall be too late But when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of > its waistcoat pocket and looked at it and then hurried on"," Alice started > to her feet"," for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen > a rabbit with "} how do I find the positions of the list elements that contain the following words/character strings:               words = {"her", "she", "alice", "bbit"};      Following on from this question, I tried using `Position` like so:               Position[text,       s_ /; StringMatchQ[s, __ ~~ Alternatives @@ words ~~ __,          IgnoreCase -> True] &]      > {} but this doesn't produce the list of positions. The follwing seems to suggest that I have the right string-matching criteria:               StringMatchQ[text, __ ~~ Alternatives @@ words ~~ __,       IgnoreCase -> True]      > > {True,False,True,False,False,False,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True} What am I missing?
