If we have two equations E1 and E2, and instead of using `Solve` to solve it, we simply need to manually add them up which would allow some simplification that could lead to better visibility of its structure, I found that               E1 + E2      would always fail. Instead, I need to extract left and right sides of an equation explicity using               E1[[1]] + E2[[1]] == E1[[2]] + E2[[2]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GFbkk.jpg) Is there any built-in function to do this?
