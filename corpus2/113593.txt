I'm a great believer in clean code and code craftsmanship, though I'm currently at a job where this isn't regarded as a top priority. I sometimes find myself in a situation where a peer's code is _riddled_ with messy design and very little concern for future maintenance, though it's functional and contains little to no bugs. How do you go about suggesting improvements in a code review when you believe there is so much that needs changing, and there's a deadline coming up? Keep in mind that suggesting the improvements be made _after_ the deadline may mean they'll be de-prioritized altogether as new features and bug-fixes come in.
