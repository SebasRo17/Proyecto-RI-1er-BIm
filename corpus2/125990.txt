I have always heard about the powerful programming capabilities of Microsoft Excel (not VBA, I am referring to the formulas of Excel itself), but have never seen it.   * Does it really have all that power on formulas or have I misunderstood?   * If it does, what is the extent of Excel's programming capabilities?   * How is it done (what does serious, complex programming looks like in terms of syntax, patterns, styles, etc.)?   * Does it pertain to a paradigm (say, functional programming)?   * Do Excel programmers exist?   * What is it mainly used for?
