Today when I read about the LCC (Windows) compiler, I found out it has the implementation for operator overloading. I'm puzzled because after a bit of Goggling, it has been confirmed that operator overloading ain't supported in standard C, but I read some people's comment mentioning LCC is ANSI-compliant. So my real question is, is LCC really standard C or it's just like objective-c, a C variant with object-oriented features?
