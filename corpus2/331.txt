sorry for a basic question, but does any one know what is the trick to make the front end beep at me each time I issue the same command (which contain an error)? It now only beeps the first time, but when I SHIFT+ENTER the same command again, it stops beeping. I want it to beep each time. here is an example:               expr = 0.09 - (0.00043739999999999995*          Sin[x])/(Sqrt[1 - 0.36*Sin[x]^2]*(0.0225 - 0.0081*Sin[x]^2))     FullSimplify[expr]      now it beeped and gave message to the notebook               Indeterminate      and the following messages to the console:                Mathematica beeped to let you know that a warning or error       message was generated by the kernel. You can disable this beep by resetting       MessageOptions in the Option Inspector.      But when I typed the above again:               FullSimplify[expr]      I see no more messages to the console and no more beeps but only the `Indeterminate` message comes out to the notebook. Only way to see the error again and hear the beeps is to do `Remove["Global`*"]` and run everything again. Strange thing, is that this behaviour does not happen for everything. For example, if I type               Simplify[1/0]      I will see a new error a hear a new beep EACH time I execute the command. I have a feeling that the kernel is remembering things. But I do not want to clear everything each time. I am using 8.04, and this is a picture of my setup: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bEhuJ.png) and here is the messageOptions in the advanced setup ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Tfhml.png) I tried to change the `MaxMessageCount` to 100 but no change. same for the `MessageCountRestTime`. thanks
