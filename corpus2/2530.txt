Building up on the solution proposed here : Simplifying nested If statements You can find here the data set : allGazes.dat               allGazesX =       Uncompress@        Import[FileNameJoin[{NotebookDirectory[], "allGazes.dat.gz"}],          "String"];      I need to filter large data set and believe I lack an efficient method to do so. The purpose here is to filter given the `EuclideanDistance[]` between gazes. Below is what I am using currently : This is what i am using currently :               GZ[delta_] := ParallelTable[                   Table[                         Reap[z = allGazesX[[subNO, dispNo, 1, ;; 2]];Sow[z];                         Scan[                              If[                                 EuclideanDistance[#, z] > delta,                                 z = #;Sow[z]] &,                                 allGazesX[[subNO, dispNo, All, ;; 2]]]][[2, 1]],                        {dispNo, Range[Length[allGazesX[[subNO]]]]}],                   {subNO, Range[5]}];
