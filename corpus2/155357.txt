When you are writing JavaScript unit tests, where do you put all the test code? I see two potential approaches:   1. Leave all your test code with your regular web project and explictly don't release the code to production.    2. Maintain a separate project that runs all your tests. I see pros and cons for both. I'm curious what more experienced JavaScript developers have ended up using.
