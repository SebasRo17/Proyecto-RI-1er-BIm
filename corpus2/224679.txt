JavaScript is functional but not in a strict sense. It does not rely on immutable data and side-effect free functions. There are a few libs that provide immutable data structures, so I believe it should be possible to write a more strictly functional program using JavaScript. I know ClojureScript exists but I am not interested in transcompilation. Are there any open source projects that use JavaScript in a more strictly functional sense with nothing but immutable data? I am interested in whether this is practical in a language not built with this in mind.
