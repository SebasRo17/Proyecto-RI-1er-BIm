I've heard people saying usage of JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) isn't recommended in Java applets. All I they say is: 'because of the security reasons'. What 'security reasons' do they mean? What would a potentially 'bad person' do when he/she found out about JDBC used in an applet, placed somewhere on a website? To make one's applet safe, it is wise to place a servlet between an applet and a database. I believe most programmers do it, I would like to know why.
