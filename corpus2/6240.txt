Consider the following snippet of code:                 Module[{pr, ps, var, option},        option = 1;        var = 0;        pr[] := Module[{}, var++; Print[var]];        ps[] := Print["Test..."];             PaneSelector[         {1 ->           Button["Defaults 1",           option = 2,           ImageSize -> 100],          2 ->           Button["Defaults 2",           option = 1;           pr[],           ImageSize -> 100]},          Dynamic[option]]       ]      Note that pr[] is executed when the button "Defaults 2" is clicked. **Question: I want to execute a function immediately after a Pane is selected in a PaneSelector construction. How should this be implemented?** ( Question translated to the context of the above snippet: how to execute either ps[] or pr[] immediately after setting option to 1 or 2?)
