I have a RESTful API, built in NODE.js that does what you would expect it to: consumes data and then makes it accessible. Currently, data being submitted to my server is nested form data:               data[0][username]=...     data[0][email]=...     data[0][phone]=...     ...     data[12][username]=...     data[12][email]=...     data[12][phone]=...      or as a query string               data[0][username]=...&data[0][email]=...&data[0][phone]=...      SO when I parse it on the server, I get a JS array of objects with those particular fields. What I am wondering is, is it safe for me accept a string that I can JSON.parse and the process it?               data=(some stringified json object)      I am unsure if it's possible for malicious code or anything to be included in the JSON object that would blow up my server once run through a parser Thanks.
