I am exposing a few REST methods on a server for an mobile app. I would like to avoid that users can sniff how HTTP methods are built (from the mobile app) and then send them again to the server. Example :   * The mobile app send a request   * The user uses a proxy and can check what's going on on the network   * The user sees and save the request that the mobile just sent   * => Now I don't want the user to be able to send over manually that request Is it enough to secure the server over HTTPS?
