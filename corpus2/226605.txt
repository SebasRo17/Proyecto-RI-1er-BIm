I can understand this:               List("one word", "another word") unzip (_ span (_ != ' '))      But don't get what's happening here **below** in the `span`. `span` takes a predicate and I think the braces can be omitted as `span` is used inline and has only one parameter but why isn't there any `_` and what is `' '.!=`               List("one word", "another word") unzip (_ span ' '.!=)
