I have a set of points $\\{x_i,y_i\\}$ that represents a closed curve. I want to find a function $F(x,y)$ such that $F(x,y) = 0$ gives the needed curve and $F(x,y) \ne 0$ outside the curve. For example, suppose I am given a set of points that forms a circle:               n = 16;     points = Drop[Table[{Cos[2 i Pi], Sin[2 i Pi]}, {i, 0, 1, 1/n}], -1] // N;      I use the `Interpolation[..]` Mathematica function:               args = Join[Table[{points[[i]], 0}, {i, Length[points]}], {{{0, 0}, -1}}];     F = Interpolation[args];      Here I have added a new point $(0,0)$ with value $-1$ in it to my set of points to give "a depth" to $F(x,y)$. First question. Is that solution right? Can I be sure that my $F(x,y) \ne 0$ on non-curve points if I add "an inner" point with non-zero value to my set? What solution is more preferable? Also I have a second (and main) question. Due the peculiarity of my problem I need an explicit expression for my curve in a given section. In other words I want to have an expression for my curve in terms $y = f(x)$ or $x = f(y)$ (does not matter) between near points. I need this $f$ and its derivative $f'$. Thereby $f$ should be an InterpolatingFunction object too (but one- dimensional). Using `Solve` on `F` from previous example does not give a result. How to get $F$ and $f$ (between given near points)? **Update** : In my example $F(x,y) = x^2+y^2-1$ and I can single out two explicit fucntions: $f_1(x) = \sqrt{1-x^2}$ where $x > 0$ and $f_2(x) = -\sqrt{1-x^2}$ where $x \leq 0$. Equations $y=f_1(x), y=f_2(x)$ and equation $F(x,y)=0$ represent the same curve (a circle). This is what I need: implicit function $F(x,y)$ and a set of explicit functions $f_i$. Also I can single out another explicit functions: $f_1(y) = \sqrt{1-y^2}$ where $y \leq x$ and $y \geq -x$; $f_2(x) = \sqrt{1-x^2}$ where $y > x$ and $y \geq -x$; $f_3(y) = -\sqrt{1-y^2}$ where $y > x$ and $ y < -x$; $f_4(x) = -\sqrt{1-x^2}$ where $y \leq x$ and $y < -x$. Together they form a circle. **Update 2** : The given curve is closed and has no self-intersections. Locally $F(x,y)=0$ can be expressed as $y=f(x)$ or $x=f(y)$. This is what I need. I try Solve function but it does not give result for interpolating $F(x,y)$. Instead it gives an error: _"Solve was unable to solve the system with inexact coefficients or the system obtained by direct rationalization of inexact numbers present in the system"_
