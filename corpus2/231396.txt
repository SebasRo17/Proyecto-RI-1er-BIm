I am completely new to using VCS and haven't settled on Git or Hg, but I do know that I will be using it soon. My old project folder has versions of files labeled v1, v2, etc. How easily can I fold this into a new [local] repo? There are only a few sets of files with version counters (so commit, then copy paste, then commit is an option). I should also note that I am not a classically trained programmer but a self-taught former analytical chemist.
