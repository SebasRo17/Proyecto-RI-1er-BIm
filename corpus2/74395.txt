My company is currently interviewing for a developer position, and a disturbingly high number of candidates with good resumes end up being total frauds. We do have a written technical test which works fine for that purpose (it was initially designed for interns, but we found out that even candidates interviewing for senior positions failed it abysmally), but I'd like a few questions that allows us to filter out those people with a < 10 min. time investment. I'm trying to come up with a very trivial C++ (or even just programming) question that can be easily answered on the phone. The goal is not to get tricky, or even midly complex, just to weed out the people who'd fail an "intro to programming" midterm. So far, the best I've come up with is "Let's assume I'm an intern you're mentoring: can you explain to me, in simple terms, the difference between a vector and a list, and when I should use or the other". Any other ideas?
