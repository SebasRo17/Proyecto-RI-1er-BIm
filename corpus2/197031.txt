Note: I know that none of you (probably) work for google, so this is a lot more of a conceptual question. So yeah, i discovered that Gmail uses java and that got me thinking, Why? I personally never really learned java and am familiar with C/C++, Python, Php e.t.c But what i dont understand is why do some websites use languages such as java? (Note: This is in no way a thread saying one language is better than the other). What i want to know is why do some websites such as Gmail use java and similar languages?What advantages/disadvantages come with using java/similar languages over languages such as php/python/ruby for web development? Ps: I know that some sites prefer to compile their code for optimization(Like facebook's hiphop)
