MatchQ[Hold[1 + 2], Hold[2 + 1]]      returns `False`. But in the presence of a `Blank[]` in the matching pattern as in the example below               MatchQ[Hold[1 + 2], Hold[2 + _]]      which returns `True`, apparently the fact that `Plus` is `Orderless` is being respected. Apart from doing something like removing the `Orderless` attribute from `Plus`, how can I make the order matter when pattern-matching in a case like this? Where can I read more about this in the documentation?
