Is it possible to plot an image, i.e., draw it's pixels against usual coordinates? My goal is to plot my image and my function in the same coordinates. **Update** I drew an image of size `200x100` and drew a spot at `100,50`. When plotting it should coincide with actual coordinates, but it doesn't. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/lQate.jpg) i.e. image takes random size and random scale both unrelated with plot size and scale. While I need each pixel be located at it's correct coordinates, not only image corner. **Update 2** Why `Image` is not a `Graphics` primitive or directive?
