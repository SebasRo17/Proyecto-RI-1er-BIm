I often find myself trying to plot multiple PDFs for my courses. I find the default tools available to me are lacking and/or cumbersome. After readings some suggestions here, I have come up with the following code to plot 3 instances of the Binomial Distribution. I'm hoping this will prove useful to others (perhaps even myself). I'm also wondering if folks can improve on this.               n = 12;     plist = {1/6, 1/3, 2/3};     colorList = {Magenta, Blue, Green};     Plot[Evaluate[       Map[PDF[BinomialDistribution[n, #], Floor[k]] &,         plist]], {k, -0.001, n + 0.001},      Exclusions -> None,      PlotStyle -> Map[{Thick, #} &, colorList],      PlotLegends -> plist,      Frame -> {True, True, False, False},      FrameTicks -> {Table[i, {i, 0 , n, 2}], Automatic},      FrameLabel -> {"Successes k", "Probability"}]      Here's the output ![plot of multiple histograms](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7Pwt8.png)
