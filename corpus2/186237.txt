I am going to start a new project using Scrum and Jira and I have some questions regarding how to write proper tasks in Jira. From what I understand user stories are small non-technical descriptions written by the stakeholders (ideally) that can have the form: As a user I want to order monkies so I can earn money. However these tasks must be elaborated with requirements, technical requirements etc. My question is: How do you write such tasks in Jira properly, and do I have the right understanding of user stories. Should I create user stories as super tasks and then create subtasks with the actual tasks/requirements? Should I estimate super tasks/user stories, or only the sub tasks?
