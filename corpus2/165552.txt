We are developing a web application with a fairly standard registration process which requires a client/user to verify their email address before they are allowed to use the site. The site also allows users to change their email address after verification (with a re-type email field, as well). What are the pros and cons of having the user re-verify their email. Is this even needed? **EDIT:** _Summary of answers and comments below:_   * "Over-verification" annoys people, so don't use it unless critical   * Consider a "re-type email" field to prevent typos, but users can still copy/paste, rendering it moot.   * Beware of overwriting known good data with potentially good data   * Send email to old for notification; to new for verification   * Don't assume that the user still has access to the old email   * Identify impact of incorrect email if account is compromised
