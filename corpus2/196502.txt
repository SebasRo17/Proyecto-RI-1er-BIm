Now, when I make a programming mistake with pointers in C, I get a nice segmentation fault, my program crashes and the debugger can even tell me where it went wrong. How did they do that in the time when memory protection wasn't available? I can see a DOS programmer fiddling away and crashing the entire OS when he made a mistake. Virtualization wasn't available, so all he could do was restart and retry. Did it really go like that?
