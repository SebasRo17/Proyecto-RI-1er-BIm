I'm not sure I have the correct verbage in my question, so let me explain: What I mean by "software architectural design":   * I have (what I believe) is a unique and useful design concept for an architecture that involves multiple clients, shared states, blah-blah, etc. etc.    * This architecture would be used in multiplayer games with persistent worlds.   * Although it would facilitate a novel kind of gameplay, it is not a description of "gameplay." What I mean by "for others":   * Free for personal/edu/commercial use. (MIT/BSD style license?) What I mean by "prevent patenting":   * I want to make sure that this particular design cannot be patented/copyrighted by someone else. (Basically, litigation battles over software architectures for games like MMOs, etc. disgust me, and I want to keep this particular design idea free to use.) Is this something that I can easily accomplish? Can I just write up a design document for the architecture and publish it to the web under say, the MIT license even though its not actual code? Or do I have to file for a patent?
