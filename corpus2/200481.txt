I know Aggregation is a has-a relationship, but I encountered a question in a test which did not make sense (and had grammatical mistakes as well) Which of the following statements correctly describe the concept of aggregation in OOP?   * **A** Splitting a class into a several sub classes   * **B** Creating one piece of code that works with all similar objects   * **C** Accessing data only through methods   * **D** Combining several classes to create a new class   * **E** Creating a new class from an existing class I think;   * **A** Could be true.   * **B** Sounds like inheritance.   * **C** Seems like property.   * **D** Could be true.   * **E** Could be true. I'm uncertain how the has-a relationship translates into actual code in these statements. Any ideas?
