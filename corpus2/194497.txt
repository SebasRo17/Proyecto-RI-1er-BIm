I started coding with php, mysql, html, and javascript back in 2002 and heck that is all you basically needed to create any type of website. Over the years I picked up other languages, but what turned me off were all of the frameworks and JQuery that was popping up every few months and clients (if freelancing) or employers expected you to be an expert on some crap a geek released recently. Because of this I got out of programming since I don't know if I can constantly throw away all of my previous knowledge and replace it with some new hip fad that does the exact same thing but just uses different function names. I miss knowing the core knowledge of PHP and being able to code from scratch and I'm afraid the skill of mastering a technology to completion is obsolescent. Is it right to feel this way, and can any of us feel secure about our programming career in the future?
