newdata = Import["data.txt", "TSV"];     ListPlot[newdata]      My `data.txt` file consists of two columns of numbers, separated by commas, like this:               1,4     2,5     3,5      and so on. When I look at how my `newdata` output seems to be fine (list of datapoints).               (* in  *) newdata     (* out *) {{1, 4}, {2, 5}, {3, 5}}      But, when I try the `ListPlot` command, I get just a blank graph at the origin with x and y's that range from 1. Can somebody help me with this type of graphing? Thanks in advance.
