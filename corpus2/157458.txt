I want to split poker pot to chips. Example: Pot = $17.500. I have the endless piles of chips. I have the following types of chips: ChipsTypes = [$1, $5, $10, $25, $100, $500, $1.000, $5.000, $10.000, and so on]. Index starts from 0. I want to get an array that says which chips I have to take to divide the pot and in which order to have minimum number of denominations and chips after pot-to-chips conversion. For example Result = [7, 5] means that I have to take 3 * $5.000 + 5 * $500 which $17.500. Is there is any strategy or algorithm that would suit my need?
