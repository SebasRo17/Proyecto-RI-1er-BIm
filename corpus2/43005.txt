The function `CoordinateTransformData` in _Mathematica_ only works for three dimension. For example,               CoordinateTransformData["Cartesian" -> "Spherical", "Mapping", {1, 2, 3, 4}]      > CoordinateTransformData::dimp: Evaluation point {1,2,3,4} has dimension 4, > which does not match dimension specification 3. >> Can anybody provide an efficient version of `CoordinateTransformData` that will work for any dimension?
