I defined a function as:               g[b_] := Integrate[f[n]Exp[-b  DA (n.u)^2], n]      Obviously                D[g[b], b] /. b -> 0      gives > >     (-DA)*Integrate[(n.u)^2*f[n], n] >   But, then, how can               Series[g[b], {b, 0, 2}]      be > >     Integrate[f[n], n] >   I guess there is something basic I don't understand. Something with order of evaluation? It's like `b = 0` is evaluated before the differentiation in `Series`.
