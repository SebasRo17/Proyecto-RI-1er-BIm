Why apps like Trumph's suite are so poorly designed and (without seeing the actual source, I can only guess) badly written? This question came this afternoon after a crash while doing a simulation in Trumph's Punch software, my boss told me "they're the leader in this sort of technology, so if something goes wrong it's likely on purpose"... I tried to explain, as a dev, the fact that even leading companies can release ugly software (in terms of efficiency and design) with, as an example, the fact that even big companies like twitter/facebook/google/microsoft/sony... are often in trouble with security holes, couldn't make him understand this. **TL;DR: why such high-cost software aren't well designed and are not as efficient as they could be?**
