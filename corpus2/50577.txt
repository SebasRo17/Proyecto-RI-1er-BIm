I downloaded the source code of a demonstration and modified it. Then saved it as a CDF file. When I re-opened this file (in _Mathematica_ or _CDF Player_ ), all of the code can be seen. How can I hide the code so that only the manipulation panel be shown? I want it to be seen just as the demonstrations on the website demonstration.wolfram.com. I searched this site but found no solution to my problem. By the way, I use _Mathematica_ 8.0.
