So given the _Separation of Concerns_ , how coupled should the View and ViewModel be? For example, I want the visibility of a Control in the View to be databound (databinded?) to a flag in the ViewModel. My first hunch would be to use a boolean value, `IsControlVisible` that returns true/false. However, in the View, visibility is set by an Enum. So I have a choice: change the property to an Enum, or use a Converter to convert the bool into the Visibility Enum. **Which is the proper approach when trying to follow idiomatic MVVM?**
