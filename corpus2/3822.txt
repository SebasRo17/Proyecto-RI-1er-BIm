This seems like a simple thing to do, but I couldn't find anything relevant from Mathematica documentation. So suppose I have an expression:               a*b/(a + a*Cos[a/b])      And I have defined:               k=a/b      Now I want to simplify the expression above so that the simplify would use my definition of k in place of a/b in as many places as possible so that the final expression would look something like:               a/(k+k*Cos[k])      This was just a simple example I made up to demonstrate what I'd like to do, but I have encountered a similar situations many times every now and then.
