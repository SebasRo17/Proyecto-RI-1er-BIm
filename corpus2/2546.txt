Suppose I have an array, not necessarily square: a = $\left( \begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 4 & 5 & 6 \\ 7 & 8 & 9 \end{array} \right)$ I want to rotate it like one of these: $\left( \begin{array}{ccc} 3 & 6 & 9 \\ 2 & 5 & 8 \\ 1 & 4 & 7 \end{array} \right)$     $\left( \begin{array}{ccc} 7 & 4 & 1 \\ 8 & 5 & 2 \\ 9 & 6 & 3 \end{array} \right)$     $\left( \begin{array}{ccc} 9 & 8 & 7 \\ 6 & 5 & 4 \\ 3 & 2 & 1 \end{array} \right)$ I have been using:               a = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};          Reverse[a, {2}]\[Transpose]          Reverse[a\[Transpose], {2}]          Reverse[a, {1, 2}]      Is there a cleaner, faster, or otherwise better way to do it? I am more interested in a general solution rather than a compiled solution for an integer array, but if you have a nice compiled approach please make it work on version 7.
