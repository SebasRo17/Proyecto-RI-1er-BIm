I've just finished 70-536 ("Microsoft .NET Framework - Application Development Foundation") Microsoft training book from Microsoft Press. I found it quite good. I have also done the 70-528 ("Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 - Web-based Client Development") book. What book should I be reading next? I am job hunting, so I want to be marketable for a position as a software developer. What will make me stand out from the crowd and get the job?
