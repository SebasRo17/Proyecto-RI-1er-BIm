I'd like to make a exportable film (in some format like .avi or .mp4, something playable on most computers) where each frame is a Graphics3D output. For example, we might generate frames in the following way:               polytopeSize = 3;          numFrames = 10;       frameSet = Table[Graphics3D[Table[Translate[Scale[PolyhedronData["Dodecahedron", "Faces"], polytopeSize], RandomReal[{0, 5}, 3]], {i, 1, 5}]], {k, 1, numFrames}];      I'd like to be able to set a time delay individually for each frame:               frameSetTimeDelaysInSeconds = RandomReal[{0,1}, numFrames];      Is this possible?
