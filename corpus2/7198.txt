I'm trying to put together a GUI in _Mathematica_ and need to evaluate one cell to kick that off. Is there a way to automatically evaluate that cell when the notebook is opened? Here is an example of the code I'm using in that cell. Yes I know loading them like:               <<one.nb`..."       etc. is best, but that doesn't seem to work on my system. Thanks!               SetDirectory[NotebookDirectory[]];      nbs = {"one.nb", "two.nb", "three.nb", "four.nb", "five.nb", "six.nb", "seven.nb",             "eight.nb"};     For[i = 1, i <=  Length[nbs], i++,         Block[{nb = NotebookOpen[NotebookDirectory[] <> nbs[[i]]]},               FrontEndTokenExecute[nb, "EvaluateNotebook"]
