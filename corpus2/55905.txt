Try to evaluate the following code:               ContourPlot3D[(x^2 + 9/4 y^2 + z^2 - 1)^3 == x^2 z^3 + 9/80 y^2 z^3,        {x, -6/5, 6/5}, {y, -6/5, 6/5}, {z, -6/5, 3/2},        Mesh -> None, Boxed -> False, AxesLabel -> {"x", "y", "z"},        PlotPoints -> 50, Axes -> False,        ContourStyle -> Directive[Red, Opacity[0.58], Specularity[Yellow, 30]],        AspectRatio -> 1.15, ViewPoint ->{-0.930, -3.137, -0.860}]      The resulted heart looks broken: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YC64r.png) Increase the `PlotPoints` value to up to `200` improves the appearance but does not solve it. What is happening?
