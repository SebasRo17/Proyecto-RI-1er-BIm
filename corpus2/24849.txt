I have the coefficients of my desired polynomial in an array CoefArr (I'm new to mathematica, so I think of everything as arrays, it is actually a list I believe) starting with the constant at index 1. I want to turn this into a function I can evaluate like this:               f[x_] := CoefArr[[1]][[1]] + x*CoefArr[[2]][[1]] + etc.      So I can just do f[5] and get the answer. Is there a way to do this in general?
