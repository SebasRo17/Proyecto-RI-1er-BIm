Been fiddling around with the legends and trying to place one in each corner and I bumped into an issue:               BarChart[{{12, 14, 16, 18}, {8, 10, 11, 12}, {2, 5, 6, 7}, {1, 3, 5, 7}},        ChartStyle -> {Green, Blue, Red, Orange}, ChartLegends ->            MapThread[Placed[PointLegend[{#1},{TextCell[#2,TextAlignment->Left]},       LegendMarkers->{#3},LegendMarkerSize->20,LabelStyle->{FontFamily->"Arial",18}       ,Spacings->{0.2,0.2}],#4]&,{{Green, Blue, Red, Orange},        {"A","B","D","C"},{{"\[FilledSquare]",22},{"\[FilledCircle]",22},{"\[FilledUpTriangle]",22}       ,{"\[FilledDiamond]",22}},{{0.8,0.1},{0.1,0.1},       {0.1,0.8},{0.8,0.8}}}]]      ![Result](http://i.stack.imgur.com/48Lby.png) which doesn't show all 4 legends. But this works for PlotLegends as below               ListPlot[{{{0.2, 0.4}, {0.4, 0.8}}, {{0.1, 0.5}, {0.3, 0.7}}, {{0.4, 0.7},        {0.7, 1.1}}, {{0.1, 0.7}, {0.8, 0.5}}}, Joined -> True, PlotStyle-> {Green, Blue, Red, Orange},       PlotMarkers -> {\[FilledSquare], \[FilledCircle], \[FilledUpTriangle], \[FilledCircle]}       , PlotLegends -> MapThread[Placed[PointLegend[{#1},       {TextCell[#2,TextAlignment->Left]},LegendMarkers->{#3},LegendMarkerSize->20,       LabelStyle->{FontFamily->"Arial",18},Spacings->{0.2,0.2}],#4]&,{{Green,        Blue, Red, Orange},{"A","B","D","C"},{{"\[FilledSquare]",22},{"\       [FilledCircle]",22},{"\[FilledUpTriangle]",22},{"\[FilledDiamond]",22}},       {{0.8,0.1},{0.1,0.1},{0.1,0.8},{0.8,0.8}}}]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pcox1.png) A workaround possibly is using Epilog to inset the legends into their positions. But I was wondering if anyone knew why this did not work for ChartLegends? **Edit** : Added image for ListPlot, and fixed the syntax.
