I cannot get what's the problem with Compile function in my program. If I simply use the Abs function, I get this answer:               Abs[NestWhile[1/(#^2 + 2 #) &,        3 + 4*I, ((Abs[#1] > 0.01) && (#1 != -2 ) && (Abs[#1 - #2] >             0.001)) &, 2]]      > >     1108116250625/(4097 Sqrt[4415238971393]) >   But if I make a function called `PointFunction`, it compiles, and when I try to find its value at the point 3 + 4*I, I get this error message:               PointFunction =        Compile[{{c, _Complex}},          Abs[NestWhile[1/(#^2 + 2 #) &,          c, ((Abs[#1] > 0.01) && (#1 != -2 ) && (Abs[#1 - #2] > 0.001)) &,          2]], {{x, _Complex}}]          PointFunction[3 + 4*I]      > CompiledFunction::cfse: Compiled expression -128.657+3.99803 I should be a > machine-size integer. >>   >  CompiledFunction::cfex: Could not complete external evaluation at > instruction 1; proceeding with uncompiled evaluation. >> >   >   >     1108116250625/(4097 Sqrt[4415238971393]) >   What is the problem? I have tried different options but they didn't work, and I have no idea at all.
