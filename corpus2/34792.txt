I was trying to do computations in Gaussian cgs units, and of course I failed due to dimensional issues. For instance, $q_1 q_2/r$ cannot be converted to $\mathrm{erg}$ since Gaussian system uses $4\pi \epsilon_0 = 1$. So, the question is: **Is it possible to use Gaussian cgs unit system in Mathematica computations?** "Using Gaussian cgs unit system" means, for instance, $V_\mathrm{coulomb}=q_1 q_2/r$; no doubt that the units themselves can be called in whatever suitable situation. Personally I think the answer is no, because the only unit systems listed in documentation of `UnitConvert` are `"SIBase"`,`"SI"`,`"Imperial"`, and `"Metric"`. But I am asking to get confirmation, and hopefully we can settle an answer to benefit future Google searches of this topic.
