If I define               f[x_]:=If[x<0,-1,1]      and then integrate,say               Integrate[f[x],{x,-3,7}]      I get what I expect, namely 4. But if I do the same thing with a different function               f[x_] := If[x < -1, 1/(2x^2), If[x > 1, 1/(2x^2), 0]]      and if I then integrate               Integrate[f[x], {x, -3, 7}]      I do not, as expected, get 16/21; instead I just get an expression consisting of an integral sign with -3 and 7 at the limits, followed by the definition of f just as I typed it above (with all the If statements, etc) and then a dx. I can of course break the integral into two parts, either of which Mathematica handles perfectly well. But how do I get it to evaluate this expression without my manual intervention?
