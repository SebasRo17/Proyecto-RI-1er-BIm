I'd like to draw a set of spheres with colors assigned from a defined set. To provide an example, say I wish to draw a set of three spheres of radius 2 at the positions: {{6, 5, 10}, {1, 4, 20}, {2, 4, 15}}. I might write:               pos = {{6, 5, 10}, {1, 4, 20}, {2, 4, 15}};     Graphics3D[{Sphere[pos, 2]}]      If I define an ordered set of colors for the three spheres, e.g. SphereColors={Red,Blue,Red}, how can I use this list to color the spheres as desired using Graphics3D?
