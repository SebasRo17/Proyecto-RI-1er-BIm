I roughly understand that cc, ld and other parts are called in a certain sequence according to schemes like Makefiles etc. Some of those commands are used to generate those configs and Makefiles. And some other tools are used to deal with libraries. But what are other parts used for? How are they called in this process? Which tool would use various parser generators? Which part is optional? Why? Is there a brief summary get these explained on how the tools in a GNU or LLVM/Clang toolchain are organised and called in a C/C++ project building? Thanks in advance.
