I am learning DBMS in my college. Recently I was given an assignment to draw a E-R Model of a Bus Reservation system which handles Reservations, Ticketing and cancellations.   I understand the theory about E-R model when I study from a book, but it gets confusing when I try to draw one from scratch.   How should one proceed? There seem to be a lot of ways to model a E-R diagram for a particular requirement. It's really confusing.   Can anyone explain taking **Bus reservation System** as an example? Here is the model I made (But I am not confident with it because at every step, I could think of many more alternatives!) - > Entity_Set **Passenger** (passengerID,name,age,gender) > > Entity_Set **Ticket** (ticketID,status) > > //Status is either _WaitingList_ , _Confirmed_ or _Cancelled_ > > Entity_Set **Bus** (busID,MaxSeats,Type) > > //Type is Ac or Non-AC > > Entity_Set **Route** (routeID,ArrivalTime,DepartureTime,Source,Destination) And a Ternary relationship between **Passenger** , **Ticket** and **Bus** with attributes as passengerID, ticketID, busID .   Binary relationship between **Bus** and **Route** with attributes as busID, routeID . I have few doubts regarding -   1 . Should we take Time as a composite attribute with Arrival and Departure as its attributes (What's the difference if we take that way?)   2 . The same with Source and Destination. Should they be made into a composite attribute "Place" or something like "Location"?   3\. Are there any weak entity sets here? I have no idea at all what to take as a Weak entity set?
