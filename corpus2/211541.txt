I am trying to deploy a _Redis_ server in Linux. The _Redis_ official site provides source code to download, so I have to use ' _make_ ' to install Radis. The ' _make_ ' works, but my problem is how can I use **rpm** file to install it? Because of policy, I must obey the policy of software installation for this specific environment. The policy also bother me to install other software by making source code. What is your opinion? Thanks!
