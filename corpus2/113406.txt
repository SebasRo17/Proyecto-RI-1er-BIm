I'm using xml to store cross-program information. This information is used in some webpages and in C# programs. When the information is altered, these alterations are not displayed right away in the webpages, they keep on displaying the information saved in cache, it takes a few refreshes for the webpage to show these alterations. Is there any way I can force the webpages to show the actual file and not the cached one?
