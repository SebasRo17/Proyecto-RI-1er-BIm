I was playing with xslittlegrass's Pov-Ray package and more generally with the POV-conversion function `ExportString[#, "POV"] &`, and noticed that `ExportString[#, "POV"] &` seems to ignore colors given to objects using `ColorFunction`. For example:               ParametricPlot3D[{Cos[ϕ] Sin[θ], Sin[ϕ] Sin[θ], Cos[θ]}, {ϕ, 0, 2 π}, {θ, 0, π},      PlotPoints -> 100, Mesh -> None,       ColorFunction -> Function[{x, y, z, ϕ, θ}, Hue[Sin[6 ϕ] Sin[6 θ]]],      ColorFunctionScaling -> False]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4Z90o.png) However, applying `ExportString[#, "POV"] &` to the previous graphics object yields a POV-Ray script which, when rendered, consists entirely of white triangles: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7MHB4.png) So it seems that the surface coloration provided by the `ColorFunction` specified in the plot does not get converted to the POV output at all. Is there some way to correctly export the plot colors provided by `ColorFunction`?
