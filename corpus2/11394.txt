I have the following function I want to plot in 3D (For simplicities sake we can say $a=5,b=-1,c=3$.)               f[x_, y_, a_, b_,c_] := ((E^(b x) - E^(b y)) x)/((c E^(a b) + E^(b x)) (x - y))      However, when I plot it I get error messages for Intermediate values. To try to solve this I used `Exclusions`, but despite this I still get the same error messages.               Plot3D[{f[x, y,5,-1,3]}, {x, 9, 10}, {y, 9, 10}, Exclusions -> {x - y == 0}]      I thought I should maybe exclude the values `-0.1<=x-y<=0.1`, but I don't really know how to do it or if it works. Another thought I had was maybe use the conditions that result from using reduce. However, I'm not sure how to use the results to exclude intermediate values.               Reduce[f[x, y,5,-1,3] == 0, x]      Any suggestions on other ways to do it would be greatly appreciated.
