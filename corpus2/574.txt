For example, this input...               {{1, 2}, {3, 4}}*{{1, 2}, {3, 4}}      produces this output...               {{1, 4}, {9, 16}}      and this input...               {{1, 2}, {3, 4}}^2      produces the same...               {{1, 4}, {9, 16}}      What I want in both cases is...               {{7, 10}, {15, 22}}      I think I know what's going on here. Mathematica doesn't seem to be discriminating between lists of lists, and matrices, and the `*` and `^` operators are just threading over the lists. I've found `.` and `MatrixPower` which do what I think `*` and `^` should. But the question still remains, is this confusing (to at least me) behavior of `*` and `^` by design, and what benefit does it confer?
