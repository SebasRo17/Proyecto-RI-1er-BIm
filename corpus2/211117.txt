I am using state pattern on 28 states in my application. The states are for membership cards that has 7 major states, there are 4 boolean attributes for the membership card that actually affects the its behavior so I have decided to embed them with states, that's how it multiplied to 28 states. The problem now is with states class naming, it is getting crazing, I am ending up with class state named like this `Membership-UnderCreation-Printed- Linked-Premium-Frozen` \----- I have hyphened different attributes to make it clear. Is it ok for state class names to be like this?
