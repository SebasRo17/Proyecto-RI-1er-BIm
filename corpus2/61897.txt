Whenever we start reading a big project source code it's often necessary to note down the calling chains and notes that reason why a specific code pattern was chosen, for example. I found primitive tools like A4 sheets lack the cut and paste or find capabilities. Consider working with a very simple editor like command line ones (such as `vim`/`emacs` or `nano`), or other lite IDEs like `Geany`. What are your methods to take notes to help you track the code folds and- ummm- mazes?
