I am currently reading illustrated C# by Apress(on my first read through) and was thinking about moving on to illustrated WPF or Pro WPF after. I was wondering if anyone has read either and could tell me if pro WPF covers everything in illustrated WPF or should I get illustrated wpf then move to pro? Also, if anyone was thinking about getting illustrated C#, its not a bad book, it can get kind of confusing for someone who hasn't done any programming at all, but I find if you mix the structure of the book with some online videos it goes pretty well.
