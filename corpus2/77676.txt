Previously, I wanted to learn Python quickly: Resource to start with Python quickly? and I was quite successful (enough to write a simplified LISP interpreter). Now I need to learn JavaScript for some web programming using Prototype and Scriptaculous with Ruby on Rails. Are there any resources to learn JavaScript quickly in reasonable depth? I am not a beginner programmer, but I have no experience with JavaScript. Are there any good quick tutorials?
