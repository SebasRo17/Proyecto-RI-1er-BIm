I'm here to post this question and know more about your thoughts on it: **Can you work with noise?** Sometimes, when you're developing something really tricky, your deadline is getting close, and someone enters your room talking to your colleagues, with loud talking, suddenly... your logic is gone! :-) About me, it's really funny and ironic this: when it comes to music, I can think better, maybe because I'm focused in my solution avoiding distractions and chit-chat. But I know people who told me that they can't work in silence. I just can't work with too much noise. How about you?
