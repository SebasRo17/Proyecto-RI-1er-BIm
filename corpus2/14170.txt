You can define shortcuts for notebook cell styles in the stylesheet editor, by adding `MenuCommandKey->"7",` etc. to the style definition. That is, you can define `Alt`-`1` to set/create a cell with one style, `Alt`-`2` a different style, ..., through `Alt`-`9`. From the documentation in Mathematica 8 for `MenuCommandKey` for styles: > Acceptable values include None and "1" through "9". So it appears that there are only 9 possible shortcuts. But there are more than 9 styles I commonly use. Is it possible to define additional such shortcuts?
