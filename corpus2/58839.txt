I working with the integral               Integrate[(4*(x^2 + y^2))/(1 + x^2 + y^2)^2 +                 Derivative[0, 1][w][x, y]^2 + Derivative[1, 0][w][x, y]^2 +                  (4*x*Derivative[0, 1][w][x, y] -  4*y*Derivative[1, 0][w][x, y])/(1 + x^2 + y^2),               {x, -Infinity,  Infinity},               {y, -Infinity, Infinity}]      Mathematica is not able to reduce this any further even with `FullSimplify`. I believe this integral diverges to positive infinity, since if we distribute the integrals over the addition, the integral of the first term clearly is positive and diverges and the second term is non-negative. The third term can be negative and arbitrarily large, but it is asymptotically smaller than the second term. If that is correct and provided `w` and its partial partial derivatves are defined throughout the domain, the answer should be `Infinity`, in the same way Mathematica returns `Infinity` for things like `-Log[0]`, despite the usual mathematical issues with this. How can I guide Mathematica to do this? * * * ### Edit The above integral can also be rewritten as               Integrate[((2*x)/(1 + x^2 + y^2) +                    Derivative[0, 1][w][x, y])^2 +               (-((2*y)/(1 + x^2 + y^2)) +                    Derivative[1, 0][w][x, y])^2,         {x, -Infinity, Infinity},         {y, -Infinity, Infinity}]      but Mathematica cannot do anything with that either.
