2 years ago I starded learning AS3 in order to get hired at a web design company. A few months later, I ditched it, because I discovered that I'm better at design; so now I'm a web designer. Recently, I decided that knowing JavaScript would be nice and helpful, so i started with Essential JavaScript Training from Lynda.com. Untill today, I was under the impression that my knowledge of programming was somewhat basic. What happened today...? I learned (through trial and error) that variables are only valid in the functions that they're defined in. This turned my world upside down. I was like: "that makes sense now..." thinkin of the all the headaches that the lack of this specific piece of knowledge gave me. How could I have missed such a fundamental thing while learning AS3 (and now JS)? I didn't. And I remember reading a at least three books on AS3, but none of them taught me about programming. So what I want to ask you, is if you could recommend me a good JavaScript book from which i can learn programming, too, besides syntax. Thanks! And sorry for my bad english :)
