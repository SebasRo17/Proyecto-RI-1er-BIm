Very new to Mathematica. Used the code to solve for the response of a system of spring mass dampers but would like to export the data to Excel.               Dyn = NDSolve[{Response[[1]] == 0, Response[[2]] == 0,                     Response[[3]] == 0, Response[[4]] == 0, x[0] == 0.1, x'[0] == 0,                     phi[0] == 0, phi'[0] == 0, xf[0] == 0, xf'[0] == 0, xr[0] == 0,                     xr'[0] == 0}, {x, phi, xf, xr}, {t, 0, 1}];          Plot[Evaluate[{x[t], phi[t], xf[t], xr[t]} /. Dyn], {t, 0, 1}, PlotRange -> All]      Basically want `x`, `phi`, `xf` and `xr` against time, only in Excel. Thanks.
