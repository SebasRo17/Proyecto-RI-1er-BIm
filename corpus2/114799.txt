I'm a senior studying CS and slated to graduate in about a year. I'm planning to become a web developer, but I have an opportunity to spend more time working in an IT support role. That seems like a detour from my chosen career path as a web/application developer. Is this true, or are there valuable skills I could pick up from a few years in IT?
