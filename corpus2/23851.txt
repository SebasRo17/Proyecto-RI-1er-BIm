In this answer, Simon Woods concludes that when you display an expression with head graph more than once, something is getting stored somewhere. I looked into it too and found out this only happens if you tie the expression with head graph to a symbol. Evaluating the symbol a second time will no longer print messages and results of random numbers are the same. Consider this example               g=Graph[{1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 1},         VertexShapeFunction -> ({Random[] // Hue, Disk[Print["VSF"]; #, 0.05]} &)]      --prints--> messages --displays-> a graph with pretty colors               g      --displays--> a graph with the same pretty colors (and does not print messages) even though               g // FullForm // InputForm      returns               (*output*)     FullForm[Graph[{1, 2, 3}, {DirectedEdge[1, 2], DirectedEdge[2, 3],            DirectedEdge[3, 1]}, {VertexShapeFunction ->              {{Hue[Random[]], Disk[Print["VSF"]; #1, 0.05]} & }}]]      where we can see that the colors are supposed to be generated randomly by the option `VertexShapeFunction`. However, after evaluating               ClearSystemCache[];      evaluating g will (almost almost surely ;) ) yield a graph with a new colors. this Q&A seems related. **My question is** : How can we turn off such caching? We can find systemoptions having to do with Cache by evaluating               SystemOptions["Cache*"]      but setting all the rules of the form               "Cache"-> True      to               "Cache" -> False      does not change the way the graphics behave. They do however influence the value of               Timing[N[Pi, 1000000]][[1]]      The SystemOptions can be set by evaluating               SetSystemOptions["CacheOptions" -> "Developer" -> "Cache" -> False];     SetSystemOptions["CacheOptions" -> "Numeric" -> "Cache" -> False];     SetSystemOptions[       "CacheOptions" -> "ParametricFunction" -> "Cache" -> False];     SetSystemOptions["CacheOptions" -> "Quantity" -> "Cache" -> False];     SetSystemOptions["CacheOptions" -> "Symbolic" -> "Cache" -> False];
