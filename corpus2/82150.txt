Currently I am employed as high level programmer doing some algorithmic & database stuff in C++. In my company there are programmers that are writing Windows kernel drivers (mostly software drivers not hardware). Recently I have read some materials about windows kernel programming and I realised that this type of programming that I am really passionate about (more than high level programming). I would like to switch to kernel programming but I need a plan to do this. I was thinking about asking a boss to move me to the mentioned project but in my company you cannot freely move between projects (there is a lot of pressure to become specialist in one field). I was thinking about changing jobs but there is one issue. Does my high level background disqualify me in becoming kernel programmer? Maybe I should not put on CV my high level jobs? Could you give some advice in changing my job?
