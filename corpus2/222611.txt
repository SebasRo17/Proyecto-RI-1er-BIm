I have an admin controller that is just used for its index action which renders a view with the most recent updates to certain resources:               class AdminController < ApplicationController              before_action :authenticate_user!         layout "admin"              def index             @events = Event.last(3)             @foos   = Foo.last(3)             @bars   = Bar.last(3)         end          end      Now, I want to create a new event. So I have an Events controller:               class EventsController < ApplicationController            before_action :authenticate_user!, only: [:new,:create]       layout "admin", only: [:new]                 def index         @events = Event.all       end            def show       end            def new       end            def create       end                    end      But I want to display a list of events that have previously been added in the same view as the form for creating a new event. Should I retrieve all the events in the new action? i.e.               def new       @events = Event.all     end      Or is there a better approach(perhaps more restful)?
