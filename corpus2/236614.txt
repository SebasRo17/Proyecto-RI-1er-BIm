I use git for my personal projects, so I have never run into any issues with Git, however I had a discussion at work today and its something that I haven't thought about. In TFS you can store your changeset into a shelveset, this shelveset can be viewed by other developers, say for a peer review. From what I understand in github you are working on your local copy of the repo (possibly with custom branches for different features) and then comes a point for a peer review. How would you go about sharing a specific changes on your local repo with someone else?
