I am currently creating something that has been inspired by another library. It is a complete rewrite on another platform - yet, has the same purpose and functionality and is written in the same language. As far as I understand it, this is still considered a derivative work. The original piece is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. Which steps do I need to take now when publishing my source under the Apache 2.0 license? Do I have to maintain copyright notices? If so, it can't obviously be in the source files (which are all new and cannot be mapped to the original piece). What do I have to do to be on the safe side? What do I have to include when I distribute the sources?
