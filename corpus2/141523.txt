I'm working full time 5 days a week, mostly between 10 and 14 hours a day. In the end of the day I'm very tired and just wanna take a shower, hang out and go to sleep. I have a lot of ideas that I want to implement and someday sell maybe through an online software business. I have my weekends free. However, when I get to the weekend I can't even imagine myself turn on the computer. But I really want to make my ideas happen, and I can't leave my job right now to devote myself only to my ideas. What do you say? Do you find some method helpful? Do you use some technique? Thanks
