I work in a company that does web applications for various banks and some smaller e-shops We employ about 20 developers and have 4-5 projects in development at any one time. Our development teams don't interact much and a lot of the same problems are done in varied ways(good to bad). I was wondering if it would be a good idea for a company to have a team of programmers that do research on current frameworks and continually improve a common library of functions and a common framework to build current and future projects much faster and more efficiently. How large should a team like this be? Also should it have permanent members that train others or should it rotate people? **Update:** I was thinking about a common project that people can work on for fun that might spark some interest. It seems that when people have job pressures the solutions they come up with are not the best.
