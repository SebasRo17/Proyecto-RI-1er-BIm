I've been following the successful Git branching model guide for most of my development. I still wonder if the way I handle bug tickets is correct. My current workflow: Once I accept a bug ticket I will do a `git checkout -b bug/{ticket_number}`, create a single commit as a fix and then checkout develop and do a `git merge --no-ff`. I'd love to hear from the experiences of others whether or not I am abusing the --no-ff option in this instance. If I am, could someone suggest a better approach?
