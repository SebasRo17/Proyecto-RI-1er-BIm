I enjoy going to hackathons as it gives numerous benefits (like free pizza), but I have never successfully navigated the projects through to a good ending. Most hackathons in my area are approximately 8 hours of actual coding. What is the best way to manage a project in such a short time period? From creating the idea to some sort of semi-working product. In such a short time, should a project have one feature and if it gets done, another feature can be started? Should everyone work on the same feature? How should leadership be formed? Should there be leadership or direct democracy? It always seems that either the scope of the project is too much, or major time will be lost on solving some sort of problem.
