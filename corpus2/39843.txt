I have a build computer where Visual Studio not installed, only MSbuild which can build VS2008 projcets without having any Visual Studio installed. I wonder whether it is possible to use MSbuild with VC++ 6.0 project files, although I am thinking this could not be possible. In the past I have used it with a VS2008 solution file for C++, but not for building C++ 6.0 dsw file. For Vb6 we have an extension package for Msbuild (MSBuild.ExtensionPack.VisualStudio.VB6). Is anything similar available for C++ 6.0 projects? An alternative could be if there are lightweight build tools that can built VC6++ .dsw files without having to install Visual Studio 6.0 ?
