Over the past years I learned about 14 programming languages (assembler phyton delphi qbasic c++ c# ruby perl - etc etc etc). However this was all out of my own interest, I didn't went to school for it. Now without real education I am into a team with other programmers. We are into robotics with our work. In contrast to me they know about 2 languages and many frameworks I never had heard of before. I don't really feel behind them, but they can surprise me and other times I can surprise them with solutions. The largest difference is that they have worked for years in the IT, while to me the programming part, is new and I enjoy it. But after the many languages I find it a bit hard to improve. Sometimes I see code (or tools) that are new to me. I never used tools as anksvn, or did versioning or never had seen USB driver made in code, I got used to them, learned from them on projects and my colleagues. I started making money with code (without a real degree) the last 2 years. Given that I haven't found any good YouTube channel or a book, that might improve my skills, how can I improve further? My interests these days are C++ and C#. The point I loose interests if books start with the basics of "if then while for types objects" after 14 languages you get that.
