I am struggling with understanding the code given in this original post I understand how the tests are conducted, both of them. However, I do not understand this part:               FitModel[data_List, coords_List] :=       With[{lm = LinearModelFit[data, coords, coords]},         dispatch[{           "BreuschPagan" -> BreuschPagan[data, lm, coords],           "WhitesHeteroskedasticity" -> WhitesHeteroskedasticity[lm, coords]}]];     dispatch[list_][field_] := field /. list     dispatch[list_]["Properties"] := list /. Rule[field_, _] :> field     dispatch /: ReplaceAll[fields_, dispatch[list_]] := fields /. list     Format[dispatch[list_], StandardForm] :=        HoldForm[dispatch]["<" <> ToString@Length@list <> ">"]      Could someone explain what this is doing? If you recommend that I do it in a chat, I have created a chat room for such discussion. I find it particularly difficult to understand the code for `dispatch` and how it works.
