We've just been through a hiring cycle and one thing that struck me was the fact that interviewees that threw every buzz word on the planet at us tended to rate the lowest. We gave them each a simple design problem and asked them how they would approach it. The people that sketched a simple process flow on the board were generally the ones that impressed. The ones that leant back and then said something like "This look like a typical xxx pattern. It's an interesting paradigm and probably requires a phase-shift in your current methodology" didn't generally impress.
