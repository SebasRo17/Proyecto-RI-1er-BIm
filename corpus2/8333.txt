It's convenient to abbreviate often-used function names, eg `Dim = Dimension`. Is it possible to abbreviate long context symbols, e.g. _Combinatorica_ when the context is not inserted in the context path, like with               Block[{$ContextPath}, Needs["Combinatorica`"]]      `Com = Combinatorica` doesn't work, eg: `Com`Star[6]` is fixed by the interpreter. Is there a way to abbreviate it?
