I have a system of just two recurrence equations, I need to solve them and so I use `RSolve`:               RSolve[{H[n + 1] == (1 + (7 h[n])/10) H[n],              h[n + 1] == 1 - (1 + (7 h[n])/10) H[n]},             {H[n], h[n]}, n]       But this just returns my code, without any errors: > >     RSolve[{H[1 + n] == (1 + (7 h[n])/10) H[n], >             h[1 + n] == 1 - (1 + (7 h[n])/10) H[n]}, >            {H[n], h[n]}, n] >   Where am I going wrong? Why am I not even seeing any errors? Additional Info:   * I am modelling the frequency of two variants, H and h, through discrete time (n)   * Total frequency in the population: h + H = 1   * The two variant's frequencies depend on each other as you can see in the above code
