I have been looking for a job for more than 3 weeks and have applied for about 30 vacancies. From all of these I only received few calls from recruitment agencies which didn't propose anything special. One of them just forwarded my CV to the employee and another suggested me to fix my current CV. I made some changes to CV which they didn't like and resent it back. No reply since. I feel frustrated and worried. First of all I don't like that everything vacancy should go through recruitment agency. Even if I want to apply directly I cannot find any name or any lead which company is recruiting. Secondly I don't see any reason why nobody replies back. My cover letter is in plain text and CV is made in Latex. Everything is crafted by all suggestion I have read over the internet and one very interesting book "The Google Resume". What I am doing wrong? Is there any tips how to search direct jobs? Particularly I am interested in UK job market. P.S. I am using http://www.simplyhired.co.uk/ which I believe is the best site because it accumulates from all it job boards.
