I'm developing an enterprise website, and I have to define some sections like this:   * I have many sections and each section have many (or one) sub-pages.    * The number of sub-pages vary per section.   * Each sub-page should not be longer than 2500 characters Also, I have to use a relational database (MySQL). I'm in doubt which would be the better in terms of design and/or performance:   1. To store a `JSON` array, with all sub-pages as object, as a single column of the `Sections` table;   2. To create a table `Sub-pages` which references it's parent section by a `Foreign Key`.
