I have a list. I want to get all the elements in that list which do not match a given pattern. That is, I want the strings which do not match any of the following patterns:   1. First and last characters are the same: $123aw1$    2. Does not have two consecutive similar characters: $1era22we, awe33rt, 123aa123$ I wrote following code               inputset = ToString /@ {       11223434, 12123434, 11234342, 11234243, 11234234, 11232434, 12132434,        12134234, 11234324, 11232443, 11234423, 12134243, 12314234, 12314324,        12341234, 11223344, 11223443, 11234432     };     outputset = Complement[inputset,        Select[inputset,          StringMatchQ[#, StringExpression[x_, ___, x_]] ||            StringMatchQ[#, StringExpression[___, x_, x_, ___]] &]];      and I got > >     outputset = {12123434, 12132434, 12134234, 12134243, 12314234, 12314324, > 12341234} >   Is there an easy simple and efficient way to do this?
