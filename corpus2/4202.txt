I'm looking for some explanation or advice, not help in solving something. Recently I finished my program and my supervisor said "Ok, now it's time for your first paper: write a scientific text about how your program works". If I understand him correctly it means I have to describe the algorithm I used instead of writing in a manner like "for this purpose I use the built-in `Interpolation` function, and for this purpose I use `NDSolve`" etc. I know how `FindRoot` and `NDSolve` work because there is an explanation in the doc pages about the methods they use, but I did not find detailed information about `Interpolation`. The only thing I know it fits with polynomial curves. So my question is: What exactly does the `Interpolation` function do? How does it work? How does it determinate (partial) derivatives? And why do 3D data points have to be situated in rectangle order to interpolate a surface? If there is some literature I may read and then reference it would be great too.
