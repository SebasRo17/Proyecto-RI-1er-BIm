Other people have answered this question, but I'm new to _Mathematica_. We're supposed to use the `Manipulate` and `Show` commands to produce two functions: one that is sin(x), and the other a line that moves tangent along f(x)=sin(x). I have no idea if this makes any sense, but the other pages don't. This equation was given as a hint:               Manipulate[Plot[Sin[t], {t, 0, 2π},      Ticks -> {Range[0, 2π, π/6], Sin[Range[-(π/2), π/2, π/6]]},          Epilog -> {{Dashed, Line[{{x, 0}, {x, Sin[x]}, {0, Sin[x]}}]},           {Red, PointSize[.015], Point[{x, Sin[x]}]}}],       {{x, (2π/3}, 0,2π}]      Anything helps. Thank you. :)
