I am trying to use a special font with musical symbols in a .cdf that I send to some friends. The font is called "Tempera" and is freely distributed here: http://christian.texier.pagespro-orange.fr/mididesi/free/index.htm#tempera In the .cdf I use substitutions like this:               sub = "A" -> "\*StyleBox[\(\!\(\*StyleBox[\"A\",\n\        FontFamily->\"Mathematica6\"]\)\!\(\*StyleBox[\"U\",\n\        FontFamily->\"Tempera\",\nFontSize->18,\nFontWeight->\"Plain\"]\)\)]";      which are used in this manner:                "A" //. sub      What this does is to change the regular "A" character into a curly A (from the Mathematica6 font) and a symbol that is a half-sharp (the "U" from the Tempera font). This works fine in Mathematica, and also in the .cdf on my computer. However, when I send it to my friend, he sees the "U" and not the half-flat. This is probably what you will see too, unless you download the Tempera font. I believe this means that Mathematica does not embed the font in the .cdf, and I'm wondering if there is any way to force the embedding to occur. While I could have my friend download the font, if I ever want to place the .cdf on the web, this would not be practical.
