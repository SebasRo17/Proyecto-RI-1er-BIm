private string mWhatever;          private string Whatever     {         get         {             return this.mWhatever;         }         set         {             this.mWhatever = value;         }     }      I've seen some people who make properties for every single member, private or not... does this make any sense? I could see it making sense in 1% of the cases at times when you want to control access to the member inside the class containing it because if you didn't use properties for every member it would lead to inconsistencies and checking to see if the member has an access or not (since you have access to both in the scope of the class).
