Hi I'm intrested in using the apparently now defunct app-mdi libray in a flex application for a paying customer. http://sourceforge.net/projects/appmdi/ It appears that the app-mdi project has been forked from flex-mdi and indeed the code has so much in common it would appear almost identical to the origional code. Now in the original source flex-mdi the following licence appears in the source code > /* Copyright (c) 2007 FlexMDI Contributors. See:   >  http://code.google.com/p/flexmdi/wiki/ProjectContributors Permission is > hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this > software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the > Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to > use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell > copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is > furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: The above copyright > notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or > substantial portions of the Software.

The copyright notice in its entireity makes no sense in binary material. Specifically talking about redistobutions in the binary form. Finally the question is what exactly has to be shown on web clients who access softare that utilises this library? Also is changing the licence in this manner actually allowed?
