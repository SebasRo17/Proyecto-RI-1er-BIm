I would like to have a command "RedoButton" which would make a button (or whatever control is suitable) that when clicked would print the value of a certain function over and over _in the same place_. So for example `RedoButton["do it", RandomInteger[{1, 10}]` would produce a button that, when clicked, would produce a random integer of the sort required, clicking it again would produce a possibly different random integer where the old one was, and so on. I have tried `Toggle`, `Button`, and numerous other commands but can't make any of them work correctly.
