It seems like every .net book talks about value types vs reference types and makes it a point to (often incorrectly) state where each type is stored - the heap or the stack. Usually it's in the first few chapters and presented as some all-important fact. I think it's even covered on certification exams. Why does stack vs heap even matter to (beginner) .Net developers? You allocate stuff and it just works, right?
