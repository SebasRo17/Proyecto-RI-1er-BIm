For the bugs or issues, there are now many good issues trackers available which allows status and tracking issues and also allows you to organize it to manage specific releases. I am looking for test case tools should be able to support listing of functionality and test cases with possible linkage to them, allows test suits or test plans (as group/ hierarchies) to organize them. Some of the potential usage could be to identify list of key test cases that must be executed if particular functionality or modules are affected. Also Additional parameters to support related to system of execution. It would be best if result of execution of tests can be recorded with necessary comments. Web interface and possible email notifications could be essential. Please note that i am _NOT_ looking at test automation systems like cruise control etc. but more as a system for testing management. I am more keen to see a system that allows visualization of Traceability matrix. Open source projects are most appreciated, though please also suggest if there is commercial software. Are there any tools that allow you to track and manage test cases and test execution?
