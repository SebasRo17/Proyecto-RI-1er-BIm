**Is there any way to connect`Modelica` with `JaamSim`?** As I want an open source GUI with drag and drop option for simulation with `Modelica` running in back-end. _I have already tried`SimForge` but there is no drag and drop option in it whereas `JaamSim` has drag and drop option but it doesn't runs Modelica for back-end processing._ I am basically looking for a open source GUI built using JAVA.
