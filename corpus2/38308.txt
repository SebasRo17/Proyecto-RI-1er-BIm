I have made this function:               conv01 = Map["["<>StringJoin@@Riffle[#,","]<>"]"&,Map[ToString,#,{2}],{0,1}]&      to convert:               list = {{1, 2, "test3"}, {3, 4, "test4"}}      to               "[[1, 2, \"test3\"], [3, 4, \"test4\"]]"      I know that I can do: `conv02 = StringReplace[ToString[#], {"{" -> "[", "}" -> "]"}] &` but it's not same if I have `{` or `}` inside it. I have tried:               conv03 = Map["[" <> ToString@Row[#, ","] <> "]" &, list, {0, 1}]      but it doesn't work and I don't understand why if this works:               "[" <> ToString@Row[{1, 2, 3, 4}, ","] <> "]"      Some clue on the last method? Some idea of simpler solution?
