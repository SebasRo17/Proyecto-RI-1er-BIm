I'm just wondering about _"stringify"_ vs _"serialize"_. To me they're the same thing (though I could be wrong), but in my past experience (mostly with asp.net) I use `Serialize()` and never use `Stringify()`. I know I can create a simple alias in Javascript,               // either     JSON.serialize = function(input) {         return JSON.stringify(input);     };          // or     JSON.serialize = JSON.stringify;      http://jsfiddle.net/HKKUb/ but I'm just wondering about the difference between the two and why stringify was chosen. * * * for comparison purpose, here's how you serialize XML to a String in C#               public static string SerializeObject<T>(this T toSerialize)     {         XmlSerializer xmlSerializer = new XmlSerializer(toSerialize.GetType());         StringWriter textWriter = new StringWriter();              xmlSerializer.Serialize(textWriter, toSerialize);         return textWriter.ToString();     }
