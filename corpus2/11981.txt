So I'm thinking about doing a masters, or some other form of degree to add to my Bsc in Computer Science - and am looking for ideas on some of the more unusual options out there. It seems to be fairly easy to understand "typical" career paths for programmers (and indeed, I may take one of those) - but I also want to explore what other possibilities exist. So - What is this question: I am looking for people who have taken their programming careers into more unusual directions, specifically with a focus on the education to get there:   * Politics   * Law   * Psychology   * Business (ok, not that unsual, but I'll include it)   * Other sciences (biology, etc)   * Anything else you can think of I suspect the science option will not be the one for me - but for completness on the question I will include it. Likewise if there are some really interesting offshoots that I have not thought of lets add them in. What this question is not: There are quite a few other questions on this and other stackexchange sites dealing with similar questions - and there are quite a few answers from people detailing why they advocate staying in computers forever. I love programming. And I may continue looking for ways to grow in this industry (team lead, architect, etc). But those answers have been _well and truly_ covered. So for this question I would really like to hear from people who have gone through different routes, the career paths they ended up on, and their thoughts on it. Thanks!
