I've calculated the harmonic addition theorem and would just like to check my result with _Mathematica_. However,               a Exp[I (ω t + ϕ1)] + b Exp[I (ω t + ϕ2)] ==      Sqrt[a^2 + b^2 + 2 a b Cos[ϕ1 - ϕ2]] Exp[     I (ω t + ArcTan[(a Sin[ϕ1] + b Sin[ϕ2])/(a Cos[ϕ1] +      b Cos[ϕ2])])] && Element[{a, b, ϕ1, ϕ2, ω, t}, Reals]      does not evaluate to True, Reduce does not work either. Numerically, it seems to be true on a 10^-15 level:               init = a Exp[I (ω t + ϕ1)] +  b Exp[I (ω t + ϕ2)]     /. {a -> 3, b -> 5, ϕ1 -> 0, ϕ2 -> π/3, ω -> 1}          sum = Sqrt[a^2 + b^2 + 2 a b Cos[ϕ1 - ϕ2]] Exp[I (ω t +      ArcTan[(a Sin[ϕ1] + b Sin[ϕ2])/(a Cos[ϕ1] + b Cos[ϕ2])])]     /. {a -> 3, b -> 5, ϕ1 -> 0, ϕ2 -> π/3, ω -> 1}          Plot[Re[init - sum], {t, -30, 30}]     Plot[Im[init - sum], {t, -30, 30}]      What should I be doing better / what's the point I am missing?
