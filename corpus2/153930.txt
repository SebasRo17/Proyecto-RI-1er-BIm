I am a non-technical recruiter and I want to lay out some initial interview questions, one of which is to determine the analytic skill of a person. We will soon launch our hiring process for programmers and we are mapping out what would be the best questions. I have read quite a few posts here that suggested on how to interview programmers but I haven't come across on what technical question to ask that non-technical recruiters can easily comprehend if the answer is good or bad.
