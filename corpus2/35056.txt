After finishing a few tutorials, I thought I was ready to calculate the pixel values of a large (smaller numbers 20x20 used here) image and export to a standard format (.jpg) but my code doesn't work. I am clearly missing something important. I thought it might be best to see if someone would look at a small segment of the code and comment.               (* image calc *)     numrow = 20;     numcol = 20;          (* midpoint of image *)     midrow = N[numrow/2];     midcol = N[numcol/2];          (* azimuth angle of pixel from center point *)      (* mixed symbolic and numeric results *)     patfun[i_,j_] := N[ArcTan[i-midrow,j-midcol]];          (* spoke-like image *)     pat = Array[patfun[i,j], 20, 20];
