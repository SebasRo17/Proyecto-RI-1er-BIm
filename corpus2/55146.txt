I am trying to figure out how to use Mathematica as a real-time interface. I've used Excel/ODBC connection to a SQL database to use the graphing functions within to get my real-time dashboard. I also know there are many Python implementations (http://dashing.io/), Javascript (d3), Ruby() on watching data. I currently I not looking to do this at a big data implementation. The first piece I am looking for to do is have an updated top 10 SKU Sales that are over 30 locations that are synced back to a Sql Server Database. My thought was to use a simple `SQLExecute` statement to the database every 5 minutes or so. Currently I am trying to figure out how to reissue that command to the db to get my new numbers and automatically update the table. The second piece is to watch transaction flow at each of these locations. Here I just simply want to graph by the hour which I'd update an array with the data. I just don't know how to trigger the data execution. After some searching online, I haven't found anyone who has done this with Mathematica. Does anyone have links/examples where a dashboard is implemented into Mathematica?
