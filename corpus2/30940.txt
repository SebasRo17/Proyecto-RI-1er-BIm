As part of another issue, the following has come up. Create an `Interpretaion`:               Interpretation[Subscript[a, b], a[b]]      Select and copy the $a_b$ output from the notebook. If you paste it into a text file, you get: `a[b]`, which is correct as the `Inputform`, and what we want. However, if you select it and choose Copy as Latex, you get: `\text{$\$$CellContext$\grave{ }$a}(\text{$\$$CellContext$\grave{ }$b})` in a text file. I would like to be able to copy this and get the latex as $a_b$, or $a[b]$ as a worst case. Are there any tricks that could help here? (I don't think this has anything to do with subscripts)
