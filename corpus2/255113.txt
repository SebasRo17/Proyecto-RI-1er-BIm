I am working on a huge web application in which I need to add transparent failover feature. I understand the necessary steps to make a web application distributable, the most difficult thing being: to ensure that the objects stored in the session are serializable. I want to know which type of variables exactly should I store in the session? e.g. just login info or other things too. The web application is actually a gateway to numerous other smaller applications like generating business reports, setting calander etc. So will I have to make those other applications also serializable or just the logon application will suffice ? I am new to web development so excuse me if the question is trivial.
