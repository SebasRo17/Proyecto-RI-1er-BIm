I had an idea for a website. After much coding and thinking out the idea, I've got it to a decent stage. If I were someone else, potentially a more commercially-minded person, I might want to sell it, or slather it with ads. However, I've fallen somewhat in love with open-source, and I'd like to host the project on GitHub and give it a nice open-source license. However, the project seems to be getting better all the time and, in fact, I think that it'll quickly grow to be fairly popular. So I want to put ads on it that benefit charity. How can I ensure that one small text advertisement benefiting charity remains in all derivative works? Are there any licenses that would let me do this? p.s. My other requirement for a license is that it gives me attribution (in the same form as the MIT license would be fine) [EDIT] I've decided to just let it be Apache licensed. I'm hoping that people will just leave charity-benefiting ads in.
