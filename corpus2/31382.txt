I have a _Mathematica_ program that calculates a series of large vectors that I need to save for future reference (in addition to some scalar values). I want to save all these to a file, tagged by their _Mathematica_ names, as the calculation proceeds. `PutAppend` will not work because only the data values are stored, losing their associated names. `DumpSave` does not seem to append to the file, while it does store the values with their names. My goal is to be able to load back the expressions later for further analysis, with the names I gave them. I'm sure this is simple, but I have no experience with _Mathematica_ I/O and can't find what I need in the help.
