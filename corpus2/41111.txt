Let's say that $x$ is some real valued number $>0$.   Are the following commands interchangeable in the context of using `Assuming`?   1. `Assuming[{Re[x] > 0}, Integrate[...,x]]`   2. `Assuming[{x ∈ Reals && x > 0}, Integrate[...,x]]` Or, as I suspect, is this not true for the reason that `Re[x] > 0` should just mean that the Real component of $x$ is $>0$? Also, is there a way to more compactly specify `{x ∈ Reals && x > 0}`?
