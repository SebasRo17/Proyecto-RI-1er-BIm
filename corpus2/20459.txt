I want to use the solution of `Maximize`, defined as a function, in another function. Here's an example:               f1[y_] := x /. Last[Maximize[{Sin[x y], Abs[x] <= y}, x]]  (* or any other function *)      This definition is fine, for example if I give `f1[4]`, I get the answer `-((3 \[Pi])/8)`. The problem is that when I want to use it in another function I get an error. For example:               FindRoot[f1[y] == Pi/4, {y, 1}]      Gives me the following error: > ReplaceAll::reps: {x} is neither a list of replacement rules nor a valid > dispatch table, and so cannot be used for replacing. >> > > FindRoot::nlnum: The function value {-0.785398+(x/.x)} is not a list of > numbers with dimensions {1} at {y} = {1.}. >> I've been struggling with this for several days now! Any comment, idea, help, ... is deeply appreciated!
