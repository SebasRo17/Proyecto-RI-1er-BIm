How can we simplify tensor expressions in _Mathematica 9_ using the mixed- product identity $(A\otimes B)(C \otimes D) \equiv AC \otimes BD$ ? Is it possible to implement this kind of evaluations using the new _Mathematica 9_ tensor capabilities? The following expression is false:               TensorProduct[a, b].TensorProduct[c, d] === TensorProduct[ a.c, b.d]      I don't really need to prove this identity, but rather to use it for simplifying some expressions. In my case, $a$ and $c$ are some (unknown) symbolic matrices, while $b$ and $d$ are explicit integer $2\times 2$ matrices. I'd like _Mathematica_ to evaluate the matrix product between $b$ and $d$ explicitly. For instance, when               b=PauliMatrix[1]; d=PauliMatrix[3];      as the product of two Pauli matrices gives another Pauli matrix, I'd like to obtain the simplified result               TensorProduct[a.c, -I PauliMatrix[2]]
