I am planning to post an article on codeproject.com where I will be sharing some code I feel worthy of the effort - so I went and read the posting guidelines. It appears that I will have to select a software license for my submission. I really do not care about my material and what people will do with the code that I will give. If they profit from it that is all fine with me and I am happy to have shared my ideas. My concern really is more about my own personal protection that if the code I give for some remotest of reasons inflict damage to them or to their system that I should not be liable for anything. Or something to that effect. My material is about patterns for ASP.NET CRUD operations. I use this pattern every single project that I have. It is absolutely harmless, but you never know really how other people will use it. I just want to have some safety net. What license is suitable for me in this situation?
