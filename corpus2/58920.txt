I have a csv that encodes the results of plugging certain parameters (say, `A` and `B`) into certain functions (say, `f` and `g`). Think matrix with (say, 4) columns and a million rows with the columns corresponding to `A, B, C = f(A, B)`, and `D = g(A, B)` respectively. I'd like to be able to use the dynamic visualization features of mathematica, but this requires turning this data into discreet functions, and the columns into their own lists to use as domains in the Manipulate environment. I want to be able to do something like `Manipulate[Plot[function[A, B], {A, (list of values)}], {B, (list of values)}, {function, {f, g}}]` I have been poring over the Help guide for hours and this seems to be such a basic thing to do that I feel crazy for not being able to find it.
