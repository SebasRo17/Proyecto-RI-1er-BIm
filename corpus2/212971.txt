I'm developing an application where I'd like to use credentials from external websites. This will be used to login with the website API and get information for the user. Example: I want to use the user Reddit's account to warn him if more than X people reply to one of his comment. How would I go about storing the user's Reddit credentials on my end securely so I only ask once and can automate this process. Or is that even possible?
