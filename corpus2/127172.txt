I would like to launch an in-house user group/forum for the developers in my company, but I'm not sure how to get started. We have several teams of developers spanning many technologies and levels of experience. I envision this as an opportunity for all of us to come together and share techniques, best practices, lessons learned, pain points, new technologies, or anything else a dev finds interesting. This could also be a great way for new hires to integrate, learn how we do things, and share some of the expertise they bring with them. This is my first attempt at anything like this and I'd like to do it right. I'm interested in things like:   * Driving participation   * Keeping things interesting for both 20-year veterans and fresh, green graduates   * Avoiding pitfalls known to be toxic to user groups Has anyone done this successfully? If so, what can you share about the experience?
