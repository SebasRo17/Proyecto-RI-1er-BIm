I'm currently beta-testing an iPhone app. Right now I have sent out the first beta-test for my users and I have labeled that release as `1.0` for my testers. Now since the testers have tested the app we have discovered some bugs that I have fixed and I'm ready to send out a new beta-test for my users. Should I label the release as `1.0.1` then? Another question related to this is, when my testers have tested this `1.0.1` release and they do not find any bugs it would be a good time to release this version to the public in the App Store. What version number should I release this under in the App Store? First thought is that since it's the first release to the App Store it should have version number `1.0` but then it will be "out of sync" with the version that has been tested (`1.0.1`).
