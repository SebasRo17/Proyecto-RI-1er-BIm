I know C# pretty well (self-taught, sadly) and need to do some C++ programming for a Windows application. I have been able to find a ton of information for C++ developers learning C# but haven't been able to find much on learning C++ when you already know C#. Has anyone come across a good rundown of the basics? MSDN has a comparison but it is not very in-depth. I can piece together several sources but figured something was out there - I just can't find it. Thanks for your help.
