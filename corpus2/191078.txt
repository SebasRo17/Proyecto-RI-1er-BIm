I plan to import works from a Java GPL2 project into a GPL3 one.   1. How must I "head" all my project derivating sources files : must I put the GPL2 license of the original project (saying that "This file is part of PROJECT_NAME ...") above my project one ?   2. How should be the LICENSING file of the whole projet : must I put both licenses in it ?   3. I don't know yet if I will import nearly complete classes or just some pieces of codes from the original project. Anyway, how should I inform the user (saying, in a about dialog) : is saying "Work derivated from PROJECT_NAME project" enough ? Thanks in advance.
