I'm going to start by saying, this may not be the correct place to post this. So...I'm working in Embedded Development, using C. Is there any benefit or disadvantages to doing the following:               while (1)     {        i++;        switch (i)        {           case 1:              x_get_inputs();              break;           case 2:              x_react();              break;           case 3:              x_set_outputs();              i = 0;              break;           default:              break;         }     }      Rather than a standard list of function calls? I think this is similar to a _Round Robin RTOS_? My logic is that the program cycle time will be shorter, and as such this should be more efficient?
