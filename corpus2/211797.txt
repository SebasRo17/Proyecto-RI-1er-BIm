I'm researching what's needed for EDI as far as protocols and server/application setup. This is transportation industry and I'm interested in X12 format for transactions like 204, 210, 214. Specific question is: Do BOTH trading partners have to run servers? With AS3 it seems like SFTP server and it seems like one partner can run it and another partner can push/pull. What about AS2? Can it have server only on one side? Or both partners should be able to push?
