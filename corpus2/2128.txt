I have read that $\LaTeX$ source can be directly pasted into a Mathematica notebook. However, I have been unsuccessful in this regard. An example of the errors received are:               $\frac{1}{2}$     Syntax::sntxb: Expression cannot begin with "$ frac{1}{2}$".     Syntax::tsntxi: "$ frac" is incomplete; more input is needed.     Syntax::sntxi: Incomplete expression; more input is needed .      This is not remediated by removal of the `$` signs, placement of two `$` signs (`$$`), or use of other $\LaTeX$ math mode delimiters (e.g., `\\[ \\]`, `\begin{displaymath}\end{displaymath}`, `\begin{equation}\end{equation}`, etc). I do not wish to import an entire `.tex` file as I merely want to pass a few select equations. Please advise as to my error. Thank you. **Edit:** I am using Mathematica 8.0.1.0.
