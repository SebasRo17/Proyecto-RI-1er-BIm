Should boolean methods always take the affirmative form, even when they will only ever be used in the negative form? Say I wanted to check whether an entity exists before creating one, my argument is that the first form below is better than the second form, whether or not the method is ever used in the affirmative form. In summary, I find `if(!affirmative)` easier to read than `if(negative)`. I have a colleague who disagrees, thoughts? **First Form:**               int entity_id = 42;     if(!entity_exists(entity_id)) create_entity(entity_id);      **Second Form:**               int entity_id = 42;     if(entity_not_exist(entity_id)) create_entity(entity_id);
