I am in a dilemma about a job offer from a top 10 semiconductor companies in SF bay area. I have about 10 years of experience at various small to large (> $1 billion) companies in bay area. After my Graduate degree about 10 years ago I started at a big company in Bay area as as Sr Engineer. However, due to job change after a 5 years from that position, more job changes afterward, and not caring too much about titles, I am currently (still) a Sr Engineer at another company. Having had so many years of experience in Hi-tech I now realize that titles are important too. The dilemma is that this offer from another company also is for a Senior Software Engineer, and not a Staff or MTS title, which I after some investigation realize to be higher titles than just Sr engineer. Should I be asking the company (and its recruiter) to give me a higher title than a Sr Sw Engineer; is that expectation reasonable? I had the same Sr Engineer title 7 years ago and after many job experiences and a graduate degree I think I should be acknowledged by the new company making the job offer as a higher staff engineer. **Is there any way to find information about the company hierarchy as I can not trust the information company's recruiter is giving me due to his vested interest?** There are reviews about the company on sites like glassdoor but they do not provide a chance to put questions to employees. Are there any interactive websites/forums for Hi-tech employees (hardware design as well as software) where one could ask such question and hopefully get an answer from someone working at the company? PS: If needed, the company regularly appears in googled list of top 20 semiconductor corporation by sale for every year.
