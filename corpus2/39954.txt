I have a program that needs to be done like this:               ParametricPlot[       equation,       If[x < 1, {x, 0, t}, {x, t, 2}]]      But _Mathematica_ didn't seem to recognize the values of xmin and xmax in the range of the independent variable x, nor the variable x itself. The simplest solution, in my opinion, would be to insert `If` expressions into the range itself, something like this:               ParametricPlot[       equation,       {x, If[x < 1, 0, t], If[x >= 1, t, 2]}]      **EDIT:** This is why I needed to do this. I needed to paint the curve when $0<t\leq T$, but "delete" it when $T<t\leq2T$ ![Spirograph](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3zSEK.gif)
