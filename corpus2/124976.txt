ORMs and persistence ignorance make perfect sense: if I am programming in a language, then I want to use the language's native implementation of objects and data structures to drive my program. I shouldn't need to worry about SQL or a database, and I always thought that inline SQL strings in a program was very cumbersome. Why is SQL still used as a backend? Why doesn't the ORM just persist objects to XML or a binary file(s) and avoid all the overheads and difficulties of administering a database server?
