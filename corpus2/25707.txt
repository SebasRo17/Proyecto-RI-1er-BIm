> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  How Can I Know Whether I Am a Good Programmer? As many programmers I have worked in several languages. While of course there are some that I am more at ease than other, I do not have a real way to precisely measure my skill in a specific language. So I thought of a system which allows me to help me with that. I am looking for 5 common criteria in programming languages, to which I will have a value from 1 (junior) to 4 ( Senior) to represent my skill. I however have no real idea of the criteria I should choose for that. Does anybody have suggestion ? Thanks.
