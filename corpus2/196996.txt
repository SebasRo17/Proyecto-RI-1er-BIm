I am taking an introductory course on python and the instructor says that python is a high level language and C and C++ are low level languages. It's just damn confusing. I thought that C, C++, Python, Java, etc were all high level languages. I was reading questions at stackoverflow on C, C++, etc and they all seem to refer to those languages as high level. it seems to me that some programmers use those terms interchangably. Please clarify this for me.
