My company is developing driver for our hardware. Now I need to sign my driver for 32 and 64 bit platforms. Please tell, now I need to buy Authenticode certificate, right? What CA to use? DigiCert?   GlobalSign? ( http://www.sslshopper.com/microsoft-authenticode- certificates.html )   Symantec? ( http://www.symantec.com/verisign/code-signing/microsoft- authenticode ) What is the difference between this CA offers? I need to use tools from WDK?
