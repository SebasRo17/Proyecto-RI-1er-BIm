I have the following sample code.               StringSplit["a test string", " "]     Thread[WordData[%, "PartsOfSpeech"]]      The output I get is:               {a, test, string}     {{Noun, Preposition, Determiner}, {Noun, Verb}, {Noun, Verb}}      If I change `"a test string"` to `"test string"`, then my code fails, giving the following:               {test, string}     {}      Can anyone tell me why this is and how to solve it?
