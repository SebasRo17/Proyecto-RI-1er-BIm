Hello Mathematica community, my name is Preston! I have a real quick question that should be easy to answer. Alright, so for a research project that I'm involved it at my university, I need to illustrate the outline of a Cassini Oval using something I've been calling "concentric circles" - but that doesn't really matter. I've decided to use Mathematica in my research. I used the "Manipulate" function in order to illustrate what these "concentric circles" would do as their radii varied over a specific interval. Here's the code for that:                   Manipulate[         Graphics[{Circle[{-1, 0}, H], Circle[{1, 0}, 1.2/H]},          Axes -> True], {H, Sqrt[1.2 + 1] - 1, Sqrt[1.2 + 1] + 1}]        That is all fine and good, and it does exactly what I want. However, I really need to somehow plot the curve of the following function in the Manipulate:                   [(x+1)^2+y^2]*[(x-1)^2+y^2]=(1.2)^2      So, basically, as the manipulator runs, I want the "concentric circles" to do what they do, but I want the function I just listed to just sit still. The idea is that as the "concentric circles" change over the interval defined for $H$, their intersection will outline a Cassini Oval (the equation above). I would greatly appreciate any help. Thanks! Also, what I'm trying to do may be illustrated in the following code:                    x = Table[{(-1 + H^4)/(4 H^2), Sqrt[1 - H^2 + (2 H^2 (-1 + H^4))/(4 H^2) -               H^2 ((-1 + H^4)/(4 H^2))^2]/H}, {H, 1, 1 + Sqrt[2], 0.01}];              x1 = Table[{(-1 + H^4)/(4 H^2), -(Sqrt[1 - H^2 + (2 H^2 (-1 + H^4))/(4 H^2) -               H^2((-1 + H^4)/(4 H^2))^2]/H)}, {H, 1, 1 + Sqrt[2], 0.01}];              x2 = Table[{-((-1 + H^4)/(4 H^2)), Sqrt[1 - H^2 + (2 H^2 (-1 + H^4))/(4 H^2) -               H^2 ((-1 + H^4)/(4 H^2))^2]/H}, {H, 1, 1 + Sqrt[2], 0.01}];              x3 = Table[{-((-1 + H^4)/(4 H^2)), -(Sqrt[1 - H^2 + (2 H^2 (-1 + H^4))/(4 H^2) -               H^2 ((-1 + H^4)/(4 H^2))^2]/H)}, {H, 1, 1 + Sqrt[2], 0.01}];               m =              Manipulate[                  Graphics[{Green, Circle[{1, 0}, 1/H], Blue, Circle[{-1, 0}, H],                   Black, {BezierCurve[x]}, {BezierCurve[x1]},                   {BezierCurve[x2]}, {BezierCurve[x3]}}, Axes -> True], {H, 1/(Sqrt[2] + 1),                   Sqrt[2] + 1}]      This is something I did for a trivial Cassini Oval with constant product equal to 1. It sort of does what I want, but it's way to complicated and glitchy. I want to know if a more evolved code is possible.
