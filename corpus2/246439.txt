In Purescript, IO an other effects are managed with the Eff monad, and extensible effects, which are declared like this:               main :: Eff (trace :: Trace, random :: Random) {}      So if I understand well, this `main` declaration only allows to log to console, and generate random numbers. The `trace :: Trace, random :: Random` is a row of effect, ie an unordered labeled collection of effects. Now I get that `Trace` is an effect, and `trace` is its label. But why do we need both? It makes sense for records such as `{ foo::String, bar::String }` but I cannot understand why I would need to manage two `Random` effect with different labels. ie I would write the following:               main :: Eff (Trace, Random) {} -- no redundant labels      Are effect labels useful in purescript? If yes what for?
