[Note: I hope I am not breaking etiquette, but I originally posted a variant on this question here, but am re-asking here because I am making this now solely a question about programming.] I would like to program of the following simple form:   1. The user can produce X number of resizable frames (analogous to HTML frames).   2. Each frame serves as a simple text editor, which you can type into and save the whole configuration including resized windows and text.   3. The user should be able alternately "freeze" and present the information, and "unfreeze" and edit frames. Thus it will be a cross between a calendar and a text editor. I don't particularly care if it is a web application or not. What languages are ideal for such a setup? I know some C and Python and Html, and am willing to learn others if need be. It seems to me this should be a relatively easy program to make, but I need a little direction before starting. EDIT: My OS is Windows 7.
