I'm wondering what's the best way to add copyright/info into source for a client. Normally I do projects for myself and release them as GPL however I'm working with a client and not sure how to give them the source. Would something like this be correct? > /* Package: Project Name   >  File: filename.php   >  Author: My name (emailme@example.net)   >  (c) 2011 Client Name All Rights Reserved > > File Description....   >  */ The client owns the code once they have paid for it but I still think it's a good idea to add a file description and copyright to each file. Maybe this is a conversation to have with each client but does this seem like a fair (and legal) way to do it?
