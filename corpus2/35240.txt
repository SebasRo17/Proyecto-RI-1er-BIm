Mathematica overloads the `Min` and `Max` functions to retrieve the lower and upper bounds of an interval. I need functions that work properly on `Interval` arguments. For example, the minimum of `Interval[{3,4}]` and `Interval[{2,5}]` should be `Interval[{2,4}]`. To clarify based on comments, I'm looking for the tightest possible bounds for the `Min` and `Max` functions, given the constraints of the intervals. For example, the `Max` function of the intervals {2,3} and {7,8} will be {7,8}, because all values in the interval {7,8} are greater than any value in the interval {2,3}. (Note: I'm not looking for an ordering relation for intervals. The `Min` and `Max` operations often produce new intervals. See the first example, above.) I've written my own functions to do this, that only work for simple intervals:               intervalopf[a_Interval, b_Interval, op_] :=       Flatten[Outer[op, {Min[a], Max[a]}, {Min[b], Max[b]}]]     intervalop[a_Interval, b_Interval, op_] :=       With[{v = intervalopf[a, b, op]}, Interval[{Min[v], Max[v]}]]      Are there built-in functions I should be using? And, how can I generalize this to intervals that are unions?
