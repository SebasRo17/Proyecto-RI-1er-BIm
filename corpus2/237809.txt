I have been self studying algorithms and data structures for some time now and currently enjoying it. Whenever I understand an algorithm, I usually try to code them from scratch for fun and I always will discover some logic I've never thought of before. I'm not so sure, but I always think that when I code algorithms, I am maybe practicing my skills in programming. Is this true? I know they are important, but will my programming skills really improve by coding them?
