My boss has always told me that a good programmer should be able to ensure that the code he or she changes is reliable, correct, and thoroughly self- verified; that you should completely understand all the results and impacts your changes will cause. I have tried my best to be this kind of programmer—by testing again and again—but bugs are still there. How can I be a zero-bug programmer and know what every character of my code will cause and affect?
