My webapplication uses codes (in form of `http://www.url.com/code/105820582020204`), that I want to encode as QR-Code. I assume that such generated QR-Code will be scanned by both people using my mobile application (and bundled built-in QR-Code scanner) and by some 3rd party, external scanners. Exactly what data should I encode to support both of them -- code itself only or full URL? First scenario fails with external QR-Code reader. It will decode a QR-Code to just a long number and will get no idea, what it should do with such number. Only my own, mobile application QR-Code scanner will know, that it should exchange data with server, using decoded code. In second scenario, I assume that external QR-Code reader open up entire URL, so the whole thing will work as supposed, while my on, in-app QR-Code reader will extract code itself from the URL, and also be able to use it (just as in first scenario). So, second scenarion seems to be the only one to support both kinds of QR-Code readers. The problem is, that I read in this answer, that I shouldn't encode entire URLs in generated QR-Codes.
