I'm writing some OS software just for funsies, and it's licensed using MS-PL (ie, do pretty much anything you want with it). It's a project from which I'm using many different sources (lots of personal reading/research going into it) and I'm crediting the original book/writer in the comment header(s) of the files as applicable. I'm doing it so that if anyone actually decides to read or use the code, they can refer to the original sources that inspired the work. Of note:   * I own a copy of each source   * All of the sources are able to be purchased by the general public (amazon)   * As far as I can tell, none of the books explicitly state that the code is licensed   * None of the code is copied verbatim. I've translated it all from various languages (mostly C++) to C#, and when appropriate I've added exception handling etc.  I'm just wondering if there are any implications of sourcing these books in a freely open source application/library.
