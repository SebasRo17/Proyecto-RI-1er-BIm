I will soon begin the process of applying for entry level programming positions. As of now I have no professional coding experience, so all I have to show is some personal projects and code samples to show what I am capable of. How do I present such things as code samples, my specific work on collaborative projects, personal projects, etc, to a prospective employer? Something like a digital business card? a web link on the resume to a page where it is all laid out? links to individual project pages? Basically, is there a preferred method for listing or displaying what I have done aside from just a few lines on a resume describing it?
