Let me simplify the problem I am trying to solve so that the issue I face is highlighted.   Say, I want to generate $n$ samples of a Gaussian random variable. I have a script (say `random.m`) that does it. I have _Mathematica_ installed on a node with $4$ cores. I ssh into it and run $4$ instances of `"math -script random.m"` The idea is that I generate $\frac{n}{4}$ per instance. Now, my actual script is a little more complicated, with other variable names, etc. One of the features of _Mathematica_ is that the value of a variable is not restricted to a notebook (unless one does so explicitly).   My question basically is: **when I run 4 instances of a program, do they run completely independently of one another?**   (Even though I have the same variable names in `random.m`, the variables themselves are random. So, I don't want any cross-talk amongst the four instances.)
