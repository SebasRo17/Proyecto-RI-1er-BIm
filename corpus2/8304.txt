I can't get my email settings set properly such that I can use `SendMail[]` to email directly from Mathematica. I have opened "Preferences", clicked on the tab "Internet Connectivity" and filled in all the settings to match those in my Apple Mail accounts settings. These include:   * Server   * Port Number   * Encryption Protocol   * Username   * From Address   * Full Name   * Reply To Odd that no setting exists for "Password"? The "Preference" window's "Test Internet Connectivity" tells me "Test succeeded..." Apple Mail has a setting to "Use default ports (25, 465, 587)" so I thought this might confuse the Mathematica settings, so I've tried setting the Apple Mail settings to "Use Custom Port" and specified each of the the default ports specifically. None of those settings worked either. I have also attempted to specify **all** available options for `SendMail[]` specifically also trying each of the 3 possible "default" ports described above.                SendMail[      "From" -> "myemail@myisp.com",      "To" -> "recipientemail@isp.com",      "Subject" -> "Example Message",      "Body" -> "Test",      "Server" -> "smtpout.secureserver.net",      "EncryptionProtocol" -> "SSL",      "FullName" -> "MyUserName",      "Password" -> "myPassword",      "PortNumber" -> 25 (* I also tried 465, 587 *),      "ReplyTo" -> None,      "ServerAuthentication" -> Automatic,      "UserName" -> "myUserName"      ]      Again `SendMail[]` gives me the same message: `$Failed`. Also, in the "Preferences" window under the "Proxy Settings" tab I have tried selecting both "User proxy settings from my system or browser" and "Direct connection to the Internet". The "Troubleshooting Internet Connectivity Problems - Wolfram Mathematica" in the "Document Center" suggests checking proxy settings. Given what mine look like in Snow Leopard's "Preferences" >> "Network" >> "Proxies" ![Proxies](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Nu6q4.png) I don't think I have much to help. I have no Firewall Setting on the computer. This has me stumped. Does anyone have an idea of what else I can try.
