In the recent years, the hype around Git raised greatly. Everybody knows about Git, nobody knows about alternatives. Other ones like Mercurial seem to be unnoticed. Both have been released in 2005, and provide similar functionalities. Moreover, Mercurial is generally considered to be easier to use, more intuitive and had for a long time better UIs. Therefore, it could be assumed that this would be a popular alternative, especially for those new to distributed version-control. Yet, it seems unknown to most people, unlike Git which succeeded pretty well. The point of this post is to try to understand this phenomenon better. How comes Git gets all part of the cake? Did they somehow use better marketing? Is it because its community is more ...ahem ..."verbose"? Is it because of the "Linus" name? Is it because of its geeky image? What's your opinion?
