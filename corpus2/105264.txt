I've been considering taking some web-related programming courses from an online technology school (it's probably best if I don't name names). When I read the syllabi of the different courses on their website (which included courses on HTML, JS, PHP, Perl, DB admin, and Unix/Linux system admin), I was a little concerned that some of the content and descriptions sounded a bit dated. I emailed my concerns to their representative, who responded promptly. I hope I'm not outside the scope of this forum, but based on the rep's responses (below), I have two questions that I think only experienced programmers can answer:   * Does the rep have a good point when she says that teaching earlier versions of technology is justified because "most people/sites/businesses do not change quickly"?   * Is there such a thing as PHP in the SQL style? (I couldn't find anything on that) _Discussion with representative:_ Hi, I'm wondering how much effort is taken to keep these courses up to date? Computer technologies and best practices change fairly quickly and I would obviously want to be taking courses based on current standards. > Yes you are correct that technology & practices change quickly, most > people/sites/businesses do not change quickly.
