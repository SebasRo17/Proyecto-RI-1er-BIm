I just got a salary negotiation this morning (I passed three interviews last 3 weeks), and it was like a game. I was stubborn with my expectation, or that number, or I leave. OK, to be honest, it's not about money, but I, a not-very- experienced developer, want to see how much the employer pays me, and it was fun. And at last, my employer gave me this: "OK, _*_ $, but with two conditions, first, you get your spoken skill improved (English is not my native), and second, you got MCPs before the end of the year". He asked me to get 3 MCP certificates. The company will buy any books that necessary to the exam, but I must read them at free time, take and pass the exams . If I not get them, my employer will not kick me out, but, salary discussion will be harder, for me. I accepted that offer, I thought it's good enough. But I wonder, is it usual? If you're an employer, have you ever given that offer to a candidate? If you're an employee, have you ever got, or will you accept an offer like that?
