I am using the ratio between two error probabilities in various functions. I want _Mathematica_ to display this ratio in the most simple manner. How do I let _Mathematica_ know that, in this case, the simplest manner is as the top line in the picture below? How do I let _Mathematica_ factor the expression into `(e1)`, `(e2)`, `(1 - e1)` and `(1 - e2)`? ![http://i.stack.imgur.com/89eol.png](http://i.stack.imgur.com/89eol.png)
