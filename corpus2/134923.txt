A few weeks ago I saw a story about a master app designer showing how he worked with good old pen and paper to do effective prototyping before writing code. I'm unable to dig up that story (and I think it was a video) but if you could recommend any other useful resources I'd appreciate them. I know roughly what I want to build, but want a useful framework for thinking about how the screens should flow together. The app I want to build is for the iOS platform, but I think the video might have been about creating a web app. Thanks!
