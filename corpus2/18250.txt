I have several data files which contain columns of data. All my files follow the same format data001.out, data002.out, ... , data00n.out. I want to import and plot all of them simultaneously. In particular, I use only the first two columns of the data files for my plot. I wrote this simple Mathematica code:               SetDirectory["..."];          dataAll = {};          Do[        data = ReadList["data00" <> ToString[NumberForm[i, 2, NumberPadding         -> {"0", ""}]] <> ".out", Number,         RecordLists -> True];        pdata = Table[{data[[j, 1]], data[[j, 2]]}, {j, 1, Length[data]}];        AppendTo[dataAll, Flatten[pdata]];       , {i, 1, 50}     ]             S0 = ListPlot[dataAll, Frame -> True, FrameLabel -> {"x", "y"},      RotateLabel -> False, PlotStyle -> {Black, PointSize[0.01]},      PlotRange -> All, ImageSize -> 500]      I am wondering, if there is a simpler or even more correct way to perform this task. Perhaps, the `Do` loop needs improvement. I noticed that the `PlotStyle` in `ListPlot` does not apply to all points of the dataAll list. Even if I determine the color (black) and the size, the output contains several colors ans sizes. Where is the mistake? Many thanks in advance!
