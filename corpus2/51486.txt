I got Mathematica code from my friend:               n = 100     l = 0     gw = GaussianQuadratureWeights[n, 0, 2]     (*the result of gw maybe like this {{0.000286273, 0.000734634}, {0.00150805, 0.00170939}, {0.00370487, 0.00268393},...}}*)     J = Array[SphericalBesselJ[l, gw[[#, 1]]] &, n]      The first, I'm not sure with syntax because i'm not a Mathematica user. But in my understand this code just try to create Spherical Bessel array by using 2 parameters such as               l just a constant. its value is 1           qw this is two dimensional array       On Mathematica code up there for `gw[[#, 1]]` i think they just tried to call {{0.000286273, 0.00150805, 0.00370487, ...}} and put them one by one to second parameters of SphericalBesselJ . And finally, we will get a one dimensional `J` array If write it as pseudo code from my understanding it might be like this:               l = 1     n = 100     gw = gaussiannode(100) //generate 100 gaussian nodes     for (i==1, i<=n, i++):         J[i] = SphericalBesselJ(l, gw[1][i])      My question is "Is it the Mathematica code up there equivalent to my pseudo code?" My point is just want to know `Array` can work as `Loop` or not? if not please correct Mathematica code up there to the right way by using loop.
