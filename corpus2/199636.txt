I am trying to create Export Module for our application, this seems to me a bit complex so I am posting it here to get some guide lines. In our database we have a list of Products, which can be exported as XML, RTF or PDF The user can select one or many products from the list to export. After Selecting the product(s) he/she is presented with list of Export type(XML, RTF, PDF) and a list of Connections( where to send this export files) like FTP, HTTP, EMail etc whose details are already configured. And this export is used for many different users, who have different needs. For example User1 need only Description, User2 needs Description+Thumbnail etc. Should I create for Export type(XML, RTF, PDF) a Manager class? and For Connections also a Manager class? And for Different users should I create an Interface?
