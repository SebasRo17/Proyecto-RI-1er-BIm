I write a lot of javascript applications and in many different circumstances the browser will become unresponsive or give a "slow script" error. Even when following best practices, initializing large data sets, complex animation, or when too many event handlers fire at once, I have to include extra setTimeouts or requestAnimationFrames around script blocks to load balance them. Seems like there should be some standard way of managing the browser load for large javascript applications. Any ideas? It seems like there must be JS application designers thinking about this, but I can find nothing on the web or on stack. _**edit_** I appreciate all the response. My question is _not_ "How can I write efficient Javascript?" which seems to be the question the current responses are answering. My question is: How can I balance the load of multiple sequential threads of javascripts running in the same browser? I am well aware of all the information posted in the responses so far and appreciate the posters, but I am looking for a framework or a design pattern that balances script execution in a browser. This question is common in many other languages and for devops, I am simply asking the same question for javascript.
