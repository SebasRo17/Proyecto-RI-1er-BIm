I'm working on a project where multiple (several hundred perhaps) users will need to run an application remotely. We thought that running a web app would be the best course of action to go. (Note: when I say web app I mean a program where a user can type in a URL that will then allow the user to run the application we're working on remotely without any installations or limited installations to the browser they're using) My problem is not knowing where to start in creating a web app. The way that I see it (and correct me if I'm wrong), there are two types of web apps out there. A Rich Internet Application which: > has many of the characteristics of desktop application software, typically > delivered either by way of a site-specific browser, via a browser plug-in, > independent sandboxes, extensive use of Javascript, or virtual machines. wiki or a 'regular' web app similar to gmail. I'm very familiar with Python and desktop GUI development using wxPython. Is it possible to write a program in Python, and then run it as a webapp? If so, How?
