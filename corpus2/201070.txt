We are getting ready to port part of our app over to node.js, and are looking for a way to support s3 uploads and testing in our development environment. Right now we are thinking about setting up test buckets (ie 'myProductionBucket-test'), setting this in our dev environment configuration, and then creating a lifecycle rule to delete content after 24 hours. This seems clunky though, wondering if there is are local alternatives we could run on our dev boxes that might work better. Also, we're leaning towards node-config vs node-convict or just loading json. Any thoughts there also greatly appreciated. **Edit:** We've looked at https://github.com/jubos/fake-s3, and also thought about just mocking for tests, but it would be handy to put and retrieve the same files, since that's the basic function of the app. It seems crazy to pay amazon for running dev/test and production.
