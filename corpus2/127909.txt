Given the following assumptions:   * The amount of available data storage is highly limited   * All data is international    * As much storage as possible must be preserved since it will be used for something else Is there any widely accepted standard or best practice which defines how much storage should be allocated for those items? **Note** : I'm not looking for assumptions but for facts like "97.5% of all names fit into 70 bytes using UTF-8" and "An international address must at least contain field1, field2 and field3 of size1, size2 and size3". **Edit** : I'm looking for the fields/lengths to use in the user interface. Not a technique to store it efficiently.
