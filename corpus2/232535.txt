I wanted to create a parser that can read a solidworks file and turn it into a protein data bank file. This has already been done in a program called DiamondCAD. http://www.zyvex.com/Research/DiamondCAD.html I waant to make a parser that can parse the data and then visualize it the same way as DiamondCAD. I have downloaded and opened solidworks files before and they make no sense to me with never before seen symbols and looks like ancient writing. Does anyone know how a sldprt. file is structured and how it can be parsed into a PDB file? (A software called VMD converts a PDB to Obj. file so it is proof of concept)
