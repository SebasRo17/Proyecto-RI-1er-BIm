I know the Ruby on Rails framework is only for web development and not suitable for desktop application development. But if a ruby programmer wants to develop a desktop application, is it suitable and preferable to do it with Ruby only (not jRuby, as most of the tutorials are for jRuby)? If yes, please provide some good tutorials. I want to use linux as OS for development. Please suggest something, as I am a ruby developer and wants to develop desktop application.
