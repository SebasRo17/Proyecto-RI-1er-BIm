At our office new privacy regulations are introduced requiring every employee to protect his or her computer with a personal password. The employees are required not to share these passwords. Prior to this, everybody could access everybody's computer. No, there is little doubt that this is an improvement from a security point of view. However we - as developers - struggle with this, because we do a lot of pair programming (often for several days in a row) and due to flexible working hours and a like, access to different working station is needed without the presence of the developer who owns the computer. There is a tendency, that developers will share their passwords (even going so far as putting it as a list on the wall). How can you reconcile the need for accessing uncommitted code on a working station from different developers with security and privacy guidelines regarding these working stations?
