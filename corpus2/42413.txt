As a school assignment we have to write a program which solves this issue. Since the program has to run efficient I am wondering what the best way is to approach this issue. Of course there you can just guess and try if it works, but that would not be efficient at all. Could someone push me in the right direction how to solve: n = b ^ e where e is the largest number possible? For example, n = 16 would result in 2 ^ 4 instead of 4 ^ 2.
