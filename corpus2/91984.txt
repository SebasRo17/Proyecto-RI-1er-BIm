If I was interested in interview questions like "Describe how you explained a difficult technical issue to a non-technical person" I would use the Googles to search on communication skill interview questions.. But, what I really would like is to have someone actually explain _to me_ some sort of relatively difficult technical issue. So I'm interested in are answers that identify a useful topic for this purpose or examples of what others have do to create scenarios for the purpose of evaluating a candidate's communications. In other words some exercise that actually forces the candidate to communicate something challenging rather than describe some time in their past when they were required to do so.
