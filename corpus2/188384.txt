I came across below style of writing if statements in C#, on msdn code examples. Usually when I write if statements, the conditions I would write `(Customer != null) I want to know if there is any difference/gain in writing statement like below:               Customer customer;     if (null != customer)     {       // some code     }      Or               if ("" != customer.Name)      {       // some code     }
