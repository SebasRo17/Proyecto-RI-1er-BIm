Functional Requirements state "WHAT" needs to be done from a user's perspective Functional Specification state "HOW" it needs to be done from technical standpoint. Do QA teams focus and Functional Requirements whereas development team focus primarily on functional specification though they need to have an understanding of functional requirements? I assume QA would sign off the product as long as the functional requirements are met irrespective of whether the functional specification is followed or not. Is my assumption correct?
