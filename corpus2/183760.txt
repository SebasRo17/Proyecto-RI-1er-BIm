**Disclaimer** : Not as exaggerated as the title suggests, but it still makes me uncomfortable. I'm just going to express honestly, so take it with a grain of salt. Just pretend that I'm talking about _that_ coding standard that you don't like working with. **Edit** : The fact that I don't like it, doesn't mean I don't use it or enforce it. * * * I decided to ask this question in the spirit of how to get over a standard you don't like, not to get help on how to better argue how it can be changed (although any comments regarding this last part is appreciated). Besides, I work in a big company and such a change of something that has lived for so long and that matters so little is unlikely. The standard is the opening-curly-brace-on-dedicated-line standard:               somefunction()     {         //...     }      Instead of the ***clearly superior*** (note the joking/frustrated tone):               somefunction(){         //...     }      My personal arguments against the standard:   * **It bloats code** : extra unnecessary lines   * **Harder to type** : although probably this is just me struggling with the standard, I know one extra keystroke isn't that bad.   * **Not easier to read** : I start reading a function declaration, if statement, or any other scope-stacking statement and I already don't have to look for an opening brace. Nested blocks with this standard just make me angry for some reason.   * **Used by people who come from a Microsoft IDE background** : I think there should be an argumented reason (or more) behind a standard, not just take it in by paradigm. Their arguments (and my way of internally retorting to them):   * **Easier to read because you can see where blocks start and end right away** : I cannot understand this, what good is the block if you don't know what it is owned by, so then you have to read backwards.   * **I used it in a Microsoft IDE and I liked it** : Uhh... ok?   * **It is in the standard** : _*cringes*_ Am I the only one that struggles with an opinionated stance against a specific standard?, how have you gotten over these?, what is your opinion on what this particular standard should be (just for fun)?
