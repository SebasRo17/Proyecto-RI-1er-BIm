I want to solve the equation               Sqrt[x] + Sqrt[1 - x^2] == Sqrt[2 - 3 x - 4 x^2]      with real solutions (in the real domain).   I tried               Solve[ Sqrt[x] + Sqrt[1 - x^2] == Sqrt[2 - 3 x - 4 x^2], Reals]      > >     {{x -> Root[-1 + 10 #1^2 + 9 #1^4 &, 2]^2}} >   and also               Reduce[ Sqrt[x] + Sqrt[1 - x^2] == Sqrt[2 - 3 x - 4 x^2] && x âˆˆ Reals, x, Complexes]      > >     x == -1 - Sqrt[2] || x == 1/9 (-5 + Sqrt[34]) >   The real solution of the given equation is `x == 1/9 (-5 + Sqrt[34])` With _Maple_ I got ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5BLkr.jpg)
