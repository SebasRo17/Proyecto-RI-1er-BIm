I want to start a side project at the company i work for. Right now we are a 100% web based company. I have an idea for a fun project that would install an application on your computer. Anyways, i am not here to discuss the product. I am here to ask about the front end application development. I am a good C++ programmer but only algorithms (I have over 10 years in web development). I have never made a UI application before (minus the old school VB days). I would like to know my options for the front end application for windows, osx and linux. What are the popular choices these days for the UI of applications in windows, osx and linux?
