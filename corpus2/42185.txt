I'm currently a sophomore at my university, majoring in Computer Science. Obviously, there are some programming courses as part of my curriculum. However, I'm feeling very underwhelmed by its progress. I've self-taught myself a lot and like to code in my spare time as a hobby. I'm currently in Computer Science II. I never took CS 1 because it seemed rather basic -- I asked someone in the department if they would override my CS 1 requirement if I passed their final (which I did with flying colors). Anyway, the class is going by quite slowly. It seems like the rest of the class has a hard time understanding some basic concepts, which the professor needs to keep going over to help them understand. Is this normal? Looking at the class schedule, I seem to know everything except for one or two things near the very end of the semester. Is there a different perspective I can look at this through so it doesn't seem so boring?
