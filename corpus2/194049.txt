For someone that is relatively new to web development, would you recommend pursing an academic curriculum that is more diverse (introducing several languages and frameworks with other classes on analysis, networks, databases, etc.) or a curriculum that is very focused and rigorous (i.e. mostly classes on Java-related technologies)? **Background** : I am trying to transition into the web development field. I currently have a Bachelor's in Biology and have almost two years of "webmaster" experience for my current employer along with a little bit of freelance web design work on the side. I've applied to several jobs over the past year and the resounding feedback that I get is that I need a degree in Computer Science or related field. I have decided to pursue a Master's degree and have been accepted into two programs. **Boston University** \- Master's in Computer Information Science with Concentration in Web Application Development **Brandeis University** \- Master's Degree in Software Engineering BU's program is very eclectic and provides classes on a variety of different topics like HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, JQuery, JavaSE, Oracle database, networks, etc. Brandeis' program goes really deep into Java technologies (basic Java SE, J2EE, Struts, Hibernate, Spring, JDBC, etc.). I currently have a pretty good understanding of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Java SE through about 2 years of self-study. I'm just not certain if it's a good idea to try and broaden my general understanding of website design or if it's better to try and develop a niche (i.e. Java) before I try and get my first developer position. Thanks and have a great day.
