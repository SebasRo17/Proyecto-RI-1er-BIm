I have been testing Pentaho BI server community edition, and after reading their licensing terms I found out that the community edition is under GPLv2. As you may know the server is intended to host different types of files and applications (like reports, olap cubes,etc...) My question is : are we allowed to sell applications that run on the GPLv2 server ? (we will maybe modify the server source code a bit but we won't charge it to our clients. thus the modified GPL server will be just an execution environment or a container for the reports and applications that we intend to sell) ? this suggests that our clients must install the GPL v2 edition first and then buy from us the reports that work on it but not their source code. Thanks in advance.
