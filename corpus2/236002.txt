This might be a silly question, but I've reading a little bit about NoSQL databases on the past few days and I'm trying to understand when really they help us. One thing I've realized though is that it seems that NoSQL databases are closer to OOP than RDBMS. I say that because usually when we deal with OOAD we don't get a finished version of the model upfront. The model changes lots of times before getting to the real thing. I've even questioned about this here on Programmers.SE. With NoSQL, however, this seems the most natural thing, since the database can also change without much trouble. Also, for a first try with this kind of technology I've created one MongoDB database and the data was being saved like POJO, so that it seemed much more close to object oriented design. In that setting, NoSQL is really a good idea when working with OOP or it's just a good idea in cases where we need the database to scale, to be accessed by many users and all of that stuff?
