How do you ask the potential employer in the interview if the project you will be working on is Support and Maintenance or new development? Last time in the interview I asked this question and I was told its a support + new development but it turned out to be support + enhancements. I don't want to make the same mistake again and get into something like this. Most of the time people interviewing will tell its a support + new development but thats not what it turns out to be after accepting the job. So what kind of questions will get the right answer if the project is really a new development or its just support and patching and hope it works kind of a project.
