I want to build a desktop application which has google maps embedded to it. This app should have a thread to read coordinate data online a usb microphone to use. This application will move the google map markers to their new locations based on the data retrieved from online connections on each refresh. As far as I know gmaps has a javascript API so the first idea in my mind was to embed this mapview into a java applet. So the application will run on a browser. I'm not sure if this will work. Do you guys have any idea about this or any other advices you might have?
