I interviewed for a job at a company where they said their policy is to make sure that at least 2 people understand any piece of code, just in case one of them "goes on vacation". They also said that some people don't last more then a few months at this company, although many have stayed for years. I think I get the message: They are inclined to fire people right away who don't like the work culture or who don't integrate into their cliques. But is there another interpretation? Thanks.
