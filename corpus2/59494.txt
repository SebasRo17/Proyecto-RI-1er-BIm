I'm trying to run some external command line program in Mathematica, and I have problem getting the output. For example,               Import["!echo hello world\nexit\n", "Text"]     (*"hello world"*)      run echo and get the output. However this doesn't work for me               Import["!g++ -v", "Text"]      I only get an empty line. In version 10, there is the `RunProcess` function which seems to work               RunProcess[$SystemShell, "StandardError", "g++ -v      exit      "]          (*     Configured with: --prefix=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr \     --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1     Apple LLVM version 6.0 (clang-600.0.51) (based on LLVM 3.5svn)     Target: x86_64-apple-darwin14.0.0     Thread model: posix     *)      My question is, can we do the same thing in version 9, using other functions ?
