I'm a Haskell beginner. I started learning Haskell around 20-25 days back. With a programming day job I am doing this in my spare time because I wanted to learn about functional programming. **Background** I have been going around stackoverflow to see how I should proceed. I have read the first 6 chpaters of learn you a haskell and around 2 chapters of Real World Haskell and done a bit of Haskell programming. I have no prior experience in functional programming. But I have used Python, which has **_some_** functional programming concepts used. Now I am really confused about how to proceed. I am used to learning to program by writing programs on the go but here in Haskell I am not sure what kind of programming problems to do. I am having trouble thinking the solutions to problems that I already solved in Python or C. I have tried some of the 99 Haskell Problems but their solutions use library functions which I don't know about. Haskell emphasizes recursion but without any kind of looping I don't know how to solve many of the problems. I tried going over the advices that I got when I was learning Python. But this time learning Haskell those are not helping because I am stuck at an even lower level. This time I have lesser time to practice and it is just so different. Is there a way to familiarize myself with Haskell better than the above mentioned method? Does it just take some time coming from imperative background?
