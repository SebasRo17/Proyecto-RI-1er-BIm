It seems to me that the best way to manage priority for programming tasks in a backlog is to simply put them in order. Do the top task first, second one next. If priority changes, re-order the queue. I thought this was exactly how things were supposed to work in Agile. I have yet to find an online open-source team task manager that supports custom ordering of tasks this way - although I might be out of date. Assembla definitely doesn't. Jira doesn't seem to. When we used Agilo in my previous company, it didn't seem to either. The only service I've found that implements this simple concept well is Google Tasks, but that's hardly suitable for managing software projects. I don't understand why this isn't the standard way to manage priority. My ideal way to track issues would be through Github. As far as I can tell Github Issues also doesn't support custom ordering of tasks. Does anyone know if there's any way to implement this on top of Github Issues somehow? Is there any way I can suggest it as a feature?
