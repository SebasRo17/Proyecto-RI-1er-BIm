I'm writing a code review process document for our team; we've never had a formal process in place although we do do some code review. I've found lots of articles talking about how important code review is, but I have one question in particular that I haven't found the answer to on the web... is the programmer part of the code review? In other words, should a code review be 2 people sitting together, going over what's in the code, or should it be 1 person looking at another person's code? Most often, our projects are done by a team of 2 people, so before it is sent to QA, should those 2 people just sit together and go over the entire project, including what each of them have written? Or, should they just both look at each other's code? I can see advantages to each. Finally, what happens with issues found during code review? Are they noted, and then sent back to the programmer? Or should the reviewer note them and then just fix them? Or is it ever ok to make a change and not even tell the programmer specifically what you found?
