I am trying to use the Combinatorica package in a Mathematica version 8 in the following code:               gp = Graph[{1-> 3, 1 -> 2, 3 ->1}]     << Combinatorica`     ConnectedQ[gp]      But this gives me an error message: General::compat: Combinatorica Graph and Permutations functionality has been superseded by preloaded functionality. The package now being loaded may conflict with this. Please see the Compatibility Guide for details. I have checked the guide but, the recommendation given could not solve this problem. Any suggestion please?
