I've generated a simple 3D histogram, where the x-y coordinates corresponding to the "location" of an event defined on a simple 160x160 grid, and the z-axis height is simply the count of events that occur at each x-y location. For this particular graph, I have an png image (think of it as a map) on which the 160x160 grid is defined. I'd like to use this image as the x-y floor of my Histogram3D. I'd also like to use a ListContourPlot as the x-y floor, in a companion image. Any suggestions would be most welcome. Thanks. Mark
