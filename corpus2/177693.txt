I did not study CS nor IT. I just became a developer, now working with Java. Actually, since I now work with a big company writing high-scalable web applications, I think I need to be better with details. I have no understanding of what happens underneath of Java. Java Performance, Server-Side Java might be the buzz words?!! I am very poor with those more of low-level details but I do not know where to look honestly. I started looking for some keywords in Amazon, ended up reading books like "pragmatic programmer", "clean code", "code complete" which IMO they are not what I am looking for. Could you please give me some learning resources (books, articles, blog posts, online trainings) for this matter? I also read this post as well: Approaching Java/JVM internals But I think I need a pre-step before jumping into the OpenJDK, right?!
