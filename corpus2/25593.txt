I'm just starting to learn _Mathematica_ and I got stuck at this question. This a noob question but please help. I need to define a function named continuedFraction that takes user input of type list as this `continuedFraction[{a,b,c,d}]` that will output               a / (1 + b/ (1 + c/ (1 + d)))      this is just any other continued fraction like on this page http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ContinuedFraction.html what I had done so far after 383 inputs in notebook (now you know how hard this is for me)               fx[x_] := Fold[x/(1 + #) &, x, {a, b, c,}]          fx[{a, b, c, e}]           {a/(1 + a/(1 + a/(1 + a/(1 + a)))),        b/(1 + b/(1 + b/(1 + b/(1 + b)))),        c/(1 + c/(1 + c/(1 + c/(1 + c)))),        e/(1 + e/(1 + e/(1 + e/(1 + e))))}      which is of course, not the correct answer. ps: this is under functional programming-> pure function and a hint to use Fold.
