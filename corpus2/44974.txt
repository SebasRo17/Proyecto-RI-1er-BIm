l = {"BreuschPagan" -> BreuschPagan[data, lm, coords],         "WhitesHeteroskedasticity" -> WhitesHeteroskedasticity[lm, coords]};          f = {"BreuschPagan", "WhitesHeteroskedasticity"}          In[360]:= l /. Rule[f_, _] :> f          Out[360]= {"BreuschPagan", "WhitesHeteroskedasticity"}`      Have tried reading the support but i just dont get it. If I only apply `l /. Rule[f_, _]` the output becomes `_` And why does `l /. Rule[lof_, _] :> f` give the out               {{"BreuschPagan", "WhitesHeteroskedasticity"}, {"BreuschPagan",        "WhitesHeteroskedasticity"}}
