I recently found this article/table: http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html It shows a big rise in Lisp's popularity. Does anyone know more about this? What applications is it gaining popularity in? Are there more Lisp jobs out there lately? Why isn't there a similar increase in Scheme? I am an enthusiast of Lisp and Scheme so I'm excited to see this. I've never used them professionally but I'd love to oppurtunity to. If anyone knows more about this I'd love to hear it.
