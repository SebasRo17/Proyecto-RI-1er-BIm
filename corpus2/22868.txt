In the normal _Mathematica_ language, where no built-in symbols are redefined and no evil things happen, is it a valid assumptions, that no function symbol (`Plot`, `Print`, `Attributes`) is also an option name (like `PlotRange`, `ColorSpace`, `ImageSize`). Furthermore, is it save to assume that symbols carrying an `OwnValue` (`$MaxNumber`, `Pi`, `$Failed`) are in neither of the other two groups? To say it straight out: Does someone find a function, which is used as an option too?
