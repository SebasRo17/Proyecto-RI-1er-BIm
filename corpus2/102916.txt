There are lots of books on assembly. However, they usually deal with ISAs about which I don't care, such as MIPS or ARM. I don't deal with these architectures; there's no reason for me to try to learn them. But x86 assembly books seem... nonexistent. Let's say for example I'm trying to build a toy compiler generating Windows Portable Executable files. Is there a book out there that's the de-facto standard for describing best practices, design methodologies, and other helpful information on x86 assembly? What about that book makes it special?
