I know that programming languages can be defined in EBNF which can be converted into regular expressions. Right now I am working on a very simple BASIC interpreter for a project. The code has to be entered in a gui which should validate the syntax to later transfer the code to an embedded system where it is executed. I was googling to find an article or tutorial on writing a validator for this job but I could not really find such a thing. Is it just defining the regular expressions and try to match them? Note: the GUI part is written in Java while the embedded code is written in C++.
