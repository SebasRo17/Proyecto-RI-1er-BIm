In the Mathematica front-end, symbols that have been defined are colored black and symbols with no definition associated are colored blue. This is useful to prevent spelling mistakes. Also, defined symbols appear in the autocomplete (as of Mathematica v9.0). I have a symbol `chrom` with no definitions associated, but I want Mathematica to recognize it. That is, I want that when I type `chrom` in the front end, it appears colored black, and I want it to appear in the autocomplete. I can't associate a definition with `chrom` (as in `chrom = ...` or `chrom[..] = ..`, because then if `chrom` appears in the evaluation of an expression, it will be replaced by the associated defined value. This is not the behavior I want. In other words, is there a Mathematica function that does the opposite of `Remove`? `Remove` removes a symbol from the symbol table. How can I add a symbol to the symbol table without associating a definition with it?
