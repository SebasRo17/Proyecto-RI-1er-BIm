I'm bootstrapping my own project, it has a registration/login area (via devise with RoR, properly hashed and salted of course). As I'm using subdomains and I need to access them with iframes (it's justified, really!) I'd need one of those expensive certificates that cover subdomains. As I'm doing this out of my own time and money, so I'm hesitant to drop a couple of hundreds on a certificate, plus a couple of hours delving into something I haven't tried before. I'm not storing any sensitive information besides the email address and the password. As far as I understand, the only vulnerability happens when a user logs or signs up from an unencrypted network (such as a coffee shop) and someone is listening the network. Am I being cheap? Is this something I should tackle before releasing into the wild. I probably should mention I have 25,000 users signed up to be notified when I launch, so I'm nervous about it.
