We are trying to start a web base project that need to develop based on MS technologies such as C#,.net, IIS etc. This is a web application suppose to sell as a product with a single installer. Now we are discussing which kid of database we are going to use. Some says `non-embedded database` (Ms Sql) Some of them idea is to use `embedded databases`. So we are in a bit of confusion stage for a batter decision. Can you guys give some feedback according to your experience. then that will help us to come up with a good decision. In simply what is need is **When to use non-embedded over embedded databases?** **Edit :** Anyway We have technical understanding about how to use Non- embedded database such as MS Sql Server or Embedded database. What I need is, Conceptually in which situations usually we prefers each type of databases and what are the pros and cons of using each types.
