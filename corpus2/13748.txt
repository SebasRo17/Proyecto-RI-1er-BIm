I have these two lists, both with the same length in the first dimension:               l1={{a1,a2},{b1,b2},{c1,c2}};     l2={{{1,2,3},{4,5,6}},{{10,11,12},{13,14,15},{16,17,18}},{{19,20,21}}};      And I need mix both to get into this result:               {{a1,a2,1,2,3},{a1,a2,4,5,6},{b1,b2,10,11,12},{b1,b2,13,14,15},     {b1,b2,16,17,18},{c1,c2,19,20,21}}      I have done this code that do the job:               Flatten[MapThread[Function[{a,b},Join[a,#]&/@b][#1,#2]&,{l1,l2}],1]      But I think it could be simpler. Some clue?
