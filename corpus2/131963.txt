Does anyone know a good algorithm for drawing an ellipse from a bounding box?               draw_ellipse(int s1, int s2, int s3, int s4, color c);       I don't need something optimized to incomprehendable , unreadable efficiency. Just something good enough to use for a simple drawing api. You can provide the algorithm in your answer in all programming languages or even pseudocode, but I would prefer it if you use C++ or a C++-like syntax.
