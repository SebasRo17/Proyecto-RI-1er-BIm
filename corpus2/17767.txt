Usually in programming languages, function arguments are normal local variables, which can be modified. Is this not true in Mathematica?               In[94]:= TTT[x_] := Block[{},        x += 2        ];          In[95]:= TTT[3]      > During evaluation of In[95]:= AddTo::rvalue: 3 is not a variable with a > value, so its value cannot be changed. >>               Out[95]= 3 += 2      Is it possible to simulate normal argument behavior somehow?
