I have a very complicated expression involving trigonometric functions, complex numbers etc. You may find it here as it is too long to be pasted here. You may also find a screenshot of it here. **Assumptions:** All variables are real and strictly positive. This expression should be real! I'm dealing with this expression for days. Could someone tell me a strategy for simplifying it within Mathematica 8 ? More generaly, are there good tutorials or textbooks or lessons on strategies for simplifications? Perhaps is simplification a subjective concept? In my case it means more readable, and why not something that could fit in a research paper.
