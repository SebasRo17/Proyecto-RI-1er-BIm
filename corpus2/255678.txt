I have a `LoginService` class with `loginUser($email, $password, $remember = false)` method in the application layer of my model layer. Now, if `$remember` is `true` it needs to create a persistent user login cookie on the client's browser, but since that is the responsibility of the View, what is a good way of reaching the view through the controller to let it know it should create the cookie for it?
