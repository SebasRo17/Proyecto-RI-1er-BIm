I have a data file contains several lines of numbers that separated by "," and I cannot load it correctly with ReadList and Import. Here is a example: with data contains "," and "\n", simple `ReadList` doesn't work.               ReadList[StringToStream["1099.5,0,-166.79\n1098.4,0,-166.79\n"], Real]     (* {1099.5, $Failed} *)      If we use separators, it works, but if we group the types, it doesn't work.               ReadList[StringToStream["1099.5,0,-166.79\n1098.4,0,-166.79\n"], Real,       RecordSeparators -> {",", "\n"}]     (* {1099.5, 0., -166.79, 1098.4, 0., -166.79} *)          ReadList[StringToStream[       "1099.5,0,-166.79\n1098.4,0,-166.79\n"], {Real, Real, Real},       RecordSeparators -> {",", "\n"}]     (* {$Failed} *)      And `Import` cannot import correctly as it treats each line as a string.               Import[StringToStream["1099.5,0,-166.79\n1098.4,0,-166.79\n"], "Table"]     StringQ /@       Flatten@Import[        StringToStream["1099.5,0,-166.79\n1098.4,0,-166.79\n"], "Table"]     (*       {{"1099.5,0,-166.79"}, {"1098.4,0,-166.79"}}       {True, True}          *)      So why they are not working in these cases? And How to make `ReadList` and `Import` to work without using `Partition` etc. after the import? Version: 9.0 on Mac.
