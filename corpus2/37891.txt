In Steven Wolfram's blog entries, he discusses using mathematica to discover algorithms. I have tried several different google searches for papers on such topics, and have found none. I suspect this is a case where I'm not using the proper search terms. I could imagine some sort of genetic algorithm based approach that takes a genome and turns that into an algorithm, but I would be curious what specifically he is discussing.
