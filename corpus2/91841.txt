I'm interested in knowing what are the real difference (benefits and drawbacks) between the two types of python templating engines; XML (like Genshi or Kid) and a custom syntax (like Cheetah or Jinja2). I'm not looking for which is better, or a recommendation. I understand that no one solution will be perfect, and that the best solution will depend on the problem. I do want to better understand the differences between the two types before I choose one for my problem. This list may not apply to all templating solutions. XML Benefits:   * Uses XML, it's mostly familial to developers. There are a few new (ifelse, flow logic) items to learn.   * It works with existing XML toolchains.   * It's more powerful as it is knowledgeable about the data being worked on. (Genshi is context aware) XML Drawbacks:   * The XML based engines tend to be slower than the custom syntax engines.   * Some will argue that XML is more difficult to learn than custom syntax. Custom Syntax Benefits:   * It's fast than XML based engines. (see earlier link)   * It's a simple powerful syntax that should be easier to learn. Custom Syntax Drawbacks:   * It's another syntax to learn.   * It might not work smoothly with existing XML toolchains.
