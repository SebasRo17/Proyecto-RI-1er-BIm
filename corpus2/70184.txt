I'm working on a project where the everything is driven from the a .dll on the server. The UI and the business rules are all on this .dll This makes it pretty difficult to debug. My question is, I would like to present alternatives to allowing the users to the ability to still create customized screens without the UI and the rules being so tightly intertwined. Can anyone offer suggestions or references to ways of splitting out the UI but still allowing ultimate customization abilities? Let me know if I need to add further information.
