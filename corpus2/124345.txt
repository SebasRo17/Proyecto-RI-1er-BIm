Hey I'm a student programmer currently working in Java. I often see several terms thrown around alot and it would be very helpful for someone to explain the differences. I was prompted by my research that I did when reading this question. Anyway here are the terms (and wiki links), I've read their wiki's but am still uncertain. Software Stack Software Framework/Application framework - is there a difference? what are they? Middleware
