I mean, there are really useful libs that can solve problems when you are stuck and do not know how to solve this or that with your knowledge of programming language you use... For example, Boost for C++ or JQuery for JavaScript or Spring for Java... They solve problems in seconds and you do not really care how they did it (despite that they are written in the very same language you are programming in)... So I wonder am I alone in using libs while not being capable to write solutions for my problems from scratch or is it standard practice?
