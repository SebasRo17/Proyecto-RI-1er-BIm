I have taken the following derivative of a transcendental equation using the `D[...]` function, as part of an approximation:               Solve[y'[x] == -D[-t*Log[2*Cosh[(a* y'[x] + x)/t]] , x], y'[x]]      And the result is then               y'[x] == Tanh[(x + a y'[x])/t] (1 + a y''[x])      For simplification reasons I then just ignore the `(1 + a y''[x])` term, leaving me with               y'[x] == Tanh[(a* y'[x] + x)/t]      but now I want to find the integral of that simplified function. How do I do that in _Mathematica_? I haven't been able to find a function that is the obvious counterpart to `D[...]`, to calculate the integral of my simplified `y'[x]` numerically to find my new `y[x]` \- the challenge of course being that `y'[x] == Tanh[(a* y'[x] + x)/t]` is a transcendental equation.
