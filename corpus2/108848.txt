Why don't many code review tools seem to be syntax aware or provide more in- depth analysis of changes? Is it simply too hard to do? I find this to be a major hole of most programmer's toolkits. From what I have seen, which admittedly is not much, code review tools just compare code line- by-line with many of them not even being able to do syntax highlighting. Is there a solution out there that is smart enough to offer file-level, method-level code review/comparison? One of the simple problems I have is that methods get re-ordered in code and my code review software breaks down completely, but they should be able to do so much more. I'm interested in others opinions/knowledge on the topic of code review/comparison tools.
