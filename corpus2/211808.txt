For loops are usually inclusice, exclusive, meaning that you start at the bottom, and stops when you reach, but don't to the top. In Python:               for i in range(0,a):         print(i)      would print 0 through a-1. The same applies for Java:               for(int i = 0; i < a; i++){         System.out.println(i);     }      would also print 0 through a-1, allthough the syntax is somewhat clearer. So what if you want to print every number up to a, inclusive? Would you write               for(int i = 0; i <= a; i++){         System.out.println(i);     }      or               for(int i = 0; i < a + 1; i++){         System.out.println(i);     }      I guess the first makes the most sense, you're looping while i is less or equals to a, but the less than sign could easily be overlooked. The `a + 1` isn't that easy to miss, in my opinion. So my question is: Is there a better alternative of the two, and is there a convension for this thing? EDIT:   I just want to point out that i'm talking about integers here.
