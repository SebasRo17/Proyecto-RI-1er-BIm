I consider myself an intermediate Python programmer and have been offered an opportunity to be a trainer for a beginner Python programming class. I was wondering if this would really widen my programming repertoire. Has somebody had an enlightening experience after they successfully trained a group of people? Does it also depend on those people -- whether they're programmers or noob students? (In my case they are intermediate .NET and Java programmers) What should I expect from them? One of my fears is -- what if I choked when one of them asked a tangled question. Is this normal?
