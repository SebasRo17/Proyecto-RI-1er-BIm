I'm a programmer currently working in rounds of meetings along with BAs and PM to gather/describe modules and functionality of our case management system; after a few meetings I saw that using 'use cases' would be a very very good fit to document many of the things and functions discuessed and/or proposed for the new system. When I suggested we needed to create 'use cases' so that we don't forget what we said/concluded and also to have programers know what they should code, the leading BA mentioned don't like 'use cases'. What can be used to gather/document requirements when people supposed to write user requirements say they don't like 'use cases', or when you realize that they don't want to write 'use cases' to describe what the system should do? I'm trying to find out if there's a close or effective substitution to using 'use cases' to document system functionality/scenarios.
