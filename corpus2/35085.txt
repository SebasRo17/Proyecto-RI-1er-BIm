If I have a fractional value, how can I truncate (not round) that to a certain number of bits, like 8? For example, for Pi 3.141569265359... the fractional part is 0.141569265359...               NumberForm[BaseForm[FractionalPart[N[Pi]],2],8]          0.00100100001111110110101010001      But this is giving me 8 decimal digits of PI in base 2. What I want is 8 binary digits in base 2.
