When writing **_Cocoa Applications_** for **_MacOSX_** , you have the choice of either having a custom preference dialog, or using the **_Settings.app_** to manage your preferences. Functionality wise, there is no difference at all between the two (apart from the fact that preferences in the Settigns.app can be accessed when your app is not running). Which solution do you use and why?
