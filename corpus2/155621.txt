I've been struggling with how to get my project going. I've got an old software package that is in need of desparate rewrite. I haven't compiled the source code since 2004. It still sells, it's stable but does require the “Run this program in compatibility mode for:” on a lot of the newer windows systems. It's also one of those hard coded 640 X 480 screen resolution programs. Yuck! I can't seem to get started with this rewrite. I'm constantly fiddling around with different things. I'll play around with different fluid layouts for a while. Then I start looking at how the main menu should work and look. I quickly find out that there's this thing called "Cool Bars" and I'll spend hours playing with that. Then I start thinking about stuff like "Oh I need to make sure that the screen sizes are preserved so when the application gets relaunched it remebers how the screens were positioned." Which leads to what happens if they have two monitors? Which leads to what happens if they have a quad screen? Yikes it's got to stop. I have always been a slow starter. I think about stuff long and hard up front. This has always plagued me. Once I get my mind made up though bam... I'm off and running. I'm looking for advice from some other one-person software companies that can help someone like me get off to a quicker start? ### Success Thanks to everyone for your motivation. I finally have a plan in place. I wish I could split the vote between @haylem and @ThorbjørnRavnAndersen. I went to download.com and filtered the downloads by my software category. I sorted by "Editors Pick" and downloaded a couple of the highest rated programs. On the second hit I found the final piece of inspiration I needed. I love yellow sticky notes. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/086P7.jpg)
