Consider using Newton's method to solve the equation $arctan(x) = 0$. Using an initial guess of $x_0 = 1/2$ produces a sequence that converges rapidly. After $8$, iterations, $x_8$ is accurate to well over 2000 decimal places. > (i) Verify with a computer that $x_8$ is a solution accurate to over $2000$ > decimal places. I was just learning Newton's Method and saw this problem. I think I might be going ahead but it seems good to know. Here is my attempt: (Sorry if I'm wrong. I am just really interested in this problem)                        In[1]:newton1[function_, variable_, initial_, iterations_] :=                    Module[{p, f, x},                    Subscript[p, 1] = initial;                    f[x_] := function /. variable -> x;                    Do[                    Subscript[p, i] =                     Subscript[p, i - 1] -                     f[Subscript[p, i - 1]]/f'[Subscript[p, i - 1]];,                    {i, 2, iterations}];                    Subscript[p, iterations]                    ]                         In[1]:Timing[approx = newton1[arctan(x)=0, x, 1/2, 8]]                         Out[1]:{0.826805, Indeterminate}      or I was wondering if the program could be this:                             In[1]: f[x_] := arctan[x] = 0;                        In[1]: mynewton[function_, variable_, initial_, iterations_] :=                          Module[{f, x, p},                          f[x_] := function /. variable -> x;                          Subscript[p, 1] = initial;                          Do[                          Subscript[p, i] =                           Subscript[p, i - 1] -                           f[Subscript[p, i - 1]]/f'[Subscript[p, i - 1]];,                          {i, 2, iterations}];                          Table[Subscript[p, i], {i, 1, iterations}]                          ]                        In[1]: N[mynewton[f[x], x, 1/2, 8], 8]                        Out[1]: {0.50000000, Indeterminate, Indeterminate, Indeterminate, \                           Indeterminate, Indeterminate, Indeterminate, Indeterminate}      Again sorry if I am wrong. I am really interested in learning this part of the program. I will be able to continue to other questions like this after help with this one on my own. I really did try. I was studying various types of Newton's Programs but can not figure this one out. Can someone please help write the input?
