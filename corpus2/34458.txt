Right now, I have the 20 cities with the most population in the world, given by the lines of code               numberofpeople = Map[{#, CityData[#, "Population"]} &, CityData[All]];     datapoints =       Reverse[SortBy[DeleteCases[numberofpeople, {_, _Missing}],          Last]][[1 ;; 20]]      Now, I am going to plot these cities on a World Map, so that there is a point for each city in the dataset. However, I am stuck on what to do from there. As of now, I have the line of code               Graphics[{EdgeForm[Black], , CountryData[#, "SchematicPolygon"]} & /@        CountryData[]]      I am unsure on what goes between the commas. The other two arguments give a black border for each country's border and then displays the world as a SchematicPolygon. Any help is much appreciated.
