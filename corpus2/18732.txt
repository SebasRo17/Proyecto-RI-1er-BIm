I have created a grid, and also made a list of control objects(ex:inputfields, buttons, etc..). Then, I lay the list in my grid. There is no problem. However, the final layout takes a lot of time. I timed each operation and realized that the final grid layout is the one that takes up a huge chunk of time. Is there a better way of controlling the execution time of the graphics grid. `mygrid = ConstantArray["", {100, 100}]; mybutton1 = Button["Example", ImageSize -> {40, 50}]; myinput2 = InputField[x]; updatedlist = {}; updatedlist = ReplacePart[mygrid, {1, 2} -> mybutton1]; updatedlist = ReplacePart[updatedlist, {2, 3} -> myinput2]; Panel[GraphicsGrid[updatedlist, ImageSize -> {30, 40}, ContentSelectable -> True]]` The above code takes a lot of time to execute. I used the `Timing` function of mathematica to figure out which part took the long time to execute and it was the `Panel[GraphicsGrid[updatedlist, ImageSize -> {30, 40}, ContentSelectable -> True]]` part that was the longest. Because of this, my entire application has slowed down. Can I finetune my code to improve the performance? Look forward to hearing your inputs! Based on the comments blow, I tried to use a grid for the `updatedlist` above, but the problem is, how can I set the `ImageSize` of the `Grid`which is an option for the `GraphicsGrid` and not `Grid`? Thanks in advance,Anuk
