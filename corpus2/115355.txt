I am currently working on FLEX and have to call a web services. once I have the result, I have to call the web service again, with the previous result as the input. A compounding problem, is that the service might return multiple results, and I have to call the service again with each of the results as the input. Lastly, i need the results to be in a hierarchical array collection, with each result as the child of the input to the web service. If it were a synchronous function, it would have been very easy, but I have spent half a day trying to come up with something elegant for the web service. I ended up with having two arrays, one for the input, and one for the results. Every time I had one or more result, I would put it in the Input array and the results. I would then remove the first item from the input array and call the web service with it, and so on, till I finished all the inputs. Once I had all the results, I made a recursive function that would create the hierarchical tree, that I needed. This seems like a very hacky, WTF Solution. Is there any elegant and better solution? I am all ears.
