I'd like to ask a question that is pretty similar to the one being asked here, but for Objective-C. According to TIOBE rankings, the rise of popularity of Objective-C is unprecedented. This is obviously tied to the popularity of Apple products, but I feel like this might be a hasty conclusion to make since it doesn't really explain the stagnant growth of Java (1. There are way more Android O/S devices distributed worldwide, 2. Java is used in virtually every platform one can imagine) Now I haven't programmed in Objective-C at all, but I'd like to ask if there are any unique features or advantages about the language itself compared to other prevalent languages such as C++, Java, C#, Python etc. What are some other factors that contributed into the rise of Objective-C in this short span of time? > ![http://i.stack.imgur.com/3q0tW.png](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3q0tW.png)
