On my team, we often require the most senior programmers to train/mentor the brand new junior programmers. However, these same senior programmers are the ones who are doing the bulk of the real, important work. I've tried to argue to my manager that it makes sense to have the junior programmers, who are showing a high aptitude, take the new programmers under their wing. First off, it will free up the senior developers to work on more important initiatives (not that mentoring isn't important). Next, it will give the junior programmers a bit of pride in their job that they would be looked to for such a responsibility and they may learn something in teaching. Finally, it will save the company money, as senior developers cost a great deal more than juniors. My boss has failed to be persuaded since this is how it has worked on this team since the beginning of time, apparently. Assuming that the decision has been made that some sort of training/mentoring is mandatory, can anyone provide me with some better arguments or tell me why I am wrong? What does your team do? **We can all agree that seniority does not necessarily denote competence so just assume by "senior programmers" i mean "top programmers".
