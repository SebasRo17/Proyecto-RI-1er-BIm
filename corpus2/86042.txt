I have been a C++,Qt programmer for the last 3.5 years and have hit a plateau in terms of doing something new. Work has been repetitive and routine. I personally believe it is time to move on but off late I am getting more offers in mobile development like Android,Iphone etc. The latest offer I have is for objective-C based profile. I do not have the slightest idea about objective-C apart from that it is Object oriented C resembling C++ but not exactly a clone. Questions in my mind are   * what are the pros/cons of this careers switch or for any such switch?    * Is it good for one's career to change domains after sometime?   * How difficult it is to get back to one's previous area of proficiency? Thanks
