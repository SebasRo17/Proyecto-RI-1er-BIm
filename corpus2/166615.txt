As i remember the time when i was learning PHP, it was suggested to build a simple blog or a forum after reading the language fundamentals. I was told/read that this would cover everything that I would need to learn about PHP from a beginners book. This advice was out there in a number of places, and after following and working with PHP it seems quite good advice. Now, i am learning Java and reading the book "Thinking in Java" by Bruce Eckel. I wonder if there is any such set of similar, small projects that I could take up, that would cover all the essentials and most of what is covered in the book.
