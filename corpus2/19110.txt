I have a function $f:\mathbb{C}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ which I would like to visualize by by plotting $|f|$ with `Plot3D` using $\operatorname{Arg}f$ as the `ColorFunction`. I use               DensityPlot[Arg[f[a + I b]], {a, -5, 5}, {b, -5, 5}, PlotPoints -> 35,                 WorkingPrecision -> 50, ColorFunction -> "DarkRainbow"]      and get the following: ![nice](http://i.stack.imgur.com/JF1rH.png) which looks pretty nice. However then when I use               Plot3D[Abs[f[a + I b]], {a, -5, 5}, {b, -5, 5}, PlotPoints -> 35,            WorkingPrecision -> 50,            ColorFunction -> (ColorData[{"DarkRainbow", {-\[Pi], \[Pi]}}][Arg[f[#1 + I #2]]] &),            ColorFunctionScaling -> False,            PerformanceGoal -> "Quality", Mesh -> None]      I get ![awful](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8vPU2.png) The quality of $\operatorname{Arg}f$ was fine in the DensityPlot using the same quality parameters, but it's awful when I make it a `ColorFunction`. I suppose this is because the surface mesh is made from $|f|$ in the `Plot3D` and not from $\operatorname{Arg}f$ as it was in the `DensityPlot`, and $|f|$ isn't changing very much around the important parts of $\operatorname{Arg}f$ which is why it looks so choppy and noticable. So, how do I fix this? Is there a way to give the `ColorFunction` more `PlotPoints` than the actual surface, or perhaps a different mesh? If possible I want to avoid just increasing `PlotPoints` for the overall plot, as I am happy with the quality of $|f|$ here, and it can be very slow to render as it is.
