I am trying to plot a function which is based on the solution of some equation; I could get the correct figure but only after lots of warnings are printed out. The following is a minimum version of my problem:               solx[z_] := FindRoot[x z == 40, {x, 1.}]     r[z_, f_] := f x /. solx[z];     Plot[Evaluate[Table[r[z, f], {f, 1., 5., 1.}]], {z, 1., 5.}]      Then I got the following warning messages: > FindRoot::nlnum: The function value {-40.+1. z} is not a list of numbers > with dimensions {1} at {x} = {1.}. > > ReplaceAll::reps: {FindRoot[x z==40,{x,1.}]} is neither a list of > replacement rules nor a valid dispatch table, and so cannot be used for > replacing. > > FindRoot::nlnum: The function value {-40.+1. z} is not a list of numbers > with dimensions {1} at {x} = {1.}. > > ... What can be done to avoid the warning messages? (I have tested that if I remove the $f$-dependence and plot $r[z]$, there is no warning messages, i.e.,               solx[z_] := FindRoot[x z == 40, {x, 1.}]     r[z_] := x /. solx[z];     Plot[r[z], {z, 1., 5.}]      works without any problem.)
