I want to know, how important is it to program in your spare time? Is it necessary to work your 9-5 as a programmer and then get home and work on your hobby to become a better programmer? This said, I know you only get better at programming by, well, programming. Do prospective employers take hobby programming into account in an interview or do they ask this just out of curiosity? I feel guilty for not having a hobby project, but everything I can think of doing has already been done. So I am kind of in two minds about this, start something that has already been done or leave it until I come up with something original?
