I've been watching a video to learn HTML. I know about HTML but I just wanted to refresh my knowledge. The author declared that he is using HTML5 because the doctype was:               <!doctype html>      but I noticed that the author used the _meta_ element in a different style that I get used to, he used it without the the forward slash to close the element as follows:               <meta charset="utf-8">       and what I know about this is that it should be like the follwing:               <meta charset="utf-8" />      Which one of the above elements is considered HTML5? I tried to search online but it seems that every web designer has a different opinion which confused me. I like standards.
