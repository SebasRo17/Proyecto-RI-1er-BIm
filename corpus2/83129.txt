So I've been teaching and doing freelance work for years. I make great money and I love what i do. However, recently I that I have more personal project ideas than I can work on. I have tons of software ideas that I would love to give attention to. I've made up my mind, I'm going to stop freelancing at the end of the summer and put all my energy into starting a small software company. I was wondering if anyone else has gone down this same path and if so, if you have any advice for me regarding this career change?
