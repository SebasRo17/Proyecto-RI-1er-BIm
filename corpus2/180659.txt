I want to implement a server side application catching incoming http requests with a certain header.After catching the request it extracts information about type of HTTP request (GET,HEAD,PUT,POST etc.), requested url and sends it to another server, collecting the data ( a webservice or a server having a 3rd party tool like statsd). Application needs to be as lightweight as possible. On a side note corresponding server where the requests are coming to, will be in a high load, as a result application needs to perform well under such load. I know that this application can be implemented in any language, however I want to try something new. Is node.js suitable for developing such an application regarding complexity and performance?
