I have pasted this code in from _Mathematica_ 10               << Notation`     Symbolize[ParsedBoxWrapper[SubscriptBox["_", "_"]]]     a = Subscript[q, m]     b = Subscript[q, f]     TraditionalForm[a + b]      Though the definition of `a` and `b` look of identical form when pasted here, I entered `a` explicitly using `Subscript` while `b` is entered q then `Ctrl`+`_`+`f`. The Head of `a` is `Subscript` and the Head of `b` is `Symbol` (which is what I want in order to work with traditional notation in my field). In `TraditionalForm`, `a` is formatted correctly while `b` is formatted as `q\\[Underbracket]Subscript\\[Underbracket]f`. So can I use something of the form `q sub f` as a symbol and still get nice output in traditional form? I this case I think it is useful to post an image capture of the notebook: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y1bMQ.png)
