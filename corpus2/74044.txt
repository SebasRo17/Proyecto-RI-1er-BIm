We basicly have project that always turn around the same pattern. But, it sometime happens that we have project that go absolutly at the opposite of what we usualy do. It become now more difficult to bid and give this bidding to a potential client. In harder case, there's sometime things which look _very_ difficult to do and we just don't have an idea of how much time it could take... We also (for sure) want to take as less possible time to bid this knowing that we should maybe never get the project. So, my questions are;   * On what you base your time?    * What are the factors to consider (I know it's a bit hard as you don't see the base informations).    * Is there any tools that can help? To wrap it all, is there a better way to do it and if yes, what is this way?
