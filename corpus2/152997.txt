Profile Diagrams, Class Diagrams, Package Diagrams... ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8tmN9.jpg) However, (IMH-and-not-too-experienced-O) I quite see that doing each and every diagram is overkill. Therefore, which UML Diagrams are more suitable in a web context, more expecificly a blog (we want to build it from scratchs). I understand that just because I used UML Diagrams does not imply that our code would be great and brilliant... but, it certainly would be better than just unplanified code...
