I have built a number of websites for friends, family, etc. and I have put them all on a single shared web hosting account. Now that they are built, I want to get out of business of supporting them and paying for them (my friends are reimbursing me but I am paying for the actual bill) so I was thinking of having them create their own hosting accounts and slowly migrating the sites over. It got me thinking how does any freelancer do this? Do they force their clients to setup their own hosting up front and let the programmer log into the customer account during development. What if there is a bug in the future and they need to go back in? I was curious to see what model most people use who build websites for others as it seems like a tricky situation.
