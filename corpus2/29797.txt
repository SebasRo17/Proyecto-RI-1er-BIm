Although Mathematica has some nice plotting capabilities, there are some things which are annoying me: I like to export a Graphics oder Plot to PDF for use in $\LaTeX$. I like to a have an ImageSize of the PDF file, which corresponds to the image size in my document (e.g. 6 cm). I don't like to scale my image in $\LaTeX$. When exporting to PDF the `PlotRangeClipping` does not work as expected (especially when having a small `ImageSize`):               cm=72/2.54;     p1 = Graphics[{EdgeForm[{Red, Thickness[.1]}], FaceForm[], Disk[]},       Frame -> True,       PlotRange -> {{0, 1}, {0, 1}},       PlotRangeClipping -> True,       ImageSize -> 6 cm]     Export["p1.pdf", p1]          p2 = Graphics[{EdgeForm[{Red, Thickness[.1]}], FaceForm[], Disk[]},       Frame -> True,       PlotRange -> {{0, 1}, {0, 1}},       PlotRangeClipping -> True,       ImageSize -> 26 cm]     Export["p2.pdf", p2]      While the PlotRangeClipping for in the second generated file (p2.pdf) is more or less okay (not perfect), ![p2.pdf magnified](http://i.stack.imgur.com/kvJKA.png) there are serious problems in p1.pdf: ![p1.pdf magnified](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tvn1q.png) Is this a bug? Is there a way to have an acceptable PlotRangePadding with a small ImageSize?
