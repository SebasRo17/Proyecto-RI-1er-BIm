I would like to export a listplot as a PDF document without loosing the tooltip information on the single points. It kind of works with hyperlinks. Nevertheless this workaround is pretty limited and does e.g. not offer graphics as tooltips. Looking forward any ideas! Thanks and best regards Patrick               data = {{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 5}, {4, 7}};     hlinks = Text[     StringForm["``",       Hyperlink[" ", "http://" <> ToString[#[[2]]]]], #] & /@ data;     chart = Show[ListPlot[data, AxesOrigin -> {0, 0}], Graphics[hlinks]];     Export["C:\\Users\\myname\\Desktop\\scatterplot.pdf", chart]
