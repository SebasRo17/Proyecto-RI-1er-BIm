This integration has an analytical solution and its behavior is described by 1/r^2 function, but Mathematica gives some weird oscillating answer. Can anybody explain this and help me overcome this issue.               R  = 1500;     f[r_] := NIntegrate[BesselJ[2, r*k]*BesselJ[1, R*k], {k, 0, Infinity},AccuracyGoal -> 12]     sol = Table[Abs[f[r]]^2, {r, R, 2000, 10}];     ListLinePlot[sol, PlotRange -> All]
