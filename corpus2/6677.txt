The way I see it if you create one before you get the advantage of:   * Planning ahead   * Overview of the project but you lose:   * Time (doing work you'll probably end up repeating when writing code) On the other hand, I could just create them all after writing my code just to keep it as a reference for future developers. Which one serves the purpose of class diagrams and which is more advantageous?
