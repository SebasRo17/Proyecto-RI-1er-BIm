I do quite a bit of textual analysis with _Mathematica_ , and am currently making some `Manipulate` objects to walk people through key terms in the database. One issue I am running into with `Manipulate` however is that it continues to evaluate. For example, please consider the following code: ( **warning, this code does loop FWIW** )               testInput = {{"the", 4415}, {"of", 1284}, {"and", 1608}, {"in",          1384}, {"to", 1353}, {"a", 1205}, {"coal", 815}, {"was",          753}, {"by", 459}, {"were", 449}, {"for", 382}, {"is",          362}, {"with", 324}, {"from", 322}, {"on", 317}, {"that",          311}, {"as", 302}, {"mines", 264}, {"s", 257}, {"mining",          257}, {"it", 253}, {"this", 244}, {"at", 244}, {"be",          225}, {"cape", 216}};          testInput2 = {{"the", 4415}, {"of", 1284}, {"and", 1608}, {"in",          1384}, {"to", 1353}, {"a", 1205}, {"coal", 815}, {"was",          753}, {"by", 459}, {"were", 449}, {"for", 382}, {"is",          362}, {"with", 324}, {"from", 322}, {"on", 317}, {"that",          311}, {"as", 302}, {"mines", 264}, {"s", 257}, {"mining",          257}, {"it", 253}, {"this", 244}, {"at", 244}, {"be",          225}, {"cape", 216}};          files = {testInput, testInput2};          Manipulate[      viewerCount1 = {};      Do[       input = access;       AppendTo[viewerCount1,         If[Length[Flatten[Cases[input, {word1, _}]]] == 0, 0,          Flatten[Cases[input, {word1, _}]][[2]]]];       , {access, files}];      Print[viewerCount1];      , {{word1, "the", "First Word:"}}]      It goes through, runs the `Do` loop which picks out the word frequencies of `word1' in the sample text provided. But then, it **continues to loop**. It goes back through and does it again. And again. And again. This is all without any change to the `Manipulate` input. Is there a way to get to the end of the line `Print[viewerCount1]` and then **stop** until the input changes? I have tried to figure out the behaviour by looking elsewhere, such as "Manipulate Evaluation Sequence" and in the documentation, but there seems to be a paucity of textual examples like this.
