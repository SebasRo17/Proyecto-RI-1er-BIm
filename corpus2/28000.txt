I was wondering if its possible to make the following type of plot in Mathematica: I would like to take a 3D object, such as an ellipsoid, and cut out a wedge. I know this can be done using SphericalPlot3D and only plotting through an azimuthal angle phi. But here's the tricky part. Usually, whats left is a hollow shell, but I want to make it seem as if its a solid object with the inside colored according to some function. So what you would see when you cut out the wedge is a flat surface colored according to some function. If this is not possible with Mathematica, can anyone recommend a program where this may be done?
