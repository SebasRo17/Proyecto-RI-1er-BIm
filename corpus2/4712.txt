This question leads on from the recent question What are the standard colors for plots in Mathematica? There it was determined that the default color palette used by `Plot` is _equivalent_ to `ColorData[1]` (see the note at the end). This can be changed through the use of the option `PlotStyle`. My question is how can we make, e.g., the default color palette be `ColorData[3]` **and** have this default survive manual changes to other aspects of the plot styling? * * * So, for example, let's make a list of monomials and some dashing settings               fns = Table[x^n, {n, 0, 5}];     dash = Table[AbsoluteDashing[i], {i, 1, 6}];      Note that the default plot colors survive other choices to styling:               GraphicsRow[{Plot[fns, {x, -1, 1}], Plot[fns, {x, -1, 1}, PlotStyle -> dash]}]      ![default](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XY43s.png) The colors in the plot may be changed by locally setting `PlotStyle`, such as               Plot[fns, {x, -1, 1}, PlotStyle -> ColorData[3, "ColorList"]]      or by setting the default options. Let's do that and run the `GraphicsRow` command again:               SetOptions[Plot, PlotStyle -> ColorData[3, "ColorList"]];     GraphicsRow[{Plot[fns, {x, -1, 1}], Plot[fns, {x, -1, 1}, PlotStyle -> dash]}]      ![ColorList 3](http://i.stack.imgur.com/eYMqM.png) Note that the new colors in the default plot style is overwritten by the use of `PlotStyle -> dash`. This can be manually fixed, in this case, with `Transpose[{dash, ColorData[3, "ColorList"][[1 ;; 6]]}]`, but you don't want to do that every time. Changing the default `PlotStyle` will always have this problem. You'd expect there to be a default `ColorData` or color scheme setting somewhere, but I have been unable to find it. * * * Note that running the hack               Unprotect[ColorData];     ColorData[1] := ColorData[3]     ColorData[1, a__] := ColorData[3, a]     Protect[ColorData];      does not fix the default plot colors. Which probably means that the default internals of `Plot` does not make an explicit call to `ColorData`... * * * It's also interesting to note that when running a `Trace[Plot[...],TraceInternal -> True]` the colors seem to appear out of nowhere! I looked at such a trace in trying to answer this recent SO question related to how Mathematica determines the number of lines and thus colors it needs in a plot.
