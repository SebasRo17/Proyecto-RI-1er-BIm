I need to use in Fortran, matrices that I create in Mathematica, therefore, I need to format them, so that Fortan can understand them. I focus on the simplest example: Let's say I have tha matrix A created in Mathematica               A = {{1, 1}, {1, 1}};      Then, I am supposed to use FortranForm               FortranForm[A]      which gives as an output               List(List(1,1),List(1,1))      My question is, what do I do with this now? This cannot be the input file to Fortran, since this should be only numbers as far as I am aware. It could be that, the input file to Fortran is the out put of               List(List(1,1),List(1,1))      but this is nothing in Mathematica, so it does not give any output. Any help please?
