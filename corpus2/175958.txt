I'm currently working on a project that makes connection between different banks which send us information on which that project replies. A part of that project configures the different protocols that are used (not every bank uses the same protocol), this runs on a separate server. These processes all have unique id's which are stored in a database. But to save time and money on configurations and new processes, we want to make a generic protocol that banks can use. Because of PCI requirements we have to make a separate process for every bank we connect to. But the generic processes have only 1 unique identifier and therefor we cannot keep them apart. Giving every copy of that process a different identifier is as I see it impossible because they run entirely separate. So how do I keep my generic process unique?
