I have an epic which involves creating a mobile application which retrieves a user's data they have previously created in a web application and act on it locally. It seems logical to split the epic as follows;   1. Mobile app which acts on local, mocked up data   2. Mobile app which downloads data from the web app's api but with no authentication   3. Mobile app which downloads data from the web app's api _with_ authentication I'm struggling to word these stories. 1 is a scenario which would never happen for the end user, he wouldn't have any local data if it hadn't already been retrieved previously. How would I word this? If 2 is 'As a user I want my mobile device to act on the [entities] which I previously created via the web interface' then what would 3 be? 'As a user I want my mobile device to act on the [entities] which I previously created via the web interface _trusting they have been retrieved securely_ '??
