When I do this:               Apply[(If[#2 == what, "yay", If[#2 == whoops, "nay"]]) &, {-5, what}]      I get:               yay      But when I do this:               Apply[(If[#2 == what, "yay", If[#2 == whoops, "nay"]]) &, {-5, whoops}]      I get:               If[whoops == what, "yay", If[whoops == whoops, "nay"]]      This setup does work for numbers:               Apply[(If[#2 == 2, "yay", If[#2 == 3, "nay"]]) &, {-5, 3}]     nay      What I was trying to do was when I got stuck here was define a `VertexRenderingFunction` in a `GraphPlot`               VertexRenderingFunction -> ({White, EdgeForm[Black], Disk[#, {2, 1}],      Black, Text[      If[#2 == alpha1, "Alpha",        If[#2 == beta, "Beta",         If[#2 == alpha2, "Alpha",          If[#2 == gamma, "(70,55)",           If[#2 == delta, "(90,50)"]]]]], #1]} &)      What am I doing wrong? Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
