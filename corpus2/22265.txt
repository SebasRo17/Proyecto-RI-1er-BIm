I'm still at school, and I know I have problems dealing with other people. I'm not an angry or shy or different, I just like to work my way and with my opinions while respecting other's, I have a big curiosity and hunger for knowledge, but I lack practice and I guess people don't want to work with me because they might fear I would talk some kind of morale. (For example I started to learn programming using linux instead of windows, even if I use windows a lot. And I have a mac). What happens to programmers who lack teamwork ? Where does the problems begin ? Does being a good programmer compensate at least a little ? Is it normal for a programmer to have a vision about his work instead of just doing what he is told ?
