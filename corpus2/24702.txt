I need to find the minimum $r$ and the maximum $k$ of the following cubic equation for which there does not exist three distinct real roots. $rx^3-rkx^2+(r+k)x-rk=0$. Is it possible to find such $r$ and $k$ analytically? Or if you can provide me help using mathematica, that would be fine too.Thanks.
