It is possible for some commuters to track the location of their bus, train or tram through a personalised GPS tracking device (e.g.see http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/new-timetables- for-51-adelaide-metro-bus-routes/story-e6frea83-1226640915193). My question is can the FindGeoLocation[entity] be used to do this using the latest Ver. 10? What can be substituted for "entity", and can one also obtain information on the location of the nearest shopping center, public school, hospital or other mentionable utilities relative to the user's coordinate location using this command in Ver. 10?
