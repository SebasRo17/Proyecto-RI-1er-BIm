In our team meeting today a senior member brought up the proposal that we should be having a common location/structure for our development solutions. A couple of his points were:   1. Making it common meant when talking about projects and emailing stuff everyone is on the same wavelength and knows where to look.   2. If there is ever the need to hard code a location path then it will work across all developers pc's. He had a more few points to back up his suggestion but I unfortunately got distracted during the discussion and so didn't hear all of them. I have no issue with the idea and can see it's merits but I was wondering if it is common or even recommended that all developers place their code in the same folder structure. Or do developers like to have the flexibility of location solutions where-ever they want? We currently use **SVN** for our version control. In this case his recommendation was to place all code in:               c:\Work\Development\<Customer>\<project>\Code\<solution>\ the code      I guess actual path is irrelevant for this question but added for completeness.
