I've read in multiple places that the requirements must not be influenced by solution and must not contain solution. So in the below example , please can you help in letting me which is correct - Application A is interacting with Application B to install a new service / change the service type and disconnect a service. There 3 different service types 1,2 and 3. Application B does not support changing service from 1 to 2 or 1 to 3. Hence 1 must be disconnected and then 2 and 3 must be added. However service can be changed from 2 to 3 or 3 to 2 directly. In the above case , changing the service from 1 to 2 or 1 to 3 is a system level contraint. However from an end user's perspective this is a service change. In the above case , should I have a single system requirement stating system shall allow service to be changed for all the service types supported or should I have 2 different system requirement - 1 stating which all services can be upgraded directly and the 2nd stating in which cases service needs to be disconnected and installed?
