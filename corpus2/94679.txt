We keep repeating "you have to pull first" (this is git and github by the way). Then you code a little, then get your tests to pass, then commit, then pull and push again. We give tutorial links, try firm / hard. The latest changes broke 2 dozen tests. We document everything. What other things can we do to help folks. We require passing tests. Right now we are tempted to rollback all of todays changes which wouldn't be popular. I'm not a big fan of that harsh an approach to management but perhaps a 'final' warning that we will do that next time is now required. Failing that it's clear they need to fix broken tests, right? We fixed them last time so that didn't 'take'...
