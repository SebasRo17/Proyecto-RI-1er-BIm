I am searching for any good site that teaches C++, that can explain most to all things about it(general) and has a decent active community. About Me: I am new to programming(knows nothing of it, so please bare with me), I have only learned(to a very basic form) LUA scripting Language, so yes I am your complete newbie. I got interested in programming, from scripting in LUA, so you can say it was my small stepping stone, One would basically take a course in college, but not everyone is well funded for that and I can't buy books for the same said reason(yes I'm somewhat poor, only money for essentials and bills), I'm not trying to get sympathy, just stating my conditions. and Please, something in between the lines of 'Programming for Dummies'(I'm not the brightest crayon in the box), I know this will not be easy, but your help will be most appreciated. I would learn for either Windows and/or Linux/Unix. I use both. Site(s) I know: Cplusplus.org(quite inactive and tutorials are a little for the programming savvy.
