The file structure of a simple MMA Application can have the form:                 MyApplication         MyApplication.m         SomeAuxiliarPack.m         Kernel           init.m      Where `init.m` file have the form:               Get["MyApplication`MyApplication`"]     Get["MyApplication`SomeAuxiliarPack`"]      Ok.. all nice until here. The question is. How can I have a SubApplication inside Application, in some way that the SubApplication is independent from the first one, and is initialized together with MyApplication? Using this structure:                 MyApplication         MyApplication.m         Kernel           init.m         MySubApplication            MySubApplication.m            Kernel              init.m      with `init.m` Application as:               Get["MyApplication`MyApplication`"]     Get["MyApplication`MySubApplication`"]     Get["MyApplication`SomeAuxiliarPack`"]      and `init.m` SubApplication 2 as:               Get["MyApplication`MySubApplication`MySubApplication`"]      It works, but as you can see, SubApplication init.m has a unnecessary reference for `MyApplication`.
