Synonyms: Morton Code, Morton Curve, Z-Order Curve, invented 1966 by G. M. Morton according to wiki. Not to be confused with Hilbert Curves which is closely related and have similar name. I was wondering if mentioned algorithm is patented. More generally, is there any place one can browse patented algorithms? I am quite new to all this legal stuff and I am keen to know more. The real question I have, I guess, is: Can I make money off a library that provides Morton Coding, legally?
