I have forked a repo and branched that clone to code a story, and because I didn't understand the problem, wrote code that isn't solving my task at hand, but may prove useful later. Should I:   1. Delete it, and don't worry about it. Then commit without the extra code.   2. Make yet another branch for just that work, commit it, but don't post a pull request on it.   3. Just commit it with the existing code, and worry about the extra "fluff" later. I was thinking #2. If I understand correctly, I could just keep the extra code on a branch I never use on my clone, and dig it up later if something comes up that may benefit from using it.
