let's assume - regardless from technology and programming languages - you have a type and the type has an association to another type. This association has the complexity of 'at least one' (1..n). How would you specify the behavior, when removing elements from this association based on a predicate? Say, the predicate fits to all elements, thus the removal would violate the 1..n constraint, would you remove all elements but one or would you rather not remove any element in this case (and have a transactional-like behavior)?
