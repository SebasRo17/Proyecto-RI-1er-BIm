I’ve working as a software engineer for last 4 years. Throughout my small experience I worked for IT organizations, where we had separate role of project manager, analyst, quality engineer and software engineers and many more. Also we applied complex agile process working in large/small team. I personally participated on every step of software developer life cycle. Few months before I got good opportunity on a co-operate company and I’m serving right now. I’m assigned few internal projects which are company goals. The problem is, I’m spending most of the time in getting requirements and my boss is not willing to give me input. He is giving me full blame that I did not deliver the tasks. I’m unable to explain that without requirements I can’t work and even I can’t commit any deadline. He uses to say me often that please make my dreams come true. How can I get this divine requirement? It took around 1 month just to give me rights on my machine to install IDE and internet connection. In short, they did not give me any requirements or documents, the targets are still unclear and also team is not contributing. I’m not trying to leave this company, I’m consider it as a challenge to get things right. As a programmer, how can I handle this issue?
