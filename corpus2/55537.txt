I encountered this when trying to solve this problem with `DSolve`:               DSolve[D[p[x, y, t], t] ==             x D[p[x, y, t], x] + (1 - y) D[p[x, y, t], y] + 2 p[x, y, t], p, {t, x, y}]      > DSolve::deqx: Supplied equations are not differential equations of the given > functions. >   >   >     (* Input returned *) >   It's not surprising to see `DSolve` fails in solving PDEsâ€¦ but why this warning? Even more shocking:               DSolve[D[p[x, y, t], t] ==             x D[p[x, y, t], x] + (1 - y) D[p[x, y, t], y] + 2 p[x, y, t], p, {x, y, t}]      > >     {{p -> Function[{x, y, t}, C[1][x (-1 + y), t + Log[x]]/x^2]}} >   The result changed just because I reordered the independent variables (from `{t, x, y}` to `{x, y, t}`). Is this a bug? Tested in _v9.0.1, Windows Vista 32bit_ and _Wolfram Programming Cloud_.
