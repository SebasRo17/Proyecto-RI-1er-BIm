I recently was browsing Reddit and came across a post linking to a "JavaScript genetic algorithm" example. I've really been fascinated with the concepts of genetic algorithms and programming, however even after some Googling I am still left slightly confused. Can someone please explain to me how it works? I suppose the vocabulary terms are confusing me more than anything else. I've never taken a computer science class but I do program on my spare time and enjoy it. I'm 16 years old so I would appreciate brief examples and perhaps explanations. Just the concept of genetic programming and how I could implement it into my projects and why. Thanks.
