I was reading up on scalable bloom filters and could not understand how each time a constituent bloom filters fills up, a new bloom filter with larger size is added. The elements that contributed to the set bits in the initially created filters cannot be looked up for presence. Perhaps I am wrong in my understanding of this? I do understand basic bloom filters. However, I cannot wrap my head around dynamic bloom filters.
