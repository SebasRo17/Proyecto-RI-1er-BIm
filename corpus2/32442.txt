I was wondering what unique features I can learn from Scheme that would help me become a better programmer? I have a lot experience in mainstream languages, and I am looking to expand my horizons and learn about functional aspects that are missing from other languages. I am familiar with closures from javascript, lambda expressions from C#, and I was wondering what I can focus on that is lacking in other languages? Aside from the Lisp syntax, I feel like what I have seen so far I've already encountered in other languages. **What is unique to Scheme/Lisp that will teach me something new?**
