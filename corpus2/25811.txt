What database features/elements are necessary for a programmer to understand in order to create non-trivial applications? I was once asked in a job interview (by a DBA) to rate my understanding of database concepts -- I thought it would be interesting to get opinions. I'm looking for basic and advanced skills, also any opinions on where developers are typically the weakest (what lack of skills or knowledge creates the most problems). Also, is it better that developers are need-to-know, and pass more advanced work onto a DBA -- where does that "line in the sand" exist?
