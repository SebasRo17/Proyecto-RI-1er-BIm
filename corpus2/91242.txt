I generally include JavaScript files using the script tag as below.               <script type="text/javascript" src="somefile.js"></script>      I have seen some people using the language attribute as well. Now-a-days I find many people omitting the type attribute. I have started to get a feeling that if JavaScript is the default scripting language then even I should omit the type attribute. Would it be good to omit the type attribute? Would it cause any problems?
