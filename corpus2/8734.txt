Software is easy to build, but even easier to build the way the developers think it should function. What about the end user? How best to obtain feedback from them regarding a new product? For example: we recently released a new web based application for IT support and this is what the user must use to receive IT support. They have no choice. How can we elicit feedback from them? Ideas outside the box are most appreciated because I find the usual feedback form gets few submissions so I am looking for creative ways to get in touch with our user base and continue to develop this application (or any in the future) with their desires in mind.
