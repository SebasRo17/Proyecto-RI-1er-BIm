I've found that the `LevelSchemes` package is extremely useful when combining several plots with precise control over where to place legends, making plots withing plots other neat stuff like that, however I ran into problems when I tried to combine a graphics object (like a .png file) and a plot. Here is what I am trying to do: I have a plot depicting the squeezing parameter value in depending on the external electric field strength. ![Plot without the picture](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SGcQP.png) I wanted to obtain something that looks like this: ![This is what I want made by hand in a graphics editor \(Inkscape\)](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WfGGd.png) To achieve said result I tried something like this:               Figure[      {       (*Main panel*)       FigurePanel[        {{0, 1}, {0, 1}}, PlotRange -> {{0, 1}, {-0.6, 20}},         FrameTicks -> {Automatic, Automatic}, FontSize -> 15,         LabB -> textit["x"], BufferB -> 2.5, TickFontSize -> 12        ],       DataPlot[        dati, Tag -> set[1]        ],       ScaledLabel[{0.5, 0.2},         "some value=" <>          ToString[Some expression that returns a number],         FontSize -> 13],           (*Smaller Pannel*)       ScaledFigurePanel[        {{0, 0.55}, {0.55, 0.95}},        PlotRange -> {Automatic, Automatic}        ],        (*AMPSPlot is essentially SphericalPlot3D that takes a nxn matrix as an argument.        It is found in the ADM package*)       RawGraphics[        Rasterize[         Axes3D[AMPSPlot[           WignerRotate[            gdm[Flatten[sols[[30, 2]]]], {optlen[              gdm[Flatten[sols[[30, 2]]]]], 0, 0}], PlotRange -> All,            Boxed -> False, Axes -> False]]]]            },      PlotRange -> {{-0.2, 1.1}, {-0.2, 1.1}}, ImageSize -> 100*{6, 4}           ]      but I get something like this: !["This doesn't work at all"](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5tgSG.png) Is there any way to incoorporate pictures in graphics by `LevelScheme`? The main goal I am trying to do this is to see how the graphs look every time I tweak which set of parameters I've used, without going through the fiddly process of merging them in Inkscape.
