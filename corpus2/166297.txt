I have just started to use Pomodoro today and I am trying to work out what I should and should not do during my 25 minute work time. For my 25 minute work stint I started to write some code and realised that I had done something similar in a related project so I opened that solution to copy and paste that existing code. Question is, is this allowed? Also, if during my 25 minutes I realise that there is an important work- related email that I need to send can I do that or should I wait for the next 25 minutes or the break ? I am writing this question during my, now extended, 5 minute break. Is this work or is it a break? I really will appreciate some guidance as I want to use Pomodoro to focus better on my work. Another thing that happened to me was that a Adobe AIR update alert came up on my desktop during the 25 minutes. Should I ignore such things until the break? Sachin
