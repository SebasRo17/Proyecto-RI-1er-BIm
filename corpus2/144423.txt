A while ago I started to create a winform application and at that time it was small and I did not give any thought of how to structure the project. Since then I added additional features as I needed and the project folder is getting bigger and bigger and now I think it is time to structure the project in some way, but I am not sure what is the proper way, so I have few questions. **How to properly restructure the project folder?** At the moment I am thinking of something like this:   * Create Folder for Forms   * Create Folder for Utility classes   * Create Folder for Classes that contain only data  **What is the naming convention when adding classes?** Should I also rename classes so that their functionality can be identified by just looking at their name? For example renaming all forms classes, so that their name ends with **Form**. Or is this not necessary if special folders for them are created? **What to do, so that not all the code for main form ends up in Form1.cs** Another problem I encountered is that as the main form is getting more massive with each feature I add, the code file (Form1.cs) is getting really big. I have for example a TabControl and each tab has bunch of controls and all the code ended up in Form1.cs. How to avoid this? **Also, Do you know any articles or books that deal with these problems?**
