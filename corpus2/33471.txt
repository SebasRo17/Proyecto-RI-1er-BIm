I want to know is there any one line code to find position of first nonzero number without calculating position of all non zero numbers. For example,               A = {0, 0, 0, 1, -2, -1, 0};     First[Flatten[Position[A, _?(# != 0 &)], 1]]      will give me position of first non zero number. But first it calculate position of all non zero number. Is there any way to stop position function when it found first non zero number?
