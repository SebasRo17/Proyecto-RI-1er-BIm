In order to improve my workflow with _Mathematica_ , I'm looking for _cheat sheets_. The purpose of such reference cards is to be printed and to stay on the desk during the learning of a new programming langage. They are _not_ extensive lists. It should be   * printable,   * readable at a glance. It may be   * general,   * or specific to a given task (algebra, analysis, style, ...) I found a first list of such cheat sheets for _Mathematica_ at devcheatsheet.com, with a special thumb up for this one at the Wolfram Library Archive. They might be unpractical (referring mostly for programming instead of shortcuts) or outdated (as they are mostly for version 5.2). Any suggestion? **Edit:** I am asking for good reference cards or cheat sheets. For a extensive list of all keyboard shortcuts, please refere to Wolfram's documentation. **Edit2:** This good cheatsheet for git is a good example of what I'm looking for. As you may see, the way information is chosen, sorted and put together has much importance in the process. It is very usefull for people that have already understood the syntax but not yet memorized it. It is a speedy and smart summary. It is also a tool for beginners to detect what is important. Please see also the example from Wolfram's archive I gave above. I would be surprised it is the only one out there.
