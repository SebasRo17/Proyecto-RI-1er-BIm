I use Doctrine 2 and I've read some articles on inheritance strategies' mapping with ORM. I've seen three main strategies : "Class table inheritance", "Concrete table inheritance" and "Single table inheritance". With Doctrine 2, I managed an install of "Class Table Inheritance" (CTI) and "Single Table Inheritance" (STI). In some cases, I think use the "Concrete Table Inheritance" is most appropriate, but i didn't find any documentation which show this strategy in Doctrine 2. Why there is no "Concrete Table Inheritance" with Doctrine 2 ? Is it for performance ? What is the reason ?
