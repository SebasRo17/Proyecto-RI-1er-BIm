I'm trying to understand how something like this works, but I'm inexperienced and I'm trying to understand how the process would work. Say you have ten categories, a thousand zip codes, and ten thousand items listed in each category, each of which has a description. When a user does a search for (e.g.) "guitar hero xbox" in the "video games" category within "50 miles", what happens next? Would the database compare zip codes first, to find everything in range, then do a `SELECT items WHERE category="video games" and zipcode=A OR B OR C OR D`, then execute some sort of search on the description of each listing in the result set? How would that work? I'm not looking for exact answers about CL, I'm looking for a general idea of how this works anywhere/everywhere.
