So I was wondering today, where would you put utility classes in an ASP.NET MVC app? By utility classes I mean classes that can be static and are just used to perform a function. Like a class to send an email that takes email address , subject, and body as arguments.   I would assume maybe creating a separate folder and namespace would be good enough, but wanted to get everyone opinions
