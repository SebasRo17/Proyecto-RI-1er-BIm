Is it possible to apply a filter on the Kafka stream of topic? What I want to do is filter out messages while consuming and then run some custom logic on top of it. It is a sort of thing that Storm trident allows us to do ( apply filter on the stream ). What I've found so far is I can create a trident topology and do the filtering but would be of great benefit if I can filter out the stream itself, as it will reduce the amount of traffic at my consumer's end. I know this is crazy but could this be a valid approach? Please correct me if I am wrong.
