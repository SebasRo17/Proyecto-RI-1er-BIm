I have to calculate: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nfbVq.jpg) How can I create such a sum? Do I have to set the factors of each term manually (one by one), like `G1 = 1, H1 = 1, G2 2, H2 = ...`.? ### Update ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UxKzV.jpg) Addtional Questions:   1. How can I store te results into another List? (In this example, the list `F`)   2. Sometimes, a variable turns blue and does not get calculated in expression. How do I fix this?
