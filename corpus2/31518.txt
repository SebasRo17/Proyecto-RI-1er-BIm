I'm trying to run Mathematica parallel on multiple nodes on a HPC, and I use the remote kernel tab in the "Parallel Kernel Configuration" settings to set the communication between different nodes(detailed setup here). Since every time I would get different nodes of the HPC, each time I have to manually change the setting in the "Parallel Kernel Configuration". So is it possible to change the settings within the code? Here is the detail where I want to change: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/p5HGs.png) For example, how can I enable 16 kernels on a remote host named "mike123" and 10 kernels on a remote host named "mike234"
