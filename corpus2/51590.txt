I'm new in Mathematica and I am working with various notebooks. My problem is that when I run a notebook, it seems taking definitions from the previous notebook. For example in 'notebook1' I make an approximation like E=M, and when I run the second notebook it takes also the approximation instead I don't want it to do it. I've tried commands like 'Clear' or 'ClearAll' but I can't get through. Can anybody help me? Thanks
