I want just data without comma and brackets. Even `TableForm` is not working for me. For example, the general pattern of my table is               t = Table[Table[{m, n}, {m, 1, 10}], {n, 1, 9}]      which gives output in the for `{x1,y1},{x2,y2}.....` . If I use `TableForm` it will show output as:               1 2 3  ... 10     1...........      ...............     2...Numbers......     ..............     9............9      But I want output of just two columns for the values of m and n ({m,n}) like               m1 m2     m3 m4     .....      How to do that? Or suggest me how convert the data in the form {{x1,y1},{x2,y2}} in just two columns?
