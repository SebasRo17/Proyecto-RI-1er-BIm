What transports/pipes/interops are available that most or all languages support across OSs? Not necessarily, network, but interprocess. Or is interprocess communication OS specific? I mean, for instance, the COM interop is on windows. Is there an equivalent on Linux, for instance, that would work the same and a programming language could use interchangeably? I know most languages support network IO. Do we have to use that for interprocess communication or are there other options?
