Asynchronous non-blocking event driven programming seems to be all the rage. I have a basic conceptual understanding of what this all means. However what I'm not sure is when and where my code can benefit from being asynchronous, or how to make blocking IO, non-blocking. I'm sure that I can simply use a library to do this, but I'm more interested in more in depth concepts, and the various ways to implement it myself. Are there any comprehensive/definitive books, or other resources on this subject (like GoF for Design Patterns, or K&R for C, tldp for things like bash)? (Note: I'm not sure if this is actually functionally an identical question to my question on Learning event driven programming)
