I am a relatively new software developer, and one of the things I think I should improve is my ability to test my own code. Whenever I develop a new functionality, I find it really difficult to follow all the possible paths so I can find bugs. I tend to follow the path where everything works. I know this is a well known issue that programmers have, but we don't have testers at my current employer and my colleagues seem to be pretty good at this. At my organization, we do neither test-driven development nor unit testing. It would help me a lot but it's not likely that this will change. What do you guys think I could do in order to overcome this? What approach do you use when testing your own code?
