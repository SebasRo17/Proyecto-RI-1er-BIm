I have a Markov Chain Monte Carlo code that uses a chi squared function to fit some data. I am running into an issue now with getting unrealistic values for some of the free parameters in the code. What I would like to do is place an lower and upper bound on the parameter value (say `k1[[i]]` below ). Each iteration (`k1[[i]]`) of the function produces a random number that is added or subtracted from `k1[[i-1]]` giving the next step in the random walk. I would like to be able to test each current parameter (`k1[[i]]`) and if it is above or below a cutoff value, choose another random number until I return to the specified range. If `k1[[i]] < lowest` or `k1[[i]] > largest`, choose another Random number until `lowest < k1 < largest` However I am not quite sure how to implement this into the code for each parameter.   Does anyone have any suggestions?               Table[       {             k1[[i]] =  k1[[i - 1]] + weight*k1[[i - 1]]*RandomReal[{-1.0, 1.0}],             k2[[i]] = k2[[i - 1]] + weight*k2[[i - 1]]*RandomReal[{-1.0, 1.0}],             k3[[i]] = k3[[i - 1]] + weight*k3[[i - 1]]*RandomReal[{-1.0, 1.0}]        },           {i,1,range}          ]
