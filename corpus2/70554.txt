All over the Internet I see people advocating for the use of enum or const rather than #define for constant definition. Are there times when #define is more appropriate or equally appropriate? Please explain. Are there times when #define is just awful? Please elaborate. (You can say 'always' if you really wish, but I'm looking for more specific answers.) (Yes, I am trying to justify my use of #define, which to me looks so much neater.)
