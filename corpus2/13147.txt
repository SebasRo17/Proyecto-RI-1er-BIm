This gives a 64×1 column vector in _Mathematica_ :               F := Flatten[ArrayFlatten[     ArrayFlatten[      Table[Subscript[f, i, j, k, l, m,        n], {i, 0, 1}, {l, 0, 1}, {j, 0, 1}, {m, 0, 1}, {k, 0, 1}, {n,         0, 1}]]]] // MatrixForm      as `F=(1:64)'` does in MATLAB. In MATLAB, `reshape(F,16,4)` gives a 16×4 matrix, where _column_ 1 is the first 16 elements of `F`, column 2 the 17th to 32nd, etc. In _Mathematica_ , the best equivalents for reshaping seem to be the top two answers here. But when I apply either of these commands, I do not get a 16×4 matrix that's constructed like `reshape` in MATLAB. Instead I get a 16×4 matrix where _row_ 1 is the first four elements of F, etc. I have tried adding transpose operations in every location imaginable, and still can't get my _Mathematica_ output to match the MATLAB. I've also tried wrapping `List[]` around the definition of `F` to make `F` appear like a row instead of a column, but everything I do seems to not work. Any help is much appreciated!
