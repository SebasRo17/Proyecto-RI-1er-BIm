I have _Mathematica_ code that uses `Import[]` to download URLs. I noticed that first time I use the `Import[]` command it works. Next time it fails. I'm using Windows 7, Mathematica 8.0.4. Here is an example. I start new sesssion of _Mathematica_ , and then type               Import["http://groups.google.com/group/comp.soft-sys.math.mathematica/about"]      No problem. Now I issue the same command again on the same URL (or different one)               Import["http://groups.google.com/group/comp.soft-sys.math.mathematica/about"]      and now this gives me an error > FetchURL::conopen: The connection to URL > http://groups.google.com/group/comp.soft-sys.math.mathematica/about cannot > be opened. If the URL is correct, you might need to configure your firewall > program, or you might need to set a proxy in the Internet connectivity tab > of the Preferences dialog (or by calling SetInternetProxy). For HTTPS > connections, you might need to inspect the authenticity of the server's SSL > certificate and choose to accept it. On the same Windows 7 PC, I start MATLAB, and type               data=urlread('http://groups.google.com/group/comp.soft-sys.math.mathematica/about')     data=urlread('http://groups.google.com/group/comp.soft-sys.math.mathematica/about')      and both work. I get the page fine the second time around. I open the browser, and type the URL, and I can see the page. This is the same PC. No proxy. home PC. Nothing special. P.S. This code used to work fine with _Mathematica_ on an earlier version (forgot which one now), becuase I used _Mathematica_ to generate this web page and all the `Import` commands I used are listed above and you can see them. I have list of many URL's that I loop over calling `Import[]` on them one by one. Again, **the problem is that I now get an error on a URL using`Import[]` and the problem seems to show up the second time I use the `Import[]`.** Any suggestions how to fix this? Is this a known issue? **update** I still have _Mathematica_ 7 and 6 installed. So I tried this on them. And I get the same problem there. This is strange, since this code worked before. I think now it is a google groups/server problem, becuase when I try different domain (i.e. not google groups), I do _not_ get this problem               data = Import["http://www.yahoo.com", "Data"];     data = Import["http://www.yahoo.com", "Data"];      No error in the second time. I do not understand why this problem (i.e. using the `Import` command again) gives an error on some URLs and not on others. **update** Thanks for everyone's help and for WReach solution. I have used WReach nice solution to bypass the problem and have just updated the currrent Mathematica code I was using to update the usenet programming languages trends charts. The updated charts are on this page if you are interested in seeing the result.
