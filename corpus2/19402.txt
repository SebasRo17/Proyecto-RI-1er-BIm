I tried to solve the following equation with Mathematica's solve:               Solve[K*(2*Tan[L/2*Sqrt[P/(EI)]]-L*Sqrt[P/(EI)])+4*P*Sqrt[P/(EI)] == 0, P]      It gave the following error:               Solve::nsmet: This system cannot be solved with the methods available to     Solve.      I do not see any strange functions being called here, and I am curious about what properties make this expression difficult for Mathematica.
