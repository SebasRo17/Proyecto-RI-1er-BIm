My team is currently locked into using a tool we dislike that takes the form of a Eclipse plugin and a .jar; the plugin gives us a button to quickly run a single file's code (via invoking the main .jar and passing to it the current file). We want to move to C#.net. Is there any way to get Visual Studio to replicate this behavior? Obviously we could put each runnable class into its own project in our solution, but that requires checking a lot of project files into source control. Ideally we'd have a main() method in each file and could tell visual studio to run just that file for development purposes, while the finished software would be run from a single entry point using command-line parameters. (I don't want to give too much information here regarding the purpose of the software, so please just accept that the current setup makes a lot of sense for what we're doing and changing it too much would be rejected by management.)
