I've been working for about 5 years in Java, developing financial back-offices (web-services, business logic, report generation etc.). I think Mathematica is very suitable for such calculations and business logic development and am wondering if there are any success stories for its usage in such systems. I also think that it can be pretty to use Mathematica with JLink in my web- application to delegate calculations.   * **Does anyone have such an experience or know-how ?** **UPD 1:** Removed some questions (they have relation to Wolfram Workbench): What about unit-testing in Mathematica ? How to organize Mathematica code if it would be very large ?
