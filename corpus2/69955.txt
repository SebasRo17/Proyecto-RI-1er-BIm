Sometimes when my life needs some guiding light, I read the **Zen of Python** by Tim Peters and usually manage to get back on the tracks. Today was one of those days, so I checked it again. I've noticed that the "abstract" section says: > Long time Pythoneer Tim Peters succinctly channels the BDFL's guiding > principles for Python's design into 20 aphorisms, only 19 of which have been > written down. What would be this last unwritten aphorism?
