I'm using the Yii Framework which is an MVC php framework that is pretty similar to your standard web-based MVC framework. I want to display the related data from a many-to-many table as a list of strings in my view. Assuming a table schema like:               tag { id, name }     post { id, title, content, date }     post_tag { post_id, tag_id }      A post will display like:               Date: 9/27/2012      Title: Some Title     Content: blah blah blah...     Tags: Smart Funny Cool Informative      I can achieve this by doing something like this in my Post view:               <?php       echo join(' ',                array_map(function($tag) { return $tag->name; }, $model->tags));     ?>      (where `$model->tags` is an array of `Tag` objects associated with my model) My questions are:   1. Is this amount of code/logic okay in the view? (Personally I think I'd rather just reference a property or call a single function.)   2. If not, where should this code live? In the model? the controller? a helper? Potentially I may want to use in in other views as well. Ultimately I think its purely a display issue which would make me think it should be in the view, but then I have to repeat the code in any view I want to use it in.
