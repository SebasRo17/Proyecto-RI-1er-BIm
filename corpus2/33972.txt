When I `Import` an EPS file, bezier curves are converted into something like this:               Graphics[JoinedCurve[       {{{1, 4, 3}}}, {{{0., 0.}, {1., -1.}, {2., 1.}, {3.,  0.}}}, CurveClosed -> {0}]]      Here `JoinedCurve` contains no curve segments but two lists, but such a representation is not documented in the reference: http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/JoinedCurve.html I can see that the latter list represents the list of control points, and `{{1, 4, 3}}` seems to do with something like dimensions of the points, but what is the exact use of it?
