From my understanding creating an application that runs on multiple architectures requires virtualization, and virtualization reduces performance since it creates a layer of abstraction. With Windows 8 supporting both Intel and ARM architectures should we expect slower performance with a WinRT app versus a .Net app running on an Intel device? Also, will WinRT support database connectivity and active directory access?
