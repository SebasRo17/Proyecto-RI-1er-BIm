If I have a spectral data set showing measured energy on the y-axis and frequency on the x-axis, how would I go about fitting this to a beta distribution? For example, lets say I had the data for the following curves showing spectrum for this ship: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/scd8Z.gif) How do I determine the beta curve fit parameters to say the blue line? Taking it one step further. If I have a wav sound file of the sound of an engine, how would I do the same thing? _**UPDATE_** I attempted to use the supplied answer and got an error as follows: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1eHIU.png) **The data file can be downloaded from the following URL:acoustic power spectrum data to 3k hz** The overall goal here is to generate a curve approximating the shape like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Wrt9a.png)
