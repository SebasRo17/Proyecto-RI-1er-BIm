Many times throughout writing larger programs I have questioned after how many copy and pastes does it make sense to put the code into a function or method and what is a good rule of thumb? I have been using a rule of thumb of four lines or greater and appearing more then twice, then I make a simple function / method containing that code. Can you think of a better practice or offer any pointers? This is more of a general design pattern question rather then a language specific question.
