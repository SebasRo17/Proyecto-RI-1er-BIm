I have to create a web application, preferably I would host that on Google App Engine. it is a multiplayer game, So it needs to be interactive. I am only familiar with C/C++ coding, and have started learning python. I have made multiplayer games before too(multi-player and single player) but with no GUI. Someone told me that the webapp interface would have to be written in JavaScript. And the back end could be in python or any other language. Please note, I have no issues in coding up the back-end, the game engine, of thew web app. Just that I do not know what are and how to, etc about web apps. And basically how to integrate the back end code into the web application (which I have to build from scratch) (I would also be writing the back end, so there is complete flexibility as of now) So please show me the light! I have absolutely no clue about where to start! Please tell me where to begin, and what all to read up which can quickly give me some insight into development work! How to go about the GUI. And what all possible language combinations can I use? The easier to use, the better.
