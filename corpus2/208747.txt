My job is mainly building websites using CMS such as Drupal, eZPublish or Magento. Most of the work is templating, CRUD and adhering to the specs with this. Occasionally, there is some business-specific logic, but it's usually 20 lines or so. Most of the logic is a bunch of `if` in the templates. In this context, I find it hard to argue over unit testing. What should I test? Only integration tests? They usually can only be done at a very high level, such as using Selenium IDE. And Selenium is a pain to handle in project-mode products, because the requirements often change in 6 months and then the project is over. There are also other difficulties such as URLs being dynamic. (CMS don't always respect a RESTful architecture, especially for contents.) I am in favor of unit testing. For libraries or framework-based projects, I easily write them and sets up a Jenkins server for them. But for CMS-based projects, I just don't know how and where to get started.
