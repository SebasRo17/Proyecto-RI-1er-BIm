I'm using "Drawing Tools" to decorate an imported image (a TIFF file). I need to create a set of regularly spaced parallel lines, and my solution for doing this is to create a pair of parallel lines (we have an LHS line and an RHS line), copy this pair, superimpose the copied LHS line on the previous RHS line, and then delete the previous RHS line. Doing this repeatedly gives me an array of parallel lines, which are all a fixed distance apart. My question is: while selecting multiple graphics primitives (lines here) how do I snap one primitive to a previously placed primitive decorating the image similar to how one can do this in Adobe Illustrator? Also, is there an easier way for me to automatically generate a set of parallel lines which can be translated / stretched apart using my mouse?
