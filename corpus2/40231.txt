Starting with               {{0, 0, 0}, {1, 1, 2}, {2, 3, 3}, {3, 4, 5}}      I would like to get               {{0, 2, 3, 5}, {1, 3, 2, 3}}      where the first list returned is the highest value reached in each of the first lists, and the second output is the position of the highest values that were reached in each list. I have been trying different combinations of `Max` and `Position`, but have been unsuccessful.
