I'm sometimes suppsed to demo work and I wonder if the Scrum methods have specified something about how demos should be done? I've done quick demos and I've been asked to demo on-the fly while it's not realistic to expect that programming always moves only forward. SO I'd like to know if you can tell me since I follow Scrum, if there is anything there that can improve my technical demos? For instance how often and when a demo should be done?
