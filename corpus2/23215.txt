I'm trying to do this:               p = 10;     a = ToString[N[Sqrt[3], p^2 - 1]];          a = Characters[a ];     b = Table[ToString[n], {n, 0, 9}];     n = 0; i = 0;     a = StringReplace[a, "." -> "g"];          a /. ToString[0] -> Graphics[{CMYKColor[1, 0, 0, 0], Rectangle[]}]      The idea is to replace the numbers, with a rectangle of each color - small numbers are brighter, bigger numbers are dark, the point is to be transformed in a green square. But for doing this, I must repeat the code a lot:                   a /.      ToString[0] -> Graphics[{CMYKColor[0, 0, 0, 0], Rectangle[]}]  /.      ToString[1] -> Graphics[{CMYKColor[1, 0, 0, 0], Rectangle[]}]  /.      ToString[2] -> Graphics[{CMYKColor[2, 0, 0, 0], Rectangle[]}]  /.      ToString[3] -> Graphics[{CMYKColor[3, 0, 0, 0], Rectangle[]}] ...      I tried to use Table, but it didn't work. I was trying the following:               Table[a /. ToString[o] -> Graphics[{CMYKColor[o, 0, 0, 0], Rectangle[]}], {0, 0, 9}]      But it didn't work. What would be a nice way to do this?
