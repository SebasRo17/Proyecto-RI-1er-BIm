I'm current working on a command line app that will grab resources online for you when you're setting up a new project locally. Right now all the urls for the resources I need are hardcoded into the application and adding new targets require updating the software. What are the benefits of hosting a database remotely that the application would query to get new packages. Sort of like `npm` and any other generic package manager out there. Are there any best practises in setting something like this up?
