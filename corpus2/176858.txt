2¹⁶-1 & 2⁵ = 2⁵ (or? obviously ?) A developer asked me today what is bitwise 65535 & 32 i.e. 2¹⁶-1 & 2⁵ = ? I thought at first spontaneously 32 but it seemed to easy whereupon I thought for several minutes and then answered 32. 32 seems to have been the correct answer but how? 65535=2¹⁶-1=1111111111111111 (but it doesn't seem right since this binary number all ones should be -1(?)), 32 = 100000 but I could not convert that in my head whereupon I anyway answered 32 since I had to answer something. Is the answer 32 in fact trivial? Is in the same way 2¹⁶-1 & 2⁵-1 =31? Why did the developer ask me about exactly 65535? Binary what I was asked to evaluate was 1111111111111111 & 100000 but I don't understand why 1111111111111111 is not -1. Shouldn't it be -1? Is 65535 a number that gives overflow and how do I know that?
