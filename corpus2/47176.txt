In my experience interviewing developers I feel like candidates who've achieved a Masters in Comp Sci tend to be **worse** programmers on average that those who don't have a Masters. Is that just me, or have others noticed this phenomenon? If so, why would that be the case? **UPDATE** I appreciate the thoughtful comments. I think I should have been clearer in the comparison I'm making. Given two candidates who graduated from college around the same time, someone who went on to gain a Masters seems on average to be a worse programmer than someone who spent all their time in industry.
