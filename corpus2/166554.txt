For an application of mine, I analyze the sentiment of articles, using NLTK, to display sentiment trends. But right now all articles weigh the same amount. This does not show a very accurate picture because some articles have a higher impact on the internet than others. For example, a blog post from some unknown blog should not weigh the same amount as an article from the New York Times. How can I determine their impact?
