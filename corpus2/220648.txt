This is one of my assignment for this semester. And just to be clear, this question is not about the answer to my assignment as I have already finished it, it is more about the sanity of the question I am confused because as I know from the textbook, ATAM is a software architecture evaluation process which has multiple phases and steps. On the other hand, "analysis tools" provided by ADLs is just a sub-set of the evaluation process. More over, each ADL provides different set of tools for analyzing the architecture. I think that comparing between the two concepts is somehow weird and just confusing. I mean it is like comparing the whole computer and the graphic card itself. They have some relationships but they are not in the same scale. The graphic card is meant to be used by the computer to process graphical stuff. Each graphic card has its own characteristics and functionalities, some are better than another. Without the graphic card, the computer can still run, but without the computer the graphic card is nothing In short, my question is "Is it possible to do that kind of comparison? "
