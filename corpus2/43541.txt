I have a very long list of numbers and I want to check whether there's a function (something that would look like `PartOfQ[element,list]`) that tells you immediately with a `True` or `False` as to whether the element in question is part of the list or not. Ideally it would also tell you its index. If there isn't a built-in such function, is there an efficient way of building such a function myself?
