We've outsourced our app development, and they've created a DB hosted on Amazon-EC2. For the UI we're in talks with a web designer, but they don't do any of the coding to integrate the website with the DB created by the app developers. Is it a good idea to have one person do the website design, and another to do the DB integration coding? What issues or complications could come up? Should we instead go with a designer who provides the complete package?
