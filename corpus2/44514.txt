Is it possible to take a time derivative of a vector given in some curvelinear coordinate system (i.e. spherical)? Mathematica would need to take into account the time dependence of the basis vectors. $$ \frac{d}{dt}\vec{r}=\dot{r}\hat{r}+r\dot{\theta}\hat{\theta}+r\sin[\theta]\dot{\phi}\hat{\phi} $$ I bet that there is something built into mathematica already to get the above result, but I can't figure it out. Edit: Thanks for your answers, they already helped me a lot. In the end I was hoping for a quick way to get: $$ \frac{d}{dt}\left( \begin{array}{c} f(r,\theta,\phi) \\\ 0 \\\ 0 \end{array} \right)=\left(\frac{d}{dt}f(r,\theta,\phi)\right) \left( \begin{array}{c} \dot{r} \\\ r\dot{\theta} \\\ r\sin[\theta]\dot{\phi} \end{array} \right) $$ just by typing $$ Dt[\\{f(r,\theta,\phi),0,0\\},t] $$ in Mathematica. I could get this behavior by multiplying the time derivative of $f$ with the result from TransformedField, but this could quickly become tedious with higher time derivatives and more vector components. Is there a more direct way to do it? Thanks a lot
