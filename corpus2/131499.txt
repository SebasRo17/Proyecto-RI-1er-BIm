I recently ran across code where the developers used both fully qualified class names AND imported class names in their source code. Example:               import packageA.Foo;          public class Example {         public packageB.Bar doSomething() {             final Foo foo = new Foo();             ...         }     }      I was under the impression that the only reason one might want to use fully qualified name for classes in source code is when they have identical class names in two different packages and they need the fully qualified name to distinguish between the two. Am I wrong?
