This is more of an abstract/creative problem. I think everyone who has played around with `GraphPlot`, ended up with an image that looks like this, at least once in their life: ![messy GraphPlot output](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ynzmam.png) I am looking for general solutions to convert _many connections_ -> _many connections_ into something that's human understandable. Here's my code above:               d = DictionaryLookup[RegularExpression["[a-z]{1,5}"]];     d = Take[d, 1000];     g = {};     Do[Do[If[Abs[StringLength[d[[i]]] - StringLength[d[[j]]]] > 1,         Continue[]];       If[EditDistance[d[[i]], d[[j]]] == 1,         AppendTo[g, d[[i]] -> d[[j]]];        AppendTo[g, d[[j]] -> d[[i]]]], {j, i + 1, Length[d]}], {i, 1,        Length[d]}]          Needs["GraphUtilities`"]     s = StrongComponents[g];     sc = Last[SortBy[s, Length]];     gc = Select[g, MemberQ[sc, #[[1]]] &];     GraphPlot[gc,       EdgeRenderingFunction -> ({Orange, Arrowheads[Small],           Arrow[#1, .07]} &)]      I would love something like this, where strongly connected nodes are grouped into single pie-chart vertices which represent the # of node connections over total connections.
