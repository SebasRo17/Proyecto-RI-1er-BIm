According to this blog post: Kiln now supports repositories accessible from both Git and Mercurial > We decided that the awesome way would be to make Kiln fully bilingual. It > stores every repo in both formats. It automatically converts everything back > and forth, always. The translation is 1:1, reversible, and round-trippable. > Whatever you do to a Kiln repository using Git will be immediately visible > to Mercurial users and vice versa. I can't imagine that everything runs smoothly. What limitations does this have?
