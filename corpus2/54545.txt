In version 10 one can define, say,               $PlotTheme = "Scientific"      Which changes the appearance of all plots. This is fantastic because on the one hand, I can have nice plots very easily and globally (i.e. No need to tune every option in `Plot[...]`), and on the other hand, when I exchange code with my collaborators, they may not have Mathematica 10 and defining `$PlotTheme` is harmless for previous versions. However, none of the provided plot themes fit my need and I would need to combine some options (for example, the lines should on the one hand have colors, and on the other hand, has solid/dashed/dotted styles). Thus I wonder if it is possible to define a plot theme myself, combining a few builtin themes and specify it globally using               $PlotTheme = "myStyle"      Note: This is related to Specifying non-conflicting PlotTheme options (which focuses on changing and tuning plot theme as `PlotStyle`, etc.), and @kguler has already provided a great answer.
