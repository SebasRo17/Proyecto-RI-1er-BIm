FlashPunk is a third-party graphics API for simple game development in AS3, and they take what are effectively sprites or display objects of some sort and refer to them as "Entities". `Entity` is the actual class name, and it's the predominant class to use to animate something such as a character moving on the screen. There's a bit of a convention right now in which you refer to things like barriers, enemies, characters, etc. as "entities". So that being said, if you're using FlashPunk for your graphics, is it bad to create a base class to represent such things and name it `Entity` as well? (In particular, does this violate a widely-held coding convention?) Obviously it would be in a different package, and most people would probably separate the graphics from the game's actual state, so there's not a lot of overlap there. It's just using the same title. What about scenarios like this in general with programming? _Is there a particular convention?_
