The `Colorize` function is often used to display the results produced by `MorphologicalComponents`:               i = ImageTake[        ExampleData[{"TestImage", "Mandrill"}], {1, -1, 10}, {1, -1, 10}];     b = Binarize[i, .5];     mc = MorphologicalComponents[b];     Colorize[mc]      ![mandrill taken](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CiP97.png) The colors represent the integer index values of each foreground component, so the magenta area is 2, the black background is 0, 42 is browney-orange, 19 is violet, and - well, my question is, what is this color scheme? I'm working on images like the following, to try to understand morphological images, but a legend-type approach might be better:               Show[      ArrayPlot[mc,       Epilog -> {         MapIndexed[{Text[Style[#1, 10, Gray],             Reverse[#2 - {.5, .5}]]} &,          Reverse[mc],          {2}]}, PlotRangePadding -> 0],      Colorize[mc]      ]      ![labeled](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cjQAJ.png) # Update Thanks to stefan's amazing detective work, I've got a way to list the colors, although this isn't available until you run `Colorize` once or set up the colors another way first:               colorizeColors[n_] :=       Part[RGBColor[N@#1/256, N@#2/256, N@#3/256] & @@           Image`ColorOperationsDump`hashcolor[#1] & /@ Range[1, 100], n]     Graphics[Table[{colorizeColors[x], Rectangle[{x, 0}, {x + 1, 1}],         White, Text[x, {x + 0.5, -.5}]}, {x, 1, 30}], Background -> Black,       ImageSize -> 800]       ![colorize legend](http://i.stack.imgur.com/NoiP7.png)
