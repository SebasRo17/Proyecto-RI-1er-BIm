I am running Windows 8.1 on a ThinkPad T540P with a 3K screen, which is equivalent to Apple Retina screens. I have configured Windows to increase the magnification of the desktop to make fonts legible. When I open a CDF using CDF Player 9.0 the resulting image appears magnified, although it does not display fonts using ClearType. When the CDF is embedded in a browser window, the height and width of the tag are magnified appropriately but the CDF itself is not, appearing smaller than the embedding area. Does anyone know of a way to force the CDF plugin to use the actual rendered size of the magnified embedding area? Thanks.
