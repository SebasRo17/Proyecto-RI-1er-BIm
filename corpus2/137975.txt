I was discussing F# and Functional Programming with a friend last night and he brought up an interesting question to me. How would you do embedded software in functional? I mean this seems like a fairly natural fit in terms of stateless code but embedded also entails being very frugal with memory and I'm not sure of the story for functional in that regard. Any suggestions about languages or packages for embedded with functional?
