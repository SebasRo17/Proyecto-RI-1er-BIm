I began to code 3 different projects, and it is alright, I have done it for 5 months, some php, some c, some matlab, but for some reason I got stuck... Usually when I pass through this I leave for a while or go to sleep (and while sleeping I'm thinking on a solution to the problem IÂ´m currently facing, the most important or urgent), and usually when I return (if I slept well) I have the solution and code comes easily. I don not know what you think, but I have been stuck for around 10 consecutive days! I can't get out of the hole, I only see how time is passing... What do you do when you lose the inspiration? Some friends say Go get some air, do sports, well I have tried... I know lot of you have passed this stage but how?
