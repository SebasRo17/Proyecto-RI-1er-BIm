I've never seen this question answered definitively: If you are maintaining a COM DLL that can be used by a .NET program, is it best to:   1. Import the COM DLL into each project, which generates an Interop assembly for each project? or   2. Generate the Primary Interop Assembly with TLBIMP every time the COM DLL is compiled? or   3. Write the Primary Interop Assembly in C# and compile that every time the COM DLL is compiled? I would like to do either number 2 or number 3. Number 2 sounds compelling, but I cannot see how you set the _AssemblyTitleAttribute_ (and other such attributes); I would assume you use custom attributes in the IDL which TLBIMP would pick up.
