For pedantic reasons I want to display an infinite sum of fractions in fractional form (i.e. as 1/x not as x^(-1)) with an ellipsis at the end of the expression. I have tried a number of ways and none seem to give me what I want. For example               HoldForm[1/#^s] & /@ Table[3^n, {n, 1, 4}]     {1, %, \[Ellipsis]} // Flatten     (Plus @@ %) // TraditionalForm      gives me output ordered as: **fractional forms + ... + 1** , while StandardForm gave me **1 + ... + the fractional forms**. Other ways I tried led to similar forms - none of them yield the book form of **1 + fractions + ...** that I want. I am probably missing something simple here - Thank you for any help
