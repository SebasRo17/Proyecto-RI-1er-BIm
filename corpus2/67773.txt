Recently I begun to watch the series of lecture Douglas Crockford made on Javascript and other topics. I've been wondering: is there also such lectures/lecturers for other other languages? **EDIT:** Thanks for the few answers I'll be sure to check them. But I must say, that personally, I have an interest on languages and technology relative to web development, or any kind of video which content could apply to more than one language. Of course, any good online video resource are still welcome, as I want this question to be as useful as possible for other people. Also bonus points if the content is downloadable and viewable on iTunes.
