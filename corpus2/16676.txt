I need help in filtering long lists of `x,y` coordinates.Lets use the following list as an example:               list={{3,5},{7,6},{15,6},{23,123}}      I need to filter out all the data points for which `x<10`. Therefore once the filtering is complete the new list should be:               newlist={{15,6},{23,123}}      Please help.Thank you!
