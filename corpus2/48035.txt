When I code in _Mathematica_ , I often find myself having to repeat large chunks of code for a function to work. The latest example of this is a color changing button that prints when clicked, code shown below.               Mouseover[      Style[       Button[        Pane["Print", FrameMargins -> {{4, 4}, {4, 4}},          ImageSize -> {34, 24}],        Print["Print"],        Appearance -> None        ], Background -> Red       ],      Style[       Button[        Pane["Print", FrameMargins -> {{4, 4}, {4, 4}},          ImageSize -> {34, 24}],        Print["Print"],        Appearance -> None        ], Background -> Green       ]      ]      The only thing that is changing on the mouse over is the button color, but for this to work I need to repeat a whole chunk of code. A simpler way of doing this is to define a button color function, and then use that in the Mouseover function, code shown below.               ButtonColor[color_] :=      Style[       Button[        Pane["Print", FrameMargins -> {{4, 4}, {4, 4}},          ImageSize -> {34, 24}],        Print["Print"],        Appearance -> None        ], Background -> color       ]          Mouseover[      ButtonColor[Red],      ButtonColor[Green]      ]      This is better, but what if i only have to refer to the button color changing function for one mouse over button? Should I really have to define a function to use it for one instance? I think the ideal way to code this would be to use Table or something similar, code shown below.               Mouseover[      Table[       Style[        Button[         Pane["Print", FrameMargins -> {{4, 4}, {4, 4}},           ImageSize -> {34, 24}],         Print["Print"],         Appearance -> None         ], Background -> color        ],       {color, {Red, Green}}       ]      ]      The only problem, Table doesn't work because it creates EXTRA BRACES! Is there a better way of coding this color changing button?
