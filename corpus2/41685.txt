And so I want to solve the following equation, subject to these initial conditions: $\ u_{tt} - u_{xx} = 6u^5+(8+4a)u^3-(2+4a)u$ $\ u(0,x)=\tanh(x), u_t(0,x)=0$ When I use NDSolve to solve within the intervals $\ [0,10] \times [-5,5]$, I tried this as a code:               NDSolve[{D[u[t, x], t, t] - D[u[t, x], x, x] == 6 u[t, x]^5 + (8+4a) u[t, x]^3 - (2+4a) u[t, x], u[0, x] == Tanh[x], D[u[0, x], t] == 0}, u[t, x], {t, 0, 10}, {x, -5, 5}]      But Mathematica then returns the following line:               NDSolve::deqn: Equation or list of equations expected instead of True in the first argument      where the `True` affirmation seemingly refers to the second initial condition. What is it that I did wrong? Is there anything wrong with the code? Is there anything wrong with the problem?
