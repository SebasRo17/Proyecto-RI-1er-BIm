I need to perform a long action with a button. I tried setting the `DynamicEvaluationTimeout`, but it seems it doesn't work for me. So I want to try using several buttons to compute pieces of the whole task and here's where my problem starts: How to tell _Mathematica_ that a button should be pressed (or have its action performed) without actually pressing the button by user? Is there a way to emulate such a thing from within the code? I need to use the preemptive link, so `Method -> "Queued"` is not the solution I'm looking for.
