I'm having a problem with polynomials. Let's say I have a polynomial "2x^2 - 5x + 6 - 3x^2" .. How can I check that this expression is not simplified ? Additionally, I would like to locate the uncombined terms (2x^2 and -3x^2) and print them. I tried a lot of polynomial built-in functions, all of them simplify the expression before output.. For example,               MonomialList[2 x^2 - 5 x + 6 - 3 x^2]      > >     {-x^2, -5 x, 6} >   Is there any command to suppress automatic simplification ? Thanks.
