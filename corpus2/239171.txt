The answer to why we put private member variables in C++ headers is that the size of the class must be known at points where instances are declared so that the compiler can generate code that appropriately moves about the stack. Why do we need to put private members in headers? But is there any reason to declare private functions in the class definition? The alternative would be essentially the pimpl idiom but without the superfluous indirection. Is this language feature more than a historical error?
