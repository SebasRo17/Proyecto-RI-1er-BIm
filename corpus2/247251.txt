Suppose I have devised a new algorithm that solves a particular problem faster/better than the currently available fastest algorithm for that particular problem. By faster and better I mean, **drastically** faster in execution time and better in terms of **very less space consumed** compared to an existing algorithm. My question is that can I patent this program? Do I need a second person as a partner? More importantly, **should I patent it?**
