1. I heard developers at my office discussing Ruby language can be used for following purposes: Desktop apps,Web Apps,and may be handheld devices. Actually,we are in phase of selecting technology to have scalability of the following:   2. I have - Ruby made Desktop apps on each inventory unit of the big firm. And wish to synchronize all relevant data from those desktop apps to a web app DWarehouse like Dropbox for some ontology and mining work. And wish to have some wireless chat app also on handsets like whatsapp to assist in faster communication between inventory unit managers.   3. So,can we get a faster good build of Desktop apps,web apps and handset chat apps using ruby technology.   4. And I know ruby can't be scaled up for large workload,then what we can do later,should we get some java or php support to scale the application base or there is some cloud option present for ruby.
