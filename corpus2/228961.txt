I am currently making a simple list tool. You can click a checkbox to mark it as done and if you navigate away from the page/close the browser and reload, it will still be saved. So it's pretty much just a visual difference. For this, I'm wondering, should I use PHP or Javascript to set a cookie to save the data on whether or not the item was checked? If not, should I use `$_SESSION`? I haven't been able to find a simple solution relevant to my concern, from my searches almost all of them are related to saving usernames/passwords, which of course have an added security aspect too. Thanks.
