I want to replace the numbers on a framed plot's axes with that number multiplied by a variable, call it `x`. (The idea is that I'm plotting things which depend on some scale, and I want to show that on the axes, i.e. that I'm plotting these functions with `x` divided out.) Here's a minimal example that I've written up:               Plot[a, {a, 0, 1},        Frame -> True,        FrameTicks ->          {{Partition[Riffle[Range[0, 1, 0.2], (Range[0, 1, 1/5] /. x_Rational :> N[x]) x], 2], None},           {Automatic, None}}]      It does the trick, but the problem is that I need to adjust it each time I change the plot range. What I do is plot the function without the `FrameTicks`, see which numbers are plotted on the y-axis, and adjust the range accordingly. Is there a way to automate that process?
