The Java Community Process is meant to be just that. A process where the Java community can have its say on the future of the language. What is the best way to get involved in the JCP?

Obviously if you are domain expert with deep knowledge of a subject then you would want to get involved in a relevant JSR at a very early stage. However, what stage is the best to get involved at if you are a likely end user (as a developer) of the JSR but are not the above mentioned domain expert?
