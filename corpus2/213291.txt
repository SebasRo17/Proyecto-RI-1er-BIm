I am writing a lot of software and I feel that writing good documentation is very difficult. Since I am not aware of any structured theory about software documentation I started to organise my knowledge in this field and hope that doing this will help me to break down information in sensible units and organise documentation efficiently. First, I would like to make a complete list of relevant concepts, that I will investigate in other questions. Which concepts are useful or relevant when describing user documentation? How does these concepts interact with each other? Is there any methodology I can use to analyse my software and devise a pertinent documentation strategy? I identified the following concepts:   * _Information categories_ like recipes (“how do I…?”), _references_ (like UNIX man pages) or _expert knowledge_.   * _User role_ like normal user, power user, system administrator and any other roles that the system defines like security officer, data officer, etc.   * _Medium_ like a hardcopy manual, contextual help, editable wiki. These concepts interact one with the other and lead to a variety of questions: When is it useful to write a handbook for each role? What should go in hard copies and what in the on-line reference? When is it useful to run a wiki gathering “recipes”? With these examples, I hope I could provide a useful explanations of what I understand under “concept” and “interaction” in my questions.
