My current project is having a 'discussion' which is split down the middle- _"this story is more complex than we originally thought, we should re- estimate"_ vs _"you should never re-estimate as you only ever estimate up and never down"_. Can anyone shed some light on whether you ever should re-estimate? IMHO I'd imagine you could bring up an entirely new card for a new requirement or story, but going back and re-estimating on backlog items seems to skew the concept of relative sizing and will only ever 'inflate' your backlog.
