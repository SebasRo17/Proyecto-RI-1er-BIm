Well, does it? Is it considered bad practice? IMO, it is less readable. I hate having to scroll to the right, then back left, right, left, and so on. It makes coding more painful and confuses me sometimes. For example, anytime I am coding a long string, I will do the following...               bigLongSqlStatement = "select * from sometable st inner join anothertable at" +     "on st.id = at.id" +     "and so on..." +     "and so on..." +     "and so on..."
