I have a data set in which I need to remove all matched pairs of entries - not just the first entry that is duplicated but both entries. To add to the complexity, the pairs must be between different columns of the data set. So if I generate an example data set as follows:               SeedRandom[2]     dataSet =        Table[{DatePlus[Take[DateList[], 2], i], RandomInteger[{1, 30}],          RandomInteger[{1, 30}]}, {i, 50}];     Grid[%]      To yield a data set of:                   {      {{2014, 6, 2}, 8, 4},      {{2014, 6, 3}, 5, 4},      {{2014, 6, 4}, 7, 4},      {{2014, 6, 5}, 0, 1},      {{2014, 6, 6}, 0, 4},      {{2014, 6, 7}, 3, 7},      {{2014, 6, 8}, 3, 0},      {{2014, 6, 9}, 2, 7},      {{2014, 6, 10}, 8, 7},      {{2014, 6, 11}, 3, 6}     }      I want to remove any rows in which a value in column 2 matches a value in column 3 (please ignore the date column [[1]] as it is not relevant at the moment). If a match is found between values in column 2 and 3 then both entries should be removed. Zero entries should be ignored and left in the data set so the resultant data set would look like:               {      {{2014, 6, 2}, 8, 4},      {{2014, 6, 3}, 5, 4},      {{2014, 6, 5}, 0, 1},      {{2014, 6, 6}, 0, 4},      {{2014, 6, 8}, 3, 0},      {{2014, 6, 9}, 2, 7},      {{2014, 6, 10}, 8, 7},      {{2014, 6, 11}, 3, 6}     }      Note that the actual data set only has a non-zero entry in one of the two columns for a row but it was too difficult for me to reproduce this easily for this example data. I am unable to get DeleteDuplicates to do what I want so am stumped as to what to do. * * * * * * My apologies, it looks like my earlier edits did not stick. I'll reformat the data to remove the ambiguity (note goal posts are not moving - just additional clarification of the data). Generate example data:               SeedRandom[2]     dataSet =        Table[{Junk, RandomInteger[{0, 8}], RandomInteger[{0, 8}]}, {i,          10}];     Grid[%]               {      {Junk, 8, 4},      {Junk, 5, 4},      {Junk, 7, 4},      {Junk, 0, 1},      {Junk, 0, 4},      {Junk, 3, 7},      {Junk, 3, 0},      {Junk, 2, 7},      {Junk, 8, 7},      {Junk, 3, 6}     }      Output:               {      {Junk, 8, 4},      {Junk, 5, 4},      {Junk, 0, 1},      {Junk, 0, 4},      {Junk, 3, 0},      {Junk, 2, 7},      {Junk, 8, 7},      {Junk, 3, 6}     }      Hopefully that removes the ambiguity of the first column and enables us to concentrate on columns 2 and 3. I do apologise for the confusion. I will go through all the answers as I'm sure there are already some that demonstrate a good solution.
