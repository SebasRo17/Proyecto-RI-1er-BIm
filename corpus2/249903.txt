Perhaps I should have picked a better title, but anyway... Basically what to do with two or more implementations that have the same public interface, but they are meant for slightly different purposes having a slightly different behavior? For example let's say a proxy class that uses the same public interface of the original class but with important changes in its behavior.               interface MyTest     {         getSomething() : MySomething;     }          interface MyTestImmutable (extends MyTest ?)     {         // same interface, but in this case the following method         // is supposed to return a clone of the stored MySomething instance         getSomething() : MySomething;     }      Thanks
