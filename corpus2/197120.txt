I am developing an application which will handle many virtual stores and I would like to have many themes that the user could choose anytime. I would to know what's the main ideia to implement it. I will be developing it using Symfony 2. I was thinking about implementing own views and assets for each theme   * Resources      * views        * theme 1          * Product            * List.html           * Detail.html           * ...       * theme 2          * Product            * List.html           * Detail.html           * ...       * theme 3          * Product            * List.html           * Detail.html           * ...     * public        * theme 1 assets          * js         * css         * images         * ...       * theme 2 assets          * js         * css         * images         * ...       * theme 3 assets          * js         * css         * images         * ... And in the database each user would have own preferences(theme name, color, etc...). I am looking for an implementation which will allow me to add any kind of theme. For exemple, one theme, in main page the cart icon will go cart page and another theme, cart icon will pop up a window showing products. What's the best approach to implement multi theme web application? What I am missing?
