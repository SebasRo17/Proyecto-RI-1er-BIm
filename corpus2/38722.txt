I am trying to visualize a problem I am working on. For this, I need $n$ distinct colors which are preferably easy to distinguish. (Obviously, the higher the $n$ is, the harder it is to distinguish the colors.) I was using the `ColorData["index","ColorList"]`. However, through a crash of my procedure, I found out that the number of colors in the schemes is limited. The documentation on different `ColorList`s is not very extensive, so with simple loop I found out that the maximum number of colors in a scheme ranges from $4$ to $21$. It is however not straightforward to see how many colors are in each scheme. Note, for $n = 5$ it is not optimal to use selection of $21$ colors. For given $n$, is there a simple way to get color sheme with $n$ easy to distinguish colors?
