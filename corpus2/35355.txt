Why does               t = 2 Pi;     Plot[D[Sin[x],x], {x,0,t}] (* Plotting the derivative of Sin[x] *)      not work, but               t = 2 Pi;     Plot[Evaluate[D[Sin[x],x], {x,0,t}] (* Plotting the evaluation of the derivative of Sin[x]? *)      do? And why does this work, but neither               t = 2 Pi;     Plot[{D[Sin[x],x]}, {x,0,t}] (* Plotting the one-length array of the derivative of Sin[x] *)      nor               t = 2 Pi;     Plot[{Evaluate[D[Sin[x],x]]}, {x,0,t}] (* Plotting the one-length array of the evaluation of the derivative of Sin[x]? *)      works?
