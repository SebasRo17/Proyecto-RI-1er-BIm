I would like to hear how you manage your emails when you get lot of emails on a day basis. Here some of the things that I follow,   1. Read emails and respond for 2 hours once. I will not disturb my work for intermediate emails unless until I got the email with high priority status.   2. Even I responded the emails, I maintain the incomplete tasks in a separate folder with follow-up tag and set reminder. I could do the proper follow up.   3. Usually archiving emails every month and take a backup of them in DVD. Email size quota issue can be avoided. As well as it wont take much time to configure if you have less number of emails in your server if you have to move to the another machine/laptop.   4. Created a rule to categorize the emails based on the To address and give more attention to the emails if it is directly addressed to me only. Some of them above are not relevant or not needed for everyone. however, i feel that this is an important thing in management to have a smooth communication with higher/subordinate in any organization.
