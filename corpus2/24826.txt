I have a function which is summation of another function over different i,j iterators.               U[r] = Sum[V[r, i, j], {i, 1, 5}, {j, 6, 10}]      and `V[r, i, j]` function depends on the values of i and j (has different parameters depending on value of i & j)               If[2 <= i <= 5 &&  7 <= j <= 10,        Evaluate[vhh[i_,j_,r_] = -ehh (1 - {1 - Exp[-Ahh (ra[i, j, r] - rshh)]}^2)],        vhh = 0];     If[i == 1 &&  7 <= j <= 10,        Evaluate[vch[i_, j_, r_] = -ech (1 - {1 - Exp[-Ach (ra[i, j, r] - rsch)]}^2)],        vch = 0];     If[2 <= i <= 5 &&  j == 6,        Evaluate[vch[i_, j_, r_] = -ech (1 - {1 - Exp[-Ach (ra[i, j, r] - rsch)]}^2)],        vch = 0];     v[1, 6, r_] := -ecc (1 - {1 - Exp[-Acc (ra[1, 6, k, o] - rscc)]}^2);      And v[i,j,r] is sum of vch, vhh and vcc. so U[r] will be               U[r_]:=Sum[vhh[i_,j_,r_] + vch[i_,j_,r_]+ vcc[i_,j_,r_], {i,1,5},{j,6,10}]      (not defined Vhh or Vcc values are considered 0) The above code isn't intended to work in _Mathematica_ ; it is just pseudo-code for sake of defining my problem. I was thinking of defining three different functions, Vhh[r], Vch[r] and Vcc[r], and summing the three functions into the final function, `U`, but it doesn't work (see below error). Mathematica doesn't allow me to add 2 or more functions to a third one. Do you have any ideas how to define `U` function in _Mathematica_?               U[r_] := Vhh[r] + Vch[r] + Vcc[r]      > SetDelayed::write: Tag C in U[r_] is Protected.
