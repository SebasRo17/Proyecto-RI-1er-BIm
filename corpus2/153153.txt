I work as a iPhone app developer now, so I know a bit of c, c++ and objective c. Also have fiddled with Java and many other. All of them have been just high level application/games development. My final goal is to make a handheld game console. More like a home made NES/SNES handheld console or even an Atari. I have found out about RaspberryPI and Arduino. But I need more information about how to approach this.   1. How Do I learn to pick the best board/cpu/controller/GPU/LCD screen/LCD controller etc?    2. Will learning to make a NES emulator first help me understand this field? If so are there any tutorials?
