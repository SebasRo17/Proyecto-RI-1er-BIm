I have a ragged list               ragged = {{a,b,c,d,e},{x,y,z}}      that I would like to trim (on the right) to be rectangular. The desired result is               {{a,b,c},{x,y,z}}      It seems like this should be a one-word operation but I can't find the one word. So far the best I can do is to PadRight with Null and then delete everything with a Null in it.               Transpose[      DeleteCases[       Transpose[        PadRight[         ragged,         Automatic,         Null         ]        ],       a_ /; MemberQ[a, Null]       ]      ]      This seems way too complicated for such a simple operation. What is the simplest way to do this?
