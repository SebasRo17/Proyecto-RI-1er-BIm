Nowadays we have a lot of programming aids that make work easier, including:   * IDEs   * Debuggers (line by line, breakpoints, etc)   * Ant scripts, etc for compiling   * Sites like StackOverflow to help if you're stuck on a programming problem 20 years ago, none of these things were around. Which tools did people use to program, and how did they make do without these newer tools? I'm interested in learning more about how programming was done back then.
