I'm interested in setting up Lazy Registration on my website. Ideally, I'd like people to be able to fill out a record that might include their name, email, address, etc. and then record it to a user record later. The problem is, sometimes the person filling out that form will already have a record on the site. At that point, if they enter a new address, this will overwrite the old one if there's already a record with that e-mail address (I don't want to create duplicate records for the same e-mail). Since this is an open website, I have to ensure if someone is changing an existing record, that somehow they have to verify they are who they say they are before the record can be changed. Right now I'm not sure what the best option is for confirming that. Is it better to:   * Avoid lazy registration altogether if this is a concern, and force users to log in if the form they are entering has the potential to change an existing record   * Embed a login into the form -- so if they enter an e-mail for an existing record, it displays a login form that they have to fill out before the data is confirmed   * Pop up an Ajax-based login form while they are filling out the form, if they enter details (email, etc) that match an existing record in the database
