i am trying to workout how to solve a simple 2nd order ODE for y and y'. I can solve for y[t] as follows but how can i solve for y[t] and y'[t] ?               m = 1; g = 9.82;     sol = Flatten @         NDSolve[{y''[t] == -m g - 0.3 y'[t], y'[0] == 10, y[0] == 0,           WhenEvent[y[t] < 0, tmax = t; "StopIntegration"]},          y[t], {t, 0, 3}];     Plot[y[t] /. sol, {t, 0, tmax}]      Also the output from NDSolve is an interpolating function but how do i turn this into a function ? i.e i thought it would be something like this but that doesn't seem to work ?               g[t_]:= y[t]/. sol       Thanks David.
