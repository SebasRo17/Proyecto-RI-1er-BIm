I'm planning to take 70-515 exam and I can't find any training kit for it from MS press at the moment. Therefore, I'm reading the book for 70-562 which covers framework 3.5. I would like to know if someone has taken 70-515 exam and knows if 70-562 training kit can be helpful for the exam 70-515. Are there any resources someone might like to suggest which can help me pass this exam? I would really appreciate any help.
