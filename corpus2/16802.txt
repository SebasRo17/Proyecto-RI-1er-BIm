In an attempt to squeeze more plots and controls into the limited space for a demo UI, I am trying to remove any extra white spaces I see. I am not sure what options to use to reduce the amount of space between the ticks labels and the actual text that represent the labels on the axes. Here is a small `Plot` example using `Frame->True` (I put an outside `Frame` as well, just for illustration, it is not part of the problem here)               Framed[           Plot[Sin[x], {x, -Pi, Pi},       Frame -> True,       FrameLabel -> {{Sin[x], None}, {x,           Row[{"This is a plot of ", Sin[x]}]}},       ImagePadding -> {{55, 10}, {35, 20}},       ImageMargins -> 0,       FrameTicksStyle -> 10,       RotateLabel -> False       ],           FrameMargins -> 0      ]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/JRzf3.png) Is there an option or method to control this distance? Notice that `ImagePadding` affects distance below the frame label, and not between the frame label and the ticks. Hence changing `ImagePadding` will not help here. Depending on the plot and other things, this space can be more than it should be. The above is just a small example I made up. Here is a small part of a UI, and I think the space between the `t(sec)` and the ticks is too large. I'd like to reduce it by few pixels. I also might like to push the top label down closer to the plot by few pixels also. ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jruyf.png) I am Using V9 on windows. **update 12/22/12** Using Labeld solution by @kguler below is a good solution, one just need to be little careful with the type-sitting for the labels. `Plot` automatically typeset things as `Text` in `TraditionalFormat`, which is a nice feature. To do the same when using `Labeled` one must do this manually using `TraditionalForm` and `Text` as well. Here is example to show the difference **1)** Labeled used just with `TraditionalForm`. The left one uses `Plot` and the right one uses `Labeled` with `TraditionalForm`. Notice the difference in how labels look.               Grid[{       {             Plot[Sin[x], {x, -Pi, Pi}, Frame -> True,          FrameLabel -> {{Sin[x], None}, {x, E Tan[x] Sin[x]}},          ImageSize -> 300, FrameTicksStyle -> 10, FrameStyle -> 16,RotateLabel -> False],             Labeled[         Plot[Sin[x], {x, -Pi, Pi}, Frame -> True, ImageSize -> 300],          TraditionalForm /@ {Sin[x], x, E Tan[x] Sin[x]}, {Left, Bottom, Top},          Spacings -> {0, 0, 0}, LabelStyle -> "Panel"]        }             }, Frame -> All]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/MXRlR.png) **2)** Now we do the same, just need to add `Text` to get the same result as `Plot`.               Grid[{       {        Plot[Sin[x], {x, -Pi, Pi}, Frame -> True, FrameTicksStyle -> 10,          FrameStyle -> 16,          FrameLabel -> {{Sin[x], None}, {x, E Tan[x] Sin[x]}},          ImageSize -> 300, RotateLabel -> False],             Labeled[         Plot[Sin[x], {x, -Pi, Pi}, Frame -> True, ImageSize -> 300],          Text /@ TraditionalForm /@ {Sin[x], x, E Tan[x] Sin[x]}, {Left,           Bottom, Top}, Spacings -> {0, 0, 0}, LabelStyle -> "Panel"]        }             }, Frame -> All]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CHhZF.png) **Update 12/22/12 (2)** There is a big problem with controlling the spacing. `Labeled` spacing only seem to work for horizontal and vertical spacing, taken togother. i.e. One can't control spacing on each side of the plot separately? Here is an example, where I tried to move the bottom axes label up, this ended with moving the top label down as well. Which is not what I want.               Labeled[Plot[Sin[x], {x, -Pi, Pi}, Frame -> True, ImageSize -> 300],       Text /@ TraditionalForm /@ {Sin[x], x, E Tan[x] Sin[x]}, {Left,        Bottom, Top}, Spacings -> {-.2, -0.7}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/q0Wdo.png) Will see if there is a way to control each side spacing on its own. Trying `Spacing->{-0.2,{-0.7,0}}` does not work, it seems to take the zero in this case and ignored the `-0.7` This gives the same result as above:               Labeled[Plot[Sin[x], {x, -Pi, Pi}, Frame -> True, ImageSize -> 300],       Text /@ TraditionalForm /@ {Sin[x], x, E Tan[x] Sin[x]}, {Left,        Bottom, Top}, Spacings -> {-.2, -0.7, .0}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6JCgC.png) ps. there might be a way to specify the spacing for each side with some tricky syntax. I have not figured it out yet. Still trying thing.... http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Spacings.html **update 12/22/12 (3)** Using combination of `ImagePadding` and `Spacing` should have worked, but for some reason, the top label now is cut off. Please see screen shot.

Then label become un-chopped !
