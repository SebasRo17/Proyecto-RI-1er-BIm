A nice way to centralize various tasks in one notebook is the `NotebookEvaluation` function. For instance I can evaluate ten notebooks from a single notebook (e.g. allnotebooks.nb) like this:               NotebookEvaluation["nbpath_1.nb"]     NotebookEvaluation["nbpath_2.nb"]     ...     NotebookEvaluation["nbpath_10.nb"]      I would like to update this automatically, e.g. every six hours, but it doesnt work. My idea is to create a master notebook with the following code (here: 15 seconds):               Dynamic[NotebookEvaluate[       "C:\\Users\\myname\\Desktop\\allnotebooks.nb"],       UpdateInterval -> 15]      And it works without using dynamic. Using dynamic gives the following error: > >     An unknown box name (ToBoxes) was sent as the BoxForm for the > expression. >     Check the format rules for the expression. >   Does someone have an idea about the reason? Is `Dynamic` not an adequate function to do this? Thanks a lot for any ideas! P.S. I tested it with this code for the sub notebooks, e.g. for nbpath_1.nb:               path = "C:\\Users\\myname\\Desktop\\";     time = DateString[{"YearShort", "Month", "Day", "_", "Hour", "Minute",          "Second"}];     data = Table[RandomInteger[{1, 10}], {10}];     Export[path <> "nb1_" <> time <> ".xls", data];
