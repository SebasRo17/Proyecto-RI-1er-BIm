> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  How to get a job with no experience? So I've worked on a desktop software coding Swing GUI for past 2 years. I feel that even having a live website selling my java desktop software (customers buy it occassionally) is not enough experience, contrary to opinions from this site, very little of my experience building, running the software business is discussed during interviews. Often jobs have extensive list of qualifications which I think I can cover 70%, but I don't have example projects for each language and framework, rather I've played around with different open source libraries and build things based on what is needed. When I land interviews, sometimes I pass all the technical questions but sometimes I don't when they ask me about experience I don't have. When I do land interviews, I cannot complete the programming tasks in time. I over think the problem, and while I have done more complex problems working on my software project, I cant think quickly enough to do the testing questions fast enough. What other ways can I improve my skills to better showcase my skills? How many portfolio of projects do I need to be convincing? Should I take a course from a local college in Java?
