Suppose we have a 3D distribution of points, like the spherical ball example below :               Ball[num_]:=Table[     {         #1 Sqrt[1-#2^2]Cos[#3],         #1 Sqrt[1-#2^2]Sin[#3],         #1 #2     }          &[         Random[NormalDistribution[1, 0.5]],         Random[Real,{-1,1}],         Random[Real,{0,2Pi}]     ],{num}]          Graphics3D[{AbsolutePointSize[2],Point[Ball[10000]]},Boxed->True,BoxRatios->{1,1,1},ImageSize->800,SphericalRegion->True]      This code produces the ball shown here : ![A spherical distribution of points in 3D space](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ONB8Q.jpg) Obviously, this ball has a spherical symmetry and could be considered as a "smooth" distribution (under the limit of an infinite set of points). Now, I would like to randomly "erode" the distribution, to get something that look a bit like a fractal shape (think about how an eroded mountain could be obtain from a smooth hill). How can I do that ? What Mathematica procedures could modify the Ball distribution that act like a random eroding process ? To me, "eroding" mean _removing a randomly selected point, and several of its neighbors, then repeat the process several times_. Please, the suggestions should be compatible with **_Mathematica 7.0_**.
