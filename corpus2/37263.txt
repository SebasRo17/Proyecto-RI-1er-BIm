I've been hired to make a website and am working with a designer (who happens to be the guy who is in contact with the client and hired me, so no, I can't kick his ass out =) ) who's too afraid to touch into the php code, and is too newbie in html and css to give me good enough models, so the work of today will be going through his new html model of a half-programmed page and removing `<div>`s and changing classes and the such. Is there some kind of tool, or some better workflow in order to make this easier for both of us? Maybe I'm dealing with this the wrong way altogether, I'm new to web development, and I don't know enough HTML/CSS (and he supposedly does) to have him just give me a graphic mock-up and do the whole thing, so what we're doing is he gives me a static HTML page that looks like he wants, and I put `<?php ?>` around it =) Can anyone give me some advice on this?
