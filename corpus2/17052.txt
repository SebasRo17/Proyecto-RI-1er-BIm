I am planning to build a mobile application (a text editor based app) to primarily use with my symbian device. I have plans to make it commercial too, once its complete. Now the manufacturer (NOKIA) website lists some choices for mobile app development - java, native platform for symbian (using c) and QT. I am aware about the aspects of scaling and extending the app for other platforms. Android is increasing in it's market share like anything, symbian is losing too. Also if i need to get the platform specific functionalities (say reading the contact list or sending an sms) i should be compromising the portability. I was not able to find any comparisons between these portability and platform specific features aspects. If i chose java, i think i could easily port my application for android/iphone and make it commercial. I have no idea how portable the QT platform can be. I do not want to go by Nokia's suggestions since i doubt they are biased to their products(even if they provide excellent developer support) I have to start learning from the beginning, irrespective of whichever platform i chose (except languages) Please advice me if i have assumed something wrong, and your opinion about portability versus platform features. Thanks,   Abhi
