Occasionally while typing something up that relates to a case-sensitive programming language I end up starting a sentence with a function name. Now the rules of English state that the first word in a sentence needs to be capitalized; the function name is lowercase, though. If you are wondering what could I be saying that would result in the first word being a function name, take this example: > Your fread implementation is broken. fread needs to return how many bytes > were read. I understand that I could change the second instance of _fread_ to _It_ but I want to know the best way of handling this other than just rewriting the sentence. Should I capitalize the function name? The only way I would like to hear "rewrite the sentence" as an answer is if starting the sentence with a function name violates some English rule that I am not aware of. Edit: I really thank everyone for these answers. They have changed and improved my insight into the issue. I have learned quite a bit from this. I am very surprised that I did not think of these simple but good solutions. I do think my stance on alternating the sentence was too tough and now I realize due to these good answers that overall altering the sentence appears to be the best option for dealing with these cases be it adding parenthesis after the function or saying The function before the function name and if available using formatting for the function name.
