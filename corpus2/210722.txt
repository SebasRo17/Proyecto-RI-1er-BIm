Android source code and many Android open-source apps and libs use m prefix for member fields and s prefix for static member fields:               private static boolean sStarted;     private long mTimestamp;      I personally dislike this, because it looks ugly and it's redundant â€“ my IDE already uses different color and formatting for local, member and static member variables. What's closest to truth?   1. It's a good practice.   2. It's a bad practice but you should use it anyway in order to be consistent with the majority of Android code out there.   3. It's a bad practice and you shouldn't use it.
