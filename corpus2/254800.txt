I have a basic grasp of accepting clients without creating a thread for each connection using tools such as `select` and modern equivalents (kqueue, epoll). But where do I go from here? e.g async I/O and (periodic) timers. I could crack open the source to libev and friends but that's a little overwhelming to me to say the least. I've looked around for textbooks on this subject but didn't come up with anything useful. The basic objective is to write a small _toy_ implementation of an evented library with timers and async I/O. Just for getting a better grasp on the subjects. _I'm not looking to reinvent the wheel. This is solely for learning/educational purposes. (not homework either)_
