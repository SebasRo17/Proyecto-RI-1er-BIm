I'm learning about REST and had the chance to build a basic REST API. After doing so, most of the material I read was internalized and I now have a better understanding of it. However, I do not see any real difference yet as to the **tangible** benefits of using REST over the old way I was doing things, which was simple URL query strings. It seems they both do the exact same things. But with REST, it's cleaner, and standardized. I thought REST had additional technical benefits. If they do, what are they? Or is REST simply that - an agreed way to implement and API?
