Understanding what a pointer (an address) is, is fairly easy and an eleven- year old can understand it. But how do we express why we have a need for a pointer to a pointer? what is a very pedagogical example? Does it extend to pointing to a pointer to a pointer (and/or onward)? ## Example problem > T[][] does not decay to a T** ## Example problem 2               brainfuck command   C equivalent     (Program Start) char array[30000];                     char *ptr=array;     >   ++ptr;     <   --ptr;     +   ++*ptr;     -   --*ptr;     .   putchar(*ptr);     ,   *ptr=getchar();     [   while (*ptr) {     ]   }
