Suppose I use `FileNames` to get a list of file names. I know that it's possible to make a hyperlink using this kind of pattern....               Cell[TextData[ButtonBox["Link Label", BaseStyle->"Hyperlink",                    ButtonData->{FrontEnd`FileName[{"Folder names"}, "FileName.nb",                                   CharacterEncoding -> "UTF-8"], None}]],         "Text"]      I would appreciate help with taking a list of file names and writing them as working hyperlinks in a specified notebook. To be clear, I'd like the hyperlink to open the file referred to by the hyperlink. I tried taking a file path, splitting it to get the parts, using that for the folder structure and the file name, but couldn't get it to work.
