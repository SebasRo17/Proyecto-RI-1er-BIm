I have adopted some jQuery code that has like 20 event-captures that look like this                 // used on menu#edit       $('.show-headers-only-toggle').on('click',function(){         arc_eh.menu_edit.show_headers_only_toggle.call(this);       });      that call a method that does the functionality. This is the only place that this method is called. I want to put the functionality after the event like this since I think there's no reason to have this other method. The argument for having it in a method is that I'm polluting this space and the event handling is like a router and this is a controller. I feel like this is bikeshedding and we're not using a framework so it's just simpler to have all in place. Who do you feel is wrong in this? I feel they are bikeshedding this.                 // used on menu#edit       $('.show-headers-only-toggle').on('click',function(){         var action=$(this).attr('arc-action');         // this would just be what is in the function above         if(action=='hide-items'){           $('.menu-item-admin').hide();           $(this).text('show items');           $(this).attr('arc-action','show-items');         }else{           $(this).text('show headers only');           $('.menu-item-admin').show();           $(this).attr('arc-action','hide-items');         }       });
