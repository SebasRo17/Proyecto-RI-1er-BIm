Folks, first time on CodeReview - just looking for some input in creating some automation in CakePHP, wondering if this is best used a component or a behavior. It's model driven but involves logic and processing. Here's the scoop: The app I'm creating requires the user to be notified when a model meets certain conditions - additionally data in the affected model or a related model might need to be changed. For example, if a customer model is saved with a certain state/province, assign that customer to a sales rep (by changing a relational field) and notify them through a Growl or an Email. So it's data driven, for sure, suggesting behavior, presumably afterSave() But it also requires logic and other utilities not typically used in the model or behavior (email, for example and Session/system configuration/user preferences) - functionality typically found in a controller/component and not readily available to a model or behavior. So is this best developed as a behavior or a component? Any tips on how to approach by Cake Guru's this would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.
