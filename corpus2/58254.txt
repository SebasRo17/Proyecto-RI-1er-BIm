I have a program running for some time at one computer. Today, unintentionally, I edited the program file from another computer (I use Dropbox), and the program kept running. Trying to correct my mistake, I deleted the program file, and, from the computer it was running, saved it again. My question is: have I ruined the evaluation? Should I start over or Mathematica can deal with such situation? My concern is that I do not know how long the evaluation will take, and it can be some months. Thanks in advance
