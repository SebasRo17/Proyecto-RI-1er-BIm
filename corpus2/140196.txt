At now I mainly create a mail account separately (with different domain name eg.noreply@example.com) and i add this mail as one return path. So the bounce message will only go to that mailbox and i parse the mail message one by one to check the failure receipent and the error code, then i convert the error code to the actual error message. Finally, the error message and the fail receipent's mail are post to my system and let my system user check the bounce information. Is it a common practice? Since i am worry about the mail other from bounce message have sent to my mail box, that would be a disaster if i parse them without filter them out, but how can i filter out between bounce message and normal mail? Thank you for any kind of help.
