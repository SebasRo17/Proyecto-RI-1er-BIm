`TraditionalForm[]` does a great job generally speaking, with complex equations like the following,               TraditionalForm[        Defer[          1/Pi =           2*Sum[((-1)^k*(6*k)!*(13591409 + 545140134*k))/((3*k)!*k!^3*640320^(3*k + 3/2)), {k, 0, 44}]        ]     ]      (which is to sayâ€¦) ![pretty equation](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ExGzu.png) However, if I put this same equation in a `Grid[]` or `Table[]` or `Column[]`, it gets "squished," as in the following ![squished](http://i.stack.imgur.com/N3jTW.png) How can I prevent this from happening? I particularly want to prevent it from swinging the upper bound of the summation to the right of the sigma.
