I am starting a software project that I want to have the option to keep it proprietary. However, since I generally use a Linux environment, I want to know: How do people write proprietary software in Linux and not violate the GPL/LGPL/etc licenses that seem to restrict uses of libraries needed to build the project? Also, does using an unmodified LGPL library in my code require releasing it as open-source (I understand that open-source and proprietary are different beasts)? And I know I'm going to be branded a heathen for asking, but can I use unmodified open-source libraries in my project but still keep the code that is mine closed-source?
