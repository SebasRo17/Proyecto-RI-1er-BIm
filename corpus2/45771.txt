So I define a 3-variable function $h$ and I want to find the maximum of $h$ in a region $\mathcal{R}$:               h[x_, y_, z_] := y (a - z) - z (a - t) + (y + x) (Max[0, b - (y - z)] - x + 1)     Maximize[{h[x, y, z], 0 <= z <= t, z <= y <= a, 0 <= x <= Max[0, b - (y - z)]}, {x, y, z}]      Here I'm treating $a,b,t$ as constants. Shouldn't Mathematica return the maximum of $h$ as a function of $a,b,t$?
