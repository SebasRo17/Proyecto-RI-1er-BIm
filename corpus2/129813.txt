I am going to try CGI scripting for implementing a web based Graphical User Interface on an embedded device. What advantages does LUA scripting have over shell scripting or C for implementing dynamic HTML files? Which one do you think is easy-to-use from developer's perspective. My GUI will comprise of some form based HTML pages. Some times, I would like a C program to run corresponding to an action performed on the GUI and then display result of the program to the user on GUI. Will shell scripting suffice in such a scenario or will I 'have to' use LUA? I have some experience with shell scripting actually.
