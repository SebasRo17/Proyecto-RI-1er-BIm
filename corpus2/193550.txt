using (SqlConnection con = db.con(user.Authority))     {         string command = "[Dashboard_GetUserPTOAndIncidentTotals] ";         using (SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(command, con))         {             cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@UserName", cboIncidentsActiveDirectory.Text.Trim());             // Display the selected users information             con.Open();                  using (SqlDataReader dr = cmd.ExecuteReader())             {                 if (dr.HasRows)                 {                     while (dr.Read())                     {                         nudPTO.Value = Convert.ToDecimal(dr["PTO_REMAINING"]);                         nudIncidents.Value = Convert.ToDecimal(dr["TOTAL_INCIDENTS"]);                     }                 }                 else                 {                     nudPTO.Value = 0;                     nudIncidents.Value = 0;                 }                 dr.Close();             }         }     }      I am writing a business application to help track the remaining PTO time and incidents for our employees, however, I am running into an issue with the parameters of my code. I initially started out with an embedded SQL statement in place of [Dashboard_GetUserPTOAndIncidentTotals], which worked perfectly, however, after finishing the base code I was asked to migrate all application statements to stored procedures on the server side. After this transition I have ran into multiple issues and this is the only one I can't seem to work out. Every time I run this code, it throws this error message "Procedure or function 'Dashboard_GetUserPTOAndIncidentTotals' expects parameter '@UserName', which was not supplied". This error occurs on this line :                using (SqlDataReader dr = cmd.ExecuteReader())      I'm confused because to the best of my knowledge, I am supplying the requested parameter here :               cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@UserName", cboIncidentsActiveDirectory.Text.Trim());      Am I just setting this up incorrectly, or does something additional just have to be done to correctly instantiate the datareader object with my stored procedure?
