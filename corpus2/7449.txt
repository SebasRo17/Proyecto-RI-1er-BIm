I have two ArrayPlots, and I want to overlap them as it is done here. For clarity, suppose               Array1 = RandomReal[{0, 1}, {3, 2}];      Array2 = RandomReal[{0, 1}, {3, 2}];      and the first `ArrayPlot` uses `ColorFunction -> (Blend[{White,Yellow},#]&)`, and the second uses `ColorFunction -> (Blend[{White,Blue},#]&)`. I'd like to combine them in such a way I end up with an ArrayPlot with White, Yellow, Blue and Green shades. Thanks for your attention.
