I recently started working with Unity3D and primarily scripting with C#. As, I normally program in Java, the differences aren't too great but I still referred to a crash course just to make sure I am on the right track. However, My biggest curiosity with C# is that is capitalises the first letter its method names (eg. java: getPrime() C#: GetPrime() aka: Pascal Case?). Is there a good reason for this? I understand from the crash course page that I read that apparently it's convention for .Net and I have no way of ever changing it, but I am curious to hear why it was done like this as opposed to the normal (relative?) camel case that, say, Java uses. Note: I understand that languages have their own coding conventions (python methods are all lower case which also applies in this question) but I've never really understood why it isn't formalised into a standard.
