Say I have a class `workStockItem`, that I wish to serialize. Which is the better style?   1. using a static method  or   2. using a non-static method (maybe even implemented as a property as seen below) Example implementations:               internal static byte[] serialiaze(workStockItem toSer)         {             IFormatter formatter = new BinaryFormatter();             MemoryStream stream = new MemoryStream();             formatter.Serialize(stream, toSer);             return stream.ToArray();         }          internal byte[] binaryRepresentation         {             get             {                 IFormatter formatter = new BinaryFormatter();                 MemoryStream stream = new MemoryStream();                 formatter.Serialize(stream, this);                 return stream.ToArray();             }         }      Again:   Which is better style and why?
