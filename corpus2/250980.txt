The problem I have might seem trivial for some of you but in general I have a question about all those "free" software licenses (mainly for PHP libraries). Let's assume that I want to create project for end-user and I want to sell it to them and if possible encrypt my source code. For example for Zend Framework licence is New BSD License and for Laravel it's MIT license. On Zend framework there is such short info: > Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this > list of conditions and the following disclaimer. > > Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, > this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation > and/or other materials provided with the distribution. but it means nothing for me. What does it mean the first one? Should I simple download Zend Framework and put in directory and when I don't do anything with it I can forget about it or maybe I should tell my client that I used framework and my software may not working because > THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS" > AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES ... I really don't understand how those licenses work and what are differences between those licenses. Could you provide me some help or external resources where this issue is explained in a simple way?
