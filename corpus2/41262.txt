I tried to run a large scale linear programming with mathematica. I entered the code below:               Import["A,B.mat", "LabeledData"]     x = LinearProgramming[{0, 0, -1}, A, B, {{-1, 100}, {0, 100}, {0, 100}}];     c.x      where A, B are two large scale matrices. {{-1, 100}, {0, 100}, {0, 100}} are bounds of variabels of linear programming. The code doesn't work and I think there is sth wrong with importing matrices `A` and `B`. How can I fix that? **Edit** : Data file access from here
