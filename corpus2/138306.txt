I'm trying to build a winform so I can play a web based game and have some other little utilities on the side. I do not plan on ever selling this or even distributing it to more than a handful of people. My question is, Would I be infringing on any copyright laws if I use images from the game in my client? I just want to be safe on the off chance the company does see it, I don't want to get sued. Edit: I took a screenshot from the game and cropped out the icons for each skill that I will use as a link to skill guides, calculators, etc. Also, I should note that I live in America and the company is based in the UK. I don't know if that affects anything or not.
