is doing the following possible in C# (or in any other language) **1.** I am fetching data from a database. At run time i can compute the no. of columns and data types of the columns fetched. **2.** Next i want to "generate" a class with these data types as fields. I also want to store all the records that i fetch in a collection.               The problem is that i wanna do both step **1** and **2** at runt ime      is this possible ? I am using C# currently but i can shift to something else if i need to.
