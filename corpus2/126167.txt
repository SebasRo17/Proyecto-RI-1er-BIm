In Java, the following code does not compile:               int val = 1;     short shortVal = val;  // Incompatible types      Anyone know why Java chooses to complain about this assignment, instead of simply truncating, when an integer Ã— integer is also likely to overflow? To illustrate:               int val = 46340;     int result = val * val;                    // 2147395600     System.out.println(result);     int overflowVal = 46341;     int result2 = overflowVal * overflowVal;   // -2147479015     System.out.println("Quietly overflowed: " + result2);
