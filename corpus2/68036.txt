What do you do when the person youâ€™re helping is your senior, do you continue to help them? I've seen this happen at a previous job. A senior developer lost touch and was having trouble with the basics. He'd got lazy over years and was accustomed to loading work on the juniors. Restructuring meant that senior now had to work hard for the money. What do you do? Help or expect more from them. **EDIT:** Myself and the other seniors did help and the juniors. But the senior developer was accustom to delegating and many felt the senior developer in question just was trying to get others do their work. I was asking the question in reference to reading: When do you not give help to less experienced programmers? Basically when should you draw a line in the sand.
