In several articles and books I learnt that "V-model introduced QA into SW development". I would like to understand the point of such statement, as from my understanding, V model activities (verification and validation) cannot be considered as QA as both deal directly with product control, no matter if it's static (verification) or dynamic (validation). I would agree that testing (say V&V) is a tool used by QA to measure the quality, but how does it assure it? Examples in Google Books:   _"Real-Time Systems Design and Analysis: Tools for the Practitioner"._ " **..these QA activities form the heart of the V model...** "   or   _Iterative Software Engineering for Multiagent Systems: The MASSIVE..:_ **the V-Model adds explicit quality assurance mechanisms to the Waterfall model: verification is concerned...**
