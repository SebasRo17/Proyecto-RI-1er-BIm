I’m a self-taught SQL developer that has worked for small to mid-sized companies. Most of my experience has been writing SQL statements for reporting, data scrubs, and never in a formalized IT department. For my last job I planned and executed a full migration and wrote all of the new business processes and trained end-users. For the most part I’m used to being the expert when it comes to developing database solutions, but this is only because no one in the room ever knew anything about databases. Now I’m working with a team of developers as an SSIS interface developer. For the most part it’s not rocket science but I’m finding it hard to get up to speed. There is a lot going on in the database and the packages are we’re developing are pretty complicated. I have spent much of my first month studying the system rather than coding. Is this normal? If so how long will it be before I’m being productive and contributing in a meaningful way. I’m used to hitting the ground running and being able to contribute from the get-go. How long does it usually take to bring a new hire up to speed?
