Asynchronous programming seems to be getting quite popular these days. One of the most quoted advantages is performance gain from removing operations that block threads. But I also saw people saying that the advantage is not that great. And that properly configured thread pool can have same effect as fully asynchronous code. My question is, are there any real benchmarks that compare blocking vs. asynchronous code? It can be any language, but I think C# and Java would be most representative. Not sure how good would this benchmark be with Node.js or similar. **Edit** : My attempt at general question combined with unclear terminology seems to have failed. By "asynchronous code" I mean what some answers described as event or callback programming. In the final result, operations that would block thread are instead delegated to some callback system so threads can be utilized better. And if I wanted to ask specific question : _Are there any benchmarks that compare throughput/latency gain of async/await server code in .NET? Or any other similar comparison?_
