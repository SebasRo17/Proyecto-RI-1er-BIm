A while ago I asked this question, I got very nice results but now I have a similar situation, but I'm looking for advices and I want to know if you think is possible to tell if you want a developer only with a phone interview. Let's say that you need to perform an interview to a candidate which is not on your country, so in case you'd hire him/her you'd have to provide a relocation package, wait for him/her to get the whole work permit in order and all those stuff, so you'd need to make sure that this person is quite worth it. Let's say that the candidate is applying for a junior developer position as a C#/ASP.NET developer with a small / medium software development company.   * Can you tell in a phone interview if you'd like the candidate?   * Any recomendations for the candidate to impress the interviewer?
