I have an authentication system(ASP.Net library) that I want to make sure is secure. What companies/resources can I use to make sure of this? Also, what should I make sure to do before sending it off to be "broken"? A bit more background: Basically, I'm wanting to make a little bit of money by selling this system, but I don't have a whole lot to invest in it(USD $100-$200). I'm wanting to make sure I'm selling something secure, and that buyers know it's secure. I personally have looked over the code multiple times just staring trying to find a security flaw and cannot find one. This is of course not to say there isn't one. This is where I want to pay someone to come in and look at my code and how it all works and basically tell me if it's secure or not
