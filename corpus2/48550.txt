I am wondering how to compare the different values of `ω` I derived in this code, and place them in order as follows. (use `Print` or something?) I would like to have `ω` placed in order in the output, instead of the values of `ω`. > $$\omega_{11} < \omega_{22} < \omega_2 < \omega_1$$ I would like to have `ω` placed in order in the output, instead of the values of `ω`.               Remove["Global`*"]          x1[t_] = A1 E^(I ω t);     x2[t_] = A2 E^(I ω t);          eqn1 = m x1''[t] + 2 k x1[t] - k x2[t] == 0 /. t -> 0;     eqn2 = m x2''[t] - k x1[t] + k x2[t] == 0 /. t -> 0;          org = k/m SparseArray[{{1, 1}, {1, 2}, {2, 1}, {2, 2}} -> {2, -1, -1, 1}];          eigena = Sqrt[org // Eigenvalues];          "The charactersitic frequencies are: "     Column[Subscript[ω, #] & /@ Range@2 == eigena // Thread,       Spacings -> 2]     For[i = 1, i < 3, i++, Subscript[ω, i] = eigena[[i]]]          "When the upper mass m1 is fixed, x1[t]=0, for all t values"          eqn11 = x2''[t] == -k/m x2[t];          "Just by observation, the frequency is:"          Subscript[ω, 11] == Sqrt[k/m]     Subscript[ω, 11] = Sqrt[k/m];          "When the upper mass m2 is fixed, x2[t]=0, for all t values"          eqn22 = x1''[t] == -2 k/m x1[t];          "Just by observation, the frequency is:"          Subscript[ω, 22] == Sqrt[2 k/m]     Subscript[ω, 22] = Sqrt[2 k/m];               Sort[{Subscript[ω, 1], Subscript[ω, 2], Subscript[ω, 11], Subscript[ω, 22]}             ] /. k -> 1 /. m -> 1
