I'm trying to use the ANOVA package and have mathematica display the Tukey PostTest, but all I get is this:               ANOVA[Tratamientos, PostTests -> Tukey]          ANOVA::nottest: Tukey is not a valid PostTests entry, and will be ignored. Valid PostTests entries are Bonferroni, Tukey, StudentNewmanKeuls, Duncan, and Dunnett. >>      Any advice? Am I missing something? Thanks in advance
