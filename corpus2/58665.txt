Is it possible in Wolfram Mathematica to transform output of BSplineFunction so it returns results in cartesian coordinates not in parametric representation? * * * Thank you for your responce. I should have clarified the question better. The question is: can I find coordinates that corespond to a given value of function. For example, I have F(x,y,z,k). Let's say that substitution of several points such as (x1,y1,z1,k1),(x2,y2,z2,k2),(x3,y3,z3,k3),...,(xn,yn,zn,kn) gives the same value of fucntion F: F(x1,y1,z1,k1)=F(x2,y2,z2,k2)=...=F(xn,yn,zn,kn). I need to know all these points (x1,y1,z1,k1)... in cartesian coordinate system.
