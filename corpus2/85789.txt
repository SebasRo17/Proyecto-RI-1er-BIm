When tuning performance in a web application, I am looking for good and light- weight performance profiling tools to measure the execution time for each method. I know that the easiest profiling method is to log the start time and end time for each method, but I see more and more people using AOP to profile (add @profiled before each method). What's the benefit of AOP profiling compared to the common "log" way? Thanks in advance Vance
