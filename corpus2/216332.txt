A `class` has a `trait`. The `class` is expected to call a function provided by the `trait` during a certain `method` invocation. How do I write a `unit test` to ensure that that happens? The difficulty, to me, comes from the fact that a `trait` is part of the `class definition`, so I cannot mock the trait in the test, as I could if the `trait` was instead an `object` that was passed in to the `class` constructor.
