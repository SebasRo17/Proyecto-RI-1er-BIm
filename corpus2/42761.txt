I'm a beginner with Mathematica, so this may seem like a simple question, though it's got me totally stumped. I'm trying to display several polygons and have the color of each polygon depend on the value in some other variable (`stscds`). My thinking is that I should do something like this: `Show[Graphics[Table[{RGBColor[stscds[[i]],0,0,0.2],EdgeForm[Black],poly[[i]]}, {i,1,300,1}]]]` `poly` contains all of the polygons. Or possibly this: `megapol = Table[{RGBColor[stscds[[i]],0,0,0.2],EdgeForm[Black],poly[[i]]}, {i,1,300,1}] Graphics[megapol]` It doesn't like that I'm trying to pull the color parameter out of `stscds` (this variable is full of values between 1 and zero). It says 'Ignoring invalid graphics directive RGBColor[0,01 1,0,0]. Any idea how I might approach this problem? Edit: Output of `stscds`: `{("1")/100, ("1")/100, ("1")/100, ("1")/100, ("1")/100, ("1")/100, \ ("1")/100, ("1")/100, ("1")/100, ("2")/100, ("2")/100, ("2")/100, \ ("2")/100, ("2")/100, ("2")/100, ("3")/100, ("4")/100, ("4")/100, \ ("4")/100, ("4")/100, ("4")/100, ("4")/100,....`
