When using the following manipulate I can rotate the plot and manipulate the value without my view point changing;               Manipulate[Plot3D[Sin[a*x + y^2], {x, -3, 3}, {y, -2, 2}], {a, 1, 5}]      If I rotate one of these plot in the following manipulate the value the view point changes back to the default.               Manipulate[GraphicsRow     [{Plot3D[Sin[a*x + y^2], {x, -3, 3}, {y, -2, 2}],     Plot3D[Sin[a*x + y^2], {x, -3, 3}, {y, -2, 2}]}],      {a, 1, 5}]      I have a much more complex plot that contains a GraphgicsRow and a Column and I want it to keep the view point of the plot while I manipulate it. Is there a simple way to do this? Is the problem the GraphicsRow or is that just a coincidence? Thanks.
