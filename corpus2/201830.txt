Most issue trackers are targeted towards developers. But when working in a small team that includes business people: does it makes sense for them to put non-dev issues inside the tracker? I must say I have never heard of that combination. In my full-time job the business things are done somewhere else. But in a startup where you have limited cash, why not put business todos and dev todos in the same tracker?
