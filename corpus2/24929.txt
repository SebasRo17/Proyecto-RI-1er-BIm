When a list of `PlotStyle`s is given, `ListPlot` behaves as expected when there are multiple things to plot:               ListPlot[{RandomReal[{-1, 1}, 100], 2 RandomReal[{-1, 1}, 100]}, PlotStyle -> {Red, Green, Blue}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BQwqv.png) When there's only one thing to plot, it chooses the _last_ `PlotStyle` instead of the first one.               ListPlot[RandomReal[{-1, 1}, 100], PlotStyle -> {Red, Green, Blue}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4uXAE.png) Enclosing the single thing to be plotted in `{}` appears to cause things to behave as expected.               ListPlot[{RandomReal[{-1, 1}, 100]}, PlotStyle -> {Red, Green, Blue}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fWLQZ.png) `Plot` shows the same behavior. This does not appear to happen with the default `PlotStyle`s, but it does happen if you modify the default styles using this kind of technique. Why is a single plot argument treated as a special case? Can this behavior be changed?
