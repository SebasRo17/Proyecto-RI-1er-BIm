I am talking of stuff related to programming only and not system or network administration. I am about to finish college and get a programming job, so I am interested to know about this. Although this may seem a subjective question, I think this is not quite and falls in the category of best practices. I don't think a programmer can know everything about OS he works on, all the APIs of the framework he works on, all the features and quirks of the languages he works with, all the data structures and algorithms, all the settings for his compiler, linker, IDE etc. I don't think it is practical either. Or can he? The usual answer is "most". What is this most? If you were to interview a programmer with about 5 years experience, what would you expect him to know? Or lets say if you were to attend an interview and you have about 10 years experience behind you, what would you brush up on?
