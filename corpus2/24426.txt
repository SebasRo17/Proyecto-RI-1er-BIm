In attempting to answer this question from @Cam on `BubbleCharts` with elliptical bubbles, I suggested using separate `ChartElements` which themselves could be ellipses. My idea was to define them as regular graphics objects and use them like this:               datatoplot = {{1, 2, 0.5, 0.7}, {10, 5, 10, 0.2}};     ellipse[v_] := Disk[{v[[1]], v[[2]]}, {v[[3]]/10, v[[4]]/10}];     ce = Graphics[Style[ellipse[#], Blue]] & /@ datatoplot;     Show[BubbleChart[{datatoplot[[;; , ;; 3]][[#]]},ChartElements->ce[[#]]]&/@{1,2}, PlotRange -> All]      However, while the objects I've called `ce` above are indeed ellipses, they get rescaled when they are used as ChartElements and their ellipsicity is undone (or at least altered). It seems in the help section for `ChartElements` that the format to define the width and height is to give               ChartElements->{g,{w,h}}      but this gives an error message when I try and implement it naively (with an arbitrary scaling of `{0.3,0.6}`). Trying it by hand:               Show[BubbleChart[{datatoplot[[;; , ;; 3]][[#]]},ChartElements -> {ce[[#]], {0.3, 0.6}}]&/@{1,2}, PlotRange -> All]      gives me the error shown here: ![error message](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3KZ7N.png) Does anyone know how to correctly implement the scaling for `ChartElements`? Is it that the elements should somehow be different from regular Graphics objects?
