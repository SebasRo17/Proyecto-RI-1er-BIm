I have worked on few projects in which both AOP and Object oriented paradigm were used. But, AOP usage was limited to logging only. I think AOP is a much more powerful technique. My question, to those who have worked with both AOP and OOP paradigm in projects, is, how do they come up with a solution, combining these powerful paradigms. Do they think AOPwise first and then design objects or vice versa. My general question to those who have used AOP extensively is, whether they find it a powerful modularizing technique. If yes, please quote examples.
