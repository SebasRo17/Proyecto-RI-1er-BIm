I am trying to make a CDF application that takes the user's system information (screen information) and adjusts the size of the application to give a seamless experience over different screens with widely varying display properties. Below is the code I tried. It should have worked, but it doesn't. I am very confused. The CDF is intended to be deployed in Player Pro/Mathematica.               CDFDeploy[SystemDialogInput["FileSave"],           CreateDocument[(Column[{Dynamic[CurrentValue["WindowSize"]],               Panel[GraphicsGrid[ConstantArray[1, {48, 78}],                                 ImageSize -> {800, 500},                                 Background -> RGBColor[.745, .886,.1],                                 Alignment -> {Left,Top},                                 ItemAspectRatio -> 1                                ](*GraphicsGrid is Closed*),                     Background -> Gray,                    Alignment ->{Center, Center}                    ](*Panel is Closed*)             }])(*Column is Closed*),              WindowSize ->Dynamic[{Round[N[((780/96)*SystemInformation["Devices","ScreenInformation"][[1, 4, 2]])]],                                        Round[N[((780/96)*SystemInformation["Devices","ScreenInformation"][[1, 4, 2]])]]}]         ](*CreateDocument is Closed*)     ](*CdfDeploy is closed*)
