After taking a class about information systems, I want to find additional resources for learning the various patterns, concepts, and examples of their implementation. The course did focus on Martin Fowler's Principles of Enterprise Application Architecture and had a project that attempted to implement some of them. Basically, where can I learn more about Information System design and implementation?
