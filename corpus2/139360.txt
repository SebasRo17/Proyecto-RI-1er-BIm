I just started managing a small team of developers for my company and I would like to give them access to a library of books that would help them improve their skills. Before I buy a bookshelf worth of books I was wondering if anyone was aware of any services that would fill this need. Something that anyone with an account could log into and get access to the latest books on programming and software development. Ideally, something like a shared kindle account, but would be happy to hear about other experiences or ideas that would also help fit my need. Or even if you think I am dreaming and should just shell out some money for the books.
