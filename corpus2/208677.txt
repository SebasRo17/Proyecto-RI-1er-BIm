I'm in the middle of developing a new programming language to solve some business requirements, and this language is targeted at novice users. So there is no support for exception handling in the language, and I wouldn't expect them to use it even if I added it. I've reached the point where I have to implement the divide operator, and I'm wondering how to best handle a divide by zero error? I seem to have only three possible ways to handle this case.   1. Ignore the error and produce `0` as the result. Logging a warning if possible.   2. Add `NaN` as a possible value for numbers, but that raises questions about how to handle `NaN` values in other areas of the language.   3. Terminate the execution of the program and report to the user a severe error occurred. Option #1 seems the only reasonable solution. Option #3 is not practical as this language will be used to run logic as a nightly cron. What are my alternatives to handling a divide by zero error, and what are the risks with going with option #1.
