Before I'd read this article, I never understood why anybody liked LISP. After reading it, I was able to give LISP a fair enough shot and have since grown to like it. It wasn't until I read this that I began to understand why some people cared about TCL. I need an equivalent for Ruby. I can read the code. I've written a trivial amount of it. I've seen Rails. Yes, everything is an object... yes, the syntax is novel... I still don't understand why folks are so enamored with it.
