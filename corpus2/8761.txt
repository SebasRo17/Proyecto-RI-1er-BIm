I guess my programming working style is not unique. I develop programs one cell at a time, and when I have some confidence about what I did, I put all my mess together refining the code, building up functions from nailed constructs, scoping variables, etc. That usually means being on a dirt road most of the time: evaluating a lot of cells, inspecting FullForms, checking different conditions, clicking the `|Show More|` button, etc. Before I perform any action on my ongoing `.nb` I _should_ save my work in advance.   But alas! My mind is weak, my memory fades and my feeble fingers are too quick for my tired eyes.   So, when I press `Shift-Enter` or `|Show More|` and my Front End hangs, I remember Michael Douglas' D-FENS character in "Falling Down" with utmost sympathy. I would like an automatic way to save _my input cells_ (not the output ones, as they could be really large) in a backup .nb file before and every time any computation is requested. How? PS:   I must confess, my FrontEnd-fu is still in its teens.   I _think_ `$pre` could be set to the desired command, but I don't know how to select only the input cells and save them programmatically.
