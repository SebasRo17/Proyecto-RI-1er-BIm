`Dcpromo.exe` is famous among MCSEs for being they only way to create a Windows Domain Controller (in other words an Active Directory Domain) ... which in turn is often used by the ASP.NET Membership system. I'm trying to determine if I should put content on "www.dcpromo.com" geared for developers or more towards sysadmins. To me, a logical extension of this "domain controller on the internet" is to use WIF for the ASP.NET Membership system. We'd then have a website that will serve the developer's interests in the SSO, SAML, user managment and identity areas we all struggle with. So my question is: **Q:** Do programmers see a connection between the utility `dcpromo.exe` and ASP.NET Membership? If so does it make sense to have a purpose of http://www.dcpromo.com help developers in the areas of membership and cloud computing?
