Inspired by this question, I have looked into user groups within my area in England, and there does not seem to be one at all for a few hundred miles. I would like to look into the possibility of setting one up in a local city, but I have no idea what the format should be. My questions are: What is the purpose of a user group? Is it to simply network or are there expectations for presentations, informal learning, etc? How and where does one promote a user group? Is it run as a free enterprise or is there usually a charge to allow for investment back into the meetings? Thanks.
