I am doing a restful web api with asp.net Web API 2 I do not want to use any form of cookies or basic authentication (send user/pass in cleartext thus SSL needed) I do not use/need claims stuff. I have not decided yet about asp.net self hosting or IIS. I just want to send an encrypted token between client server via SSL. I am using Entity framework 6, .NET 4.5.1 and I just want to do CRUD-actions on my user table. Not more. What is the project template/library/approach I should start with to do the above?
