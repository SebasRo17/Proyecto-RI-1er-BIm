My day job is java/web developer. I have been using eclipse for ~5years. I think its excellent and I also use Webstorm for javascript and html/jsp. I do on occasion need to ssh into server and mess around with config files; for this I use vi and it pains me. I have to get up a webpage listing the syntax/commands : _press escape, then asterix, turn around three times and the text will be entered two lines above your cursor_. Its so **unintuitive** to me, and I imagine anyone who grew up in the late eighties nineties. Here are the main reasons I think eclipse is brilliant(and I assume other IDE's), and do not switch to emacs and/or vim.   * Error highlighting with no need to recompile project.   * Code assist.   * Refactoring.   * Opening call hiearchy/Opening declaration.   * Fully integrated with source control.   * Debugger is included.   * availablity of 3rd party plugins - eg findbugs/checkstyle. One of the arguments I hear is that with emacs/vim you can create your own plugins - well OK, but you can do that in eclipse too. But you don't need to as everything is already there! Its like saying buy this half built car, you can build the rest yourself. Why are people using emacs/vim ? Do people who use it actually work on complex object-oriented projects in large organisations ? **What are the reasons to switch to vim/emacs. How would my productivity increase if I did switch?**
