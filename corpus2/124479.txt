I've been reading about Continuous Delivery and it sounds awesome to automate the deployment process. I've been reading about possibilities how to do this with Java Webapps, but usually it ends up with CI server or maven plugin deploying to Tomcat WITHOUT restarting the Tomcat using Tomcats management API. But that leads to OutOfPermGenSpace issues and so I wouldn't use those solutions for production. In addition it is a hassle to kill an out of control Tomcat. Is there any technology that would make it easy to deploy Java web apps to production? I use maven to build my artifacts and deploy to nexus repository. EDIT: I'm not trying to find ways to prevent Permgen space issues. I'm trying to automatically deploy to production. There should be no manual steps beyond choosing a version and clicking a button(or giving a version number to a commandline script). I want to find out if I have to create this kind of setup manually, or if there is a ready made solution for this. Thus far LiveRebel seems to be the only solution so far that doesn't require me to implement everything myself.
