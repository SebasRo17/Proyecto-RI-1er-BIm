I have been making ternary plots of data that is a list of sets of 3 numbers, where the numbers in each set sum to one (call this "DATA"). To do this, I first transform DATA onto the 2D surface with the following:               transf[{a_, b_, c_}] := {b + c/2, (Sqrt[3] c)/2}          Map[transf,DATA].      This gives a list of sets of 2 numbers that map onto a simplex (call this DATA2). This is how I've plotted DATA2:               Show[{       RegionPlot[Sqrt[3] a1 - a2 < 0, {a1, 0, .5}, {a2, 0, 1},         DisplayFunction -> Identity, PlotStyle -> White,         BoundaryStyle -> None],       RegionPlot[Sqrt[3] a1 + a2 > Sqrt[3], {a1, .5, 1}, {a2, 0, 1},         DisplayFunction -> Identity, PlotStyle -> White,         BoundaryStyle -> None],       RegionPlot[a2 < 0, {a1, 0, 1}, {a2, -.2, 1},         DisplayFunction -> Identity, PlotStyle -> White,         BoundaryStyle -> None],       ListPlot[{{0, 0}, {1, 0}, {.5, Sqrt[3]/2}, {0, 0}}, Joined -> True,         PlotStyle -> {Black, Thickness[.015]}],       ListPlot[{DATA2}, Joined -> True,          PlotMarkers -> Automatic]},      AspectRatio -> Automatic, Frame -> False,       PlotRange -> {{0, 1}, {0, 1}}]       Example: ![example of two data sets plotted on the simplex](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zr8Pw.jpg) Question: Now, I have an extended data set that is made up of sets of 4 numbers that sum to one. I'd like to plot the data in an analogous way, but now on the corresponding tetrahedron. However, I'm not sure how to transform the data or how to draw the appropriate tetrahedron. Can anyone help with this, please?
