Coming from eclipse I've developed my own coding standards which I got used to. In Visual C# 2010 however, it appears that some coding standards that MS recommends are enforced in the default configuration. E.g.: I'm used to write conditional statements like this:               if (somecondition) {         return true;     } else {         return false;     }      But the braces are forced to a newline in visual c#. Is it recommended to use that standard ?
