I'm not sure how the locks will work with multi processors/cores, I'm going to use shared memory in my application or FIFO, what worries me is the locks, I have a server with 2-CPU, how the lock will be able to lock a variable on one CPU while the another operation went to the 2nd CPU for the same variable? I'm in Linux environment using C, I've searched the web for some useful info, appreciate your help
