I have run into the following problem: when I try to run the following code in Mathematica 9 I get SQL connection error on all kernels. The code is:               ParallelTable[SQLExecute[conn, "Select 2+2"], {4}]      And the error message: `SQLConnection::conn: Connection is not opened properly`. The connection itself works fine - I tested it. Also the above code used to work in Mathematica 7. On 8 a similar but more complex SQL request did not work. I would appreciate any suggestions what I could do to solve this (tried distribute Definition on `conn` and also tried creating a list of connections and selecting one according to `$KernelId`).
