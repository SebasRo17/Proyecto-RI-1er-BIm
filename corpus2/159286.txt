My company is attempting to set up a pub/sub connection using RabbitMQ and sockjs, on Windows servers. I have two questions:   1. My supervisor is calling this setup a comet solution, I was wondering if that is the right terminology?   2. Is there a better solution stack for having a data server asynchronously ship data to a client without the client requesting data (besides the initial subscription)?
