I listening to the latest podcast in This Developer's Life and before that I was watching this talk with Uncle Bod, The Last Programming Language, and, along with that, I have been having thoughts on getting back to school, so, based on the fact that I like programming languages a lot, thought: why not getting back to school to study programming languages?? I have a degree in computer systems (that's how it is called in Mexico, it's degree in which you basically touch a little bit of math, computer science and software engineering) and I really don't have a much of clue what/where to go and especially, what kind of studies to do? I mean, should I study **linguistics**? should I go and get a degree in **Computer Science**? Thanks for your answers! ={D
