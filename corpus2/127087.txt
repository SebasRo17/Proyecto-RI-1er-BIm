I am currently working on a solution written in JavaScript. I plan to release two versions:   * For free: the lite one with base options, which is plug and play (it just works when loaded in the page)   * For a subscription fee: the full version that has more options and requires support I am wondering which license(s) would work for me. Here are my thoughts so far, feel free to correct me:   * MIT: I am concerned that somebody else might release new features on top of my solution, under a commercial license. It means that I wouldn't be able to add these same features to my own solution in the future.   * GPL: doesn't seem to work in my case, if I release the lite version under GPL then it means that I also need to release the full version for free.   * Dual licensing: I see that some frameworks or libraries offer dual licensing, but I am not sure how it works.
