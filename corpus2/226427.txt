I know many people have asked the same question but I think it really depends on the type of the website. So that's why I am asking the question about my website. I am developing a PHP web application for an insurance company. the application contains all information about the customers but this app is only used by the admins and salesman of the company. The admin creates a user then that user can add customers or renew their insurance. the address will be something like example.com/manage/ and the login is only for the users that admin person has created. Of course I will be using validation, salt, encryption, etc. But do I need SSL certificate?
