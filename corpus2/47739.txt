We would like to ask a math function similar to "LatticeReduce" for finding linear independent basis. The input is a list of vectors $M=\\{v_1,v_2,v_3,\dots\\}$, with the following property: There is a subset $O=\\{w_1,w_2,w_3,\dots\\}\subset M$, such that $O$ is a basis, i.e. linearly independent and span $M$, $$ v_i=\sum_a c_{ia} w_a.$$ Moreover, the coefficients $c_{ia}$ are **non-negative integers**. An explicit example is the following: $$M=\left( \begin{array}{ccccc} 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\ 1 & 1 & -1 & -1 & 1 \\\ 1 & 1 & -1 & 1 & -1 \\\ 1 & 1 & 1 & -1 & -1 \\\ 2 & -2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\ 2 & 2 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\\ 2 & 2 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\\ 2 & 2 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\\ 2 & 2 & -2 & 0 & 0 \\\ 2 & 2 & 0 & -2 & 0 \\\ 2 & 2 & 0 & 0 & -2 \end{array} \right),\quad O=\left( \begin{array}{ccccc} 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\ 1 & 1 & -1 & -1 & 1 \\\ 1 & 1 & -1 & 1 & -1 \\\ 1 & 1 & 1 & -1 & -1 \\\ 2 & -2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{array} \right), $$ where $O$ is the first 5 rows of $M$ and $$M[[6]]=O[[1]]+O[[4]],\, M[[7]]=O[[1]]+O[[3]],\,\dots$$ In Mathematica form, the example is               m = {{1,  1,  1,  1,  1},          {1,  1, -1, -1,  1},          {1,  1, -1,  1, -1},          {1,  1,  1, -1, -1},          {2, -2,  0,  0,  0},          {2,  2,  2,  0,  0},          {2,  2,  0,  2,  0},          {2,  2,  0,  0,  2},          {2,  2, -2,  0,  0},          {2,  2,  0, -2,  0},          {2,  2,  0,  0, -2}};      May we know that how to write a function/program such that inputting such $M$, the program will output the desired $O$. _For this example the built-in function LatticeReduce works well. But we are not sure it always works._
