Hopefully this is a simple question. I'm trying to overlay some text on top of a `LogLogPlot` using `Epilog` and `Text`. However, I'm struggling with the coordinates that `Text` seems to be using for placement. For example:               LogLogPlot[x + Sin[2x], {x, 1, 1000},       Epilog -> Style[Text["x+sin(2x)", {5, 5}], 14]]      places the label "x+sin(x)" at roughly {x,y}={150,150} on the plot's coordinate system, and not {5,5} as in the input. However, if I change the LogLogPlot to just Plot, the label will get placed at {5,5} (or wherever I specify). What's going on? How it looks right now: ![graph](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7FP4e.png)
