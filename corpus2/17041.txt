I want to select distinct cycles (represented by List). The cycle `{a, b, c, d}` must be the same as `{b, c, d, a}` or `{c, d, a, b}` or `{d, a, b, c}`. But is not equal to `{a, c, b, d}`. The distinct cycles from this set               {{a, b, c, d}, {a, b, d, c}, {a, c, b, d}, {a, c, d, b}, {a, d, b, c},       {a, d, c, b}, {b, a, c, d}, {b, a, d, c}, {b, c, a, d}, {b, c, d, a},       {b, d, a, c}, {b, d, c, a}, {c, a, b, d}, {c, a, d, b}, {c, b, a, d},       {c, b, d, a}, {c, d, a, b}, {c, d, b, a}, {d, a, b, c}, {d, a, c, b},       {d, b, a, c}, {d, b, c, a}, {d, c, a, b}, {d, c, b, a}}      must be `{a,b,c,d},{a,b,d,c},{a,c,b,d},{a,c,d,b},{a,d,c,b},{a,d,b,c}`. I want to know whether any two cycles are the same or not. The cycle I involve has length 14. For example,               {a1, a2, a5, a6, a7, b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, a3, a4}          {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7}          {b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, b7, a3, a4, a1, a2, a5, a6, a7}      How to code in Mathematica?
