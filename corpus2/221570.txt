I'm trying to create a website where the user enters a few numbers, these numbers are fed into some equations, and the output of these equations is emailed to the user. I'm using Python 2.7 for everything. I'm using a cheap Amazon instance (m1.small, Ubuntu 12.04) to host the frontend, but I only want to launch a backend instance when needed (the computations are heavy and require a powerful - and expensive - instance). I can use boto to programmatically launch a backend instance, but after that how do I feed the user input into the backend? Everything is simple enough when I'm doing things manually, with SFTP and SSH, but what's the programmatic way to do it? Should I simply execute SFTP and SSH from my Python script (using, say, 'os.system')? Somehow that feels wrong; how do people actually do it? In case it matters, this is not for a commercial website. I'm in grad school and I want my committee members to be able to replicate and tweak my research, which is stats-heavy. Also, I have no security concerns - it's just academic research, I'm not storing any kind of personal info or anything.
