I have attempted to set up and use the Wolfram Lightweight Grid Manager so I can do parallel computing from Mathematica using 2 remote processors on another machine on my local network. My computing environment includes: Computers: Name: iMac 6   27" iMac, 3.06 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo; 4 GB 1067 MHz DDR3. Mathematica version: 8.0.1.0 Name: iMac 7 27" iMac, 3.06 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo; 4 GB 1067 MHz DDR3. Network: Apple Time Capsule -- note the 2 iMacs connect to the Time Capsule by hard wired ethernet connections. No internal firewall prevent access to "iMac 7". As my license supports 4 processors for parallel computing, it should enable me to identify the 2 remote processors and then distribute computations across them and the 2 on my main machine. I've installed Wolfram LightWeight Grid Manager on iMac 6, my main Mathematica machine. When I look at Preferences>>Parallel it looks like the following: ![Preferences](http://i.stack.imgur.com/23dTn.png) You can see that it identifies the kernels at IP address 10.0.10.22, my iMac 7 machine, but in the "Parallel Kernel Status" window only the kernels on iMac 6 appear as available. I run the following in a notebook to attempt to identify and launch the remote kernels:               SetSystemOptions["ParallelOptions" -> "MathLinkTimeout" -> 120]; (* SETTING AS ADVISED BY PREMIER SUPPORT *)          Needs["LightweightGridClient`"]          $ProcessorCount     ParallelEvaluate[$ProcessID]     ParallelEvaluate[$MachineName]     $MaxLicenseSubprocesses          2     {50948, 50950}     {"iMac-6", "iMac-6"}     4          RemoteServicesAgents[]     {"http://10.0.10.22:3737/WolframLightweightGrid/Manager"}          (* THE ABOVE SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE BECAUSE THE IP ADDRESS IF THE REMOTE MACHINE IS: 10.0.10.22 *)          $KernelCount          2          CloseKernels[] (* JUST TO GET A CLEAN START *)               LaunchKernels[] (* GIVES THE FOLLOWING ERROR *)          RemoteKernelOpen::lwgconnect: Unable to connect to http://10.0.10.22:3737/WolframLightweightGrid/Manager.  Check network connectivity and the spelling of the hostname or URL of the remote computer. Confirm that a Lightweight Grid Manager is running on the remote computer. >>          {KernelObject[17, "local"], KernelObject[18, "local"], $Failed, $Failed}      Apparently, Mathematica can see the 2 processors on my local machine (iMac 6 IP address: 10.0.10.3), but cannot reach the additional processors on the remote machine (iMac 7:IP address: 10.0.10.22). The Wolfram Lightweight Grid Manager opens up in a browser. It has a "Licensing" tab that asks for a login, but interestingly does not accept either the administrative login for the computer or any of the 2 user names and passwords that one has to set up when one installs and configures the Lightweight Grid Manager. The how to video (see link) doesn't make this clear. Not certain what to try next. Do I need to install some kind of grid client software on the remote computer? Do I need to login to the remote computer from the local one? Do I need to have Mathematica installed on the remote computer? I've gone through the documentation, and I have to say I have not found it the clearest that Wolfram has produced. I seem to have missed something. Does anyone have an idea of how to configure this so I can launch remote kernels and access them?
