I need to `Plot` two functions one is on x-axis and second on y-axis, both function have common variable $x$. The two functions are               myfunction1[{al_, be_, ga_}] := (al*be)/2 Cos[x]     (Sec[x/2])^2 (Tan[x/2])^-(be + 1) (1 + ga (Tan[x/2])^-be)^(-(al/ga) - 1)     myfunction2[{al_, be_, ga_}] := (al*be)/2 Sin[x] (Sec[x/2])^2 (Tan[x/2])^-(be + 1) (1 +      ga (Tan[x/2])^-be)^(-(al/ga) - 1)      where $0<x<\pi$, and al, be and ga are equal in both functions. I have no idea how to use `Plot` function or there is any other function in `Mathematica` to plot this?
