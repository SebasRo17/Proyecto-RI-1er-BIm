I have written a Mathematica script in which I define functions and variables. Here is a **_vastly_** simplified example:               myFunA[int_Integer] := int + 1     myFunB[int_Integer] := int * 2     myFunC[int_Integer] := int - 3          myVarA = 1;     myVarB = 2;     myVarC = 3;      (In my actual script, the function and variable names vary; they do _not_ follow the form `myFunX`, `myVarX`, etc.) I would like to `Clear` (or otherwise delete) _all_ of the _variables_ (`myVarA`, `myVarB`, `myVarC`) but **not** the functions (`myFunA`, `myFunB`, `myFunC`). Is this possible (without explicitly `Clear`ing each of the many variables, since my actual script defines several dozen variables)? Thank you for your time.
