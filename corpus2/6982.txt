I am using Mathematica 8.0.4.0 running under Windows 7. Is there a way to programmatically do a "save as " on an init.nb file to save it as init.m? In the documentation center under tutorial/FrontEndTokens I found               FrontEndExecute[{FrontEndToken[FrontEnd`InputNotebook[],"SaveRenameSpecial", "Text"]}]      but it doesn't seem to work? I am looking for a working variation of this where "Text" is replaced by "Package" or somesuch. Thanks for your help.
