I have been an intern at this company for about four months now. At first, it was great because I didn't have a ton of hours, the work was interesting, and it didn't interfere with school. However, once summer started, some problems turned up. They changed my direct supervisor from the person who managed the programmers to just one of the software engineers. He is pretty busy and doesn't have a lot of time to help me, so I can end up stuck for days before I can finally get help from someone. This is pretty frustrating, as I really have nothing to do during this time period and my new supervisor is extremely hard to get a hold of. As an intern, I really feel like I need more direction and help. I quickly run out of things to do or get completely overwhelmed when assigned broad things. I'm never really "checked on", so I can sit for a long time without getting anything done and no one really cares. I've tried asking for help multiple times, but he either doesn't respond to my emails or cancels our meetings. Is this normal for an intern? Is there anything I should be doing so that I can be more productive? Should I go ask management for help or would that be considered out of line for an intern? Should I not really worry about it, since this is just an internship?
