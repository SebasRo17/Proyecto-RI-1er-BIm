I have a CV with a vast array of different technologies that I've used at my former jobs. In my experience at those jobs, I employed parts of those technologies depending on what the job required, but never enough to be a master of all the remote parts of the technologies used. But as I've been interviewing for positions, employers see that I have experience in a technology, and ask very specific technical questions that, while I might've known when using them, I can't answer now. To learn everything about each of the technologies on my CV seems to be a gargantuan task that would be overwhelming. How do I prepare for job interviews where each prospective employer focuses on a different subset of my experience in great detail?
