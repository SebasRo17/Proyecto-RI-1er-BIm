It seems to me that buying and reading books is one of the most important investments a developer can make, and one of the most important investment a company can spend on a developer. There were a lot of times when I was confronted with a tricky problem, and what I did was to flip through an algorithm book and I would stumble upon an answer. And there were a lot of times when I tackled a problem head-on without first doing a literature search, only to find out later that my solution sucked and a proper solution had already been written down elsewhere. But it also seems to me that a lot of companies view books as an expense and thus must be cut down and "budgeted". Sad, but true. How much your company spends on books?
