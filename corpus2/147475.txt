When you build an application, is it better to design the UI first (in Photoshop or whatever), then implement the functionality following the UI you just designed, or do the programming and build the design as you go? Advantages I see using UI as reference:   * the app will end up very UI-friendly :)   * like pdr mentioned, if working for a client, he gets exactly what he imagined Disadvantages:   * the programming will get more complicated, so development time increases any others? :D
