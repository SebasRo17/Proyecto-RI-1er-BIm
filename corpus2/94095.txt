We have youtube kind of website where we calculate rating for every video. Based on rating we award cash. Our problem is no same user can rate a video more than once. We thought if we keep track of static IP, we will be able to achieve this but we found there are third party tools that can be used to manipulate the IP and break this. **Note:** We thought about only signed in customers can rate the video but client asks that even guest should be able to rate the video. Do we have any other method to track this so that they a user cannot rate more than once?
