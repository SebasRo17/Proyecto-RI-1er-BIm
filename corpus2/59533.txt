I am fairly new to _Mathematica_ , but I am trying to plot an orbit of the Earth around the sun using the equation: $\quad r(t+dt) = (2 - G*M*dt^2/r^3)*r(t) - r(t-dt)$ I need to break this into components and give Earth an initial velocity. Essentially my goal is to write the code similar to the way I might write it in Fortran but make use of the plotting functions that _Mathematica_ has. This is a homework assignment so unfortunately I do actually need to do it in this basic Fortran style. Can anyone point me in the right direction?
