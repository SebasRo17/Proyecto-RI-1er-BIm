I know that Discrete Mathematics is a pretty broad topic that's used in a number of fields but I was just wondering what are some of the topics from it that you would expect an average computer science student to know? Here are the range of topics from the table of contents of a book titled "Discrete Mathematics and it's Applications 6th edition" by Kenneth H Rosen:               1 The Foundations: Logic and Proofs         1.1 Propositional Logic          1.2 Propositional Equivalences          1.3 Predicates and Quantifiers          1.4 Nested Quantifiers          1.5 Rules of Inference          1.6 Introduction to Proofs          1.7 Proof Methods and Strategy      2 Basic Structures: Sets, Functions, Sequences and Sums          2.1 Sets          2.2 Set Operations          2.3 Functions          2.4 Sequences and Summations      3 The Fundamentals: Algorithms, the Integers, and Matrices          3.1 Algorithms          3.2 The Growth of Functions          3.3 Complexity of Algorithms          3.4 The Integers and Division          3.5 Primes and Greatest Common Divisors          3.6 Integers and Algorithms          3.7 Applications of Number Theory          3.8 Matrices      4 Induction and Recursion          4.1 Mathematical Induction          4.2 Strong Induction and Well-Ordering          4.3 Recursive Definitions and Structural Induction          4.4 Recursive Algorithms          4.5 Program Correctness      5 Counting          5.1 The Basics of Counting          5.2 The Pigeonhole Principle          5.3 Permutations and Combinations          5.4 Binomial Coefficients          5.5 Generalized Permutations and Combinations          5.6 Generating Permutations and Combinations      6 Discrete Probability          6.1 An Introduction to Discrete Probability          6.2 Probability Theory          6.3 Bayes Theorem          6.4 Expected Value and Variance      7 Advanced Counting Techniques          7.1 Recurrence Relations          7.2 Solving Linear Recurrence Relations          7.3 Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms and Recurrence Relations          7.4 Generating Functions          7.5 Inclusion-Exclusion          7.6 Applications of Inclusion-Exclusion      8 Relations          8.1 Relations and Their Properties          8.2 n-ary Relations and Their Applications          8.3 Representing Relations          8.4 Closures of Relations          8.5 Equivalence Relations          8.6 Partial Orderings      9 Graphs          9.1 Graphs and Graph Models          9.2 Graph Terminology and Special Types of Graphs          9.3 Representing Graphs and Graph Isomorphism          9.4 Connectivity          9.5 Euler and Hamilton Paths          9.6 Shortest-Path Problems          9.7 Planar Graphs          9.8 Graph Coloring      10 Trees          10.1 Introduction to Trees          10.2 Applications of Trees          10.3 Tree Traversal          10.4 Spanning Trees          10.5 Minimum Spanning Trees      11 Boolean Algebra          11.1Boolean Functions          11.2 Representing Boolean Functions          11.3 Logic Gates          11.4 Minimization of Circuits      12 Modeling Computation          12.1 Languages and Grammars          12.2 Finite-State Machines with Output          12.3 Finite-State Machines with No Output          12.4 Language Recognition          12.5 Turing Machines      Appendixes          A.1 Axioms for the Real Numbers and the Positive Integers          A.2 Exponential and Logarithmic Functions          A.3 Pseudocode
