I have the follow simple condition between integers: `k - 2 h - l == 0`, which describe a plane that I plot with:               ContourPlot3D[x - 2*y - z == 0, {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2}, {z, -2, 2}]      Now the problem I have is: How can I plot the same plane under these restrictions:   * plot only discrete numbers (x = 1, 2, 3, ...; y = 1, 2, 3, ...; z = 1, 2, 3, ...);   * _Mathematica_ should observe rules on the integers (e.g.: plot only the positive integers for which `k â‰  h`)
