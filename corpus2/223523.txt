I need to realize a database in this mode:               TABLE restaurant      with "classic" fields of a place: address, street number, phone, website, etc etc etc. I need to indicate also the days of opening // closing. E.g. From Monday to wednesday close, saturday only evening and sunday lunch + evening. So, I did think at another table with 14 rows:               ID_RESTAURANT  MONDAY_LUNCH MONDAY_EVENING [...] SUNDAY_EVENING         12         0             0                    1         And "finally" every restaurant has his own cooking ("international", "chinese", "japan") Another table with a column for every cooking? Finally, several services. "Conditioned Air", "Credit Card", "Animals permitted" "children addicted" etc etc. Another table with a column for every "service"?               ID_RESTAURANT    CONDITIONED    CREDIT_CARD     ANIMALS         12              1              1              0         13              0              1              1      I hope that I'm clear. Thank you very much!
