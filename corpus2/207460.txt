I am thinking of using JIRA + GreenHopper for my project management. I have seen that Green Hopper is for making User stories, sprints. I am not able to find how do i need to add tasks, or how to break user stories in to sub stories. Do I first need to create project in JIRA and then use Green Hopper or I can use use Green Hopper standalone for project management? I am thinking of JIRA as issue tracker not project management.
