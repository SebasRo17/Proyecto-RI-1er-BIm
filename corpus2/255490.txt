I'm interested in working on a project. The project involves a test taking app with 2 modules where there is one quizzer and multiple test takers. I want to make a web application which also has an android app for the same. How should i go along with making this project so that there are no issues as some user can be on the web app and some on the android app? How can i do it so that i don't have to write separate code for the web app and the android app? What should be my approach because i have never made an internet based android app? ( i only have some basic android programming experience, and i'm willing to learn more) but i have a fair experience with developing with jsp/servlets and frameworks. UPDATE: I do not want detailed answers. Just point me in the right direction.
