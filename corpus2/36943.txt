I have a list, L, of this kind ($n\in \mathbb{N}$):               L=Sort[RandomSample[Subsets[Range[n],{2}],RandomInteger[{1,Binomial[n,2]}]]]      S contains any k-sized subset with no duplicating integers:               S=Select[Subsets[L,{k}],Length[Gather[Flatten[#]]]===2k&] (*k>1*)     (*What I need is Length[S]*)      But when $n$ and $k$ are too big, I think there must be a simpler way to get the length than generating S. Which obtainable properties of L determines Length[S]?
