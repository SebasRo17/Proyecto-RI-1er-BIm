(I was encouraged to ask this question here.) In C, we say: > GCC _compiles_ `foo.c`. For interpreters (such as Lua), what is the equivalent verb? > The Lua interpreter **___ __ ___** `foo.lua`. When I write instructions for users of my Lua script, I often say: > Run the interpreter on `foo.lua`. I think this can be said more succinctly: > _Interpret_ (or _Translate_ ) `foo.lua`. but that sounds awkward for some reason (perhaps because I'm unsure of its correctness). I can't really say _compile_ because users may confuse it with the usage of the Lua compiler when I actually mean the Lua interpreter.
