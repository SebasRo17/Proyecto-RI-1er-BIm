Going through some old Hacker News items, I came across a post from a user that said > Aguri trees, which marry a bounded-size radix trie (like you'd use in a > software routing table) to an LRU list, and automatically synthesize > aggregates (like, 10.0.0.0/16 from 1,000 observations across all IPs) from > the pattern of insertion. They're best known in traffic analysis, but we've > used them on in runtime memory analysis as well. ~ tptacek So I decided to look it up,   * A quick Google Search leads me to a F1 driver.   * A search on Wikipedia leads to a agricultural caste in India and some items from Japan    * Stack Overflow hits 0 results http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=aguri `site:stackoverflow.com/questions aguri` So I have finally linked it back to the user see he has a link on his blog > http://www.matasano.com/log/1009/aguri-coolest-data-structure-youve-never- > heard-of/ But it's dead. _So, what is this Aguri data structure and if it is a real data structure, why is it not documented anywhere else?_
