I am building a video server application that has multiple projects in Visual Studio. One project, the video server project, needs to call a shell script to generate documentation. This works fine when you build the video server project, because the script is simply               cd "$(SolutionDir)"     start documentationgenerator      However, there is also an SDK project that, when built, also builds the video server project. However, when it does this, it does not know where the shell script is, since it tries to use the _SDK Project's Solution Directory_.   * SDK Project   * Video Server Project      * shell script So the question is: how do I make the SDK Project find the Video Server Project? I checked the MSBuild properties and there are no properties that seem to deal with 'nested' projects.
