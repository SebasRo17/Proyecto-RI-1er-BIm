I am trying to manipulate a plot of the Bernoulli roots as follows: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/lNroQ.gif) The following code clearly is not going to work, but I have included it in an effort to illustrate my meaning.               sol = Solve[N[Table[BernoulliB[n, z], {n, 20, 20}] == 0, 10]];     Manipulate[ListPlot[{{Re@z, Im@z} /. sol}], {roots, 1, 100}]      It is the {n, 20, 20} that I think I am having the trouble with - the 20 is obviously the variable I would like to manipulate, and {n, roots, roots} was all I could think of doing. I am also unsure how to format the axes and point sizes so they remain constant throughout the manipulation.
