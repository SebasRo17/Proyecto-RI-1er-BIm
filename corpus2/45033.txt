I guess this is actually a legal question, but it relates to software. I'm about to include a JS plugin in a project. The comments include: >   * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, > this list of conditions and the following disclaimer. * Redistributions in > binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of > conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other > materials provided with the distribution. >   1. Is using this in my web site "redistribution?"   2. If I minify this to conserve bandwidth, I assume it will strip all comments. **If the answer to #1 is yes, doesn't that imply I'm legally not allowed to minify it?** (That would stink, since I was planning to auto-minify all JS as part of the deploy process.)
