I would like to set up an app that allows users to send their code and execute it on my server. The thought of running untrusted code makes me cringe, so I am trying to set up an exhaustive list of security threats that should be addressed. I am assuming I should strip down certain features of the language executed, like file access or (maybe) networking. I also come across terms like `sandboxing` or `chroot`. I know what they mean, but how should I actually use them? In short: What security threats should I address before allowing users to run their code on my machine, and how do I do it?
