Java would be jsps and servlets (or a framework such as Spring) running on the JVM and tomcat (or glassfish etc). C# would be asp and C# running on dot.net framework and IIS ? (I have no experience with this please correct and improve my terminology) Is there an equivalent for C++ ? I could happily call some C++ from a java servlet/controller but was wondering if there are existing frameworks and libraries out there specifically for creating business logic in C++ with a web front end.
