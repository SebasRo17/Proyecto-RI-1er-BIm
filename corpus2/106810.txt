I am a junior in high school and I've developed an optimization system for functional languages that could be very powerful. My computer science professors at Boise State University believe I should write a paper and take my idea as far as I can. I've formalized my method, but I haven't had an expert look at it rigorously. I'm also being careful to retain intellectual property safety, so my options are a little limited. Where should I start? I have implemented the optimizer in Haskell (it doesn't actually compile and generate code, but it demonstrates the concept). I'm thinking that I need to finish the research paper focusing on the system itself and see if I can publish it to a journal. The doctor specializing in compiler optimizations at BSU said I might be able to present at Apple because I was planning to generate code with LLVM, which they want to encourage interesting projects for and demonstrate its versatility. This sounds like an exciting prospect, but I'm guessing writing a research paper comes before that. I feel slightly overwhelmed. I'm not sure if I should implement the compiler further to lend my paper credibility, or see if the idea takes off and gather a small community to fully implement it. I'd write the research paper (I have the methods section done), but I'm no expert at research papers, and I might need someone who knows about compiling functional languages that I can trust to look at it. Also, I'm worried that I'll be discriminated for my age (I'm 16 years old). What are some good resources on writing research papers, particularly computer science ones? Where should I start when I have it written? How would I develop interest and a community to implement and expand my idea?
