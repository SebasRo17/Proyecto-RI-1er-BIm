I want to licence a non-trivial PHP application I have been working on under Affero GPL v3 (because I want every admin, who will use it, also release the source code). However, something troubles me. I have a file localSettings.php, where the admin is supposed to write keys and some more information for MySQL database and some other secret info in the form               $dbPassword="mypassword";      and so on. BUT. Under the AGPL, if he changes this, isn't he obliged to release the changed source code together with the secret credentials? (Because the file localSettings.php is, too, licensed under AGPL.)
