I'm trying to solve this integral: $I(a,b)=\displaystyle{\int_1^{\infty }\dfrac{e^{-ax}}{\sqrt{x^2-1} (1+x\sqrt{1-b^2}) (x-1/\sqrt{1-b^2})} \, dx} \,\, \,\,(a \;\textrm{real>0} \, , 0<b<1)$ by varying b from 0 to 1. Mathematica didn't calculate this integral. Maybe it is too complicated to be done. In Mathematica input form:               Integrate[Exp[-a x]/(Sqrt[x^2 - 1](1+x Sqrt[1-b^2])(x-(1/Sqrt[1-b^2]))), {x,1,Infinity}]      If I simply enter that into Mathematica, it instantly returns the same expression. How do I go about this? Is there any tricks that can be applied? Is there a way to get the a symbolic result? Thank's.
