Just wondering whether dynamically built HTML layout is fine from SEO perspectives? So let's assume e-commerce engine and its most popular page - products catalog. So 90% of the page is built using AJAX and MVVM library knockoutjs which builds HTML on the fly on the client side. So how search bots would parse such content? Is it fine indexed and would be such effective as server-side built HTML pages from the SEO perspectives?
