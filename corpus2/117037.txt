my question is rather a matter of English language. For proper commenting my code I want to know when you do for example the following code, what comment you can write for it?               public class TestClass     {         public double volt {get; set;}         public double curr {get; set:}     }       Somewhere else in the same namespace               public class AnotherTest     {         TestClass test;              public AnotherTest(TestClass test)         {            this.test = new TestClass(); //how to comment this?         }     }
