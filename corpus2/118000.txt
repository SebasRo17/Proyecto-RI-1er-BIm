I've recently started taking Scala to heart (sweet Python, I still love you, but your collections just can't match Scala's), and in doing so am now using IntelliJ IDEA almost entirely for development. However, IDEA's Scala plugin is far from perfect, and there are many times I wish I could just go back to my one editor love -- VIM. Unfortunately, there are a few Intellisense-like features I still don't know how to retrieve. Namely,   1. automatic imports   2. type inconsistency recognition   3. method definition lookup   4. a list of valid methods or variables for instances Can anyone recommend any tools to get these done? While Scala is the language most preferred, these concerns are equally valid for C++ and Java. I really would like to leave IDEs behind!
