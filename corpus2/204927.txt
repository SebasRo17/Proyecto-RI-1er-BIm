I want to built an app that it will support In-App Purchases. In short, user will download the app (with some basic features), and he will have the ability to download extra layers (delivery content) with additional info (e.g. a recipe). I want the content of this layer (the recipe) to be dynamic, and be downloadable (through web services) from a server. What concerns me is, how i will secure the web services to be available, only to the users that have pay for the extra layer (using In-App Purchases)? Is this functionality possible to be implemented in Google Play?
