I'm unit testing some code that processes data from an external API. That external API serves up a large pile of JSON data. The right thing to do here, of course, is to use fixtures in the unit tests, so that I don't do a real API call every time the test runs. Those fixtures can be quite large though - many thousands of lines, even. I'm not sure whether I should put them into git. It seems like a bad idea, since they seem like static files. On the other hand, writing the unit tests really requires specific fixtures, so I do want them shared with anybody working on the project (and shared with our build machinery). Should large fixtures be committed into a repo?
