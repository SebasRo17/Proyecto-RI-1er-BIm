I have an awesome URL, I've had it since the mid 90's, and up until around 2002 I was having an awesome time writing music reviews and features into static pages and adding their URL to static index pages and everything was just great. Then things got complicated really fast, and for one reason or another I handed the site over to a very talented friend who turned it into a db based site run by cf. Now, here I am around twelve years later putting it all back together using mysql, php and css on a need-to-learn basis and even though I'm sooo close to where I want it to be I realize, erm, it should have been written using mysqli etc etc ad infinitum. So I'm wondering at what point do I just give in and hire a developer to take over, how much does it even cost, and how do I know I'm working with someone who is better than I am?
