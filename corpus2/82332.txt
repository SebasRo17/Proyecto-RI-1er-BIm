I'll soon be assigned a few other programmers to guide through the development process and will be in the role of the _git_ ("Integration Manager") and generally become a project manager. Telling the truth, I've never done anything like that. I understand that such experience comes through practice, but it wouldn't harm to read about others' experience. Perhaps you know some book or set of articles or something of that kind about the project management? I'm interested not only in how to separate tasks and control their execution, but also in the psychological part. Say, how to inspire the developers, keep a good atmosphere in the group and "reward" / "punish" when necessary, and how to do that correctly; how to point out that some solution is not good enough without offending the team member, etc, etc.
