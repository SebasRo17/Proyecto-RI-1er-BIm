A continuing battle with Mathematica involves graphics heavy with text labels. For example, the following expression renders so that the `"Lifecycle properties..."` node completely hides the arrow from the `"NonFunctional"` node. Any options to space these nodes apart?               TreePlot[{           "Software Engr" -> "Specification",           "Software Engr" -> "Implementation",           "Specification" -> "Functional",           "Specification" -> "NonFunctional",           "Functional" -> Style[ "What the system \n must do", Bold],           "NonFunctional" ->             Column[{ Style["Lifecycle properties:", Bold], "Interoperability",               "Usability", "Scalability", "Safety", "Expandability",               "Flexibility", "Robustness", "Modularity"}]           },          Top, "Software Engr",          VertexLabeling -> True,           PlotStyle -> {FontFamily -> "Helvetica", FontSize -> 14},          EdgeRenderingFunction -> ({GrayLevel[0.5], Arrow[#1, 0.2]} &)          ]      A related issue is that although `Export` renders a PDF of this exactly as it appears in notebook, right-clicking on the cell and using `"Save Selection As..."` makes the above mentioned nodes overlap. It's a mess. Imagine dealing with larger graphs
