I am using jquery and HTML 5 techniques (like File API, HistoryAPI) extensively in a project I am working on. I was wondering what tools I can use for   1. quality assurance my javascript and front end code   2. unit testing my javascript and front end code Let me share some background info. If somebody asked me about this for PHP, I would say, use PHPUnit for writing unit tests, use PHP CodeSniffer and then with the help of Phing and Jenkins, put this all into a single build process. I basically want to know if something similar can be pulled off with javascript using Jenkins. Do share your actual experiences. Please advise me on the most beginner- friendly ones. Disclosure: I cross-posted in G+ community for javascript and HTML5.
