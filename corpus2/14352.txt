Row[Table[Graphics[Rectangle[{0, 0}, {2^k, 1}]], {k, 0, 5}]]      yields ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YAOwv.png) However, I'd like uniform scaling of the rectangles, i.e., each rectangle should look twice the width (but same height) as its predecessor. How can I force "absolute sizing" here? Second, how can I align the bottoms of the rectangles? I tried inserting `Alignment->Bottom` in several spots, none of which worked.
