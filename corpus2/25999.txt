After having read the manuals and searched extensively, I could not find a way to do the following. Suppose you have an implicit equation of the form $y^4 + y^5 = x$, and $y$ is a function of $x$. Now, using `ContourPlot`, one can easily graph y against x. However, I would like to know if there is a method to graph `y'` against `x` (i.e. $dy/dx$ against `x`). I haven't come across any such thing yet.
