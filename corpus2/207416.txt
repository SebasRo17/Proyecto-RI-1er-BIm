I am in the middle of a disagreement (cordial, of course) with my lead about proper branch naming. This applies to bug-fix and small feature branches, not long-running feature branches. For long-running feature branches, we agree that human-readable names are better. Here are the two points of view: Mine: Naming branches according to their team and ticket number is better. It makes it easier to find them in our ticketing system, and shorter to type. It also makes it easier to look up relevant branches in GIT when looking for historical information about a ticket. Example:               team-name/12345     team-name/53719      His: Naming branches according to their feature/functionality. It makes it easier to autocomplete, and is easier to remember than individual numbers. Example:               team-name/fix-that-sql-bug     team-name/expand-http-parser      One compromise I offered is this:               team-name/12345-fix-that-sql-bug      But he does not like this, as it messes with GIT autocomplete. If this is primarily opinion-based, please feel free to give me guidance on how this can be a better fit for SO - but I think that the reasons I gave can be amended/added to to give an empirical answer.
