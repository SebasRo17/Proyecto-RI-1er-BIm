I have a basic search in my webpage. When I designed it, I chose to combine the search box inputs with OR. For example: A search for `foo bar` will be translated to `foo OR bar`, so every entry which includes foo or bar will be shown. I did this because I thought that a search should return as much as possible and leave it to the user to search with AND (a search for `foo and bar` will return only the entries that contain both). When the customer tested it, he tried a lot to search for 'foo bar' and wasn't able to find the right entry because the search returned to much. It seems confusing to him that a search for `foo bar` could return entries where one of the search inputs is included and not both. What is the best way to combine search words (when the user doesn't provide any combining info)? Should I use `foo AND bar` or `foo OR bar`?
