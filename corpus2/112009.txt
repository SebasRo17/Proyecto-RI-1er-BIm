Are **Small Basic** ( **SB** ) and **Microsoft Small Basic** ( **MSB** ) related or is this a confusion based upon similar names? I have read that **SB** is written in C and is GPL. The oldest date on SourceForge is 2004 but the facebook group states its over 10years old. **MSB** is written in .NET 3.5 by Microsoft DevLabs. Wikipedia states it originated in 2008. They seem completely unrelated. Is this another Microsoft "Embrace, Extend, and Extinguish" tactic? I have read that **MSB** does not allow distribution: > The license is presented when you install the software. Small Basic includes > a command line compiler that can be used as part of the product. You may > install and use any number of copies of the software on your premises to > test how it runs with your programs, distribution is not allowed. Please > review the license terms for additional use rights/restrictions. Thank you. -MSB Forums
