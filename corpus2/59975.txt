I'm kind of a beginner to Java and OOP and I didn't quite get the whole concept of seeing a real world problem and translating it to classes and code. For example, I was reading a book on UML and at the beginning the author takes the example of a tic tac toe game and says: "In this example, it's natural to see three classes: Board, Player and Position." Then, he creates the methods in each class and explains how they relate. What I can't understand is how he thought all this. So, where should I start to learn how to see a real world problem and then "translate" it into code?
