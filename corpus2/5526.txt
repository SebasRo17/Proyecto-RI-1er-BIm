I want to make a function that takes a function as a parameter and prints an integral with the function inside. I've tried this:               L[f_, a_, b_] := HoldForm[Integrate[f[x], {x, a, b}]]          L[E^-Sqrt[#] &, 0, 1]      But it gives me this: $$\int_0^1 \left(e^{-\sqrt{\text{#1}}}\text{&}\right)[x] \, dx$$ I want the integrand to look normal, that's all, so I want the variable x to be substituted inside it, but not evaluated any further. Is this possible?
