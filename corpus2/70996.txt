Say you have the following `for`loop*:               for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {         // ...     }      which it could commonly also be written as:               for (int i = 0; i != 10; ++i) {         // ...     }      The end results are the same, so are there any real arguments for using one over the other? Personally I use the former in case `i` for some reason goes haywire and skips the value 10. * Excuse the usage of magic numbers, but it's just an example.
