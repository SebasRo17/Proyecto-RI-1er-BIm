I am about to take plunge into PHP frameworks and my weapon of choice is kohona. I have a reasonable amount of OO experince with java. And my javaScript, jQuery, PhP and html/CSS skills are passable. Now to the question. Is this a reasonable choice? As ZEND looks like a steeper learning curve and CakePHP commandline configuration does not immediately strikes me as good way to produce code.
