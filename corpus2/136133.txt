I'm quite proficient with Java, C/C++, JavaScript/jQuery and decently good at Objective-C. I'm quite productive with the languages and their corresponding frameworks too and do produce enterprise level systems (and also small scale ones) with sufficient ease all the while keeping code 'clean' and maintainable (yes, I can read my own code after six months :) Unless mandated by the platform (iPhone, iPad, etc.) or by the client/implementation organization, just "why" should I learn a new programming language? Just for "fun"? And do what with that fun if I'm not going to do anything worthwhile with it? A lot of my peers are ready to dive in to learn the "next new thing/language" and it's usually Python, Ruby or PHP (just naming a few popular ones). Now, just knowing the language by itself is futile IMHO. You also need to know the frameworks, learn their usage/APIs as well as 'good implementation practices', etc. So from an 'economic' sense, is there any benefit in learning a new programming language? If the language is learned in a quick and dirty fashion, it'll probably also be used for quick and dirty prototyping/implementation - but I don't see THAT as a justifiable investment of time/effort. So just WHY should I (or anyone for that matter) learn a new programming language other than "it's fun so let's try it out" - if the investment of time may not be worth it in the long run?
