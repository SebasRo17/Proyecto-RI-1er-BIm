I am making a discrete plot and a regular function plot together. But my curve is so thick that for color-blind people, it's pretty much impossible to see the black dots of my discrete plot:               plot1 = ParametricPlot[{Sin[t], Cos[ t]}, {t, 0, 2 Pi},         PlotStyle -> {Red, Thickness[0.01]}];          plot2 = ListPlot[Table[{Sin[n], Cos[n]}, {n, 50}],         PlotRange -> {-1, 1}];          Show[plot1, plot2]      > ![combined plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1XF6m.jpg) I tried adding "thickness" parameter, but it didn't work.
