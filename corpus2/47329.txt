I have a system in which there is a Poisson arrival process with rate $\lambda$. I need to split this process into two independent poisson processes $\lambda_i$ and $\lambda_u$. Where $\lambda_i=p(t)\lambda$ and $\lambda_u=(1-p(t))\lambda$. $p(t)$ is a deterministic function which is defined as the CDF of the Lognormal Distribution. I am using `ParameterMixtureDistribution`, but cannot get it to recognise the CDF of the log-normal distribution.               PDF[ParameterMixtureDistribution[ExponentialDistribution[t/600],            t \[Distributed] CDF[LogNormalDistribution[1, 2], t],       t]]      Does anyone know how I can achieve my goal of modelling a time varying rate of the Poisson process?
