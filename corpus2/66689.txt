Imagine that an unfaithful (or maybe careless) employee at Microsoft managed to sneak in three lines of GPL code into a the core of a distribution of Windows. Wouldn't this mean that Microsoft would need to publish all their source code under GPL as well? Or could they just rewrite the three lines once they are notified about the issue? Shouldn't Microsoft be scared to death about this? **Edit** In the comments below, Kenneth states that it has actually happened, so I would be most intereted in any references. I also do not understand how this question could get closed.
