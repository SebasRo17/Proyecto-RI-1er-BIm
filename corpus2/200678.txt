There was an application for PalmPilots that I liked back when PalmPilots were a thing. I want to recreate it (or at least what I remember of it) for modern mobile devices. The problem is, after scouring the internet for any information on the application or the original author, I am unable to find anything. I can't even find any binaries for the app. Since I have absolutely nothing but memories to work with, I'll have to write this from scratch, but my intention is to make it as similar as possible to the original. Since I have no idea who the original author was or what the original license was (I do know that it was at least freeware), I wonder to what extent I can do this. I don't plan on charging for my rewrite and I would like to license it under the GPL or similar. I know this is probably a gray issue, but is it closer to light gray or dark gray? EDIT: I should also add that I know for a fact that any text or graphics (ie. anything except code/functionality/UI layout/general concept) would have been licensed to the author in such a way that, without question, I would also be able to use them.
