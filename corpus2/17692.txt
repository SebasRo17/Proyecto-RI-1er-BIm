I have a need to sort the entries of one list into the same sequence as the entries in a reference list. Because I have rather large lists involving strings, I'm trying to use Dispatch to accomplish this quickly. Here is code that works correctly to provide an example of what I am doing:               list1={"q", "r", "p"}; (*reference list*)     list2={"r", "q", "p"}; (* needs sorted into same order as list1*)          list1rules=Thread[list1 -> Range[Length[list1]]]     listdispatch=Dispatch[list1rules]          updatedpositions=list2 /. listdispatch     list2[[updatedpositions]]          Out[2]= {"q" -> 1, "r" -> 2, "p" -> 3}          Out[3]= {"q" -> 1, "r" -> 2, "p" -> 3}          Out[4]= {2, 1, 3}          Out[5]= {"q", "r", "p"}      This code works as expected and allows me to extract the elements of list2 in the same order as list 1. My problem comes in when the strings are more complicated ... the behavior of the above seems to change. Here is an example of toy code that does not work as expected.               reflist={"AFFX-BioB-5_at", "AFFX-BioB-M_at",         "AFFX-BioB-3_at", "AFFX-BioC-5_at", "AFFX-BioC-3_at",         "AFFX-BioDn-5_at", "AFFX-BioDn-3_at", "AFFX-CreX-5_at",         "AFFX-CreX-3_at", "AFFX-DapX-5_at", "AFFX-DapX-M_at",         "AFFX-DapX-3_at", "AFFX-LysX-5_at", "AFFX-LysX-M_at",         "AFFX-LysX-3_at", "AFFX-PheX-5_at", "AFFX-PheX-M_at",         "AFFX-PheX-3_at", "AFFX-ThrX-5_at",         "AFFX-ThrX-M_at"}; (* reference list to be sorted against *)          seclist=RotateLeft[reflist, 4] (* list that should be sorted according to reflist *)     rules=Thread[reflist -> Range[Length[reflist]]]          dispatchthis=Dispatch[rules];     newpositions=seclist /. dispatchthis          seclist[[newpositions]]               Out[7]= {"AFFX-BioC-3_at", "AFFX-BioDn-5_at", "AFFX-BioDn-3_at", \     "AFFX-CreX-5_at", "AFFX-CreX-3_at", "AFFX-DapX-5_at", \     "AFFX-DapX-M_at", "AFFX-DapX-3_at", "AFFX-LysX-5_at", \     "AFFX-LysX-M_at", "AFFX-LysX-3_at", "AFFX-PheX-5_at", \     "AFFX-PheX-M_at", "AFFX-PheX-3_at", "AFFX-ThrX-5_at", \     "AFFX-ThrX-M_at", "AFFX-BioB-5_at", "AFFX-BioB-M_at", \     "AFFX-BioB-3_at", "AFFX-BioC-5_at"}          Out[8]= {"AFFX-BioB-5_at" -> 1, "AFFX-BioB-M_at" -> 2,       "AFFX-BioB-3_at" -> 3, "AFFX-BioC-5_at" -> 4, "AFFX-BioC-3_at" -> 5,       "AFFX-BioDn-5_at" -> 6, "AFFX-BioDn-3_at" -> 7,       "AFFX-CreX-5_at" -> 8, "AFFX-CreX-3_at" -> 9, "AFFX-DapX-5_at" -> 10,       "AFFX-DapX-M_at" -> 11, "AFFX-DapX-3_at" -> 12,       "AFFX-LysX-5_at" -> 13, "AFFX-LysX-M_at" -> 14,       "AFFX-LysX-3_at" -> 15, "AFFX-PheX-5_at" -> 16,       "AFFX-PheX-M_at" -> 17, "AFFX-PheX-3_at" -> 18,       "AFFX-ThrX-5_at" -> 19, "AFFX-ThrX-M_at" -> 20}          Out[10]= {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, \     1, 2, 3, 4}          Out[11]= {"AFFX-CreX-3_at", "AFFX-DapX-5_at", "AFFX-DapX-M_at", \     "AFFX-DapX-3_at", "AFFX-LysX-5_at", "AFFX-LysX-M_at", \     "AFFX-LysX-3_at", "AFFX-PheX-5_at", "AFFX-PheX-M_at", \     "AFFX-PheX-3_at", "AFFX-ThrX-5_at", "AFFX-ThrX-M_at", \     "AFFX-BioB-5_at", "AFFX-BioB-M_at", "AFFX-BioB-3_at", \     "AFFX-BioC-5_at", "AFFX-BioC-3_at", "AFFX-BioDn-5_at", \     "AFFX-BioDn-3_at", "AFFX-CreX-5_at"}      You'll notice that the newpositions list does not contain the proper coordinates to rearrange seclist into the same sequence as the first. I am at a loss to understand this behavior, when the first code example works. Any thoughts? Thank you.
