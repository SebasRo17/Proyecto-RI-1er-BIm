I've found that `WordData` has a database of English words and their possible parts of speech. But some words are ambiguous, e.g. _result_ can be a verb or a noun:               In[7]:= WordData["result", "PartsOfSpeech"]     Out[7]= {"Noun", "Verb"}      Such cases can, however, be distinguished based on context. So my question is: can one use _Mathematica_ to perform parts-of-speech tagging of a text, either through built-in functions or as an extension? There are many known algorithms and implementations available, yet I have not been able to find a way to leverage them in Mathematica.
