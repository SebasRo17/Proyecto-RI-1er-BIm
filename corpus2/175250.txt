According to the software engineering point of view, I should model the system to make it easier for other people to understand well what they work on. To do so, I have used the Dia drawing program. But, after having used Dia for some time, I find that it falls short in helping me to correctly and efficiently model my project. How do you usually tackle this problem (modelling a project in the large) and what tools would you recommend for the job, and why?
