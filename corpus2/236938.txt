The topic of database version control seems to come up at my work and in social discussion more and more often. But the truth is, I haven't met anyone actually DOING it. The only thing Googling the topic has ever yielded are expensive products/services. Is this really all there is? Does an open source (or at least a _standard_ , and not just "Version control from company x") solution exist for ANY type of database (transactional or otherwise)? I'm in love with the idea, but I don't know where to start looking.
