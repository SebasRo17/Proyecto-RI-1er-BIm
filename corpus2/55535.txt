The command               Plot[x^2, {x, -3, 3}, PlotStyle -> Arrowheads[{-.025, .025}]] /.Line -> Arrow      produces this output. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0WN0q.jpg) What I don't understand is what `Line` has to do with anything. It must be the case that the `Plot` command produces `Line` objects that can be replaced with `Arrow`. I haven't seen anything in the documentation for `Plot` that suggests this is the case. Without `/.Line->Arrow` the plot won't have arrowheads at the ends of the graph of the function.
