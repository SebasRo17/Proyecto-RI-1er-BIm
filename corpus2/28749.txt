Here is an example of the system that I am running,               eqns = {y'[t] == y[t] (x[t] - 1), x'[t] == x[t] (a - y[t]), x[0] == 1,y[0] == 2.7};     tmax = 100;     pfun = ParametricNDSolveValue[eqns, Integrate[y[t], {t, 0, tmax}] , {t, 0, tmax},{a}];     Plot[pfun[a], {a, 0, 1}, AxesLabel -> {"a", "y"}]      and for a particular range of the parameter, "a", I get numerical giberish as shown here: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/VWl5v.png) To check what is going on in this region I looked at the timeseries of x and y for different values of "a". If you plot example timeseries for "a" values higher than the numerical noise you get nice oscillating curves ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HSEWe.png) This was found using this code:               tmax = 100;     amin = 1;     amax = 3;     aint = 1;     eqns1[a_] := {y'[t]==y[t] (x[t] - 1), x'[t]==x[t] (a - y[t]), x[0]==1, y[0]==2.7};     pn1 = ParametricNDSolveValue[eqns1[a], x, {t, 0, tmax}, {a}]     pn2 = ParametricNDSolveValue[eqns1[a], y, {t, 0, tmax}, {a}]          plt1 =Plot[Evaluate[Table[pn1[a][t],{a,amin,amax,aint}]], {t,0,tmax},PlotRange-> All];     plt2 =Plot[Evaluate[Table[pn2[a][t],{a,amin,amax,aint}]], {t,0,tmax},PlotLegends->       Range[amin, amax, aint], PlotRange -> All];     GraphicsRow[{plt1, plt2}]      However, to get the timeseries to plot for the `a` values around the noise, i.e. between 0 and 0.1, I had to add `Workingprecision-> 20` and `Method-> "LSODA"` into `pn1` and `pn2` (into the `ParametricNDSolveValue` options). Which nicely renders the curves ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YmAcp.png) So the problem is that these options are not necessary for all the "a" values when I plot pfun above. In fact, if I include these options into my real system (which is larger) the whole plot takes exponentially longer to finish. So I would like to turn on these options for only some "a" values and not others, when I make a plot of pfun. Or use another trick you might know. I would greatly appreciate any suggestions on how to do this, or other comments. Thank you.
