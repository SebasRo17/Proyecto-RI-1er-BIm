My goal is to make an iOS-like enable/disable switch like this: ![iOS sliders](http://i.stack.imgur.com/yxXCu.png) I use a `LocatorPane` for the slider with so-called "jumps" to only make two settings possible:               LocatorPane[Dynamic[pt], Graphics[{LightGray, Rectangle[{-.5, -.5}, {1.5, .5}]}],                 {{0, 0}, {1, 0}, {1, 1}},                 Appearance -> ImageResize[Graphics[{Gray, Disk[]},                                                    Background -> None], Scaled[.25]]]      Now, I want make the 'slider' better looking by adding a gradient to it but i cannot make it work. `ColorFunction` (probably the only way to add gradients in _Mathematica_ ) seems not available to `Disk`. I tried using Heike's solution for gradients in this question, but pasting the graphics from her function into my code does not work: the size of these graphics is way too large and rescaling it (using `ImageResize`) adds a white background which I cannot remove. I tried making a disk with a gradient myself using `Raster` and `ImageAdd`, but here the same problem of a none-removable background occurs again:               ImageAdd[     Graphics[Raster[Table[i, {i, 100}, {j, 200}],              {Scaled[{0, 0}], Scaled[{1, 1}]}, {1, 100}, ColorFunction -> "GrayTones"]],     Graphics[Disk[]]]      Can anyone give some tips about how to add gradients to disks?
