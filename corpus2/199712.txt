We are working on automation of deployment using Jenkins. We have different environments - DEV, UAT, PROD. In SVN, we are tagging each release and placing same binaries in DEV, UAT, PROD. The artifacts already contains config files w.r.t each environment but I am not understanding why we are storing binaries in environment folder again. Are there any scenarios where deployment might be different for different environments.
