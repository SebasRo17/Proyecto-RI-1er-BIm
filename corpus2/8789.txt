I was browsing through this talk about "Historically Bad Ideas" over the history of Computer Science, and found an interesting presentation about the rise & fall of the Java Enterprise initiatives. Slide #16 grabbed my attention by suggesting that Container Managed Persistence is a "na√Øve ORM solution". Of course, I assume the presenter made a live in-depth analysis of the problem, which is missing in the slide. So I was left intrigued by that statement. Is CMP Entity Beans just a heavy piece of naive engineering? Aside any bias from the author(s) of the presentation, what would constitute a more adequate ORM solution in the domain of languages like Java or C#? I'm not asking for specific tools or frameworks, but better approaches. Thank you!
