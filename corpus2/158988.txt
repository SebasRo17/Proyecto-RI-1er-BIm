A Java App Store sounds like a cool idea right? Well, I turned to Google and found some remnants of an app store that Oracle had been developing. It looks like it has since been discontinued, but I haven't been able to find much commentary on why it was abandoned. So why was it discontinued? Links to other references, for instance blog posts discussing the difficulties of Oracle's app store, would be much appreciated.
