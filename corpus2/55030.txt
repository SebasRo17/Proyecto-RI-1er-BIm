The manipulate function in _Mathematica_ allows the users to adjust the values of the parameters in a graphical way. How do I plot multiple functions in a same graph and also I can use manipulate at the same time?               Manipulate[      Row[{        Plot[f1(x+n)], {x,           0.0001, 1}, PlotRange -> {-10, 10}],        Plot[f2(x+n)], {x,           0.0001, 1}, PlotRange -> {-10, 10}]}],        {n, 1, 10}]      with give two independent plots with single curve in each. How should I do multiple curve in a **same plot?**
