How do I correctly include copyright statements for included libraries? I have a program that uses libraries which are licensed under the GPL and MIT (either jointly under both, just only MIT) licences. How do I specify this at the top of a combined and minified file? I have this currently:               My Program (GPL)     Copyright 2009-2013, Me          jQuery (GPL/MIT)     Copyright 2005, 2012 jQuery Foundation, Inc. and other contributors          Some other library (MIT)     Copyright 2013, Some other person          This file is part of My Program.
