There are advantages in holding daily scrum, like:   1. Team get coordinated with each other   2. Everyone knows what amount of task has been done   3. Burndown chart gets more and more complete   4. Task board is updated    5. It doesn't last that much, 15 minutes won't kill anybody However, recently (after 6 months of implementing and using scrum), I feel like that our developers don't like scrum daily that much anymore. People just update the task board, without explaining enough and it seems that they're bored of it. I see that when for any reason, we don't hold it, they kind'of become extra-happy. I just don't know what could be wrong with this. Are there any reasons mentioned somewhere for disadvantages the "daily scrum" can have for a team? What could be the reasons for developers getting tired of daily scrum?
