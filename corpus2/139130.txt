I have a question about "commercial" and "non-commercial" usage, also with the usage of MongoDb. Lets imagine we got a website without a business model, the site grows in popularity but still no incomming money. Are we talking about non-commercial at this point? And once the website starts making money, is it allowed to decide at that point to get a commercial license? Thanks for help.
