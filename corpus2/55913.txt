We have recently polled our company wide wiki users and found out that there are two large groups of users:   * people with **lots of knowledge** but (who claim they have) no time to document   * people with **time** but (who claim they have) not enough knowledge worth documenting Each group covered almost 50% of the users! How do your companies handle this? That is, **how do you encourage your busiest / most knowledgeable people to share their knowledge?**
