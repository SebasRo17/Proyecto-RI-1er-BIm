The Hankel Transform is given by               Integrate[f[x] x BesselJ[0,x t],{x,0,Infinity}]      It is self-inverse, so               Integrate[F[t] t BesselJ[0,x t],{t,0,Infinity}]      gives the back-transformation. I tried out a simple case:               Integrate[UnitBox[x/2] x BesselJ[0,x t],{x,0,Infinity}]      which promptly results in               BesselJ[1,t]/t      This is correct. However, if I do the back-transformation:               Integrate[BesselJ[1,t]/t t BesselJ[0,x t],{t,0,Infinity}]      the integration takes noticably longer (which is expected since the function oscillates) and the result is               ConditionalExpression[0,x>1]      While that single condition would be correct - UnitBox[x/2] == 0 for x>1 - the rest of the function won't show up. Is there any way to make the obviously missing parts show up? (I am not sure what tags to use.
