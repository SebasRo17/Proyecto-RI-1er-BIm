With help of the previous questions here, I am analyzing weather data as daily `MeanWindSpeed` of some cities with the following code:                 {date, year, month, day, wind} = {1, 1, 2, 3, 2}            cityWind1 = WeatherData["Bodo", "MeanWindSpeed", {{1973, 1, 1}, {2013, 5, 1},"Day"}];       cityWind1[[All, date, year]] = 0            slowWinddays1 = Select[cityWind1, #[[wind]] < 21 &];       DateListPlot[{cityWind1, slowWinddays1}, ImageSize -> 600]      I have two problems.   1. I want to calculate the probability of the days that mean wind speeds higher than 21 km/hr and show it in the plot. It could be monthly or weekly outlet. I know the algorithm is too easy, but sorry guys I am new in town!    2. Most important, how can I show this probability in different geographic regions based on data from the available stations of that region. For example, assign a color to Norway and vary intensity to indicate the probability on the geographic map. That is to say, the more intense the color, the higher the probability.
