I type the following command line               Table[D[#1,varx[[i]]] &,{i,3}]      where `varx` is a vector of dummy variables               varx = {x1, x2, x3}      According to this link NonCommutativeMultiply, I want to obtain a vector like this > $\left\{\frac{\partial }{\partial \text{x1}},\frac{\partial}{\partial > \text{x2}},\frac{\partial}{\partial \text{x3}}\right\}$ But I got this > ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/U2QMV.png) It seems like the index `i` in the command `Table` does not work. I don't know why this happens. I try not to use the placeholder '#1' like this               Table[D[2 x1^2 + 4 x2^3 + x3^4, varb[[i]]], {i, n}]      And this works all fine               {4 x1, 12 x2^2, 4 x3^3}      If I want to keep the placeholder, what should I do?
