I'm not necessarily asking if a NoSQL database can be ACID compliant, which has been asked here: Is there any NoSQL that is ACID compliant? I'm wondering if we have a database either now or in the future that is wanting or is another option to a traditional RDBMS? I know NoSQL was supposed to be the big thing and RDBMS were supposed to go by the wayside and so forth (I've read I dunno how many articles on it). But that never really solved the issue of data that was very strict and had to be kept consistent (like bank transactions... stuff like that). So when RDBMS was "supposedly" supposed to go to the wayside... what was supposed to replace this Data that had to be strict?
