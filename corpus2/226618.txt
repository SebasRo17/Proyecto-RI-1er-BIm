I was hired as an intern at a company that mainly deals with civil and environmental engineering. I am their only programmer and the project they assigned me seems impossible for someone of my experience. I'm a 3rd year computer engineering major working on my B.S. My program is a tool that organizes tens of thousands of items and performs numerous calculations based on user specified constraints..all while displaying charts and graphs of the outcome of various scenarios in a user- friendly interface. I'm given 2-3 months to do all of this on my own. I've managed to make good progress but at the same time I'm terrified I cannot deliver to our clients in time and that I may be using terrible coding techniques that will result in bugs and errors as the tool becomes more complex. I'm told soon this program has to connect to a database and will be reused for other clients. Is this a likely job for not even an entry level developer? I feel like I'm given the job of senior level work but I have nobody to turn to and ask if I'm doing it right except the internet and I'm going crazy from the constant pressure to do all this correctly and on time. Any advice?
