There are some peculiar things to be discovered in derivatives of some standard functions in MMA: **Strange behaviour** _Example 1: Abs_ We have               Abs[0.1]          (* Out[72]= 0.1 *)      But               Abs'[0.1]          (* Out[73]= Derivative[1][Abs][0.1] *)      Same thing if we avoid writing the prime:               D[Abs[x], x] /. x -> 0.1          (* Out[110]= Derivative[1][Abs][0.1] *)      That is, the derivative of `Abs[]` has no numerical value. When plotted, there's nothing to be seen. The derivative should of course be, or at least behave like, `Sign[x]` . _Example 2: Sign_ Sign[0.1] (* Out[78]= 1 *) Sign'[0.1] (* Out[79]= Derivative[1][Sign][0.1] *) That is, the derivative of `Sign[]` has no numerical value. When plotted, there's nothing to be seen. _Example 3: Floor_               Floor[0.1]          (* Out[80]= 0 *)      But which value has the derivative at 0 ? First possibility:               Floor'[0]          (* Out[89]= Derivative[1][Floor][0] *)      No value. Second possibility:               Floor[0.]          (* Out[90]= 0 *)      Hence the numerical value seems to be 0. No, bad luck, wrong guess! Look at that Third possibility: N[Floor'[0]] (* Out[93]= 36.2120995105236639865598801739718338716778459859 *) Furthermore:               Table[{x, N[Floor'[x], 5]}, {x, 0, 1/2, 0.05}]          (* Out[96]= {{0., 36.212}, {0.05, 12.5946}, {0.1, -4.29432}, {0.15,        1.61679}, {0.2, -0.532708}, {0.25, 0.13901}, {0.3, -0.0263362}, {0.35,        0.00318987}, {0.4, -0.000184538}, {0.45, 0.}, {0.5, 0.}} *)      Strange ocillatory behaviour for a quantity which should be = 0 throughout. It seems to be defined via a Fourier series. **Remedy ?: do it yourself !** Finally, let's create the derivative by ourselves as it is originally defined:               floorPrime[x_] := Limit[(1/h) (Floor[x + h] - Floor [x]), h -> 0]          Plot[0.1 + floorPrime[x], {x, -1, 1}, PlotRange -> {0, 0.2}]          (* Picture snipped *)               absPrime[x_] := Limit[(1/h) (Abs[x + h] - Abs[x]), h -> 0]          Plot[absPrime[x], {x, -1, 1}, PlotRange -> {-2, 2}]          (* Picture snipped *)      Ok, everything fine. But why has MMA such problems with its own standard operation ' (or D[]) in this class of functions? Please explain. Regards, Wolfgang
