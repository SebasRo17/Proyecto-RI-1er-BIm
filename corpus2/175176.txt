I sometimes create 'Util' classes which primarily serve to hold methods and values that don't really seem to belong elsewhere. But every time I create one of these classes, I think "uh-oh, I'm gonna regret this later ...", because I read somewhere that it's bad. But on the other hand, there seem to be two compelling (at least for me) cases for them:   1. implementation secrets that are used in multiple classes within a package   2. providing useful functionality to augment a class, without cluttering its interface Am I on the way to destruction? What you say !! Should I refactor?
