As far as I can tell, there seems to be a bug in `SeriesCoefficient`:               In[4]:=        f[z_] := (-z + z Sqrt[1 - 4 z^2])/(2 (-1 + z));       SeriesCoefficient[f[z], {z, 0, 10}]       SeriesCoefficient[f[z], {z, 0, n}] /. n -> 10          Out[5]= 9          Out[6]= 93/256      Note that both outputs should be the same, but apparently the application general in `n` makes a mistake (`9` is the correct result). In fact, I know that the coefficients grow exponentially in `n` but we get:               In[9]:=        SeriesCoefficient[f[z], {z, 0, n},          Assumptions :> Mod[n, 2] == 0 && n >= 2] // FullSimplify          Out[9]= 1/2 (1 - Gamma[n/2]/(Sqrt[\[Pi]] Gamma[(1 + n)/2]))      This quantity, $\qquad\displaystyle \frac{1}{2} \cdot \biggl(1 - \frac{\Gamma\bigl(\frac{n}{2}\bigr)}{\sqrt{\pi} \cdot \Gamma\bigr(\frac{n+1}{2}\bigr)} \biggr)$, converges to 1/2 from below (odd `n` support the same series), so it's not even _close_ to being correct. Obviously, I can't tell what exactly goes wrong inside `SeriesCoefficient`. Since I have an interest in the general form of the coefficient (of the expansions of this and other functions), is there a way to circumvent the bug inside (or the application of `SeriesCoefficient`) so that it works more reliably? Less power would be acceptable in trade.
