In Mathematica I am trying to implement algorithm, for which I would like to have user friendly interface, I have managed to create Panel using Widgets, but when I am trying to provide the value of the textfield with clicking the Submit button, nothing happen. I have created the following event: > BindEvent["action", Script[buttonClicked[]] so when the button is clicked buttonClicked[] should be executed, which contains check on the textfield. But nothing happen when clicking Submit. Could you please give me a hand on that.               Needs["GUIKit`"];     ref = GUIRun[Widget["Panel",             {Widget[          "Label", {"text" ->             "Please provide the following coefficients:"},          WidgetLayout -> {"Alignment" -> Center}, Name -> "mainLabel"],              WidgetSpace[10],         {Widget["Label", {"text" -> "  Value for p1"}],          Widget["TextField", {"columns" -> 6}, Name -> "p1_tf"],          Widget["Label", {"text" -> "            "}]          },         WidgetSpace[10],         {WidgetFill[],           Widget["Button", {"text" -> "Submit",             BindEvent["action", Script[buttonClicked[]]]},            Name -> button1], WidgetFill[]          }         }        ]]          ImaginaryQ[expr_] := ! FreeQ[expr, _Complex];          Script[      buttonClicked[] := (If [          ImaginaryQ@p1_tf ==            False, {MessageDialog [             "The provided value is not valid. You need to enter complex value"], Exit[]}];)         ]          GUIScreenShot[ref];          p[[1]] = p1_tf; (*p1*)       Print["p1=", p[[1]]];
