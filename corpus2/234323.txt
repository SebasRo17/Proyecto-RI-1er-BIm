I am working on a android schedule app but that isn't matter , the problem is a algorithm / methodology so you are welcome to just write the pusedo code to answer. The data is like this               Place      =============     Name     lat      lng     duration     isBookMark     type      Note: There are **only** two type: Shop, Park, duration is the time base on hour e.g. 1 => 1hour, 0.5 hour etc.... lat lng are the location unit So, I would like to generate a random place list based on the following criteria:   1. There are 2 duration limit     * if short limit, then I need to get exactly 1 Park and some Shop, based on the hour 3-5 is given     * if medium limit, I need to get exactly 2 Park and some Shop, based on the hour 6-8 is given     * if long limit, then I need to get exactly 3 Park and some Shop, based on the hour 9-11 is given   2. The user can select whether the bookmarked item is higher priority, so it may need to handle bookmark higher priority when select the item.    3. Also, the next place chosen must be the nearest place. You can assume there is already a `calcuateDistanceDiff()` function available  So, how to generate a list in the above case? I have tried to simply like "hardcode" to handle the duration limit one by one e.g. get one Park first and get the next by checking the priority / distance one by one , but there should be some more wise way to create a more generic "methodology" to handle this, in terms of better performance and elegant.
