I've given a few talks recently and I have not found a good way to make slides. Here are a few desirable characteristics for programming slides:   * They're slides. A standard emacs buffer won't do it.   * They have syntax highlighting for code.   * They support _basic_ formatting, like font size and color and bullets.   * No fancy animations needed. The only animation I desire is one-by-one appearance of bullets.   * EDIT: It should be easy to alt-tab back and forth from the terminal to the slides without destroying the presentation sequence/position. So far I have considered:   * Microsoft Office - out of the question for Linux users.   * OpenOffice.org - too much for my needs, code formatting/highlighting needs to be done externally and pasted in. On the plus side supports bullets, bullet-by-bullet animation, and font formatting. To my knowledge there's no way around the fact that alt-tab to the terminal destroys presentation mode and position.   * Emacs - Supports all the code formatting but I haven't found a _slides_ mode that lets me transition from one chunk to another.   * HTML5 - I once made slides using html5rocks as a template. It supports everything, but is too hard and time-consuming to "throw together" a few slides before a minor talk. Also the html5-only features may not work on the podium computer's installed browser. Any suggestions for programs/techniques for making code-centric presentations? EDIT: I think S5 and Latex are most in the spirit of what I'm looking for, but that's not to say the other suggestions (including not using slides at all) are "wrong".
