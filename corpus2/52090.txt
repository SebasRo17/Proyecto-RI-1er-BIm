I am not good with slot management when it comes to 2D lists. What is the correct way to map a function on list of lists of different length, where the function needs to act of each entry in each list and return the result in the same shape as the list of lists? Example:               data1 = {{1, 2}, {4, 5, 6}, {1}};     x = {80, 81, 82};      And I'd like the result to come out as               Clear[f]     result = .......           (*result={             {f[x,1],f[x,2]},             {f[x,4],f[x,5],f[x,6]},             {f[x,1]}            }     *)      The function `f` is defined to take as its first argument a 1D list, and its second argument a single number or single symbol as in `f[list_, n_]` I've tried MapThread, Scan, And many others, but keep getting slot[#] mismatches. ofcourse I can use `Table` command to force the iteration over the rows, or use `Do` but I want to learn how to do this without these. I wish WRI will have a course on slot management and threading. I would sign up for it.
