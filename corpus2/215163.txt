I didn't learn programming at school and I do not work as a (professional) developer, hence a lot of basics are not quite clear to me. This question tries to clarify one of them. * * * Now let's suppose that I have issues `#1`, `#2` and `#3` in my Issues Tracker that are set to be corrected/enhanced for version `1.0.0` and that the last (stable) version is `0.9.0`. When should I increment to version `1.0.0` ? When a) **just one** of the listed above issues is closed or b) when **all** the issues related to version `1.0` are closed ? Which one is the _right_ way to do it ? And by the _right_ way, I mean what is currently used in the industry.
