I have the following function:               f[lst_List /; MatchQ[lst, SOME PATTERN HERE]] :=        ({#[[1]] + #[[2]], #[[1]] - #[[2]]} &) /@ lst;      I want to match lists that are ordered pairs of reals: `{{0.1, 0.2}, {0.3, 0.4}}`, and so on. I tried the following pattern:               MatchQ[{{0.1, 0.2},{0.3, 0.4}}, _List[_List[_Real, _Real]]]      but this returned `False`. I know that:               MatchQ[{{0.1, 0.2},{0.3, 0.4}}, {__List}]      returns `True`, but this pattern is not sufficiently specific, since it also matches `{{}}`, among others. What is the correct way to construct the pattern I want?
