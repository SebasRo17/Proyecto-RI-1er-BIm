In the university that I am working they have decided to participate in the ACM regionals for the first time, they would like to appoint me like a coach. I have never been into that situation before and have not found so much information about it, so what is the real work of a coach in those contests? Sometimes I have found experienced programmers like coaches, but others are just people with no so good programming skills; so what is all about?
