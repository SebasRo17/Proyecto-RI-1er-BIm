It's sometimes frustrating to know that one particular feature is working in one compiler and not in another. Even after downloading latest gcc4.6 few weeks back some C++0x features are not working. Will the **complete** C++0x support provided by the compilers (at least the popular ones) on the very 2nd day when the C++11 is released officially ? Have these compiler vendors decided any timeline to provide the full support ?
