My doubt arises from this sentence in the gifmerge distribution conditions: "This software may be freely copied, modified and redistributed without fee provided that this copyright notice is preserved intact on all copies and modified copies." Especially the "without fee" part is the one thet puzzle me. Can some expert dispel my doubt? http://www.the-labs.com/GIFMerge/
