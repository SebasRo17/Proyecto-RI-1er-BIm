I have a list of coordinates               {{A[9, 4, 7], 0.0395174}, {A[1, 5, 0], 0.0163797}, {A[0, 7, 2], 0.0577425},       {A[2, 7, 5], 1.01313}}      I want to find the distance between them using the equation $$r= \sqrt{(x_2-x_1 )^2+ (y_2-y_1)^2+(z_2-z_1)^2 }$$ I will choose the first coordinate and calculate the distance to other coordinates by using the above equation. In the second step I will take the second coordinate and calculate the distance to other coordinates. since the distance between first one and second one is already calculated there is no need to do it again. In this way I have to find the distance between all coordinates. Can anyone help me.
