Do you know that feeling when you just _need_ to show off that new trick with `Expression`s or generalize three different procedures? This does not have to be on Architecture Astronaut scale and in fact may be helpful but I can't help but notice someone else would implement the same class or package in a more clear, straightforward (and sometimes boring) manner. I noticed I often design programs by **oversolving the problem** , sometimes deliberately and sometimes out of boredom. In either case, I usually honestly believe my solution is crystal clear and elegant, until I see evidence to the contrary but it's usually too late. There is also a part of me that _prefers_ undocumented assumptions to code duplication, and cleverness to simplicity. > What can I do to **resist the urge to write “cleverish” code** and when > should the bell ring that **I am Doing It Wrong**? The problem is getting even more pushing as I'm now working with a team of experienced developers, and sometimes my attempts at writing smart code seem foolish even to myself after time dispels the illusion of elegance.
