How do I import a uLaw-format audio file into _Mathematica_? Here's an example:   * hello-world.ulaw For reference, here's the same file in wav format:   * hello-world.wav As I understand it, the uLaw format contains raw Âµ-law audio data. In this respect, it should be very similar (or identical) to AU, which _Mathematica_ supports, except there is no header. I have tried:               Import["hello-world.ulaw", "AU"]      but _Mathematica_ returns:               Import::fmterr: Cannot import data as AU/SND format.      From the documentation, it looks like there is probably some combination of parameters and options that will work, but the `Import`/`Export` documentation doesn't go into much detail on how to actually use the various available options. (Or at least, not in a way that makes sense to me!)
