In the documentation of _Mathematica_ it is mentioned that you can use `Hyperlink` and `Tooltip` as _wrapper_ in a similar manner as `Style`. However, the following example does not seem to work: vertices `1` and `2` are highlighted in `Red` but there is neither hyperlink access nor tip.               HighlightGraph[Graph[{1 -> 2, 2 -> 3}], {Tooltip[1, "TEST IT!"],                       Hyperlink[2, "http://stackexchange.com/"]}]      Did I miss something ?
