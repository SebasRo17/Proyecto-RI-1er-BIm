Take a simple `GridGraph`:               g = GridGraph[{3, 3}, VertexLabels -> "Name", ImageSize -> 150, ImagePadding -> 10]      ![g](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ycGpT.png) I am puzzled by the following behavior: Try to delete vertex 2:               h=VertexDelete[g, 2]      ![vd](http://i.stack.imgur.com/POsDU.png) Vertex 2 was deleted, but so were several edges that did not have a node at vertex 2. In addition, Vertex 1 appears to be connected to vertex 3; it wasn't before. Now look at the remaining edges:               EdgeList[h]      > {1 [UndirectedEdge] 4, 3 [UndirectedEdge] 6, 4 [UndirectedEdge] 5, 4 > [UndirectedEdge] 7, 5 [UndirectedEdge] 6, 5 [UndirectedEdge] 8, 6 > [UndirectedEdge] 9, 7 [UndirectedEdge] 8, 8 [UndirectedEdge] 9} According to the edge list, Vertex 1 is not connected to vertex 3 (even though it was draw as connected to 3); but vertex 1 **is** connected to vertex 4 (even though it was not so drawn). * * * Try deleting vertices 1 and 3:               VertexDelete[g, {1, 3}]      ![vd2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tihaD.png) Either I am misunderstanding something or Mathematica is erring. Can anyone explain which is the case? Thanks.
