I observe that the answer generated by the first integration is not in any simple way related to the next two answers. (some simple jump of i 2\pi across the branchcut of the logarithm is not helping either - as discussed in the previous question _Mathematica_ puts the branchcut of the function $log(z^2 +4)$ as being along the positive imaginary axis starting at 2i ) Can someone help understand what _Mathematica_ is doing mathematically?               Integrate [ Exp[I p] Log [ (3 Exp [I p])^2 + 4] , {p, 0, π}]      > >      2/3 I (-6 + π + 4 ArcTan[3/2] + Log[2197]) >                 Integrate [ Exp[I p] Log [ (3 Exp [I p])^2 + 4] , {p, 0, π/2}]      > >      -2 + I π + 4/3 ArcTanh[3/2] + Log[5] +  1/3 I (-6 + 4 ArcTan[3/2] + > Log[2197]) >                 Integrate [ Exp[I p] Log [ (3 Exp [I p])^2 + 4] , {p, π/2, π}]      > >     1/3 I ((-6 - 6 I) + π + 4 ArcTan[3/2] + 5 I Log[5] + Log[2197]) >
