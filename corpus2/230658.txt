I build one **MAIN** branch. This is our trunk and our only code base for the project. Once this is built, ideally it would continuously deploy to our Dev environment. Once the developers have confirmed operation in that Dev environment, I'd like to simply publish the binaries that were previously built, to the Test environment. Once QA has confirmed operation in the Test environment, I'd like to publish the same original binaries to the Stage environment, and then to the Production environment. I guess it's sort of like deploying old school where you just copy over the binaries onto the box you're doing the deployment to. Any strategies, tuturials, tips, links and third party software recommendations (preferably with link to tutorial) are appreciated. I'd like to keep everything within Visual Studio if possible.
