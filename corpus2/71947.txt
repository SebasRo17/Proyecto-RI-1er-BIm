Here's my scenario with made-up names: A big company called Supersoft have announced that in about 3 months they're going to release an Android app called "Supersoft Metronome" (where Metronome is a fairly common noun). I want to call my new iPhone app (notice the other app is on Android) "Metronome" and I'm ready to release in a week. Should I rename my app? Will I get in legal trouble otherwise? Both apps are in the same category of program. I've already bought a related domain name, paid for artwork and styled my app around the name so I really don't want to change it now. I've considered extending the name to something like "Metronome Music Editor". Would this protect me?
