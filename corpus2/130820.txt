I need to introduce a group of 5-15 people to recursion and I would like to do so by using a physical game/dance/activity they can play to get a feeling for recursion. The class is not so much focused on CS than general concepts so anything computer or programming related is out (but programmers are still the best people I could think of to bombard with such as question). I was thinking about using some kind of clap game such as teenie girls like to play that includes recursion but couldn't come up with one yet. The game/dance might well be ridiculous, it should just be interactive and get them some intuitive feeling for what recursion is and how omnipresent it is in our surroundings. Looking forward to your suggestions!
