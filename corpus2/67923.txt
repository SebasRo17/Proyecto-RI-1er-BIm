**What methods seem to work best to coax requirements out of non-tech business people?** I am working with a team that’s trying to get a spec together for a project. Every time we have met and it comes down to expectations for the next meeting, we ask for the business people to bring back their requirements. They usually respond something like this: “Well, do you think you guys could whip up a prototype so we can see what we like next week…you know, not with any data or anything since it’s a prototype, just the functionality.” This is a 6 month plus project so that is obviously infeasible (we would have to develop the entire thing!), and we don’t even know what to prototype without some sort of spec. Frankly, I think like most people, they have some idea of what they want, they just are not thinking about it in the focused sort of way necessary to gather true requirements. As an alternative to simply telling them, “give us what you want or we can’t/won’t do any work” (we do want them to be happy with the results), are there ways to help them decide what they want? For example, we could tell them: “Draw out some screens (in Powerpoint, on a napkin, whatever) that show the UI you would like with all of the data you want to see and a description of the functionality in the margins. From this, we will polish it up and build the backend based on this set of behavior requirements.” OR “Don’t worry about how it will look right now (the number 1 hang up). Just give us a list of all the data you want about each thing the program keeps track of. So for “Customer” you might list: name, address, phone number, orders, etc. It does not have to be a perfect database structure, but we can work something out from this and get an idea of what you are looking for” **Do either of these alternative approaches to get business people focused on what they want make sense? Are there alternatives that you have seen in action?**
