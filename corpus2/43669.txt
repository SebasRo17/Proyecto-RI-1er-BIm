I have a list of points, that may have clusters in some of the $x$ axis values, and my goal is to get a function that shows that graphically. Something like this, but the red function is "hand drawn", it's just for reference. ![frequency plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YKYL4.png) The high points of the red plot shows where the clusters are and the low points where are the points that are most isolated.
