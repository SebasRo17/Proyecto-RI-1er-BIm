I always wondered if I could start NDSolve from an intermediate time step. What I mean is, in the code sample below, if I were to run my solution from `tmin=0` to `tmax=2` and then I realize that my solution hasn't converged yet, could I just change my `tmin` to `2` and then proceed with a larger `tmax` (in this case the solution coverges [attains steady state in this example] at `tmax=5`). This is because very often I solve 4th order Nonlinear PDEs with NDSolve, some of which take over 70-80 minutes to complete (as I run them for long times of a million time steps or so) and then I realize that the solution hasn't converged yet. So can I just, as in my presumed working example, change my `tmin` to my `tmax` from the previous run and change my `tmax` to a larger run?               tmin = 0;     tmax = 5;     sol = NDSolve[{D[u[t, x], t] == D[u[t, x], x, x], u[0, x] == 0,          u[t, 0] == Sin[t], u[t, 5] == 0}, u, {t, tmin, tmax}, {x, 0, 5}];     Plot3D[Evaluate[u[t, x] /. sol], {t, tmin, tmax}, {x, 0, 5},       PlotRange -> All]
