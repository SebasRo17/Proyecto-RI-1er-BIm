I have a website that takes two primary get strings:               ?type=GAME&id=SomeGameID     ?type=SCENARIO&id=SomeScenarioID      for reasons unknown, I have recently begun receiving requests for erroneous get strings from both Yandex and Baidu. They are always in the form of:               ?type=GAME&id=SomeScenarioID      None of my users are triggering these errors, so I am (sort of) confident that this is not due to an HTML template error somewhere on my part. There is also no HTTP_REFER showing up in the $_SERVER array, so I'm guessing these are direct requests from bad dbase data on their part. I see two options for dealing with these bad requests, and would like to know which is recommended... or if there are other, better options I have not thought of:   1. simply 404 the request, since it is incorrect   2. redirect the request to `?type=SCENARIO&id=SomeScenarioID` because the scenario IDs are always valid, the breakage is due to asking for the wrong type.
