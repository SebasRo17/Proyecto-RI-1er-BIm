Are there any tools available for the following use case: I am planning to write a complex application and now I just know about the basic functional requirments. I am refining the functionality with more and more details. I am also writing down how to implement this in software architecture perspective. I am in a situation where there are multiple ways implement a certain functionality and based on the selected approach, other parts of the program will also change. At this moment, I don't want to decide on the approach to use, I just want to list down all the options, present to a wider audience and get it finalized. Are there any standard software tools to do this? I know I can use MS excel or some mind mapper tools, but just thinking of some standard tools (not just for programmers, but for managers and other) availability Thanks, Den
