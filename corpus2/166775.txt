In my university, our total required weekly attendance (for lectures and tutorials/similar) is about 12 hours. It was like that in the first year, and then everything required extremely little effort - I believe that if I invested as much efforts as someone who is studying for medicine or law, I could have learnt everything for 1-2 months - if not less! Now I'm second year and it doesn't look like it's going to be too different. This concerns me about the people who study in Oxford, Cambridge or Imperial College. It would be weird if they study that little, and it would be very concerning if they do study very hard, because this would mean that by the end of the year, their first year students will be better than our average third year student. Which is bad news for me, given that I share the market with them. I know the question can't have an absolutely accurate answer, but it can still be answered quite definitely, and it's relevant to many people.
