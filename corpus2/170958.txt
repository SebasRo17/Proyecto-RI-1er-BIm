I was looking at how file systems are designed and noticed that most places say that the directory hierarchy can be implemented using a hash table. Could someone please explain me how using a hash table to store a directory structure works? For example, what would happen if I add a file/ directory or move a directory, how does that affect the hash table? Also, how are paths involved?
