I'm planning on getting certification in Database Development for SQL Server (MSTC - 70-433). I'm a junior level report writer at a new job and the company is offering to pay the majority, if not all, of training course fees. The course is five days. I noticed that MS has a self-paced training kit (book) that I could use. I'm wondering if this would be a better option because it will allow me to go as quick as possible. I've also heard about video training sessions (Lynda.com) but they seem to go at slow pace. My questions are:   1. What should I expect at a certification course? Is it hands-on training? Small classes with personal feedback or not?   2. Would I be better off learning at my own pace using the training kit? (I'd rather this not turn into a certifications are pointless discussion..)
