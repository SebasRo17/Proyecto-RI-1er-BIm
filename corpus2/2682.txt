We’re working on a .Net framework which ultimately amounts to a single DLL. We intend to charge for commercial use of the framework, but make it free for open source/non-commercial use. The rough plan at the moment is to administer this through some form of fairly simple licence which will be issued whether you’re using it for free or paying. We’re debating whether to make the source code available. It’s our perception (and our own preference) that it’s far more appealing to use something where you have access to the source code. I’m interested in whether people think making the source code available will damage our ability to make money from the framework, or whether it will encourage more usage and enough “good” people will arrange to pay for the correct licence if using it commercially. My feeling is that, generally, commercial operations don’t mess about on the licencing front and so making the source code available will only encourage usage and therefore ultimately generate more revenue, but I’d be interested in others views/experience.
