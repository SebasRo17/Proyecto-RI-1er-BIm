What are the pros and cons of generating dynamic pages with javascript vs doing it in PHP? As an example, I want to display certain records from some database in a table and I'm considering the following approaches:   1. Use Javascript to get some response in JSON from some PHP page, then dynamically build the table in Javascript.   2. Write some PHP in the page which will make the query and iterate through the result set echoing the table markup. What are the pros and cons of each approach?
