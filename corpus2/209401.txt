I'm a developer working on a Wordpress project. I work on this alone and I want to improve the way I use Git but I don't know where to start. Currently, I'm using git to commit all of the work that I've done for the day as long as that specific work is done. Here are some instances where I commit a specific work:   * A specific feature whose code can be written within a day   * A bugfix For bigger features that can take weeks to finish I create a branch for it, then commit the sub-features once they're done. But often times I feel like I'm committing way too much; for example, when I'm trying to solve lots of bugs I do not commit each and every bug that I resolve. Sometimes I also end up working with 2 or more things that should be in there own commits. Then I'll find it hard to just target the specific files within a specific change so I end up putting them all in one commit and end up with a commit message like `add search feature and add caching feature`. What I want to know are the best practices for solo developers working with Git. For solo developers out there you're welcome to answer with your own workflow as well.
