I'm looking for suggestions on whether **we should build** _or_ **are there readymade applications** that do the following:   * Allow admins to build a structured workflow of support Q & A, similar to Windows Troubleshooting i.e. when you try one tip, you then get the next one.   * Allow end-users to search and follow the Q & A We have an existing Liferay portal which we would like to plug in this app to it - is there some suitable app like a CMS which does this? I mean building the structured questions - not just plain content like a wiki. Open source options are welcome, but I'd like to know of COTS as well.
