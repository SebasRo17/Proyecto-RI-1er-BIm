I've heard of TDD as an organizational development paradigm, where all developers are asked to let testing drive development, and I've also heard of organizations who don't embrace TDD so long as unit test coverage reaches close to 90 percent for the application. One thing I never hear is why an organization would set a standard for TDD specifically when it is an individual development discipline.
