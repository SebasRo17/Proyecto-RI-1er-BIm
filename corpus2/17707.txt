> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  How to Combine Pattern Constraints and Default Values for Function > Arguments First a simple example: define a function "add" with two arguments, and its second argument should be Positive and have a default value 1.               addv1[x_, (y_:1)?Positive] := x + y;     addv2[x_,y?Positive:1] := x + y;      these two just don't work as expected. So is it impossible to use `PatternTest` and `Optional` value on one `Pattern` simultaneously, considering the probability of its default value conflicting with its pattern test?
