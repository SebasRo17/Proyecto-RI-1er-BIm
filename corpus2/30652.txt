So I have been fiddling with this the last hour and I just can't get it to work. I have 3 matrices of the same size which contain nothing but 0's in a list, I also have 3 matrices of the same size (not same as first 3) that have different values in them (also in a list). I have a Coordinate x and y value as well (x is right, y is down). I want to replace the values of a small part of the matrices containing 0's with their corresponding matrix (corresponding one is the ones with different values) e.g. $a=\begin{matrix}0&0&0&0&0\\\0&0&0&0&0\\\0&0&0&0&0\\\0&0&0&0&0\\\0&0&0&0&0\end{matrix}$ $b=\begin{matrix}1&2&3\\\4&5&6\end{matrix}$ $CoordX=2$, $CoordY=3$ When I use the function, I want the output to be $Output->\begin{matrix}0&0&0&0&0\\\0&0&0&0&0\\\0&1&2&3&0\\\0&4&5&6&0\\\0&0&0&0&0\end{matrix}$ This was my attempt at the function but for the three matrices instead               CreatePlaceholderMatrix[Matrix_,CoordX_,CoordY_]:=     (PlaceholderMatrix=Table[0,{3},{64},{64}];     For[i=CoordX,i==CoordX+Dimensions[Matrix[[1]][[1]]][[1]]-1,i++      For[j=CoordY,j==CoordY+Dimensions[Matrix[[1]][[1]]][[1]]-1,j++       For[k=1,k==3,k++,PlaceholderMatrix[[k,i,j]]=Matrix[[k,1,i,j]]       ]      ]     ];     PlaceholderMatrix)      The value of Matrix is in the form of (and if it helps is square):               MatrixForm/@ImageData[Image,"Byte",Interleaving->False]      and that is why I needed an extra [[1]] whenever I referred to Matrix (not sure exactly why but it was the only value that worked). Anyways, whenever I run the function, it just presents PlaceholderMatrix as 3 64*64 Matrices of 0's and nothing else. It seems as if it didn't even go through the for loop. I also want the final answer to be in the same Format as matrix, so I can do operations with it later and convert it to an image If anyone can explain why this is happening, or any alternative method that may work better, please tell.
