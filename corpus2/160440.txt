[edit#2] If anyone from VMWare can hit me up with a copy of VMWare Fusion, I'd be more than happy to do the same as a VirtualBox vs VMWare comparison. Somehow I suspect the VMWare hypervisor will be better tuned for hyperthreading (see my answer too) I'm seeing something curious. As I increase the number of cores on my Windows 7 x64 virtual machine, the overall compile time **_increases_** instead of decreasing. Compiling is usually very well suited for parallel processing as in the middle part (post dependency mapping) you can simply call a compiler instance on each of your .c/.cpp/.cs/whatever file to build partial objects for the linker to take over. So I would have imagined that compiling would actually scale very well with # of cores. But what I'm seeing is:   * 8 cores: 1.89 sec   * 4 cores: 1.33 sec   * 2 cores: 1.24 sec   * 1 core: 1.15 sec Is this simply a design artifact due to a particular vendor's hypervisor implementation (type2:virtualbox in my case) or something more pervasive across more VMs to make hypervisor implementations more simpler? With so many factors, I seem to be able to make arguments both for and against this behavior - so if someone knows more about this than me, I'd be curious to read your answer. Thanks Sid [ _edit:addressing comments_ ] @MartinBeckett: Cold compiles were discarded. @MonsterTruck: Couldn't find an opensource project to compile directly. Would be great but can't screwup my dev env right now. @Mr Lister, @philosodad: Have 8 hw threads, using VirtualBox, so should be 1:1 mapping without emulation @Thorbjorn: I have 6.5GB for the VM and a smallish VS2012 project - it's quite unlikely that I'm swapping in/out trashing the page file. @All: If someone can point to an open source VS2010/VS2012 project, that might be a better community reference than my (proprietary) VS2012 project. Orchard and DNN seem to need environment tweaking to compile in VS2012. I really would like to see if someone with VMWare Fusion also sees this (for VMWare vs VirtualBox compartmentalization) **Test details:**   * Hardware: Macbook Pro Retina      * CPU : Core i7 @ 2.3Ghz (quad core, hyper threaded = 8 cores in windows task manager)     * Memory : 16 GB      * Disk : 256GB SSD   * Host OS: Mac OS X 10.8   * VM type: VirtualBox 4.1.18 (type 2 hypervisor)   * Guest OS: Windows 7 x64 SP1   * Compiler: VS2012 compiling a solution with 3 C# Azure projects      * Compile times measure by VS2012 plugin called 'VSCommands'     * All tests run 5 times, first 2 runs discarded, last 3 averaged
