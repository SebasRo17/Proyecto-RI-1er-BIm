Have you guys ever needed to define Integrate boundaries as equations? I tried to submit the equation as was written in original text but it seems that mathematica can't understand it.               kb = 0.001872041; Na =  6.02214129*10^23;     ep = 10.22; p = 2.56;          pot2[r_] := 4 ep ((p/r)^12 - (p/r)^6)          f[r_, T_] := Exp[-pot2[r]/(kb T)] - 1         B3[T_] := -8 \[Pi]^2/3  Na^2 \!\(     \*UnderoverscriptBox[\(\[Integral]\), \(0\), \(\[Infinity]\)]\(     \*UnderoverscriptBox[\(\[Integral]\), \(0\), \(\[Infinity]\)]\(     \*UnderoverscriptBox[\(\[Integral]\), \(Abs[r12 - r13]\), \(r12 +             r13\)]f[r12, T]\ f[r13, T]\ f[r23,             T]\ r12\ r13\ r23\ \[DifferentialD]r12 \[DifferentialD]r13 \     \[DifferentialD]r23\)\)\)      Original Text ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7xVkV.gif) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OQyGW.gif)
