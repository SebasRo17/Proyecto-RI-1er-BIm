As a web application developer, recently my work in creating Social Applications has taken a lot of momentum (specifically, Social Login buttons.) Is it ok to use my company's social network developer credentials for this? I don't want to sign each client up for between 1 and 20 different services based on their needs. It's a lot easier to just open up my Google Console and click 'new.'
