It is simple for Mathematica to find an asymptotic expansion for $\frac{1}{-1+p}$ as $p \rightarrow \infty$. However, if we want to restrict $p$ to be an integer and also include some terms that simplify for integer p (but not generally) then Series by itself will no longer do the job (without some prodding, I expect). Is there a simple way to use Series to find the asymptotic expansion of $$\frac{1}{(-1)^p+p}$$ as $p \rightarrow \infty$, assuming integer $p$?
