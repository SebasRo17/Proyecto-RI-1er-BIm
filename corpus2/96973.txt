This wiki page tells : > A schrödinbug is a bug that manifests only after someone reading source code > or using the program in an unusual way notices that it never should have > worked in the first place, at which point the program promptly stops working > for everybody until fixed. The Jargon File adds: "Though... this sounds > impossible, it happens; some programs have harbored latent schrödinbugs for > years." What is being talked about is very vague.. Can someone provide an example of how a schrödinbug is like (like with a fictional / real-life situation)?
