Using Mathematica what is an efficient way to generate a list of $n$ **random** two dimensional points $\\{x_i,y_i\\}$ where $i=1,...,n$ so that **no** two points $p_1$ and $p_2$ in the list has an Euclidean distance lower than say $d$ meaning $\|p_1-p_2\|\leq d$. I came up with the following solution. Though it works I wanted to know if some better method exists. **Code**               NodeGenetrator[LowerBound_, UpperBound_, DistanceBound_,SampleLength_] :=      Block[{list},           list = RandomReal[{LowerBound, UpperBound}, {1, 2}];           For[i = 0, Length@list <= SampleLength - 1, i++,               list = Module[{NewVal, dist},                             NewVal = RandomReal[{LowerBound, UpperBound}, 2];                             (*NewVal=RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[                             Mean@{LowerBound,UpperBound},DistanceBound],2];*)                             dist = Map[EuclideanDistance[NewVal, #] &, list];                             If[Min[dist] >= DistanceBound,                                 AppendTo[list, NewVal],                                 list                               ]                            ];              ];           list          ];     (* Define function parameters *)     LowerBound = 0;     UpperBound = 100;     DistanceBound = 5;     SampleLength = 60;     sample = NodeGenetrator[LowerBound, UpperBound, DistanceBound,SampleLength];     (ListPlot[#, Frame -> True, Axes -> False,PlotStyle -> PointSize[Large],     AspectRatio -> 1] &)@sample      **Output** ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gLa0e.png)   1. As one can see this code uses `For` loop and also keeps on iterating until number of points requested is not met. This somehow makes the _execution time_ for this function unpredictable!    2. As expected the parameter `DistanceBound` has a important effect on the function behavior. If we try `DistanceBound=12.5` function evaluation becomes very _time consuming_.   3. Here we check only one mutual distance condition but is it possible to use a more _general test function_ that checks for more than one mutual characteristics involving those requested number of points that are to be generated.
