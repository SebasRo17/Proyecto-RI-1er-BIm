I have a very big notebook with a command repeated a lot of times but with different parameters each time and I want to run all these commands at the same time without having to run separately all of them. Is there a way? **EDIT: more info** Between different calls of the 'command' there are other things (mainly plots) and I want to preserve the order of the notebook. Using the `Evaluate Notebook` form the menu `Evaluation` can be an option but when I am in a hurry this is bad because it evaluates also all the things in between while I am mainly interested in the output of my commands.
