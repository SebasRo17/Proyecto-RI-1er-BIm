I've been tasked to train a new MS Access developer that's moving into my department in a couple weeks. I'm not completely certain what his knowledge level is, but from what I've seen he knows very little if anything about basic design concepts like normalization. I don't think he even knows much VBA and is still primarily macro/wizard driven. There's no budget in my department for training, so free options are the only ones I could use. What resources could be recommended to help me teach him some of the basics and start developing a foundation to build on to get him up to speed?
