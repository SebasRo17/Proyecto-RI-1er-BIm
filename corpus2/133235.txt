I write a set of productivity tools that sells online and have tens of thousands of users. While we do get very good feedback, this tends to come from only the most vocal users, so we fear we might be missing the big picture. We would like to know if there is any off the shelf (or nearly so) solution to capture usage of different features and to report usage patterns and trends over time. Note: These tools are native apps, not web-based. I know about Google Analytics and the like. They're great, but I'm looking for native code solutions.
