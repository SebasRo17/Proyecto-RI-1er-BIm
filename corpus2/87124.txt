Let's say I checked out a version different than HEAD. Let's say I made some commits, and so an anonymous branch was created. Afterwards I may have checked out a different branch, so now the only way to get to my commits is via `reflog`. If do this:               >> git reflog | grep -i mycommit     sha1hash     >> git branch reattaching     >> git cherry-pick hash_of_commits     >> git checkout master     >> git merge reattaching      Is it the equivalent of:                  >> git reflog | grep -i mycommit         sha1hash        >> git branch reattaching sha1hash        >> git checkout master        >> git merge reattaching      What happens to the detached head commits, as I think that via cherry-picking, they will exist in 2 places. Will they forever remain in my repository?
