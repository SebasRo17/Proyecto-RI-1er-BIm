I've been baffled by a lot of the behaviours of _Mathematica 9_ â€” so much that I regret upgrading my copy of _Mathematica 8_ (I would downgrade but I'm currently on vacation). Here is an example:               DSolve[{x^2*y''[x] + x*y'[x] - y[x] == 0}, y[x], x]      should return the simple answer of C1*x + C2/x. In fact, this is what Wolfram Alpha returns and also Mupad (a Maple within Matlab). However, _Mathematica_ returns ![Mathematica picture](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PX7gW.png) Yes, I know you can simplify this for real output, but it baffles me why it doesn't do it in the first place. Moreover, once your differential equations become messy, this can be hard to do. I have encountered other examples where the output from Mathematica's `DSolve` seems to very strange indeed. This isn't an isolated example, and I encounter examples of these very simple DEs that _Mathematica_ fails to simplify in any sort of obvious way. I don't remember these difficulties in _Mathematica 8_ or previous versions. Does anybody know what is an easy fix or what's going on? I have also documented similar bugs in the series expansions here and here.
