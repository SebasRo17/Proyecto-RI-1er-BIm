When I was going through the project on which I am working, I came across a cpp file, which has only functions and static variables.I was wondering why they have not put everything into a class! Whenever the inside functions have to be called, the cpp file is included. Is this a good design? what are the pros and cons of these type of design? for ex.               //independent.cpp     #include "someclass.h"     static int var1;     static someclass object("hello");     static bool var2;          void foo(const char* dir, const char* filename){     ...     }          somefile.cpp     #include "independent.cpp"     class sample{     public:       void caller(){       foo("c:\", "file.txt");       }     }
