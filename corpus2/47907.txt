I discovered a strange behavior of the `Evaluate` function. Case 1:               Clear[f]     f[x_] := x^2     g[x_] := Evaluate[D[f[x], x]]     Clear[f]     g[x]      > >     2 x >   Case 2:               Clear[f]     f[x_] := x^2     g[x_] := Evaluate[D[f[x], x]] + f[x]     Clear[f]     g[x]      > >     f[x] + Derivative[1][f][x] >   I think the Case 2 behavior is strange, because the derivative of `f` isn't evaluated properly when `g` defined. Why do I see this difference?
