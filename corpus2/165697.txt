I am an experienced programmer but completely new to the market. Someone wants me to do a project for them, but I do not know how much it is worth. What are general guidelines/advices for finding what a project is worth on the market? If I can ask here about this particular one, it is a HTML5 site with a login/register form and a video player that has to play a lecture video and powerpoint slides synchronized. They'll give me the video, the audio the powerpoints. I should also do some editting on the video before.
