My company has decided to use stored procedures for everything dealing with the database (because they didn't know of any other way besides raw SQL), and as the saying goes "When in Rome..." so I try to follow. Recently I had to add a hack fix that required grabbing a database value, and since it was a single value from a single table I wrote it as inline SQL (parameterized, of course) since there didn't seem to be a need for a stored procedure for one trivial line of code used in a single part of the application as a kludge. Of course, I've now been told to fix it and only ever use Stored Procs for anything related to the database. This feels just a bit too much like blindly following dogma instead of using common sense. Don't get me wrong, I understand the purpose of having coding standards but I am also a proponent of ignoring standards when they don't make sense, not just blindly following them as though they were Gospel.
