If a controller gets to fat and model instantation starts to add up a service layer could be used.   * If I just wrap the logic inside a service class I will get a bunch of Services with one/two methods. This feels like a code smell. Any best practice regarding this?   * Can a service instantiate models?   * If a service instantiates models the services can't be unit tested. They can only be covered by integration tests?
