I'm fairly new to working as a programmer, at least working as a regular employee in-house for a company. I often become frustrated with my company's management style as they basically just pick out whatever random tasks catches the lead developer's fancy that day, or the day before, and give me the task (with tasks usually lasting less than 1 day). A lot of the tasks I have now are fairly small and are for adding enhancements to a web application, fixing bugs, etc. I am bothered, however, by the fact that they don't plan ahead so as to give me an written outline of projects a few days in advance so that if, for example, I am rusty on something I can at least familiarize myself with it on my own time or at least have a more relaxed approach to the job so that everything doesn't have to be so reactionary on my part (where I can mull things during off-time over before starting work on them, etc) I guess I'm just curious if this is the norm or if most development jobs value clearly laid out specifications for tasks and are able to prepare them somewhat in advance. I would be interested to hear anyone's experience / opinions, etc. Thanks
