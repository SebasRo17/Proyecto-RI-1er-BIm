I read this article Unobtrusive JavaScript with jQuery and I noticed these points in the slide page **11**   * some companies strip JavaScript at the firewall   * some run the NoScript Firefox extension to protect themselves from common XSS and CSRF attacks   * many mobile devices ignore JavaScript entirely   * screen readers **do** execute JavaScript but accessibility issues mean you may not want them to I did not understand the fourth point. What does it mean? I need your comment and responses on these points. Is not using JavaScript and switching to libraries like jQuery worth it? **UPDATE 1 :** whats the meaning of **Unobtrusive JavaScript with jQuery** ? and yes it does not say we should use libraries but we should have them on external files for that reason i asked my question.
