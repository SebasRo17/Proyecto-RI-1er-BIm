I'd like to make an animation showing how we wrap a rectangle to form a cylinder (by joining a pair of parallel sides). Here's my first pass:                Manipulate[         ParametricPlot3D[         t {Cos[theta], Sin[theta], rho} + (1 - t) {rho, -1, theta},          {theta, -Pi, Pi}, {rho, 0, 2},          PlotRange -> {{-1.5, 1.5}, {-1.5, 1.5}, {-1.5, 1.5}},          PerformanceGoal -> "Quality", ViewPoint -> {-2.3, 0.77, -2},          ViewVertical -> {-0.08, 1, -0.06}],       {t, 0, 1}]      I'd much prefer the simpler looking transformation (without the twists this animation shows) which we'd do by simply rotating the pair of parallel sides until they touch to form the cylinder.
