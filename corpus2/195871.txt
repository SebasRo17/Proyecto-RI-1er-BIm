I made the case to coworkers that deep levels of control flow was harmful to the readability of code. Example, taken from the relevant stack overflow question If you need more than 3 levels of indentation, you're screwed?:               for(int i=0; i<10; ++i){       Object val = repeat(i, someVar);       if(val.value > 3){         switch(val.item){           case DOG:             if(mProcess){               outputToUser(val);               doMoreThings(val, mMoreThingDoer);               if(mRepurpose){                 addExample(val);               }               // and so on, and so on...      As with most things, it's trivially easy to find opinions on this topic. I'm wondering however if someone can contribute more to it than that. Has there for example been done an actual study relevant to the problem? Or can other arguments be made that go beyond "I like X better"?
