Assume there is a library that is licensed under GPL. I want to use it is closed source project. I do following:   1. Create small wrapper application around that GPL library that listens to socket, parse messages and call GPL library. Then returns results back.   2. Release it's sources (to comply with GPL)   3. Create client for this wrapper in my main application and don't release sources. I know that this adds huge overhead compared to static/dynamic linking, but I am interested in theoretical way.
