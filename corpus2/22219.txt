We will be engaging large corporations to help them run various types of analysis, mostly code analysis of their applications. The storage requirements will likely be modest, hundreds of MB per client. My question is mostly aimed at finding the stack with existing frameworks, best practices and a community which will allow a rapid development process. I am comfortable with the .Net environment and am leaning towards Azure. Any thoughts?
