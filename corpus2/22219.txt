I want to write a function in Mathematica which has two inputs 'n' and 'd', and the output should be (in Latex notation) $$F(n,d) = \sum_{i[1],...,i[n] =0; i[1]+...+i[n]\leq d}^{d} C[i[1],...,i[n]] f[i[1],x[1]] f[i[2],x[2]] ...f[i[n],x[n]]$$ n and d are integers. The problem is that I can hard code `F` for a given `n` and `d` alright. But when I want to write a generic function which take in any `n` and `d` and spits out the required right hand side, it becomes difficult as I have to keep changing the array size along the way depending on the values of `n` and `d`. Probably, there is a simpler way to do this in Mathematica?
