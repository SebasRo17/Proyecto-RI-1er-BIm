There are a lot of manuals. I am trying to create an database to hold information of these documents. But, there is a small problem. How can I give meaningful id to the manuals? Are there any standard or logic behind the giving meaningful id to the documents? If there is no standard, can you tell me how I should do that? example:                table :                   manual id | manual name      EDIT:               Not Meaningful ID                1        or  M1        or   foo          2            C2             bar          3            P123           name         ...           ...            ...          (i)          (ii)            (iii)      (i) Not meaningful for me because if some item deleted, there can be gap. ex 1 33 100. (ii) random character can be confusing when one try to give a name to new manual (iii) Why giving name is not preferred is because finding a name to the manual as ID is hard after 500 manuals. Meaningful : New ID               * Can be easily produced even if after 1000 manuals     * Should not be so complicated
