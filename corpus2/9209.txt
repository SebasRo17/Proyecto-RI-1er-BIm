_Mathematica_ provides functions that perform a depth-first traversal, or which use such a traversal, including: `Scan`, `Count`, `Cases`, `Replace`, and `Position`. It is also the standard evaluation order therefore functions Mapped (`Map`, `MapAll`) will evaluate in a depth-first order. It is quite direct to do this:               expr = {{1, {2, 3}}, {4, 5}};          Scan[Print, expr, {0, -1}]      > 1 > > 2 > > 3 > > {2,3} > > {1,{2,3}} > > 4 > > 5 > > {4,5} > > {{1,{2,3}},{4,5}} How can one do a `Scan`-type operation breadth-first? (Simply storing then reordering the output is not adequate as it doesn't change the order in which expressions are visited.) `Scan` has the property that it does not build an output expression the way that e.g. `Map` does, which is quite appropriate for breadth-first scans, and conserves memory.
