I'm working with large data sets (>1gb) which I'm visualizing with `Manipulate[]`. The following example works fine for me with no additional memory overhead:               data = RandomReal[{0, 1}, {500, 500, 500}];     (* no memory overhead and fast response time *)     Manipulate[Image[data[[All, All, i]]], {i, 1, 500, 1}]      However, if I wrap the above code into a separate function definition, memory usage rises and evaluation does'n complete in a reasonable time:               vizData[dataVar_] := Manipulate[Image[dataVar[[All, All, i]]],{i, 1, 500, 1}]     (* very high memory usag and slow evaluation! *)     vizData[data]      How can I wrap the functionality of `Manipulate` into a function without this high memory utilization? Working with global variables is not an option because I'm dealing with multiple data sets.
