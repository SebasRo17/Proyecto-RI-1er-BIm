At my current job, I have coworkers who still throw interview questions at me even though I've been working there for 6 months. I though it would end after I got hired but then it continued on and on. What is appalling is that it is precisely the ones who are poor programmers (the manager and couple other guys) who do this most. How should I handle this situation? P.S. I have certainly seen this at other worksites in the past, but usually there is just one jerk with a chip on his should who does it. Here, it is many people.
