I'm facing the problem of counting the unique visitors of groups of places. Here is the situation: I have _visitors_ that can visit _places_. For example, that can be internet users visiting web pages, or customers going to restaurants. A visitor can visit as much places as he wishes, and a place can be visited by several visitors. A visitor can come to the same place several times. The places belong to _groups_. A group can obviously contain several places, and places can belong to several groups. Given that, for each visitor, we can have a list of visited places, how can I have the number of unique visitors per group of places? Example: I have visitors A, B, C and D; and I have places x, y and z. I have these visiting lists:               [      A -> [x,x,y,x],      B -> [],      C -> [z,z],      D -> [y,x,x,z]     ]      Having these number of unique visitors per place is quite easy:               [      x -> 2, // A and D visited x      y -> 2, // A and D visited y      z -> 2  // C and D visited z     ]      But if I have these groups:               [      G1 -> [x,y,z],      G2 -> [x,z],      G3 -> [x,y]     ]      How can I have this information?               [      G1 -> 3, // A, C and D visited x or y or z      G2 -> 3, // A, C and D visited x or z      G3 -> 2  // A and D visited x or y     ]      Additional notes :   1. There are so many places that it is not possible to store information about every possible group;   2. It's not a problem if approximation are made. I don't need 100% precision. Having a fast algorithm that tells me that there were 12345 visits in a group instead of 12543 is better than a slow algorithm telling the exact number. Let's say there can be ~5% deviation.   3. I have a finite number of visitors and a finite number of places. I don't have so much places (approximately 60 for now, but it can grow to 200) but I have quite many visitors (estimated to 50 millions and this number could grow to 200 millions in the next months). Is there an algorithm or class of algorithms that addresses this type of problem?
