I don't understand why people like to say "Images had to be distorted otherwise they would be easily cracked". I'm talking about those verification images that we had to type to identify that we are humans. Exactly what steps must we take to break even a simple image? like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vmPUb.png) Ok so i'm guess we had to read all the bytes of the image and try to draw some sense out of those bytes? because if that's _really_ how it is done it does seem really pretty tough (so what's with that comment that it's _easily cracked_ ), or is there a better way to crack images (that make it so easy after-all) ?
