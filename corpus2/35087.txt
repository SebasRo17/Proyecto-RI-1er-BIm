I'm having some real trouble with _Mathematica_ wrongly evaluating various symbolic sums at the moment. I have this function: $$h_{ij}(x) = \binom{j-1}{i-1}-\sum_{r=0}^{j-x-n-(k+1)/2-1}\binom{r+x+n+(1-k)/2}{i-k}\binom{j-r- x-n-5/2+k/2}{k-2}$$ and I use it in the following double summation: $$\sum_{1\leq s<t\leq2x+2n+1}h_{is}(x)h_{jt}(x)-h_{it}(x)h_{js}(x)$$ and I want to know what this summation is as a polynomial in $x$. The values $i,j,k,n$ are all integers, and it can be assumed that $x>0$. Here is my _Mathematica_ input for $h(x)$ (with a slight change of variable in the summand):               h[i_, j_, k_, x_, n_] :=       (Binomial[j - 1, i - 1] -        2*Sum[Binomial[r + i - k, i - k]*Binomial[j - i - r + k - 2, k - 2],        {r, x + n + (k + 1)/2 + 1 - i, j - i}])      and here is my code for the double summation:               summ[i_, j_, k_, x_, n_] :=      Sum[h[i, s, k, x, n]*h[j, t, k, x, n] - h[i, t, k, x, n]*h[j, s, k, x, n],       {t, 2, 2*x + 2*n + 1}, {s, 1, t - 1}]      Now the thing that is really bothering me is a discrepency between evaluating these functions where $x$ is undetermined. I know from other calculations that when $x=1,i=1,j=3,k=3$ and $n=2$, the function `summ` should return 96, which it does. However if leave $x$ undetermined I get the following output:               summ[1,3,3,x,2]      > >     1/3 (x + 2) (x + 3) (2 x + 5)^2   >   Which gives 196 when $x=1$, which is a) in disagreement with my other calculations; and b) in disagreement with _Mathematica_ 's answer for when I specify $x=1$. Please can someone help me understand why this happens? It's driving me up the wall.
