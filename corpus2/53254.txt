I am looking for more information on a **gradual release process** \- that is when you release new version of a software only to certain set of end users, mostly geographically limited (or limited by a reach of particular server). Google seems to be blind to this term - that indicates that's not how it's called. What's the name then? EDIT: An example of what I mean is when Facebook rolled out new image galleries they were first visible to certain users only, then to whole US and then to the rest of the world.
