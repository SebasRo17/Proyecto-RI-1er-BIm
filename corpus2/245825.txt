Say we have a GPL library (CGAL for example). We have a big tasks chain like pipes modeling and testing. We would love to use library for our indoors application yet we must open sources... so we make a minimal application that takes arguments and files in, and returns files and data out. And is being used like `closedSourceApp > GPLApp > closedSourceApp`. And all interesting/relevant parts are excluded from GPL app. At the same time GPL library is not used at its full potential and does not get integrated into bigger applications. So the question is what reasons were behind GPL license idea to force project new code to live under it?
