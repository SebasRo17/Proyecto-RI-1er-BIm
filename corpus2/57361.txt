I have a big list which in principle can be described as this more compact list :               list1 = {{e, {{a, 0.1}, {b, 0.3}, {c, 0.5}, {d, 0.7}},          f, {{a, 0.2}, {b, 0.4}, {c, 0.6}, {d, 0.8}}, g, h, i}};      I am interested in rewriting to the following :               {{e, {"abcd", 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7}, f, {"abcd", 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8}, g,        h, i}}      which works well when applying this simple rule:               list1 /. {{a, x1_}, {b, x2_}, {c, x3_}, {d, x4_}} -> {"abcd", x1, x2,         x3, x4}      However when the affected sublists `{a,x1}` to `{d,x4}` are not on the same depth, I have difficulties constructing a rule that works. So for instance:               list2 = {{e, {a, 0.1}, {b, 0.3}, {c, 0.5}, {d, 0.7},         f, {{a, 0.2}, {b, 0.4}, {c, 0.6}, {d, 0.8}}, g, h, i}}      does not give the desired result. So my questions are: 1\. Is there a way to ReplaceAll independent of depth? 2\. Is there a more elegant method that does the job?
