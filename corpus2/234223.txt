I am primarily from a .net background. During the course of my regular job I find it tiring to keep up with all the relevant technologies (angular js, windows workflow, wcf, Jquery, SSIS, SSRS, asp.net ...). Since most of the top technology companies out there are java based, I am considering making a switch to java. But I am concerned that me devoting time to java might result in me lagging behind in .net (which is very vast ocean in itself). I don't want to spend a few years getting good at java only to realize that I ended up being a jack of all trades and who is not really good at anything. I know I am asking a very general question that may be hard to answer. But I am still hoping, some of the seasoned veterans with many years of experience, can give me some advice on this.
