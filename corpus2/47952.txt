I have a list of strings,               {"x1", "x2", "x3", "x4"}      And a list of linear equations:               {"x1" + "x3" - "x4" == 0, "x1" + "x2" + "x3" == 0}      How can I use `Eliminate` to eliminate `"x1"` from these equations? It complains that `"x1"` is not a valid variable. Is there a workaround?
