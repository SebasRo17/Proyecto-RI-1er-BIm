I'm implementing the first answer to my earlier question about redirecting the output of Print[ ]. Opening a file with `OpenWrite[]` and assigning the stream to `$Output` seems to work satisfactorily. However, `Close[]` gives the error message shown below, and doesn't close the file. Does anyone know what's wrong? (Print statements and other code goes between opening the output stream and attempting to close it) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dwPTz.jpg)
