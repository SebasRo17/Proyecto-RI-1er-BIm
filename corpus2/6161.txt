In Mathematica I'm trying to render a polygon as a set of vertices and directed edges. What I have so far:               Graphics[Polygon[{{1, 10}, {2, 4}, {10, 5}, {20, 10}}]]      I see Mathematica has the `Graph` and `PathGraph` commands - both of which have a `DirectedEdges` option - but it seems like I have no control over the position of the vertices with these commands. If I could customize the fill and edge/stroke of the `Polygon` command, that would be acceptable - but I'm not seeing how to do it. It looks like this command is specifically meant to draw filled polygons. I'd also be OK with a custom Mathematica routine to draw what I want using a loop and multiple `Line` commands within a `Graphics` command - but I can't see how to draw the lines as arrows (I'm sure I could make the routine do this with _three_ `Line`s per edge, but I really just think I'm missing something here.)
