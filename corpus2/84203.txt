There are a lot of ways of typing code, but I can't understand what is the good reason to adopt a certain standard or style if it does not change the way the code can be read and understood. Everyone can type code the way (s)he thinks it's better, but is there a really good reason to force all programmers for a certain style ? Does it really make a difference in the end ? Is it for pleasing the managing folks, or the control freaks ? Apart from this post about those very stupid coding standard, are there companies who encourage employees to choose what works for them ? EDIT: Wow thanks for the answers, the thing that made me post this is the BSD vs K&R brace style: this is a big issue, and this really made me rant.
