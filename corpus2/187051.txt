We have a system whereby the database connection is get once using a common method, and being pass throughout the relevant class to be used. There are doubts that passing the database connection as a parameter to different classes would cause problem, so i'm checking here to see whether this is actually viable, and are there any better patterns to do it? I know there are some ORM tools to do the persistence but we can't go into that, yet.. Any feedback is welcomed, thanks.
