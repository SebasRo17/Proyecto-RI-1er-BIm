For the longest time in places like Java's IRC channel, SO, and other places I've been told something along the lines of "Worry about how the code looks and its readability/understandability now, and performance later if absolutely necessary". So for the longest time, I haven't really been OCD about performance for my small desktop or web apps, just removing the obviously inefficient. Most responses are "What about scalability?". Thats a legitimate point, but if my app was only built to parse, say, files 10,000 lines long, should I make my code a mess for the small percentage of people that are going to shove in a 1,000,000 line file? My main question is when should I trade the easy but somewhat inefficient ways of doing tasks for big giant complicated beasts that do things extremely quickly but destroy any possible ways of upgrading and make the code excessively difficult and prone to rewriting anyway by the next developer?
