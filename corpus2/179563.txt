I have been programming for many years but I am still not comfortable with the concept of "Interfaces". I try to use interfaces but many times I don't see a mandatory use for it. I think this is probably because the projects weren't so big, or because interfaces are more useful when teamwork is involved. So, making another attempt to understand the importance of interfaces, here is my question: What problems will I face if I remove the concept of interfaces from my code?
