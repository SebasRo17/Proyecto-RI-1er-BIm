I'm designing a payroll system I have designed a database with several tables and this question is related to following tables `EMPLOYEE (Employee_ID [pk], Name,... etc)` `LOCATION (Location_ID [pk], Name, Address, ...etc)` These two tables have many to many relationship as one employee can work in several locations and in a location, several employees are working. These two tables are related through `ATTENDANCE` table. `ATTENDANCE (Employee_ID, Location_ID, Shift_Type, In, Out)` Shift type would be either "Day" or "Night" and "In" / "Out" fields are `DateTime` fields. The shift type is decided based on the date in the field "In" . For example if an employee's `In` field is lets say -`06/22/2014 07:30:00 PM` then the shift type is `Night` and shift is belongs to 22/06/2014. (his `Out` time would be `23/06/2014 07:30AM`; that is on next day) THE CONDITION is that, an Employee can't work same shift on same date twice even in two locations. But an employee can work Day in a location and Night in another location. My initial primary key selection ATTENDANCE table was `(Employee_ID + In)` but that is wrong as an employee can work same shift in same day if the `In` time is slightly different in two occasions. So now I know the primary key should be some thing like `(Employee_ID + Shift_Type + Shift_Date)`. But the problem is I don't have a Date field in the ATTENDANCE table. But I have `In` field which is a `DateTime` field. Hopping that my understanding about the issue is correct..., My question is, with out adding another field to ATTENDANCE table as `Shift_Date`, is there a possibility to get the Date part of the field `In`, when creating a `PRIMARY KEY` for this table ?
