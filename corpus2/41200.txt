I've always wondered how do you find **undocumented / private** API ? Example the _Apple_ undocumented / private API, _Play Station_ , _Windows Phone 7_ , _Win32 Kernel_ , _Windows API_ , _hidden callback_ , etc... What tools do hackers use to find out about private and undocumented functions? Where can I read about peoples' experiences delving into private APIs and reverse engineering techniques which reveal the secrets which are normally explained in API documentation? thanks,   A
