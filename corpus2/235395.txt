I am working on a project with several older programmer and we were doing up the documentation of the program when I had a heated debate with one of the older programmers regarding the term : `Kilobyte`. He wanted to stick to the old way of using `Kilobytes` to represent 1024 bytes as he said most programmers understood the term : Kilobyte to represent 1024 bytes. I wanted the new way of using `Kibibyte` to represent 1024 bytes as we can't forever be stuck in our old ways and this has been updated by the community. How should I resolve this conflict with him so as to appease both of us ??
