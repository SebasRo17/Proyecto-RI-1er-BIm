On my 20 years on this planet I have never had a job. I am a CS student who just finished his first year at uni with a 3.8 GPA. I will be applying for internships next fall, and I will have a nice portfolio of "stuff" I can showcase (a mix of web, mobile, and desktop applications) on my resume. But... I don't have any work experience whatsoever. No job folding shirts in the mall; no flipping burgers at Wendy's; nada. Will it be difficult for me to land an internship given that I have no prior work experience? Should I try to find any kind of job in the interval between now and next fall, so I can at least put something down? On a side note, how would it look if I marked myself as "self-employed" as a freelancer selling custom-made websites and web apps (which is something I am planning on doing with a friend)? Would that make up for my lack of real world experience? Would employers eat that kind of thing up? Any and all insight is appreciated!
