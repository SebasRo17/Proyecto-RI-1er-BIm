I want to define my own little 'Inner Product' function satisfying properties of linearity and commutativity, and I'd like to use the "$\langle$" and "$\rangle$" symbols to output my results. For this I am using `AngleBracket` which has no built-in meaning. I was able to use `SetAttributes[AngleBracket,Orderless]` to give my inner product the property of commutativity. $\langle v,w\rangle=\langle w,v\rangle$. Then I am able to inconsistently get the AngleBracket to distribute over addition using for example `Distribute[AngleBracket[u+v,w]]` But I am at a loss to impose the conditions $\langle a v, w\rangle=a\langle v,w \rangle$ where $a$ satisfies `NumericQ[a]==True`, and especially $\langle 0,v\rangle = 0$. How can do this? Do I need to write my own 'myInnerProductSimplify' function?
