What is an efficient way to create a list of (psudo)randomly chosen permutations? I'm trying to create a list like below:               x = 5;     RandomChoice[Permutations[Range[1, x]], {x}]          {{1, 2, 4, 5, 3}, {5, 3, 1, 2, 4}, {5, 2, 3, 1, 4}, {1, 3, 2, 4, 5}, {3, 2, 4, 5, 1}}      However, this eats up a lot of memory and doesn't work after x=11. Each sub-list does not necessarily have to be unique, but in this case it was.
