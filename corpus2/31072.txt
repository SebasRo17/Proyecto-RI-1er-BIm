I am running _Mathematica_ on a computer with mulicpu and every cpu has multicore. I am wondering if there exist a method to send different cell evaluation to different core? So if I already have a cell being evaluating for a long time, I can still add other cells into evaluation at the same time, while won't have to stop the current evaluation or wait until the current evaluation to be done.
