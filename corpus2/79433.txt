How often do you correct others when they say something that is inaccurate? For example I recently corrected someone when they kept referring to a forward slash as a backslash. He made the reference several times so I knew it wasn't a slip of the tongue. Furthermore, I wasn't trying to " _Display my vast knowledge_ " I just thought he might like to know. A couple of guys here write code in VB.NET, for some reason the non technical people in charge got the term VBN or VBN.NET in their heads and no one corrected them. So now thats what they call it. Everyone here knows what they mean when they say VBN though, so I guess theres no real harm. I personally love to learn so I gladly welcome most corrections, so I can learn whats right. I feel like other people just get annoyed when corrected. Should some fallacies be left alone or is it always OK to simply say: > Actually its called VB.NET, I think maybe you were confusing it with VPN. Or am I just being pedantic? Correcting mistakes in someones code is always fine, but are there any guidelines to correcting people outside of code reviews? Are there different rules I should follow in correcting Technical vs Non Technical people? I don't want to be an information hoarder, but I don't want to be an annoying pedant either.
