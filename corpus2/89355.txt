When I try to design an OO solution ,I generally use the CRC modelling wherein I list the class names (nouns), what they do(verbs) and how they collaborate with other classes. This blog has the below thing to say about this noun-verb approach                  ...This approach, which I will call “noun and verb,” is so limited         I’ll dare to call it brain damaged....      My question is, does a better modelling technique exist to use OO approach?
