I had a discussion with a friend about row vs column oriented RDBMS. From my understanding, these things are closely linked with the fact that there's a concrete drive head reading and writing the data. This head moves and reading/writing data is faster if the head moves are limited. Still from my understanding, SSD drives drops those mechanical artifacts and accessing the data is now taking the same amount time regardless of where they are physically stored on the chip / device (don't know the right term). Considering these two points, will the SSD drives (when they'll have reached their full potential) make the distinction between row oriented and column oriented either obsolete or pointless?
