$m, r$ are parameters in the following integral:               Integrate[z Exp[I z r]/Sqrt[z^2 + m^2], {z, -∞, ∞}]      How to do this integration directly? The result should be `2 I m BesselK[1, mr]`. This post may be helpful, but I haven't found anything to solve this question. As suggested by b.gatessucks, this integration can be converted to the following one which can be computed by Mathematica:               Integrate[Exp[I z r]/Sqrt[z^2 + m^2], {z, -∞, ∞}]      and its result is `2 BesselK[0, m r]`. But this method may be not general, because we do not know which form can be recognized by Mathematica for other similar problems.
