I'd like to know if there is a possibility to solve an equation in a while loop with 2 different steps. I want the step to be small at the beginning and bigger after a certain value of sigma (sigma is the parameter that changes). I don't have an exemple and didn't find anything near it here. It would look like : `If[sigma<0.5,iteration=0.05 Then[While[Solve[hat==0, x], Else[While[Solve[hat==0, x], with iteration 0.1]]]` "hat" is a system of equation (long to obtain and I can't copy everything); I want to know if it is possible, otherwise I'll just put the results together on a plot. Thanks!
