I have a couple of big lists (each of them contains elements that are themselves lists of two elements, i.e. an element of each list that I have is of the form {x, y}) that I want to save/export. Their generation namely takes hours, and I don't want to do this every single day. I looked at the Mathematica help section on this (http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/tutorial/ImportingAndExportingData.html), but found that if I follow the example, I can't just import the data back into a list as it was before. It just ends up being something really messy. So given such a list, say, list = {{1,2}, {1,3}, ... , {500, 500}}, what do I do, so that the next day I can just write list = Import[...]?
