I am trying to build a very large graph with approximately $16\,000\,000$ edges, each being a two-dimensional integer vector. I have a list of edges in the form $\\{\\{e_{11}, e_{12}\\}, \\{e_{21}, e_{22}\\}, \dotsc\\}$, where $e_{11} = \\{n, m\\}$, etc. To convert it into a usable edge-list I need to turn every element of this list into a rule:               edgeList = MapThread[Rule, Transpose[edgelist]];      This works fast enough when there are $3\,000\,000$ edges but is too slow for $16\,000\,000$. What is the best way to speed up the threading?
