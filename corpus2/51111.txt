In More efficient implementation for comparing coefficient lists in a Do-loop link, george2079 posts in his first answer a piece of code that takes 352 seconds to compute. When I run this same piece of code on my 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 MacBook Pro laptop, it takes 853 seconds. What are the reasons for this, and how can I get the code running optimally on my machine? (Would it be appreciably faster if I used a desktop?) Perhaps this question is best posed to George2079, but the original thread is unfortunately dead and there doesn't seem to be a way to contact individual users.
