There's two of us working on something. We're using this branch structure   * master   * dev-A   * dev-B We both work on separate branches (dev-A,B) and whenever we're done - we promote our changes to master. But the drawback of this is we can't get changes the other developer makes. Everything exists in the master tree - but we can't get the latest updates the other developer made. Is there a way to resolve this or should we change our branch structure (per feature?)?
