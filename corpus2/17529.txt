I have written a module for my assignment like below.                V[n + 1] = rk[x[n], y[n] ,z[n], V[n]];      vs = V[n].V[n+1];      V[n + 1] =       I want to modify it with efficient and faster built-in functions like `FoldList`,`FixedPoint`,`ComposeList` etc. I tried `FoldList`, however, I can't get the right syntax for my program. Can I use these functions for this purpose? How would I write them? Or is it better to use program like this? Any help is appreciated.
