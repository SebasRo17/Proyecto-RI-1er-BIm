We have several hundred ASPX files (could be more than that, into the thousands, I haven't actually counted) that currently use no architecture and have all the logic/data access in code-behind files. Moving forward I want to push using `Model-View-Presenter` (probably the "Supervising Controller" version) to try and get some clean separation. What would be the best approach to logically lay out these files in my Presentation library? Most of the aspx files aren't organized and just thrown into the main directory, but some are grouped (or are misgrouped e.g. having customer-related files in a folder called "orders"). Should I try to group presenters and views by modules (e.g. have `Presentation.Views.Customers` and/or `Presentation.Customers`)? The correct approach does **not** seem to be just have hundreds of `XPresenter` and `XView` files thrown into the class library.
