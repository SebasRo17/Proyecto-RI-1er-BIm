There are lots of great demonstrations that show how to get periodic functions in the unit circle. I'm wondering how hard it would be to simulate a "moving grid" similar to this video on youtube (at about 1 minute) The circle and moving points are easy , but I don't know how to simulate that grid and sinusoid moving under the moving points. Any help would be appreciated. Here is my start, lots of possibilities to make this look better cosmetically, but the moving "paper" is something that would really help to illustrate the idea.               Manipulate[Graphics[{        Circle[],        PointSize[0.012],        Point[{Cos[t], Sin[t]}],        Point[{0, Sin[t]}]        }, PlotRange -> {{-1.1, 11}, {-1.1, 1.1}},        ImageSize -> {500, 100}], {t, 0, 10}]
