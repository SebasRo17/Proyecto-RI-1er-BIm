I have a (large) software project in a git repository. There is a benchmark suite that spits out lots of numbers (time per benchmark, allocations done per benchmark) Iâ€™d like to track. What is the best way to get a grip on intended and unintended performance changes in such a setup? (Ideally, I think, there is a piece of free software that takes a git repository, a script to obtain the numbers, schedules jobs for new commit, also checks old commits when idle and presents a slick web interface with lots of graphs and analysis tools.)
