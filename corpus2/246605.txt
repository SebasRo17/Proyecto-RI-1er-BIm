I was given a task to prototype a Desktop Application with the ff. requirements:   1. Must use javascript, nodewebkit, node.js   2. Must be multi platform specially Windows and OSX   3. Can take a screenshot of a certain area where a use can point and drag   4. Must be able to watch multiple directories for changes Mostly `1,2,4` are possible but I can't get my head around (3) how I will take screen shots on specific areas depending on user point and drag input with only web technologies? What are ideas on this? I also plan to use angularJS/css for the UI.
