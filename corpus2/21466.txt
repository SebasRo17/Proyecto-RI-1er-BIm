My task is something like this:               PrependTo[Evaluate[Table[{x, Sin[x]}, {x, 0.1, 2 \[Pi], 0.1}], {0., 1.}]]      where I tried also skipping the               Evaluate       and I get a               PrependTo::rvalue:      error. If I do:               a = Table[{x, Sin[x]}, {x, 0.1, 2 \[Pi], 0.1}];     b = PrependTo[b, {0., 0.}];      everything works fine. I want it to be a part of a big code, so doing it in one line without defining the first list separately would speed up the program. And I don't need the first list, only the second one, so why should I store both? How can I deal with this problem? Edit: The case is to make               Join[{{0., 0.}}, Table[{x, Sin[x]}, {x, 0.1, 2 \[Pi], 0.1}], 1]      but are there other, maybe better, solutions?
