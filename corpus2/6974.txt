My function is something like this,               a[x_Real?(# > 0) &] := Plot[x*Sin[y], {y, 0, 10}];      But, `a[5]` returns nothing but `a[5]`. This function doesn't work either,               a[x_Real/;(# > 0) &] := Plot[x*Sin[y], {y, 0, 10}];      I'm very much confused. Can anybody tell me why these won't work?
