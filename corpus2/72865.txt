I have read quite a bit about the Go language, and it seems promising. The last important bit of information I am missing before I decide on spending more effort on the language is: How much money/man power does Google or other companies invest in the development effort? If this information cannot be provided, do you have any other information showing the commitment of Google to the project. Is it being used as the primary language for a new investment or similar (my guess is that it is too early for this, but I do not know)?
