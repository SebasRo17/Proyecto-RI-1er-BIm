This is more of a business / ethics type of question that incorporates programming principles. So I as a developer will be selling a database driven web application to a local college university. I am currently working on the program and I coming up across a couple issues that would be easily worked with using javascript. Now I know some people do not use javascript at all so I wanted to know would forcing the usage of javascript (for the user interface only not the sites functionality) be wrong in an ethical / professional / business aspect? - I can't really find much information on this. My way of thinking about it is, that since it is a intranet application that the college is actively wanting and understand the features that come with the application it shouldn't be a problem right? * * * I just want to state that currently the app is not intensively javascript, but a lot of things that would be "easier" with javascript or just make the UI look better are not there. I also want to stress that the functionality will be PHP based and not dependent on Jquery.
