I just want to generate one stochastic process, whereas I want to be able to manipulate the start value and the volatility. Furthermore, the process should stop when it reaches 5 However, as soon as I use the SeedRandom[seed] function some error occurs. Hope you can help me. I also want the function to start at 0 and not at 1 Definition function of: (* x[t+1]=x[t]+μ (drift) + shock[t]; which stops at threshold*) My code:               σ = 0.2     SeedRandom[85]; shock1 =      RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[0, σ],(*time interval/Length of paths*) 10]          μ = 0.1            step[x_, μ_, shock1_] :=       If[x == 5, 5, If[x + μ + shock1 < 5, 5, x + μ + shock1]]               p1 = FoldList[step, 10, shock1]          ListLogPlot[p1, Joined -> True]      This Works perfectly, however, as soon as I enter the following i get some Problems:               Manipulate[SeedRandom[seed];       shock1 = RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[0, σ1], 10]; μ =        0.1; step[x_, μ_, shock1_] :=        If[x == 5, 5, If[x + μ + shock1 < 5, 5, x + μ + shock1]];       ListLogPlot[FoldList[step, S, shock1], Joined -> True], {S, 10,        50}, {σ1, 0.1, 1}]      I get the following error-message: "Argument seed in SeedRandom[seed] should be an integer or a string. " But when I enter:               Manipulate[SeedRandom[85];       shock1 = RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[0, σ1], 10]; μ =        0.1; step[x_, μ_, shock1_] :=        If[x == 5, 5, If[x + μ + shock1 < 5, 5, x + μ + shock1]];       ListLogPlot[FoldList[step, S, shock1], Joined -> True], {S, 10,        50}, {σ1, 0.1, 1}]      and try to manipulate the volatility just nothing happens. do you have any solutions for my problem?
