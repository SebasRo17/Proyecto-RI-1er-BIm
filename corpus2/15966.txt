I have the following code, schematically:               $runningLogFile = "data.txt";          If[FileExistsQ[$runningLogFile], Get[$runningLogFile], Export[$runningLogFile, "", "Text"];];          f[x_, y_] := Block[{},         (*do some calculation*)         (*put append result to $runningLogFile*)     ]          LaunchKernels[$ProcessorCount];     DistributeDefinitions[...];      ParallelTable[f[x,y], {x, 1, 10}, {y, 0, 15}];      This code works well, except for the fact that very ocassionally (surprisingly few times in fact, but still annoying) two threads try to write the result out to `$runningLogFile` at the same time, and the results output get spliced together. Is there a way to do this in a thread safe manner? (perhaps similar to `critical` procedure in openmp)
