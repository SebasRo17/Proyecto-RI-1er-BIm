I'm developing a program using a library made by another programmer (he works in the same company). Recently I discovered a leak in the library, which happens under certain network conditions after a few hours of running. I filed a bug with description of conditions to make this leak happen. That developer answered that "this is not enough", "it's not his responsibility to reproduce bugs" and I have to create unit test to reproduce this bug, otherwise he doesn't do anything.   1. Is he right?    2. What I can do in this situation? Creating unit test is impossible, because it depends on some random network timings.
