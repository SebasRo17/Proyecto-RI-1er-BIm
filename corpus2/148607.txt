Perl has this really cool documentation method that makes documenting really easy. It's called POD (Plain Old Documentation). Here is an example:               =head1 NAME          Example::Module - an example          =head1 SYNOPSIS              use Example::Module;         my $object = Example::Module->new();         print $object->as_string;          =head1 DESCRIPTION          Just an example.          =head2 Methods          =over 12          =item C<new>          Returns a new My::Module object.          =item C<as_string>          Returns a stringified representation of     the object. This is mainly for debugging     purposes.          =back          =head1 LICENSE          This is released under the Artistic      License. See L<perlartistic>.          =head1 AUTHOR          Dynamic           =head1 SEE ALSO          L<perlpod>          =cut      The output of this would be in HTML, like this example on CPAN (not what I wrote). Cool right! So is there a method similar to POD in which a developer can put there documentation inside of the code itself, without it being a comment?
