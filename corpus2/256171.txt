It's pretty straight forward: You have an object (let's say a car, or house, or clothes, or whatever), and all you want to do is to add different kind of textures to it (Let's say one can add 5-10 different types of textures to the object) The object will pretty much be static (in movement), and I'd like a pretty fast rendering time. The textures can be uploaded by the user, or picked from a DB. Sounds like a really easy project, but I'm very new to app programming. I've done some programming before, but mostly just Windows(C#,Java,Python) and microcontroller stuff(C). Where should I start? From similar products that I've seen, they seem to use everything from Asp.net to Flash for their solutions(these are websites, though).
