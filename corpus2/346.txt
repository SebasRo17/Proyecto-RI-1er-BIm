Recent versions of Mathematica provide the option of having a unique `$Context` for each cell group, via:   * Evaluation > Notebook's Default Context > Unique to Each Cell Group This is an appealing concept, but I find it unusable, as my code spans multiple cell groups. I would like a way to specify a unique context for cell groups _of a certain level_ such as every `Section`, but _not_ a separate context for every `Subsection` or `Subsubsection`. A solution will need to affect new cell groups as they are created.
