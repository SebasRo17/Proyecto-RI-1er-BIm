I am considering using GridSQL in a production environment. However, I do have some indications that it is not ready. One is that it got excluded by the offering of EnterpriseDB a while ago, and the forums seem to report a few wrong results and relatively severe bugs. The alternatives to GridSQL, however cost around 100.000$ to buy, so I was thinking to utilize some of this money to ensure that GridSQL gets ready for production. At the same time, I could risk spending 50.000$ and months of work on the development of GridSQL, just to discover that the design was flawed and that a complete rewrite is needed. Then I would have to buy the commercial alternatives to GridSQL and the existence of my startup would be at risk. **Question** What steps would you take to ensure that there is as little risk as possible that the worst case scenario described above would happen? It is unrealistic that I could do much testing nor code review/coding myself (I am also not the best developer), so please describe where to find the guys that would need to do the work.
