Is it possible for _Mathematica_ to layout a graph so that the connections lie on a grid? Furthermore, for graphs with multiple edges per vertex, is it possible to specify the location on the vertex for each connection? The context of this question is to use _Mathematica_ 's graph functionality to represent / visualize networks of circuit components. Each component has some number of input and output ports and I would like to be able to generate a network layout based on a connectivity map (netlist). I've been using `GraphPlot` and `LayeredGraphPlot` and have looked through quite a few different options but none that quite address these issues. ===== EDIT (by @VitaliyKaurov): ==== Reading @Szabolcs and @gsarma comments I am posting the image they to refer and which is approximately what is needed. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/R2Uim.png)
