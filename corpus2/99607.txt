People say definition is used when the declared stuff has some memory allocated. If I declare a class               class fish     {       char* name;       int type;       //someting i dont know about fish     };      int main()     {         fish a;        return 0;     }      Should it mean this is a declared fish or a defined fish ? Let me try first! it is called a defined fish! I now leave a breapoint at //something..... (that is a valid declaration of something I just dont know) Do you know what is there that at //someting the debugger may never reach ? Does that also mean there is no memory allocation for it. I'll be deeply sad to hear a no.
