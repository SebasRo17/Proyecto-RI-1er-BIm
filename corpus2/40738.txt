$$\sum_{k=1}^na_k=a_1+...+a_n$$ $$\prod_{k=1}^na_k=a_1\cdot...\cdot a_n$$ $$\large{?}\small{_{k=1}^na_k=a_1~\&\&...\&\& ~a_n}$$ What in mathematica would allow me to index logical statements in an operation like AND or OR? I'm trying to solve a system of n vector equations, so I can't afford to type them all in manually into the argument of Solve[]. Someone suggested that I take the product of the equations, i.e. if $a_i=(x_i=y_i)$, then $$a_1~\&\&...\&\& ~a_n\leftrightarrow \prod_{k=1}^n(x_i- y_i)$$ However, $x_i,y_i$ are vectors, and even their lengths vary, depending on $i$. Does anyone know how to solve this issue?
