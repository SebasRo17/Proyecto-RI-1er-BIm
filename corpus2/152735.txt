I have a very beginner question regarding web development. I've had some experience with JSP, Hibernate, and MAMP to create a simple system for tracking inventory and sales. But this was all done locally on one computer. This time, I want to create a system that could be accessible online. It's to help my mother track her business wherever she goes. So there would be similar aspects like tracking inventory and sales. I understand that you have to have a server in which to host all the files in. But I don't understand how you can access your database online. Or what sorts of applications or products should be used. Currently the host of my database is localhost. How do put it online such that you can still do CRUD operations? Are there any guides to do this?
