Using third party libraries for productivity gains in software development is common. Unfortunately, along with the library's functionality we also import its bugs. Some of them get fixed in subsequent releases. So, to upgrade or not to upgrade, this is the question. I am interested in learning from experiences when upgrading to a newer version of the library was desirable, but after a cost/benefit analysis the conclusion was that upgrading was not a good solution "in the grand scheme of things". I am interested in finding out what _forces_ influence the decision towards _not_ upgrading.
