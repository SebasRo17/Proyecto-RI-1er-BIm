It is considered better to have a separate factory class than having static methods in same class. See this question. But the standard API uses both approaches. Separate factory:               DatatypeFactory.newInstance().newXMLGregorianCalendar(...)      Static methods in same class:               Calendar.getInstance(...)      Why is this? In what case would having static methods be better than having a separate factory?
