Functions like `Mean` and `RandomVariate` clearly infer the dimension of the distribution passed to them. One can also usually determine the dimension of a distribution by calling one of these functions, but this is suboptimal. `RandomVariate` does not work if some of the parameters of the distribution are symbolic and long tailed distributions may not have a well defined mean. Even when this method works it is overkill. Presumably there is some lower level function that just determines the dimension that `Mean` and `RandomVariate` themselves use to determine the dimesion but I have not been able to find it.
