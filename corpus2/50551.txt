One of the four possible `AppearanceElements` for `Manipulate` is "ManipulateMenu" which provides a number of features such as bookmarks, pasting snapshots, autorun, etc. I'd like to have some of the elements of the Manipulate menu, but not all of them. In particular, I'd like to remove `Autorun`, as it is not useful or interesting in my application. In fact it is positively undesirable. Is it possible to edit the menu, in particular to remove unwanted items? The documentation suggests not. Alternatively, is it possible to disable `Autorun`? I've tried `AutorunSequencing -> {}` and `AutorunSequencing -> None` but they appear to do nothing (and are not documented).
