I'm new to Mathematica(version 9) and I'm trying to display a multigraph with different colored edges. Here's my code so far:               G = {{1 -> 2, 1},  {2 -> 3, 1},  {3 -> 4, 1}, {4 -> 5, 1},          {5 -> 6, 1},  {6 -> 7, 1},  {7 -> 8, 1}, {8 -> 9, 1},          {9 -> 1, 1},  {1 -> 2, 2},  {2 -> 3, 2}, {3 -> 4, 2},          {4 -> 5, 2},  {5 -> 6, 2},  {6 -> 7, 2}, {7 -> 8, 2},          {8 -> 1, 2},  {1 -> 2, 3},  {2 -> 3, 3}, {3 -> 4, 3},          {4 -> 5, 3},  {5 -> 6, 3},  {6 -> 7, 3}, {7 -> 1, 3},          {1 -> 2, 4},  {2 -> 3, 4},  {3 -> 4, 4}, {4 -> 5, 4},          {5 -> 6, 4},  {6 -> 1, 4},  {1 -> 2, 5}, {2 -> 3, 5},          {3 -> 4, 5}, {4 -> 5, 5},   {5 -> 1, 5}}          GraphPlot[G,                         EdgeRenderingFunction -> (Switch[#3, 1, {Black,  Line[#1]},                                              2, {Red,    Line[#1]},                                              3, {Blue,   Line[#1]},                                              4, {Green,  Line[#1]},                                              5, {Purple, Line[#1]}] &),         VertexLabeling -> True,         Method -> "CircularEmbedding",         MultiedgeStyle -> All]      ![example bug](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wOxkM.png) This draws a graph with only a few of its edges and gives many "Switch is not a graphics primitive or directive." errors. How can I get this code to draw all of the edges properly? Thanks, Corey
