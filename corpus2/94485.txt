I am considering learning the ropes for an open source ecommerce package. I've played with opencart in the past and I basically want to get opinions on actually using it for clients. Make any suggestions you like, my priorities are: 1\. not worrying about checkout integration 2\. plugin writing 3\. theming, and premade theme availability I develop with php (oo), Javascript(with Jquery) and mySQL. In a nutshell, I want to know if Opencart makes checkout easy to do, whether the api's are kept up to date and how active the community is. Or alternatively, another opensource cart that makes checkout easier than opencart (a checkout wrapper is basically all I want - other features are bonuses). Thanks.
