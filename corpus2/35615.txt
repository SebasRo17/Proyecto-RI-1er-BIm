I have a set of ODEs I am solving, and then plotting (several) trajectories of in ParametricPlot3D. I want to have a color of each plot reflect the time (i.e. the Parameter) at that point. I tried what something along the lines of:               ParametricPlot3D[{{Sin[t], Cos[t], t/10}, {Sin[2*t], 3*Cos[t], Tan[t]}}, {t, 0, 20},     ColorFunction -> Function[t, Hue[t]]]      which colors the function in a seemingly arbitrary way. Cheers!
