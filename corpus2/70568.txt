What is the best way to **incrementally educating yourself**? I mean I have a team, we work in scrum with 14 days long sprint and I would like to reserve each sprint some time for self-education including theory/practice all together (that whole team will study the same area, for example 4 hours each). For example to learn design paterns, is there any site (paid or not it doesn't matter) which provides self-education in following form:   * clear explanation of one topic (which could be studied in question of hours)   * provides some primitive self-evaluate test which finds out whether he understood (could be implementation of one example where correct result is also provided) I think this "school style" would be very efficient and it would be incremental and continuous education. Books usually doesn't provide that self testing part (they are mostly theoretical), and 1 week trainings are different topic (they are expensive and usually 50% forgotten by trainee) I also very like **"Pecha Kucha"** presentation format, but it dosn't bring a new "know how" to the team. I would appreciate any sites or books providing self-education in this format
