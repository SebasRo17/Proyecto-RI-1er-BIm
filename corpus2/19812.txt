I am looking for the fastest way to test whether an _n_ -dimensional numerical (`NumericQ`) array (in the `ArrayQ` sense) is complex or not. It is considered complex if it has at least one complex element. It is an important requirement that this test must not unpack packed arrays. Currently I have `Not@ArrayQ[arr, _, FreeQ[#, _Complex] &]`, which does not unpack, but it executes the test for each element of packed arrays (can be tested using `Print`). Theoretically it's sufficient to test only one: all elements of a packed array are necessarily of the same type. In theory it's possible to detect whether an array is packed, and if it is, only test the first element, but this is very ugly, so I'd like to avoid it. It' also not easy to implement for an _n_ -dimensional array. What I am hoping for is a function which is internally special cased for packed arrays and is thus very fast.
