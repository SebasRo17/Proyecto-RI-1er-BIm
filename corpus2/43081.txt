I have quite a lot of data in an Excel file, which I have to use in further calculations. The transformation should map a data point with thre coordinates into a two coordinate result. Example: $(r,g,b)\mapsto(r/2 + g, r \, tan(\pi/3)/2)$. So far I have tried the following, but it doesn't work since the result is the same as the imported data.               coords[{r_, g_, b_}] := {r/2 + g, r Tan[Pi/3]/2};     data = Import["file.xlsx"]     coords[data]      ### Edit OK, i'm sorry for not posting the data earlier:               {{{"0.1", "0.65", "0.25"}, {"0.8", "0.1", "0.1"}, {"0.7", "0.15", "0.15"},        {"0.6", "0.1", "0.3"}, {"0.5", "0.2", "0.3"}, {"0.4", "0.1", "0.5"},        {"0.3", "0.3", "0.4"}, {"0.2", "0.1", "0.7"}, {"0.1", "0.8", "0.1"}}}
