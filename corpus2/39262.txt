The default table alignment is `Center`, however I would like to make it `Right` so that `MatrixForm` by default returns a matrix with right-aligned entries. I have played around with the options inspector setting the option `Alignment(TableViewBoxOptions)` to `{Right, Bottom}`, ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IBNKf.png) but it does not seem to produce any effect. Also, I noticed a button `Apply` in the options Inspector window, which is greyed and inactive??
