I need to write output of a Mathematica expression (a list of equations) in a file. I use                   WriteInput[fname_, var_, eqlist_] := Module[{str, leq},         str = OpenWrite[fname];         leq = Length[eqlist];         WriteString[str, "{"];         removebracketvar[x_] :=          StringReplace[StringReplace[ToString[x],{"["-> "","]"->"",","->""}],Whitespace->""];         (*write equations*)         Do[          WriteString[str,          removebracketvar[ToString[eqlist[[i]] , InputForm]] ];         WriteString[str , ";\n"] ,         {i, leq}];         WriteString[str, "}"];         Close[str]         ]      This works fine for small coefficients, e.g.,                SetDirectory["/home/mydir"];WriteInput["sys1.txt",{x[1,1],x[2,1],x[1,2]},        {3.4x[1,1]^2,x[2,1]^2,x[1,2]^2}]      i.e., it generates the following file sys1.txt               {3.4*x11^2;     x21^2;     x12^2;     }      However, the problem comes up when 1. the coefficients are integer, e.g.,               SetDirectory["/home/mydir"];     WriteInput["sys1.txt", {x[1, 1], x[2, 1], x[1, 2]}, {3.0 x[1, 1]^2, x[2, 1]^2, x[1, 2]^2}]      which writes sys1.txt as               {3.*x11^2;     x21^2;     x12^2;     }      where '3.' is not appropriate for the later operations on the file by some other external code. 3.0 or 3 is what I want. Coefficients in scientific form are also problematic. e.g.,                 SetDirectory["/home/mydir"];       WriteInput["sys1.txt", {x[1, 1], x[2, 1], x[1, 2]},         {3.998723445*10^6 x[1, 1]^2, x[2, 1]^2, x[1, 2]^2}]      gives               {3.998723445*^6*x11^2;*x11^2;     x21^2;     x12^2;     }      where it has this weird `*^` notation for the exponents. I want _10^(6)_ instead, or just in the non-scientific form, i.e., 3998723.445 is also fine. Is there any good way of tweaking this short code to get the coefficients in the form I want?
