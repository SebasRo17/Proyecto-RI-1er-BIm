I am trying to come up with a problem that is easily solvable in a parallel manner and that requires communication between threads for a test. I also am trying to avoid problems that require require random waits, which rules out dining philosophers and producer-consumer (bounded buffer), two of the classics. My goal is for the student to be able to write the program in less than 20-30 minutes in front of a computer not knowing of the problem beforehand. (This is to prevent preparation more than to come up with something novel.) I am trying to stress the communication aspect of the program, though the multi-threaded nature is also important. Does anyone have some ideas? **Edit** : I'm using Google Go for the language and testing comprehension of the goroutines/channels combo vs an actors library that I authored.
