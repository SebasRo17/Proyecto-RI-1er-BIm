I am designing an open source Java library that I will likely release with an MIT license, and its sole dependency is the ASM dynamic bytecode injection library. According to their license: > Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, > this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation > and/or other materials provided with the distribution. What does this mean, _exactly_? Does it mean that in all my **Developer Guide** (which will be a PDF that will be distributed in the same ZIP file as my JAR)? Or does it mean something else? I guess I'm asking for an example of a _correct_ way of honoring this stipulation in the license. Thanks in advance!
