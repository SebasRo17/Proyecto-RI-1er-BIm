Some time ago I asked myself: with all these great graphics and interactive capabilities of _Mathematica_ , what kinds of 3D games can be implemented in it? And the answer which came to mind is Minecraft classic. The scene in this game is almost static, the first person view and controls can be easily implemented, the terrain textures are freely available, and the overall functionality does not seem to be complicated... There is even a related demonstration on the Demonstrations Project! So, can Mathematica really handle Minecraft classic game functionality?
