How can I get numerical output of ListSurfacePlot3D, i.e., a list of all the points, $(x,y,z)$ , used to construct the plot? Thanks to your help I now have a list of (x,y,z). But the new mesh is irregular, I need z-values on specific (x,y). In more detail: The original data (https://www.dropbox.com/s/q76qsrf8hl4li7g/6686.dat) is an array of 40 by 40, with > x = {0, 0.5, 1.0, ..., 19.5} and the same for y. Following user0501's suggestion the output is: > data = {{0., 8.73992, 14.8593}, {0., 8.38421, 15.075}, {0., 8.3125, > 15.1281}, {0., 8.22328, 15.1943}, {0., 7.77126, 15.5292}, {0., 7.31923, > 15.8642}, {0., 7.125, 16.0081},...} How can I get the result based on the same regular grid as the grid based on the input data? If you like, you can get the original data here:               data = Import["https://dl.dropbox.com/s/q76qsrf8hl4li7g/6686.dat"];     surf = ListSurfacePlot3D[data, MaxPlotPoints -> 5]      Again, thanks a lot for your help!!
