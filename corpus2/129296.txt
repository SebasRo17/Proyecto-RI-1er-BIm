What are the top reasons to write obfuscated code, in terms of a real benefit to the people developing the code, and the business that runs that code (if the code in question is in fact commericial code)? **Are there documented cases (available online in some location) which describe when obfuscation did more good than bad? Are there well-known examples where, for example, obfuscation was proven to meaningfully delay a malicious 3rd party from getting at the code?** It seems that, just like rolling up your car windows won't stop people from breaking them and stealing your stereo, obfuscating your code just keeps honest people honest. ========= Background: This is an attempt to purposely challenge my assumptions on this topic. I'm big-time against using code obfuscation in general, but I'm curious if I'm missing something. I get why, in cases like JavaScript, minification helps things load faster and all (there's a real, functional benefit there), but I can't seem to come up with a single reason why code obfuscation, **for the purpose of being an obstacle to discovering what an section of code/algorithm does** , is actually effective for any purpose whatsoever. With open source being crazy popular, the question seems to be "share the code, or keep it proprietary?" When it comes to commercial code, I can understand why you can't share everything, and you've got the law in your side to fight theft. BTW, if the reason someone is writing obfuscated code is "job security" then I would fire any programmer found to be consistently, and purposely using obfuscation **with the sole purpose of helping to keep their jobs,** unless they could reasonably show that it had some business benefit. It's so completely anti-team that it's ridiculous, and points to someone that's more concerned with keeping their job through misguided practices, then keeping it because they write awesome software. I only mention this specific case because, while I realize people are usually joking, I'd like to deter any answers whose basic thrust is that obfuscation for job security alone is a good idea.
