C99 has been with us for a while now. It introduces a lot of features that are not in K&Rs The C Programming Language. None of them are particularly radical. However, even small features like being able to intermingle declarations and code change how one organizes code. While I still consider the K&R book an invaluable reference, and like its writing style, is there a better book that takes into account the C99 standard? I'd buy a third edition of K&R in a heartbeat, but I don't think that is going to happen.
