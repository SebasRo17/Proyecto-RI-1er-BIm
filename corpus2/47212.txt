I am a long time Maple user who had just recently got hands on _Mathematica_. I have a "simple" system of PDEs, one can be solved easily. But I cant seem to get it work in _Mathematica_. I am nos sure whether I'm having a synatex problem or it's just not doable in _Mathematica_.               FF = f[a, b, c, d]          eq1 = D[FF, d] + (1 - a)*D[FF, a]/d == 0          eq2 = D[FF, c] + (b - (a - 1)*d)*D[FF, a]/(c*d) == 0          eq3 = D[FF, b] + D[FF, a]/d == 0          DSolve[{eq1, eq2, eq3}, {FF}, {a, b, c, d}]      ![Mathematica does not work](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SL7pI.png) Tried using different parameters to avoid the double subscript ![Tried using different parameters to avoid the double subscript](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CyHVM.png) Here is how it works in Maple: ![Maple works fine](http://i.stack.imgur.com/63Em1.png) Thanks The Mathematica Notebook is here Mathematica NB
