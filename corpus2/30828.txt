I'm trying to create a function that returns a partly filled `Disk`, based on a percentage. So inputting `1` would give a fully filled disk, while inputting `0.5` would return a `Disk` with half of if it filled (from 12 'o clock to 6 'o clock). Etc. So far I've written this:               Graphics[{{EdgeForm[Thick], White, Disk[{0, 0}, 1]},                {Blue, Disk[{0, 0}, 1, {4 Pi/3, Pi/2}]}}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uCZI7.png) The function part is not difficult but I can't get the coordinates to work properly. How do I transform a percentage like 0.1 to the correct segment of the `Disk`? (The `{4 Pi/3, Pi/2}` of the function).
