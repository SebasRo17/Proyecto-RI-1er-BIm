Just a quick question on Web Application attribute, if responsive (which mainly stems from web design) means website that adapts to different screen size, then the closest term I can find for Web Application which is highly 'responsive' to the user input (click, touch, etc.) is interactive? One might call it 'native-like' experience, or great user experience but I find these still too vague. Well here is what I have at the moment: **Responsive Web Application** refers to web applications which adopt responsive design, i.e. changes it layout on different screen sizes to increase user experience (supposedly). **Interactive Web Application** refers to web application which has a lot interactivity to it, i.e. elements that can receive user inputs and reacts accordingly. **Native-like Web Application** refers to web application that offers the same speed and performance as native application (either desktop software or mobile native apps). I might have missed the right term, would love input on this?
