So, I've sort of reached a point where I want to start developing a website. Originally, I planned to build said website using PHP and CodeIgniter, I'm familiar with both, but, truth be told, I'm not too fond of either. I find they just get rather messy, CodeIgniter helps somewhat, but no matter what, it seems that most PHP comes out more obfuscated than it has to be. Anyways, I've come to the point where I want to either use Python or Ruby. I'm familiar in both, though more so towards Python, but I've never done any web development in them. I'll take the necessary time to learn the frameworks (and further my knowledge in the language of my choosing), but I need to choose one. I don't like either language more than the other, they both have their benefits... However, since I've never done any web development with either language, I was hoping that you guys could give me some pointers. What are the available frameworks for each language? What do you recommend and why? Note: I've primarily looked into Rails and Django - but I'm still open to others. I'm looking for one that will work for just one (or maybe two) developers. It has to be fairly easy to learn (but I will take the time to learn it). Also, I'd like it to easily support clean code and agile development.
