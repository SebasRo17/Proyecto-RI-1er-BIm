I don't have any code for this since I don't know how I am meant to do this. I have a car and I am able to move it around on a flat plane and I have that working correctly. However, I want it to also be able to move up hills accurately. So that when I drive up a hill the front wheels start going up first and then the back wheels follow like a normal car would. So far all I have managed to be able to do is when one point of the car reaches an incline the whole car moves to that new y value instead of just the section of the car that is supposed to. Does it require some kind of translation and rotation applying to it so that it reacts correctly?
