If I plot an array with option ColorFunction -> "Rainbow" :               a = {{0, 1, 5, 3, 0.5, 0, 0, 2, 12, 0.50, 3, 7, 2, 0.2}};     ArrayPlot[a, PlotLegends -> Automatic, ColorFunction -> "Rainbow"]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mfzND.png) but want the points with value = 0 (and only points with value = 0) to appear white (they are missing values) instead of purple, how should I do that? Can I specify a color for discrete points to override what ColorFunction -> "Rainbow" does?
