My system is consuming a number of different remote (i.e. web) services to get data (mainly). These services are in different systems within the company (i.e. I have no control over them). I want to write classes that encapsulate the communication to these services (on a one to one basis). For example one class that talks to the CustomerService, one that talks to the AccountService etc. Each of these classes would use a single client class (e.g. HttpClient) to do the actual underlying transport communication. My question is what would you call these types of class that talk to the service? ...clients? consumers? adapters? (Example: CustomerService, the class that would call it is CustomerServiceClient(?)). Additional: If each of my classes talks to the remote service (via a HttpClient class) and creates internal DTOs from remote DTO type data, would you say then it is an Adapter?
