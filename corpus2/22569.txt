As the title states - does a unique order exist for any _Mathematica_ list to be sorted by the `Sort[]` function (or as returned by a function that treats lists as sets)? While I'm pretty sure the answer is yes, the kinds of elements you can throw into a _Mathematica_ list seems so general and varied (numbers, strings, symbols, images, graphs, other lists, etc., etc.) that I thought to make sure. (The reason this question occurred to me is an exercise question asked in the book I just started learning _Mathematica_ from: Write a function `SubsetQ[list1, list2]` that checks whether `list1` is a subset of `list2`. My solution is               SubsetQ[lis1_, lis2_] := Intersection[lis1, lis2] == Union[lis1, {}]     (* thanks to Simon Woods' correction, and assuming Intersection and Union sort canonically *)       but that implicitly assumes that the two lists on either side of the equality check will be sorted in the same order.)
