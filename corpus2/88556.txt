I used to work on a really small outsourcing company (4 programmers and the boss), then when the stress and the frequent long shifts made the situation unbearable I made the switch to a better paid job with a more relaxed schedule that allows me some more free time. The problem, however, is that for the most part, everything is coded in Classic ASP that interfaces with a custom made C++ queueing system that stores everything in AS400 systems. My boss used to be one of the developers that made the initial efforts towards this, and naturally won't ever approve a switch to another languages / technologies despite the increasing difficulty that represents developing today business needs with yesterday tools. I'm pretty much stuck coding with Classic ASP in the foreseeable future, and I'm struggling to find ways to make it at least interesting, as I used to work with .NET and Java previously, and I feel like I'm going backwards... Any advice?
