I have a database having around 15 tables.Currently I am working on a report generation page, which is having 16 criteria.The values are distributed among multiple tables.User can select any number of search criteria. The problem is, if the user is entering 2-3 values, it is better to filter first by certain value and then apply the next level of filtration on remaining values and this order of filtration depends on the user input always. That means, I have to check all the possible ways of input permutation and give execution path for each, which will be horrible.Is there any way by which I can reduce the execution paths. I am not able to come up with an efficient algorithm. Suppose I have 3 parameters: `name`, `skill`, `programExp` If `name` is given, then I should filter based on `name` first. If `skill` is given, then I should filter using `skill`, `programExp` and then `name`.
