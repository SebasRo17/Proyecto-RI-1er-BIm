Is it at all possible to define a function in Mathematica in terms of a power series? For a specific example, I wish to write $x(\tau)$ as $x(\tau)=x_{0}(\tau)+\mu x_{1}(\tau)+\mu^{2}x_{2}(\tau)+\cdots$ (I'm okay with truncating terms, as long as I can determine how many terms I keep.) Thanks in advance. EDIT: I am looking to use these symbolically to plug into a differential equation and solve for each $x_i$ after grouping coefficients of powers of $\mu$. (Along with another power series $\omega = \omega_0 + \mu\omega_1+\mu^2\omega_2\cdots$ where each $\omega_i$ is constant.) It's important to note that each $x_i$ is a separate function of $\tau$, which is why the basic Mathematica tutorials I have seen have been of no help.
