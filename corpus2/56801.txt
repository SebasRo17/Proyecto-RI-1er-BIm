I have a rank 3 matrix:               r = {{{1, 10}, {19, 71}, {111, 159}}, {{1, 5}, {25, 63}, {118, 132}, {164, 185}}, {{1, 19}, {28, 49}, {157, 203}}};      and each of the sub-arrays above represents a range. No two sub-arrays in a given row has any overlap. I want to check if given `i` of `r[[i]]` and a scalar `x`, I want to check if any of the sub-arrays have `x` within their range. e.g. if `i =2` and `x=175` is TRUE because `{164,185}` has it, but `x=75` is FALSE since none of the `{1, 5}, {25, 63}, {118, 132}, {164, 185}` has it. I do not want to use `MapThread` and use compilable functions, `UnitStep` if possible.
