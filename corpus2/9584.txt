I need to specify that a variable is less than another, and greater than yet another, in a Mathematica program, because I will later apply a test to them that will determine what functional form to use. I also need `Sign[]` to give the correct answer. I tried using `TagSet` like this:               h /: (h>=d0) = True     h /: (h<=d1) = True      but this does not work with `Sign[h-d0]`, for example, and               h /: Sign[h - d0] = 1;      fails because it says _h_ is too deep. An example of how I will use this:               f[x_] := Exp[ c Sign[h-x] ]      where `x` can take the values `d0` or `d1`. (This will be used to set up boundary relations to solve for a set of coefficients to solve a PDE.) I suppose I could use some `If` statements to set the whole thing up, but thought it would be nicer to have a specification of the properties of `h`. I'm sure this should be easy to do - any help is appreciated.
