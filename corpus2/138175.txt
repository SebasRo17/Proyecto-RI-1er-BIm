I have been working on an open source project for about 2 years. I would like to create a web site, but I am on essentially a zero budget. I also need a logo. My question: How should an open source developer go about improving the project's "visual appeal" without spending a lot of money? Are there graphic designers willing to donate time? How does one find them (if they exist). With a project you spend so much time on - you want to give it a nice looking web site so that it will grab people's eye. On the other hand, you don't want to spend money on something you are giving away for free. Has anyone had any personal experiences they can share?
