I'm a 100% self taught, professional programmer (I've worked at a few web startups and made a few independent games). I've read quite a few of the "essential" books (Clean Code, The Pragmatic Programmer, Code Complete, SICP, K&R). I'm considering reading Introduction to Algorithms. I've asked a few colleagues if reading it will improve my programming skills, and I got _very_ mixed answers. A few said yes, a few said no, and a one said "only if you spend a lot of time implementing these algorithms" (I don't). So, I figured I'd ask Stack Exchange. Is it worth the time to read about algorithms if you're a professional programmer who seldom needs to use complex algorithms? For what it's worth, I have a strong mathematical background (have a 2 year degree in Mathematics; took Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Calc I-III).
