I'm interested in learning about any process you need to follow when coding for a large corporation. For example, it would be nice to see a little insight into how you (or your manager) handles   * Code reviews   * Deployment to production   * Procuring HW/SW for development   * Evaluating vendors   * SOX Compliance   * Security reviews  ... or anything else I may have missed. It would also be nice to see if you think there is any benefit to the paperwork, or if there is a comparable software alternative. I'm interested in everything from paperwork, meetings, routines, or even software tools you may use.
