I love _Mathematica_ , but I find it oddly lacking when it comes to how matrices are handled. Here is an example of code that _works_ but seems like it should be a lot shorter (and minus the loop). I'm a super-newbie though so maybe one of you smart people has an idea for making this nicer. The point is to take all elements of the matrix that evaluate as `True` for some criterion (here, being less than 7) and re-assign them to a new value.               testmat = {{-1, 1, -3}, {10, 11, 5}, {15, -2, 7}};     MatrixForm[testmat]     badpos = Position[testmat, _?(# < 7 &)];     {nend, trash} = Dimensions[badpos];     For[i = 1, i <= nend, i++,       selpos = badpos[[i]];       p1 = selpos[[1]];       p2 = selpos[[2]];       testmat[[p1, p2]] = 0;     ]     MatrixForm[testmat]
