In Mathematica 9, there's an interaction between `InputField` and `Row`. The following fragment (without or without `Module` and options):                 Module[{opts},          opts = { FieldSize -> 10, FieldHintStyle -> {Black},             Appearance -> Framed};          Row[           {InputField["", String, FieldHint -> "Field 1", opts],            InputField["", String, FieldHint -> "Field 2", opts],            InputField["", String, FieldHint -> "Field 3", opts]}]          ]      Will correctly output the row of input fields and correctly handle text entered in the first field chosen by the user (not necessarily "Field 1"), but tabbing to and entering text in next field is converted to input form. Whereas, removing `Row`, as in:               {InputField["", String, FieldHint -> "Field 1"],      InputField["", String, FieldHint -> "Field 2"],      InputField["", String, FieldHint -> "Field 3"]}      Results in correct operation (including tabbing across fields). Passing the above list to Panel, `Column` or `Grid` (make two sets lists) also works fine. Known issue?
