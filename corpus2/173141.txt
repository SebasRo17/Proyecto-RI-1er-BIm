I'm a high schooler and I am competing in an open source software development competition. It must be a desktop application that runs on either Windows or Linux. I have a great idea for the open source desktop app, and I wanted to know if I could take it farther and port it to the iPhone or Android platform and make money (preferably through $.99 cost, not ads) I read somewhere that certain open source licenses allow me to do this... am I correct?
