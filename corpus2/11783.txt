I am trying to show the legend with a `ColorData` for a discrete Fourier transform coefficient table. Here's a sample data table:               f={{0,26.6185,6.54197,1.32902,0.862353},       {12.3854,4.09068,3.39286,0.208909,0.340049},       {1.86011,1.79171,0.294318,0.930939,0.13115},       {0.402539,0.448201,0.176836,0.240318,0.162534},       {0.107348,0.0917102,0.13862,0.278679,0.0561954}}      The `MatrixPlot` of the above data is as such: `MatrixPlot[f]` ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fq3ad.png) The `MatrixPlot` with `ColorData` (as in the help manual at PlotLegends/ref/ShowLegend) is as follows:               Needs["PlotLegends`"];     ShowLegend[      MatrixPlot[f,        BaseStyle -> {FontWeight -> "Plain",          FontSize -> 25}], {ColorData["TemperatureMap"][1 - #1] &, 20,        "-1", "1", LegendPosition -> {1.1, -.4}}      ]      Obviously, changing the `"-1", "1"` would change the limits on the legend. How should I have the maximum and the minimum of `f` show up instead of the non- sensical (for this case) `1` and `-1`? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/VcqZk.png) I tried changing the `ShowLegend` to               ShowLegend[     MatrixPlot[f, BaseStyle->{FontWeight->"Plain",FontSize->25}],     {ColorData["TemperatureMap"][1-#1]&,20,Max[f],Min[f],     LegendPosition->{1.1,-.4}}     ]      but to no avail. I have looked around and there has to be an easier way out than this dissertation!
