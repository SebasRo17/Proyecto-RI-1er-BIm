I have been preparing to do my first technical interview in a month, and I have a question about implementing common data structures like stacks or linked lists. I plan to do the interview in either Python or Java but I am not sure which one to use yet. I was practicing and tried to implement a stack in Python, using already built-in lists. However, lists in Python already have all stack methods, while there is still some work to do when arrays in Java are used to implement a stack. If I am asked to implement a stack and my language of choice is Python, what should I do? Should I define Node class? Would I not even be asked to implement such low-level data structure in Python anyway?
