In an ASP.NET MVC project (Razor), I have a Get request, which loads two properties on a model, dependent on the property passed into the action method. So if the parameter has a value, the Group property is supplied data. But if not, the Groups collection property is supplied data. In the post action method, when I process the data, to repopulate the view, I have to provide similar logic, and could getaway with returning `Action(param)` (the get response) to the caller. My question is, based on experience, is that a good practice to get into? I see some downsides to doing that, but adds the lack of code redundancy. Or is there a better alternative?
