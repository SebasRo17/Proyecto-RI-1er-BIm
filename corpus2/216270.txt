This doubt has to do with the requirements gathering phase of each iteration in one project based on agile methodologies. It arose because of the following situation: suppose I meet with my customer to gather the requirements and he says something like: "I need to be able to add, edit, remove and see details of my employees". That's fine, but how should we register this requirement? Should we simply write something like "the system must allow the user to manage employees", or should we be more specific writing for points   1. The system must allow the user to add employees;   2. The system must allow the user to see details of employees;   3. The system must allow the user to edit employees;   4. The system must allow the user to delete employees; Of course, this is just an example of a situation I was in doubt. The main point here is: how to know how much detailed I must be, and how to know what I should register? Are there strategies for dealing with these things? Thanks very much in advance!
