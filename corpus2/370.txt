I've been told that to be taken seriously as a job applicant, I should drop years of relevant experience off my résumé, remove the year I got my degree, or both. Or not even bother applying, because no one wants to hire programmers older than them.1 Or that I should found a company, not because I want to, or because I have a product I care about, but because that way I can get a job if/when my company is acquired. Or that I should focus more on management jobs (which I've successfully done in the past) because… well, they couldn't really explain this one, except the implication was that over a certain age you're a loser if you're still writing code. But I _like_ writing code. Have you seen this? Is this only a local (Northern California) issue? If you've ever hired programmers:2   * Of the résumés you've received, how old was the eldest applicant?   * What was the age of the oldest person you've interviewed?   * How old (when hired) was the oldest person you hired?      How old is "too old" to employed as a programmer?      1 I'm assuming all applicants have equivalent applicable experience. This isn't about someone with three decades of COBOL applying for a Java guru job.   2 Yes, I know that (at least in the US) you aren't supposed to ask how old an applicant is. In my experience, though, you can get a general idea from a résumé.
