I have a problem with `ListDensityPlot`. I have some data on an irregular grid. I try to plot them with               xStart=0;     xEnd=1000;     yStart=170;     yEnd=270;     ListDensityPlot[data,PlotRange -> {{xStart, xEnd}, {yStart, yEnd}}, FrameTicks -> True,      AspectRatio -> Abs[(yEnd - yStart)/(xEnd - xStart)], PlotRangePadding -> None,        ColorFunction -> (If[#1 === 0 , Black, GrayLevel[Rescale[#1, {0, 1}]]] &),      ColorFunctionScaling -> False, LightingAngle -> None, InterpolationOrder -> 0, ImageSize -> 1000]      In the output I have some ugly white spots: ![picture with white spots](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YJ6Np.png) If I change my plot (setting `xEnd = 230`), the white spots disappear: ![picture with reduced range](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9TGdF.png) So, from my point of view, the white spots are not caused by my data. Somehow Mathematica (I am using 9.0.1) causes them. To solve this problem I am using the following workaround:               ListPlot3D[data, PlotRange -> {{xStart, xEnd/1}, {yStart, yEnd}, All},      BoxRatios -> {1, Abs[(yEnd - yStart)/(xEnd - xStart)], 1},      ColorFunction -> (If[#1 === 0 , Black, GrayLevel[Rescale[#3, {0, 1}]]] &),      ColorFunctionScaling -> True,Mesh -> None, ImageSize -> 1500,      ViewPoint -> {0, 0, Infinity}, InterpolationOrder -> 0, BoundaryStyle -> None]      This gives me a nice output: ![picture without white spots](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YPSAh.png) What can I do that I get the same output with `ListDensityPlot`? At least I need `ListDensityPlot` because changes in the `InterpolationOrder` look there different than in the `ListPlot3D`. There is perhaps a similar question here, but rescaling does not help here. Additionally, my problem is “solved” with `ListPlot3D`, Eli Lansey’s problem not. I would be happy about some help!
