How can I vary an initial condition in the numerical solution of a system of ODEs and then make a 3D plot of the solution space with that condition as one of the variables.               sol = NDSolve[       {y''[t] + y'[t] + 4*y[t] + x[t] - x'[t] == 0,         x'[t] + 3*c*y[t] == 0,        y[1] == 1, y'[1] == 1,         x[0] == 1}, {x, y}, {t, 0, 10}]      I want to vary one of the condition variables, say `y[1]` over `u = Range[-10, 10, step]`. Then I want to make a 3D plot of the solution space `(x[t[, y[t], y[1][u])`. Can anyone please guide me in solving this query.
