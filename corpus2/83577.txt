I live in Hong Kong. I just heard one of my friend who studies English in university, just graduated and found a job of 20k HKD as a teacher for English. I started my career as a programmer with 10k HKD salary, and after a 1/2 year, it is raised to 11.5k HKD. I got my Computer Science degree. I don't understand why there is a gap so big between different types of jobs. I don't have any ideas about how to change my job and quit to be a programmer. My question is, can we maximum my value quickly so that my salary can be raised to a similar range, respective to other job such as: Teacher, Lawyer, Doctor?
