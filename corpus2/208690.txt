I am developing a new project where I will be constantly checking a webpage for data and adding this data to a queue for processing. This data will then be removed from the queue and added to a list if it hasn't already been added. This list will then be stored in the database. I was wondering about how to use threads as I am relatively new to programming? I think it would be ideal if I had a thread constantly checking the webpage for data, a thread processing the queue and a thread for processing the list. Any suggestions on whether this method is the most effective or not and how to achieve this would be much appreciated.
