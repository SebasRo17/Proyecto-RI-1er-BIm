Directly post graduation from University, I decided to build my own web app (Ease My Day) while waiting to get a job as a software Engineer. The reasons to build this app:   * Gain solid hands on software experience before hitting the job scene   * Providing a solution to a common problem   * **Not sitting doing nothing** while searching for jobs The app is **Not** an entrepreneurial tryout nor a business to be sold. Still throughout interviews I noticed that at the rate of 4 of each 5 interviews I pass through the app is being confused with a **business** and I am asked the same questions: > Why did you build the business? Why do you want to **stop** the app? Do you > want to sell the app? Knowing that I didn't build a business nor make any income from this application. Do candidates who take initiatives and like to craft their own apps on the side cause a **red flag** on the hiring manager's radar? # UPDATE requested by @Kate Gregory This is how I describe it on my resume: > Personal Project: Developer of "Ease My Day" SaaS application, Montreal, Qc.   >  Link: http://www.easemyday.com   >  Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/EaseMyDay > > "Ease My Day" BETA's main purpose is helping with daily nutrition/health > monitoring. > > _A list of more than 6000 foods with their nutrition facts is available. > Users can add their personal foods and grow the food database.   >  It allows users to specify their goal: lose weight, gain weight, no goal > just staying healthy.   >  It allows users to calculate their daily needs (calories, protein, > carbohydrates, fat etc..) using the app's built in calculator.
