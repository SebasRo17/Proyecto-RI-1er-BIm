Today I started researching the "Four colours theorem" and to do so I need data, regions for example. I tried using the following line:               CountryData["Ukraine", "Regions"]      But the result: > CountryData::dlfail: Internet download of data for CountryData failed. Use > Help > Internet Connectivity... to test or reconfigure internet > connectivity. >>               $Failed      I tried to do this next: ![CMD, Ping source](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4Gu8d.png) For those who don't understand (because the screen language is Russian) the default source does not respond. How I can change the default source? _Mathematica_ version – 9.0.1.0, OS – Windows 7.
