When I start `MathKernel` from the `Emacs` shell, there are always extra spaces inserted so the cursor goes to the far right side of the screen. For example               % emacs -q M-x shell /Applications/Mathematica.app/Contents/MacOS/MathKernel      produces               Mathematica 9.0 for Mac OS X x86 (64-bit)       Copyright 1988-2013 Wolfram Research, Inc.

Does anyone knows why such a thing happens and how to prevent it?
