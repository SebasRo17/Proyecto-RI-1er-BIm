my problem is with combining `EventHandler` and `MouseAppearance`. I want to change cursor appearance if I have primary button pressed over on item. But only then, after releasing it should be "Arrow" back. I thought it should work:               Dynamic@MouseAppearance[#, mysz]&@EventHandler[       Framed["A"], {"MouseUp" :> (mysz = "Arrow"), "MouseDown" :> (mysz = "A")}]      but it doesn't. The strange thing is, using "MouseClicked" it works, of course effect is different, it works like it should. Second thing is variable "mysz" is updated to "A" while button is pressed... but appearance doesn't change.
