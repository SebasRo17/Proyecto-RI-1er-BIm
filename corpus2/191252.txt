What endpoints should I provide, if any, to permit connectivity / availability testing for my web services / Web API? * * * **TL;DR** I am developing both the server and client in an enterprise environment. The client will interface with the server via an RESTful Web API. I would like to provide an indication to the user that they have correctly entered the Web API's root URL correctly. I would also like to implement connectivity monitoring of the API in the future. None of the public APIs (Facebook, Twitter etc) that of have looked have a dedicated end point for connectivity testing. There are a number of web sites that provide availability monitoring of public APIs. One of them, Watchmouse, reported they preform their availability testing by actually exercising the API (logging in, perform an action, and testing the results). On the other hand calling the root URL for CouchDB returns and configurable message and the CouchDB version. Should I provide dedicated endpoints for connectivity / availability testing? If so what endpoints? Or should I just exercise existing endpoints?
