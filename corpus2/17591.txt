Select[{{"foo", "bar"} -> "a", {"foo", "baz"} ->         "a", {"foo", _} -> "a"}, MemberQ[{{"foo", "bar"}}, #[[1]]] &]          (* {{"foo", "bar"} -> "a", {"foo", _} -> "a"} *)      I'd like the answer to be `{{"foo", "bar"} -> "a"}`. The built-in `MemberQ` seems to use `MatchQ` for testing equality. I'd like a `memberQ` that uses `SameQ` or `TrueQ[Equal[#1, #2]]&`, and works for possibly funky arguments such as patterns.
