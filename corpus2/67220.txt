I am a freelancer so I really don't know what you guys put behind the words when you say "working in a **small** company is X different compared to a **medium sized** one, and Y to a **large company** ". Could you please tell me (roughly) what are the boundaries between these categories ? I am asking specifically for how many programmers ( _IT-related workers_ *) in a company instead of how many workers because:   1. To avoid the "this is not a programming related question" spam; and   2. Because I (logically) care about the differences related to programming, a company with 100 workers, only 2 of which are related to IT inherits the just-a-few-programmers working environment, and is obviously smaller compared to a company of 10 workers who are all programmers. Smaller by the classification given on this site, for different situations binded to the size of the team(s). * _I suppose project managers, QA, team leaders, etc. also goes under the countable people._ **Thanks**.
