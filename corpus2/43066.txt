I am having some trouble with formulating my problem in _Mathematica_ for this question: > Is there a number greater than 1 which leaves the same remainder when it > divides into 1716, 2154, and 4271? (For example, 4 does not work because if > we divide it, we get remainders of 0, 2 and 3). Answer the question by > checking all numbers starting at 2 and ending at 1716. I am a bit confused on how to set it up. I want to say it will be a `While` command that starts at `n = 2` but I don't know how to proceed.
