I was wondering how people deal with working in a project with badly written and formatted code, I'm talking mixed tabs and spaces, unnecessary parentheses and newlines and a whole bunch of warnings appearing on the code from the IDE. For context I have this problem on java projects, where no formatting was agreed upon. Also, in my case they are projects that have not gone public yet. The possible solutions I can see are:   1. Try and talk to the team leader/code owner, agree to a formatting and reformat everything in one commit. (my preferred choice)   2. Format the piece or pieces of code that you have to change, commit, then make the change and commit (second best)   3. Deal with it, make your changes as minimal as possible, leaving everything else as was.. (worst choice, for me)
