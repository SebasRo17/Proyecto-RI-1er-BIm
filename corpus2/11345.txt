**Open Intervals** Following up on this question, I was wondering whether Mma can handle open intervals. For example, the union of the intervals, $$1<x<5$$ and $$5<x<8$$ should not include the number 5. This is easy enough to do in one's head, but how can it be done, if at all, computationally? **Interval Complement** Also, is there a way to find the complement of two intervals? `IntervalComplement[int1,int2,int3]` should contain all the points in `int1` that are **not** in the other intervals. * * * Edit: Let's take Mark McClure's data as an example.               int1 = x < -2 || -1 <= x < 1 || x == 3 || 4 < x <= Pi^2;     int2 = -3 <= x < 0 || x > 1;      The intervals are shown below: ![intervals](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0xiLQ.png) The Interval Complement (drawn above in blue on the x-axis) would seem to be:               x < -3 || 0 <= x < 1
