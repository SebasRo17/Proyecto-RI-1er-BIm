I want to make Python script that will accept input from Vim and send it to my web-site. So basically I want to make Vim my text-editor for blog articles. Of course, I need to authenticate and authorizate. I wanted to simply ask username and password. My college asked me why not to take login data from file. I answered that I don't want to save password in plain-text. He told me to use tokens! So how to do it? I understand that I need to generate random token for user and knowing it will allow anyone to login. It should be really strong and random so nobody can guess it. Is there something else? Will it be safe to save it in text file? I would like to hear how would you implement it in the simplest possible yet secure way. Some links to literature would be good too!
