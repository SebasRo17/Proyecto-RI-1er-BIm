Throughout the history of programming whenever a new technology was made a **application** for it had to be made. _E.g. When Android came out Android Apps came out ~ giving millions of dollars in revenue to the respective developers who made the apps. (The OS came in 2008)_ The beauty about computers is that it is always changing. You cannot invent a new innovation for writing as most English students learn about Shakespeare while CS students face a ever-changing curriculum.. Programmers have this advantage. **They can make a lot of money if they play their cards right.** So I want to be prepared. I want to be first in line for the next promising innovation. I know many of them will fail but I think my instinct for spotting potential success is high. _But how can I be prepared?_ I am planning to assimilate fellow programmers, friends and offshore developers/contractors. I want to make my own start-up ~ for now as a sole proprietor. There is no way I'm pitching an idea to a large company. I want to get a BN and register a company, I believe it will give more **flexibility**. Plus its **better working with other minds as designing something by yourself without help is a recipe for burnout.** So my question - going more specific is what approach should I take?   * Should I start my own software company, passive as it may be in the   beginning?   * Who should help me? Is it wiser getting internal/external developers to help me with my ideas for the new paradigms? I am a first year CS student, 18 years old with good social skills.
