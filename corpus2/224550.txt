I am designing a web app for a client who wants to keep some of his business rules private, we have an NDA. In a nutshell, customers use the app to book a service, and employees use it to keep track of bookings. Since the front end is public (and untrustworthy), all of the decisions that are determined by business rules have to happen on the server. Now, if I use a very nice GPLv3 licensed module, then that SPA has to be licensed under a compatible license, like MIT, because the app (including the module) is being distributed to everyone who visits the site. That's fine, it isn't possible to hide anything on the front end anyways. I don't contribute enough back to the community, and I would love to release an example of a production grade SPA as open source. It would be a great way to start a blog. The server would implement a publicly defined API, and the front end would work with any server that implements the API. I would include a simple server with the GPL licensed app so that it can be run by anyone. The server doesn't depend on the client, because could it could be replaced with curl. What I am wondering is, in this scenario, could I keep my client's unique business rules private in a server app without violating the rules or intentions of the GPL?
