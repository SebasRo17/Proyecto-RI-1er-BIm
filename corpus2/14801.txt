I have the matrix               {{3, 2, 1}, {3, 1, 2}, {2, 3, -1},      {-(3/b), -(3/b^2) - 2/b, -(3/b^3) - 2/b^2 - 1/b},      {-(3/b), -(3/b^2) - 1/b, -(3/b^3) - 1/b^2 - 2/b},      {-(2/b), -(2/b^2) - 3/b, -(2/b^3) - 3/b^2 + 1/b}}      and I want to compute its inverse (or pseudoinverse). The problem is that _Mathematica_ solves this regarding `b` as a complex number. How do I change this to set `b` as real? I tried `Assuming` but that didn't work. Maybe I am writing it wrong. Any ideas? It should be fairly simple, but I am not really good at `Mathematica` and I couldn't find a solution elsewhere. I would be greatful for a general answer, not one specifically for this example; e.g., `Pseudoinverse[a] /. Reals[b] -> ...` (this didn't work). Thanks
