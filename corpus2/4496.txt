I need to break my for loop in case of an thrown message and append s to the result list. Breaking the loop works, but my result is empty. I can not use `Table[]` because it does not support `Break[]`. EDIT: s has the form of list, so I get a Table structure for result EDIT 2: `AppendTo[]` yields empty result too.               result = {};     For[i = 0, i < 6, i++,       s = {Quiet[         Check[If[i == 3, Message[FindRoot::jsing, x, 1], i], "Nan",           FindRoot::jsing]]};      If[s == "Nan", Break[], AppendTo[result, s]];      ]     result      yields:               {}      Any help appreciated.
