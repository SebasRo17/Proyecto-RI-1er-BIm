Here is my code:               h = .2;      m = .04;     k = 4/Pi^2;     L = 4;     n = L/h;      s = k*m/h^2;     A = SparseArray[{Band[{1, 1}] -> 1.0 + 2.0*s, Band[{2, 1}] -> -s,          Band[{1, 2}] -> -s}, n + 1];      Here's the error:               SparseArray::dims: The dimensions 21.` in SparseArray[{Band[{1,1}]->1.81057,Band[{2,1}]->-0.405285,Band[{1,2}]->-0.405285},21.] are not given as a list of positive machine integers. >>      I've been experimenting with this for quite a while now and can't seem to figure out what's wrong. Any ideas?
