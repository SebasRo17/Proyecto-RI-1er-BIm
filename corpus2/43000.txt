I am curious if any one has comments on "specific characteristics" of a problem that will deem it to be best solved by a specific optimization method such as `SimulatedAnnealing`, `Random Search`, or `Diferential Evolution`, etc. **Edit** : I am familiar with the majority of the `Mathematica` resources which has some useful comments such as:`Random search` requires that the objective function be locally continuous, `DifferentialEvolution` is more suitable for discrete optimization problems since it needs a large gene pool, etc. I wanted a discussion expanding that knowledge based on peoples' experience on when they found one method to be more beneficial than other based on the problem characteristics such as size of solution space, non- linearity, processing speed(time), rate of convergence (iterations), etc. Ps. Thanks for the resources.
