I am trying to create a meaningful Operating Characteristic curve for use in Quality Lot Acceptance sampling. I have the following example (thanks to some help), yet when I alter the number of units sampled, or the lot size - the ticks are not right anymore.               DiscretePlot[      Probability[x <= 0, x \[Distributed] HypergeometricDistribution[8, d, 500]],      {d, 0, 250},      Ticks -> {Table[{i 500/100, ToString@i <> "%"}, {i, 0, 50, 5}],Automatic}     ]      Basically how does the Ticks work? such that I can alter the hypergeometric parameters and get appropriate Ticks? cheers, Fred
