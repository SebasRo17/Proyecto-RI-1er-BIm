I have two sets of 3D points, say               a = RandomReal[1, {10, 3}];     b = RandomReal[1, {10, 3}];      I wanna find the first N pairs that have shortest distance between the two sets, my current approach is to form a `NearestFunction` from the first list and map it to the second(say, N=3):               f = Nearest[a];     c = Flatten[f/@b, 1];      Then get the result:               N=3;     Transpose[{c[[#]], b[[#]]}]&@ Ordering[Norm/@(c-b),N]          Output={{1st pair},{2nd pair},{3rd pair}}      **Question:What is the more efficient way of finding shortest distance pairs of two sets in mathematica?** -edit- In my actual case, I want to determine the intersection of two shapes(manifolds), but the analytic form of these shapes are not available. I can only compute points on these shapes through numerical process(`NDSolve`). So I want to use enough many points to approximate these shapes, and use `Intersection`-like operation to find points that lay approximately on both shapes. The number of points is very large(eg. 10^7), and the points may in high dimensional space(eg. 4D). Excuse me for my crippled English. I am greatly appreciate any suggestions, thank you very much!
