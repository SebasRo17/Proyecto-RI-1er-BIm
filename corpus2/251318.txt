* If My WCF service have big number of clients through the Internet,then whether should all of them share the same Client Certificate(X509)?   * And if their certificates should be unique , what should I do on the WCF to identify all the certificates?   * Last question: Must I import the server-side certificate into TrustedPeople location on every Client ? (Which seems to be troublesome and any way convenient? )
