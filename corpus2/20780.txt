I have a $4 \times N$ matrix in a .txt file of the form: > -17.071 137.567 16.554 0.65 > > -16.873 136.138 16.934 0.7 > > -15.397 135.738 16.894 0.7 > > -14.7 135.982 15.9 0.6 > > ... ($N-4$ additional row entries) Where the numeric values in each row are separated by a space. How would I read this matrix in, and parse it in the following manner:               {        {-17.071, 137.567, 16.554, 0.65},       {-16.873, 136.138, 16.934, 0.7},       {-15.397, 135.738, 16.894, 0.7},       {-14.7, 135.982, 15.9, 0.6},       ...     }      Evaluating               Import[PATH\\MATRIX.txt]]       Only returns the printed contents of the file.
