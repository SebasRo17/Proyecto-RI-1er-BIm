Which style is best when you have a for loop with an unused control variable and a computationally expensive termination condition? The number of iterations is important, but the control variable (n) is not used within the loop.               //1     for(int n=0; n</*termination condition*/; n++) {      //do something     }          //2     int limit = //termination condition     for(int n=0; n<limit; n++) {      //do something     }          //3     for(int n=/*termination condition*/; n>0; n--) {      //do something     }      Option 1 will cause the condition to be evaluated on each iteration of the for loop, which is not performant. I tend to use option 2, since it is performant and explicit. Option 3 is performant and concise.
