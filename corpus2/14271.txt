I guess you could call me a "MicroISV" because it's basically just me doing the work to create a product to be sold commercially. I'm sure there are many out there like me, so here's my question: Besides the programming/coding aspect to get your code out the door, **_do you DIY or vendor-out everything else_**? For example, web site creation, internet marketing, accounting/taxes, company minutes, customer support, setting up ecommerce/banking, server management, procurement, etc. All of those activities seem to be out of the realm of what I'm good at or have the patience/time for, but I don't know if the alternative is too untrustworthy or too expensive to make it worthwhile to try to farm out these tasks to someone else (like a local company, vendors on oDesk, etc.). I can certainly understand wanting to keep all these tasks "in-house" (i.e. me) to protect strategy, plans, code, private things like bank account numbers, but is it really that much of a risk to outsource these tasks? What is your experience?
