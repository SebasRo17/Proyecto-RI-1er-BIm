For PHP, best practices, I have read somewhere that if you assign your data to a variable it takes almost no memory or resource. So let's say I have this function that return a count.               public function returnCount($array){         return count($array);     }      or if this is better?               public function returnCount($array){         $count = count($array);         return $count;     }
