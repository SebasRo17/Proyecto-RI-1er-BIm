I'm trying to solve the following system using `NDSolve`: $$ \begin{align} u_t(x,t) &= u_{xx}(x,t) - v(x,t) \\\ v_t(x,t) &= u(v(x,t),t) \end{align} $$ with $$ u_x(-1,t) = 0, \quad u_x(1,t) = 0, \quad u(x,0) = \tanh(10x), \quad v(x,0) = 1/3. $$ I tried the following code in Mathematica 7.               NDSolve[{         Derivative[0, 1][u][x, t] == Derivative[2, 0][u][x, t] - v[x, t],         Derivative[0, 1][v][x, t] == u[v[x, t], t],              Derivative[1, 0][u][-1, t] == 0,         Derivative[1, 0][u][1, t] == 0,              u[x, 0] == Tanh[10 x],         v[x, 0] == 1/3       }, {u, v}, {x, -1, 1}, {t, 0, 5}]      This produces an error: `NDSolve::delpde: Delay partial differential equations are not currently supported by NDSolve.` I think this is coming from the second differential equation, because if it doesn't have a composition, for example if I change the second equation to $$ v_t(x,t) = u(x,t)+v(x,t), $$ and try the code               NDSolve[{         Derivative[0, 1][u][x, t] == Derivative[2, 0][u][x, t] - v[x, t],         Derivative[0, 1][v][x, t] == u[x, t] + v[x, t],              Derivative[1, 0][u][-1, t] == 0,         Derivative[1, 0][u][1, t] == 0,              u[x, 0] == Tanh[10 x],         v[x, 0] == 1/3       }, {u, v}, {x, -1, 1}, {t, 0, 5}]      then I get a result. Is there anything I can do to help `NDSolve` solve the original system (with the composition)?
