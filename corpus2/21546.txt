I haven't found an answer that solves my problem, although I think it's actually a simple one. It seems hard to me because I don't have a lot of experience with string patterns. I have a Web Code like               ...<td, class=test, >strings1</td>...<td, class=test, >strings2</td>...      that I have imported using               v = Import[*url*, "Table"]      I want to find these strings _string1_ , _string2_ , etc., but when I use `StringCases` like               StringCases[ToString[v], "class=test, >" ~~ x__ ~~ "</td>" -> x]      The code will return everything between the first `class=test, >` and the last `</td>`, resulting in something like               strings1</td>...<td, class=test, >strings2`      But I want all the strings between each paired `class=test, >` and `</td>`, I have tried to use `Overlap` without success.
