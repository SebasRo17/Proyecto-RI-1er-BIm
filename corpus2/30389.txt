A function that is the sum of two Cosine terms of the same frequency                x[t_] := a1 Cos[w0 t + b1] + a2 Cos[w0 t + b2];      can be simplified to a single `Cos`. By hand, I can calculate that this is equal to `a3 Cos[w0 t + b3]` where               a3 = Sqrt[(a1 Cos[b1] + a2 Cos[b2])^2 + (a1 Sin[b1] + a2 Sin[b2])^2]     b3 = ArcTan[a1 Cos[b1] + a2 Cos[b2], a1 Sin[b1] + a2 Sin[b2]]      As a check, if you pick numbers, you can see that the plots lie right on top of each other. I would like to have Mathematica give the simplified one-term form (rather than the sum) but can't figure out how to make this happen. More generally, I would like to have many such terms in an expression (including `Sin`s as well as `Cos`s) and to be able to simplify them all. I have tried the obvious things like: `TrigToExp[x[t]]` and `TrigExpand[x[t]]` and `FullSimplify[x[t]]` but Mathematica doesn't seem to want to combine them into the single `Cos` term. Even if I supply numerical values for the constants (`a1`, `b1`, `a2`, and `b2`) it still does not do the simplification. Any help is appreciated.
