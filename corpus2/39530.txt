I have two matrices like these:               m1=Table[Random[],{i,10},{j,10}]          m2=Table[Random[],{i,10},{j,10}]      I want to create a new matrix in which its main diagonal elements are zero and off-diagonals are determined based on               Min(m1[[i,j]],m2[[i,j]])      I came up with this `Do` loop:               newm=ConstantArray[0,{10,10}];     Do[     Do[     If[m1[[i,j]]<m2[[i,j]],newm[[i,j]]=m1[[i,j]],newm[[i,j]]=m2[[i,j]]],     {j,10}],     {i,10}]      What is the better way for doing this and avoiding `Do` loops?Is it possible to use `Map` and `Which`?
