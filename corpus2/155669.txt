I'm trying to find out ,that is there any relation between different types of UML diagrams, for example, once you developed a use case, should it be an event for each of them in a sequence diagram, or is there any exact relation between the use case and class diagrams. By the way my main focus is on the below diagrams:   * Use case    * class diagram   * activity   * sequence   * event if you think I need any extra diagram to be included so it can be used to connecting the above diagrams to each other, please mention it too. Thanks In Advance
