I wanted to use the `Pick` function with a condition. But there seems to be an issue here. Take a look at this:               selection = {0,1.2,3,0.,5};     Pick[{1,2,3,4,5},selection,elem_ /; elem =!= 0]      In _Mathematica_ 8 it will give `{1,2,3,4,5}` instead of `{2,3,4,5}`. Please note, that the `Pick` function works nicely with               Pick[{1,2,3,4,5},selection,elem_ /; elem === 0]      Giving `{1}` as a result. Is this a bug or am I missing something?
