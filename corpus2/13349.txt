I am trying to set up a `Grid` with cells that span two rows and are centered on those rows, but I am having troubles with the sizing and, therefore, spacing of the elements. For illustration I can get something that has at least part of the layout right by using `TableForm`, but this will not work in practice because the columns do not align, there is no `Dividers` option, `Item` is not fully supported, etc.               dot = Graphics[{Pink, Disk[]}, ImageSize -> 40];          dat = {{"Angel Falls", "17.7 m", "0.82", "9.2"},        {"Bridalveil Fall", "6.9 m", "0.94", "9.8"},        {"Cascata delle Marmore", "8.25 m", "0.87", "6.3"},        {"Cumberland Falls", "182.0 m", "0.87", "6.3"},        {"Dettifoss", "7.41 m", "0.88", "6.7"}};          table = {dot, {#, {##2}}} & @@@ dat;          TableForm[table, TableSpacing -> None]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/JGphG.png) Notice that the pink dot is roughly centered between the two lines, and there is no excess space around the text. If the dots are resized the alignment is retained: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wXQlW.png) Now compare the result of `Grid`:               {       {dot, Item[#, Alignment -> Left], \[SpanFromLeft], \[SpanFromLeft]},       {\[SpanFromAbove], Item[#2, Alignment -> "."], #3, #4 "cms"}     } & @@@ dat;          Grid[Join @@ %,      Alignment -> {Center, Center},      Spacings -> {Automatic, 0},      Dividers -> All     ]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BbbrU.png) The spacing and alignment is all wrong because the second element on the first row of each pair (e.g. "Angel Falls") is given the vertical size of the dot. If the dots are a different size the alignment changes: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/z7It8.png) How can I get the vertical alignment shown in the `TableForm` example while retaining all the features of `Grid`? To clarify, it is fine if the lines end up further apart when the size of the dot is increased, but they should remain centered. Also, I expect that when the size of the dot is twice as high as a line of text (or other objects) that there will be no extra space. To fully answer this question I need a way for the cell containing "Angel Falls" to have _less height_ than the dot.
