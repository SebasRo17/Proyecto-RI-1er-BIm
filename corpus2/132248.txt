Does anyone know a good way to **_get users to write a semi-decent_** (read: _useful_ ) **_bug report_**? We wanted to put up something that would make sense to most users (be easy to read and understand), yet give useful information to developers as well. _**It does not work when I click the blue button! Ahhh, I just lost a week's work ... make it work._** isn't very useful, as it is. I started to fix about a list, but thought to check up with you guys, whether a similar method already exists.
