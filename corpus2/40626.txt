After working on a notebook for a while sometimes my mouse cursor disappears. I can click on different cells and the text cursor will move accordingly but I just can't see the mouse cursor. Just now after having the window out of focus for a while it came back. I don't have a system setting that makes the cursor disappear while typing, but in mathematica the cursor seems to disappear briefly whenever I press a key (so when typing continuously it blinks like crazy); could this be related? It doesn't happen in any other program so I'm assuming it's a Mathematica glitch/feature. I am using Mathematica 9 on Linux. I have definitely come across this problem before but I can't remember what mathematica version or OS I was using, so I'll leave it at that.
