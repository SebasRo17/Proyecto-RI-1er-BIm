In _Mathematica_ 9, I had the function(s). I apologize for the weak formatting.               RemoveBackground[data_,n_,rng_?NumericQ]:=RemoveBackground[data,n,{{-∞,-rng},{rng,∞}}];          RemoveBackground[data_,n_:2,regions_:{{-∞,∞}}]:= (          RemoveBackground[] = Function[{x}, Evaluate[         Fit[             (* select points only in specified regions *)             Select[                 Flatten[data,Depth[data]-3],                 Function[{pt},Or@@(#[[1]]<=pt[[1]]<=#[[2]]&/@regions)]             ][[;;,;;2]],             (* build list of polynomial terms *)             x^#&/@Range[0,n],             x         ]     ]];          Map[ReplacePart[#,2->#[[2]]-RemoveBackground[][#[[1]]]]&, data, {-2}] );      Now in _Mathematica_ 10.0, `RemoveBackground` is a protected function. I know that you can unprotect variables. This worked perfectly fine when I had to do it `Devices`, which they also protected in _Mathematica_ 10.0. For some reason since one of the calls to `RemoveBackground` has four arguments it goes red inside the package and continues to give the message > SetDelayed::write: Tag RemoveBackground in RemoveBackground[data_, n_:2, > regions_:{{-inf,inf}}] is protected. It doesn't seem to to matter where I put `Unprotect[RemoveBackground]`; I keep getting this error. Any ideas as to why? I have also tried various combinations of `Unprotect` then `Clear` as well.
