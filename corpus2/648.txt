Here's a simple script saved in the file `hello`               #!/usr/local/bin/MathematicaScript -script     Print["Hello world"]      I can then run this file using `math -script hello` or, if the file is set to be executable, `./hello`.   In Windows or OSX, run `MathKernel -script hello` It prints > "Hello world" to the terminal. How can I change this so it does not print the quotation marks?
