I have a huge data and I want to add two labels to the Histogram. the problem here is that the labels are calculated and added automatically to the histogram. for example if I have the following Histogram:               Histogram[RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[0, 10], 20000], 20,       LabelingFunction -> (Placed[Rotate[Style[#1, Bold, 14], 90 Degree],           Above] &),       ColorFunction -> Function[{height}, ColorData["Rainbow"][height]]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FkWtW.jpg) In this Histogram, the Bars labels are calculated automatically. I want to add the percentage of each number at the top of the number. something like the following handmade Histogram : ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6szrp.jpg)
