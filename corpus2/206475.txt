It was my freelancer job at oDesk. I have done several jobs earlier in given time, but is was the first time I missed the deadline. It was a very lengthy job and I tried my best but I still missed the deadline. Now, I am very scared. Because it's my fault that I missed the deadline. My question is: Is this is a big concern or are missed deadlines common among programming jobs, so I shouldn't worry too much about this?
