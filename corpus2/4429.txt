I have the following program that plots the number of trigram appearances across a corpus of textual information between 1964 and 1989 (apologies for the messy code):               Manipulate[      viewerCount1 = {};      SetDirectory["/users/ME/desktop/DB/Put/"];      filenames = FileNames["*trigrams-put.txt"];      Do[       input = Get[file];       Clear[trigramHash];       (trigramHash[Sequence @@ #1] = #2) & @@@ input;       count = trigramHash[word1, word2, word3]; trigramHash[___] = 0;        AppendTo[viewerCount1, count];       , {file, filenames}];      DateListPlot[viewerCount1, {1964}, Joined -> True,        PlotLabel -> "Number of Trigram Appearances"], {{word1, "i",         "Word1:"}}, {{word2, "love", "Word2:"}}, {{word3, "you",         "Word3:"}}]      Right now, it looks like so: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KAHl4.png) What this is doing is initially seeing how frequent the phrase "i love you" is across files like this:               {{{"i", "don", "t"}, 102}, {{"i", "m", "gonna"}, 67},       {{"wa", "wa", "wa"}, 66}, {{"i", "can", "t"}, 66}, {{"i", "ll", "be"}, 66},       {{"i", "love", "you"}, 62}, {{"you", "don", "t"}, 55},       {{"la", "la", "la"}, 50}, {{"don", "t", "you"}, 49},       {{"don", "t", "know"}, 48}, {{"ain", "t", "that"}, 47},       The problem is that in this version you have to type word1 as `"i"`, word2 as `"love"`, and word3 as `"you"`. Would there be a way for _Mathematica_ to detect `"i love you"` in the `Manipulate` box, and then return responses as if it was `"i" "love" "you"`? So it could just be a phrase box, and it would split them in to three parts. (I have separate programs right now for unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, and quadgrams)
