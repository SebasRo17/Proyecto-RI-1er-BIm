Does anyone have any experience in telecommuting (working at home) for a company based in some foreign country? By this I don't mean working on some contracted job, but more or less permanent job. Is this even possible, what are options for payment, and can you expect to be paid by usual rates for that country or significantly less? Is there any working hours control, or as long as you deliver on time it's all good.
