I am currently in high school and I discovered programming 3 years ago but I am still not "good" and it is difficult for me some times to understand, especially about data structures, bytes etc... Moreover, when I program I waste most of my time not creating but searching my syntax error, commas and all those things. I am very slow. I would love to be an expert is programming but I feel like I am too "dumb" to go threw those difficulties. At the same time, I feel passionated about Technology, Computers and Coding... So, is it normal to be slow as I am even 3 years after discovering development or Am I just not made for this? Does anybody experienced the same feelings? Would it become better with college?
