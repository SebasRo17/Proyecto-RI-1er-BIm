A common argument against operator overloading is that it can be and is abused, e.g. `A+B` doing something completely different to addition. Examples are often quoted in C++ snippets, where the functions overloading the operators don't name the operators (e.g. `operator+()`). Compare this to Python, where the operators _are_ named (e.g. `__add__`). Does this help to deter programmers from abusing overloading in the aforementioned manner? Anyone have any experiences of Python operator overloading being abused?
