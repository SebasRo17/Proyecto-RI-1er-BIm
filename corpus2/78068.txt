Ok, I want to learn C# for a job interview (they want C# or Java, I know Java, but figure knowing both would be good). I already know Java, C++, C, F# and to some extent Python and Pascal. What are the big differences between C# and Java or C++? What are some good resources to look into, given I want to get a basic understanding in couple of hours? BTW: I told them that I didn't know C#, saying that I did however know these other languages, and that I could probably pick it up quite quickly.
