I know that GDI custom controls are usually implemented as window controls and they receive WM events as a normal window, if a control receives the WM_PAINT it needs to repaint itself. My question is: if I were to render with GDI my window client area and create all the controls there by rendering them on (without using window controls) in double buffering, will there be problems regarding "which area needs to be redrawn"? There would be no more WM_PAINT events to redraw a specific control
