I've been studying a beginners guide to ASP.NET 4 for the past month and a half, and I'm at the end of the books. The next book will be one up (Professional guide). As yet I've only programmed exercise that are in the books, not my own code. When should I start developing my own code? After reading both books? Also I'm still confused over Object-Oriented and how it works with ASP.NET 4.
