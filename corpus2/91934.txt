Since I learned about the Spiral Model of software development, I've tried to apply it to the different projects I've been involved in. However, I'm starting to feel like it's really just compressing and iterating more rapidly through a traditional Waterfall Model. Even in each Spiral or Agile cycle, there are still step-by-step tasks/objectives that need to be finished in order to complete the spiral, and that step-by-step process seems really similar (although shorter total cycle and perhaps less steps) to the Waterfall Model. Is the main difference the introduction of a feedback loop into the process of development earlier on and throughout the process, or is there a fundamental difference in the actual step-by-step completion of a task?
