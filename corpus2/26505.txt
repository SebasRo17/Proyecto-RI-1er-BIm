I want to color a subset of the edges of my graph with a different color. My graph currently has a large number of edges, so the following is just a toy example               s = {1->2,1->3}     g = {1->2, 1->3,3->4,4->1}     GraphPlot[g,VertexLabeling->True]      Here `s` is a subset of `g` I would like to tell `GraphPlot` to plot the edges in `s` with a different color, and make the edges of `s` directed. How to do this? * * * EDIT: The closest I have coming after looking at some answer to another question on this site is               s = {{1,2},{1,3}}     g = {1->2, 1->3,3->4,4->1}     GraphPlot[g,VertexLabeling->True,EdgeRenderingFunction -> (If[          Intersection[s, {#2}] != {}, {Red ,Arrow[#1, .1]},                                        {Blue,Arrow[#1, .1]}] &)]      However, since I want the complement of the set `s` in `g` to be represented as blue segment (and not an arrow) I am not sure what I should write in place of `Arrow` inside `{Blue,Arrow[#1, .1]}` above.
