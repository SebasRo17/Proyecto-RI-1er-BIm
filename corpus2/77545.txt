My ideal programming language would let me define a custom css that would lay out code according to my specifications of columns/space/brackets placement etc. and check in only content. Everybody gets their own layouts - and hence we avoid all the long winded discussions about styles. A language that could do refactoring of variable names / function names as per my style requirements would be better. Another one that could translate to local language would be awesome! Is there one such language variant of C/C++? What are the negatives of this?
