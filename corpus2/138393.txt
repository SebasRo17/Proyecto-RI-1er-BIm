I was writing some code over the weekend and I found myself wanting to write a factory as a static method in a base class. My question is simply to know if this is a c# idomatic approach? My sense that it might not be comes from the fact that the base class has knowledge of the derived class. That said, I'm not sure of a simpler way to get the same result. A whole other factory class seems (to me at least) like unneeded complexity (?) Something like:               class Animal     {       public static Animal CreateAnimal(string name)       {          switch(name)          {             case "Shark":               return new SeaAnimal();               break;             case "Dog":               return new LandAnimal();               break;             default:               throw new Exception("unknown animal");          }       }     }     class LandAnimal : Animal     {     }          class SeaAnimal : Animal     {     }
