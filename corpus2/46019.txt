I am reading my csv which looks like: float,float,float,integer,boolean I read it with:               table = Take[Import["~/myfile.csv"]];     x = table[[All, 1]];     y = table[[All, 2]];     z = table[[All, 3]];     time = table[[All, 4]];     bool = table[[All, 5]];      Then I do some job with x,y,z and I need to export it back to csv. But I dont know how to get the table to export.
