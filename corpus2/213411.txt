I asked this before and go downvoted hard so someone said I should try posting here... Any help would be MASSIVELY helpful. I'm doing Udacity, Udemy, Codecademy, Lynda, and edX. I'm learning Java (my favorite), MySQL, Python (the hardest), Javascript, HTML, CSS, and just began to learn C. I work hard on them and I love doing it. OK, so I was visiting my bro and his family last week, and I told them I was doing online courses for programming. And they basically laughed their asses off at "free education" and told me I was living in a "fantasy". I'm 18, and while I'm not downplaying the idea of going to college. I just think it's a waste when I can have more fun learning online and save my money. However, I know a degree gets your foot in the door. However, they kinda drained what motivation I had to continue doing the courses. Anyone have any thoughts, success stories, or advice to keep me going? Is anyone else in the same boat? Also I was going to do some open source work and build my own projects to get some experience.
