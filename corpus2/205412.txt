How to represent the days and hours of different tasks(design, development, testing) of a software project in a graphical way. I tried using a Gantt chart for it, but it does not represent the hours but just days, of a particular task, in a project. Is there any way to do this in software management, I need this to show it to a client for a project I did. Here is some of the values I intend to use.               ●   Research time        ○    Days 10 - 8 hours * 10 = 80     ●   Design time         ○    Days 10 -8 hours * 10 = 80     ●   Development time        ○    Days 15 – 8 hours times 15 = 120          ●   Testing time        ○    Days 3 – 8 hours times 3 = 24
