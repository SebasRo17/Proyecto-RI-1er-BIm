I have the next code                Manipulate[          Switch[x, a, If[selection =!= None, selection = None], b,              If[selection === None, selection = None], c,              If[selection === None, selection = "Hola"]      ];      selection, {x, {a, b, c}, ControlType -> PopupMenu},        {{selection, None},           Switch[x, a, {"recta", "parabola"}, b, {"hiperbola", "absoluto"},           c, {"Seno", "Coseno"}], ControlType -> PopupMenu}      ]      but I need you to choose the second popupmenu I plot the function chosen.
