I have had some experience in documenting the design for project developed in OOP languages. I made classes and used class diagrams to showcase the overall design structure of the implementation when I used OOP languages. **Problem :** I am about to begin a project in C language. How am I supposed to go about writing the design document now ? **Q.** Shouldn't the design document be independent of language of implementation ? But I am not able to figure out, with no classes involved in my implementation, how and between what will I show relations ? **Q.** Is there any standard way to document C projects ? I am totally confused as to what exactly am I supposed to show in the design document ? Functions ? How will I related them ? Will appreciate link to any open source C project which might have such a documentation for reference ? P.S. : Project is minimal kernel development in C language.
