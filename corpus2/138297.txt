Context: A firm which markets oneself with all kinds of partnerships and like a programming firm, but **feels** to me to be a firm employing cheap students at low wages to work on their major product (which looks the part). They market themselves with a lot of praise, but I have never heard about the firm in the open-source community, which makes me skeptical about their level of expertise. Now this firm is looking for some long-time engagement and offering a job to work on this product. But my first impression has been very negative:   * no version control,   * non-running codebase,   * amateurish and inexperienced feel of the codebase. On top of that, they appear to to be dishonest as they push for low wages by minimizing the importance of the problem, but still require a long engagement. I don't think I can ever solve any meaningful problem in such an environment where I face this kind of diversions. It is good to speak about problems honestly and openly. Here, I am afraid about just wasting time. Any experience like that, and recommendations about how to assess the situation or get them to change?
