I have an expression of the form                   -0.0000289725287527177708 - 2.52403420408155732 x +       138.677105376831122 x^2 - 3402.37981527828424 x^3 +       34440.8443628217428 x^4 + 158064.877964911022 x^5 -       8.04498826077845134*10^6 x^6      that I would like to convert over to an expression that can be used in C++. In C++ I have defined some functions for taking powers and the syntax is that $x^3=third()$, $x^4=fourth()$ and so on. Besides this, I to convert $*10^6$ to $e6$. Is there an easy way to do these things?
