I understand _open recursion_ as the process of a method on a class calling another method on a class using a keyword such as `this`, but whereby the method call may actually be bound to a sub class at run time. Is this a fair demonstration of open recursion?               class Sup {         go() {             alert('sup');         }              callGo() {             this.go();         }     }          class Sub extends Sup {         go() {             alert('sub');         }     }          var sub = new Sub();     sub.callGo();
