Related: Automating Esc [[ Esc formatting? In previous versions of Mathematica, I could add these lines to my _KeyTranslations.tr_ file, to map Ctrl+[ to [[:               Item[KeyEvent["8", Modifiers -> {Control}],             FrontEndExecute[{                 FrontEnd`NotebookWrite[FrontEnd`InputNotebook[],                     "\[LeftDoubleBracket]", After]             }]],     Item[KeyEvent["9", Modifiers -> {Control}],             FrontEndExecute[{                 FrontEnd`NotebookWrite[FrontEnd`InputNotebook[],                     "\[RightDoubleBracket]", After]             }]],       (I had to modify @rmrf's original key binding, because there are no [ and ] keys on a German keyboard. They're under the 8 and 9 keys, so I mapped those. I also had to comment out the other occurrence of `KeyEvent["9", Modifiers -> {Control}`, in the same file.) In Mathematica 10, this works for Ctrl+8, but not for Ctrl+9, so I'm guessing Ctrl+9 is bound to something else. Is there a way to find out where Ctrl+9 is mapped (so I can change it there)? It's not listed under tutorial/KeyboardShortcutListing, and I couldn't find it by grep'ing for `KeyEvent["9"` in the SystemFiles folder
