There are now lots of WYSIWYG editors, however whenever we use one on a CMS- based website we consistently have issues. The biggest being users pasting content from Word or other online sources and all the various formatting rules being added in "behind the scenes". How do you deal with these editors on a live production website? I love Markdown, however its target market is most definitely the tech industry.
