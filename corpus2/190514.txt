I am trying to program Discrete Wavelet Transform in Matlab. I do understand that their are various libraries available, but my project requires that I must implement it from scratch. I am taking a vector of length N. I then provide this vector as input to my my Low Pass and High Pass Filters. My first question is, what must be the cut-off for these two filters? Once I am done passing my signal through these two filters, I have S_LowPass and S_HighPass. I now down sample these vectors. Once I have down sampled these vectors, the size of my vector has been reduced. Now when I use Matlab's Wavelet toolbox, the sizes remain the same on each level. My second question: Why are the sizes remaining the same?
