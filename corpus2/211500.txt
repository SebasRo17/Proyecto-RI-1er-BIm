Say I have a method that inserts a record into the database. I don't need to know the newly-inserted ID or anything else. I have two options:   1. `public void Insert()`   2. `public string Insert()` In the first: if an insert is successful, the calling code will continue. If it fails, an exception with the details will be returned and the calling code will handle it in the catch. In the second: the calling code will interrogate the return string for specific words to see whether or not it was successful. Which option is better and why?
