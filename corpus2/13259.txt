I'm currently looking at a simplified problem that approximates another problem I'm looking into. In this simplified problem I at least have an analytic integrand and can easily provide all info on here: Given the definitions               v = 0.6;     g = 1/Sqrt[1 - v^2];          ig[tau1_?NumericQ, tau2_?NumericQ, ωω_?NumericQ, ll_?IntegerQ] :=     (((2 ll + 1) ωω)/(4 Pi^2)) *      SphericalBesselJ[ll, ωω v g tau1] *      SphericalBesselJ[ll, ωω v g tau2] *      Exp[-I ωω g (tau1 - tau2)];      I would like to numerically integrate this:               f[ω_, l_, pg_, wp_] :=       2 Re[NIntegrate[         Exp[-I 1 s] ig[100, 100 - s, ω, l], {s, 0, 40},          PrecisionGoal -> pg, WorkingPrecision -> wp, MaxRecursion -> 20]]      But for example `f[2, 1, 15, 25]` etc I get a host of errors like `::slwcon`,`::einc`. I was wondering if I could use "LevinRule" here and if so what would the options be? I believe the problem gets worse at large $\omega$ maybe 100 or more. Where even putting the WorkingPrecision upto 40 and PrecisionGoal down to 10, things still scream, if I generate a table of these from 1 to 100 in omega.
