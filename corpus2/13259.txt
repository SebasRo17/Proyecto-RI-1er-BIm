Scrum being a project management methodology, how would you 'sell' it to the developers in a team that is reasonably happy with its current situation? It seems easy to me to explain to our Product Manager how Scrum will allow him to get regular releases, to amend requirements, and get the team to focus on the high-priority stories first. I found it easy to explain what TDD or Continuous Integration bring in a developer's day-to-day life. But how can developers be convinced to embrace Scrum? How would Scrum make their life easier?
