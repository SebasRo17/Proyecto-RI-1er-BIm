I've basically came here for some advise based on my criteria, The application I'm trying to build is built completely from an API. It's like a "marketplace bidding" application, what I'm trying to accomplish is an "Auto bidding" function, but for this to happen it will have to send a cURL POST request every 3 seconds based on criteria given, then return the JSON result for me to handle server side, I'd basically like a direction on what would be the best way to handle this kind of idea, I got told something called "polling" would work but I've never heard of it. Initially the idea is as provided below   1. Load set page "bid.php"   2. Enter certain criteria   3. Click submit as to which an "Ajax" request of some sort would start   4. The recurring cURL request would be activated through the Ajax.   5. Display the data back from the cURL request every 3 seconds via Javascript. I'm not initially asking for the work to be given to me, I'm just asking the professionals as to which they recon would be the best way I can do this task.
