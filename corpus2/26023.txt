Ok, let's say I create a 1x1 pixel image.               i = Image[{{0}}, "Byte"];      Now I `Export["image.png", i]` the image and import it into Libreoffice or Inkscape in Windows 7. Then I copy and paste the image back into _Mathematica_ 8.0.1 and calculate the `ImageDimensions`.               ImageDimensions[x = Rasterize[<image>]]      I would expect to receive the 1x1 but instead I get `{13, 17}` because of appended white borders around the image. Now If I save the copied output form LibreOffice and Inkscape and then `Import` the file into _Mathematica_ , I run into no problems. **What file formats have issues with _Mathematica_ so I can consistently paste from the clipboard? I know _Mathematica_ has multiple ways to copy files** `MetaFile` **and** `Bitmap` **under Edit->Copy As, but how do these relate to different way to paste objects?**
