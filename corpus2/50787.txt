I am new to _Mathematica_. I am trying to achieve the following: I need one input cell in which I set parameters, then another input cell where functions are defined and calculations are performed. Finally one output cell for the result. I want to hide the second input cell which contains a lot of code. When I change the parameters in the first input cell and evaluate it, it should automatically evaluate the second hidden input cell and update the result. I wasn't able to achieve this as I have to evaluate the second input cell separately. Also, it would be a requirement that there be no additional code in the first input cell.
