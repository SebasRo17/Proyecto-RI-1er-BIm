I'm in a situation where there's a big project that I need a lot of background know-how to accomplish. yet I'm not moving fast enough in the research/study phase - and seeing myself off-track frequently. What it amounts to is procrastination, except it's mixed with simply being overwhelmed and delaying the necessary background study. How do you extract yourself from that limbo? My intuition says I should quickly study the material and start a tiny part of the whole project. I appreciate any tips or advice.
