Try to solve the following ODE via `DSolve` $$ \left\\{\begin{aligned} y'(x)+2 y(x) e^x-y(x)^2 &= e^{2 x}+e^x \\\ y'(0) &=1 \end{aligned}\right. $$ The expected solution is $y(x)=e^x$, but _Mathematica_ produces the message: > For some branches of the general solution,``the given boundary conditions > lead to an empty solution **Note:** $y(x)=e^x$ is obviously a special solution to the original ODE and satisfies the initial/boundary value condition which can be easily verified by substituting it into the ODE. Additionally, it is easy to deduct that: $y'(0)=1\Leftrightarrow y(0)=1$ for this ODE; How to handle it?
