I noticed a previous question on this site: how to make graphic timelines in mathematica The question concerned the creation of "graphic timelines" of this form: https://kmcstrategy.usc.edu/files/2013/02/TimeLine_border_year.jpg Where I can enter in some date in some format, e.g. day/month/year = 3/14/15, and then have it display on a timeline bar with indicated months over some range. The question was asked (and answered) on July 14th, 2012, and given the number of graphics updates in Mathematica v8 and v9, I was wondering if there was a more modern way of doing the same thing? Perhaps something built it?
