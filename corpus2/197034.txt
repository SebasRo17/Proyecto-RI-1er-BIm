Well it's a problem me and my friend had thought of, and well, haven't come up with anything to solve the following problem(I'll try to phrase it in the best way I can): > Given that there are `n` number of teams, and the number of matches each > team has played, and that no team can play more than 2 matches with any > other team, predict if the distribution of matches played by each team is > possible. P.S. : I am a Python Programmer, so (if possible) post only python code for explaining..
