I understand that when any software under the GPL is given to another the recipient has the same rights over the software that I do. I also understand that this applies to "a work based on the Program". Questions: 1) I noticed several companies sell wordpress plugins and require that you buy a new plugin for each website. Plugins are obviously "a work based on the Program". How do they do this with GPL? (ie I want to do this and not have someone take my plugin, turn around and sell it for themselves. I'm working with Drupal, however, not Wordpress). 2) If I write a module for in-house purposes and an employee takes that module home and puts it online, is that legal? What I mean is that if someone steals my code do they still have the same rights over the code that I do? 3) If I use Drupal modules in a software-as-a-service business and let people use it (ie hosted on my servers), do I still have to give them the source?
