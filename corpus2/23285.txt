Related to Delete the current notebook cell using the keyboard. Difference is that here I want to delete the whole group of cells, including the original Input cell and all Print, Output, Message etc. cells it generated (or belong to the same group). However in the case when several Input cells are grouped it will not delete the whole group, but only the subgroup that belongs to that one Input cell.
