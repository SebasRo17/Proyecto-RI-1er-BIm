I'm trying to find a developer to write me a pretty basic program. I am also a developer, but don't have enough time to write it myself. This program has a pretty basic function. It will notify users, via some dialog (or alert) that some program is about to access the _built in desktop / laptop_ camera. It could be skype or facetime, or whatever it is, the program should be aware of when the OS's camera is going to be accessed and notify the user. Yes, even if the user is initiating the camera themselves via Skype, the notification would still appear. My question is this. If I need this program written in Java, is it possible? Obviously I am trying to get it done in Java so it would run on Windows _and_ Mac. If it is not possible, then it seems as though I'd have to write 2 separate programs on Windows and Mac. I've come here to get suggestions so that I can connect with the right developers. If you have any suggestions, I'd be happy to hear them. Thanks!
