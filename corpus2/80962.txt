For a distributed team that uses Git and Github as version control, should images also be stored in the git repository? For the most part, the images won't be changed. The folder containing them will only grow in size as images are added. A concern is that the image folder may grow to a large size over time by combination of large images, or just a lot of them. Is this considered a best practice? What other alternatives are there to sharing binary files needed in projects that a distributed team can easily access?
