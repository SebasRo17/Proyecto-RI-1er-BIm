I'm learning Objective C (from a C# background) and am having difficulty understanding the unusual method signatures and am looking for a shortcut to make the learning curve less steep.   * When reading Objective C code, what English words or phrases can I associate with the symbols? For example, calling a method looks like this:                 @implementation Calculator            -(int) add:(int)a and:(int)b {       }       @end      I would write this code:               Calculator *calculator = [[Calculator alloc] init]];     int sum = [calculator add:10 and:20];      So far in my learning cheat sheet I wrote: `"[" means "do"` I don't know what curves or bumps I'll run into as I proceed, but I am looking for a conceptual reference handy for a Objective C newbie.
