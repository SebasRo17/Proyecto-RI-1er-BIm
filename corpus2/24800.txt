I have a small problem with `ListInterpolation`. I want to use `ListInterpolation` to postprocess result of a numerical simulation. Therefore, I give the function (2D) and its first and second derivatives to `ListInterpolation`. When I do so, it works with the method "Hermite". But if I switch to "Spline", I receive the warning, that the method "Spline" could not be used because "the data could not be coerced to machine real numbers".               A = ListInterpolation[data, {sigAxis, muAxis}, Method -> "Spline", InterpolationOrder -> 5];      > ListInterpolation::mspl: The Spline method could not be used because the > data could not be coerced to machine real numbers. I want to use "Spline" because I want to have accurate derivatives. I checked the _Mathematica_ manual and googled to learn what I have to do to ensure that the data can be coerced to machine real numbers. Unfortunately without any sucess at all. Could anyone give me some pointers?
