I now wish to solve for $L(t)$ and $H(t)$ some ugly Lagrangian (in the code below) in configuration space, respectively the length and the height of a system. I tried running the code below, with the boundary conditions $ L(0)=\frac{2}{3},L(10)=1, H(0)=0,H(10)=1$               << VariationalMethods`     lagr = EulerEquations[(L'[t]^2 + H'[t]^2)/2 +      1/L[t]^8 (0.939047619047619 L[t]^8 +         H[t]^3 L[          t]^2 (0.008947123427519658 - 0.3461214643843182 L[t]^2 +            6.463704237990063 L[t]^4 - 112.66974752093684 L[t]^6 -            61.714285714285715 L[t]^7) +         H[t]^4 (0.0004134154745845219 - 0.017673330227199326 L[t]^2 +            0.34184835988574624 L[t]^4 - 4.255936946824733 L[t]^6 +            55.63938149182066 L[t]^8 + 27.08994708994709 L[t]^9) +         H[t]^2 L[          t]^4 (0.05911127889691029 +            L[t]^2 (-2.2077672911653297 +               L[t] (2.1333333333333333 +                  L[t] (57.725858297763935 +                     36.888888888888886 L[t]))))), {L[t], H[t]}, t];     sln = NDSolve[{lagr, L[0] == 1, L[10] == 2/3, H[0] == 1,      H[10] == 0}, {L[t], H[t]}, {t, 0, 10}]      only to get some nonsensical error messages:               Power::infy: "Infinite expression 1/0.^6 encountered."     Infinity::indet: "Indeterminate expression -338.009+ComplexInfinity+ComplexInfinity+ComplexInfinity encountered."     NDSolve::ndnum: Encountered non-numerical value for a derivative at t == 0.`.       In my mind, these messages would appear because there are complex-valued terms as well as having a point where $L = 0$, while, in fact, all coefficients are real and I would expect the solution never to cross $L=0$. However, I can't pin down what's the problem with the third message error... Perhaps I might have misunderstood the equation...
