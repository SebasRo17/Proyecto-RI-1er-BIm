I hope this is the right forum for this ... Well, in C, the standard library uses usually `(void* buffer, int size)` when referring to some data buffer. I wonder if there is a rationale for this order instead of `(int size, void* buffer)`. I couldn't think of any good reason, and it seems to be an arbitrary choice, but I'm curious to here if there is some deeper meaning behind this order.
