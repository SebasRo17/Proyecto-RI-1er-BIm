Does it matter all that much about what college you go to, to get a degree in computer programming/computer science? I didn't do all that well in high school, I actually barely graduated with a general High School Diploma. So getting into a decent college could be difficult. Companies won't deny you just because you got your degree at a college they have never heard of or a community college will they?
