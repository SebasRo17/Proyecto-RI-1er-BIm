A word square is a set of words which, when placed in a grid, read the same horizontally and vertically. For example, the following is an English word square of order 5:               F A C E D     A L I V E     C I V I L     E V I C T     D E L T A      A word cube is an extension of this idea into three dimensions. For example, here are the slices of a word cube of order 4:               H A N D    A R E A    N E T S    D A S H     A R E A    R E A L    E A R L    A L L Y     N E T S    E A R L    T R I O    S L O P     D A S H    A L L Y    S L O P    H Y P E      Imagine stacking these squares vertically to form a cube; then notice how each the nth vertical slice is the same as the nth horizontal slice, and both are word squares. This idea can be extended into word hypercubes, but for simplicity, let's keep the dimensions to 2 or 3. How can we use Mathematica to generate word squares and word cubes? This is a difficult combinatorics question, so I'm only looking for a function which can generate word squares and word cubes of small order in a reasonable amount of time.
