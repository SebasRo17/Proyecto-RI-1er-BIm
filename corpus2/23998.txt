I'm executing the command               NonlinearModelFit[data, c/(1 + a Exp[-b x]), {a, b, c}, x]      with the data being               data = { {0, 15576}, {10, 15935}, {20, 16326},      {30, 18235}, {40, 21680}, {50, 22927}, {60, 28667},      {70, 41674}, {80, 50020}, {90, 75979}, {100, 148700},      {110, 197200}, {120, 212801}, {130, 215499}, {140, 227511}}      and I'm getting a nonsensical result. It's a horrible fit. I've tried various `Method` options and I always get a bad fit. My goal is to try to replicate what a TI-84 would give. I don't know enough about this stuff to know why the TI-84 always seems to give reasonable fits but _Mathematica_ does not.
