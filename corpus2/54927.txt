I want to calculate the hessian of a matrix. So each element gets replaced by a 2 by 2 matrix.               hessian[im_, s_] :=        {{gD[im, 2, 0, 2], gD[im, 1, 1, 2]}, {gD[im, 1, 1, 2], gD[im, 0, 2, 2]}};      Now `im = My matrix`. I want to modify my hessian function in some way (using `Map`) such that when I calculate the hessian of `im`, 1 element at a time is calculated by `gD`. At this time `gD` works on the entire `im` matrix. How do I do this? Any help (preferable code) will be very helpful. I am new to _Mathematica_ , struggling, and very frustrated.
