There have been numerous times when I've needed to invert an integral equation, i.e. I have something like $$f(x) = g_1(x)\int_{0}^x g_2(x') dx'$$ for arbitrary functions $g_1$ and $g_2$, and I would like to find $x$ for a given $f$. The way I've gotten around this is just making some sort of table of f(x) and x with spacing up to some required precision. Is there a more efficient method of doing it (numerically or analytically)? When I try to use `NSolve[ f(x) == a, x ]` mathematica complains `NIntegrate::nlim: x = x is not a valid limit of integration.`
