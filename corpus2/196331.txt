Well this has been a question I have puzzled about for a long time: Suppose I have a dictionary of `input:output` like:   1. This              {2: 6,      5: 15,      20: 60,      26: 78,      ...      982: 2946,      997: 2991}      where `output = input*3`.   2. or This              {0: 5,      3: 8,      17: 22,      19: 24,      ...      991: 996,      996: 1001}      where `output = input+5` or something else.   In short where there is a **definite relation between input and output**.   How can a program **find the relation between the input and output** , such that, given another input, the output can be calculated?? Is it possible to do the same with more complex calculations like `output = 5*((input*5)+3)`
