Should the singleton be designed so that it can be created and destroyed at any time in program or should it be created so that it is available in life- time of program. Which one is best practice? What are the advantages and disadvantages of both?   EDIT :- As per the link shared by Mat, the singleton should be static. But then what are the disadvantages of making it destroyable? One advantage is it memory can be saved when it is not useful.
