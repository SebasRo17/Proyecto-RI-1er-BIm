I have a few interesting ideas (business ideas) that can be implemented as add-on features of existing business products (web-based products, mostly startups). Based on experience, can anyone let me know if telling them would be a good idea or not? I'm hoping to get some feedback from both sides (company insiders and outsiders). The upside: They could like it and think about bringing me on board to help build. The downside: They take the idea and implement it. Company size for one is less than 50. Another is less than 25.
