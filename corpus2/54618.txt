I'm sorry if this question was answered but I am completely new to _Mathematica_ , really learning as I go (background in Java). The questions I looked at that were suggested didn't make much sense with all the advanced parts being thrown around. For a Pre Calculus class I need to graph parametric equations. However, one of the questions is:               x = 2t     y = t + 5      with `-2 ≤ t ≤ 3`. How would I do this? So far I know the basic equation but I don't get the part with having the piecewise               ParametricPlot[{ 2 t, t + 5}, {t, -10, 10}]
