I'm new to _Mathematica_ and am running in to all sorts of silly difficulties with coding in it. I'm trying to calculate a function `f[x, k]`, normalise it with another function `n[k]` and then calculate and plot a thrid function `en[k]` that depends on the first two. Unfortunately, _Mathematica_ won't plot it, and I can't see what I did wrong. I'm sure it's a trivial mistake on my part and I'm sorry to have to ask. Here's my code:               L = 8;     f[x_, k_] :=        Cos[Pi k/(2 L)]^2  Exp[(-(x - k)^2)/2] - Sin[Pi k/(2 L)]^2 (x - L) Exp[(-(x - k)^2)/2];     n[k_] := Integrate[f[u, k]^2, {u, -L, L}];     en[k_] := Integrate[f[v, k] (-f''[v, k] + (v - k)^2  f[v, k]), {v, -L, L}]/n[k];     Plot[en[k], {k, 0, L}]
