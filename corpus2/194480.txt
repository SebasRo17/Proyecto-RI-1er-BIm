I'm looking for pseudocode suggestions for **sorting my mp3 files in a way that avoids title and artist repetition**. I listen to crooners - Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Ella Fitzgerald etc. singing old standards. Each artist records many of the same songs - Fly Me To The Moon, The Way You Look Tonight, Stardust etc. My goal is to arrange the songs (or order the playlist) with the maximum space between artists and song titles. So if I have 2000 songs and 20 are by Ella I'd like to hear her only once in every 100 songs. If 10 artists sing Fly Me To The Moon I'd like to hear it once in every 200 songs. Of course I want to combine these two requirements to create my "ultimate shuffle". I know this is a fairly wide open question. I haven't started programming it yet so I'm just looking for suggestions of a good approach to take. I actually have some other requirements regarding evenly spacing other song attributes but I won't get into that here. * * * As a starting point I'm modifying code I found here to manipulate mp3 files and read ID3 tags. I wrote a small app that satisfies my need using parsifal's answer below. I also wrote a follow up question here. Thanks for all the great responses!
