What is in your opinion the best way to handle (at runtime) the situation when a **more than one** input parameter to a function is incorrect. I can see two ways. First one - a simply return an first error (by raising the exception or via some other way supported by a programming language) telling that the first of incorrect parameters is wrong. Alternatively, the function can check all the parameters, combine all the error messages into one and return it as a one. Or there might be some other approach. What would be your preference and why? Thank you.
