Let me just first say I am not actually trying to find a function for these set of data. All I am doing is joining the points to make a line. Basically let's say I have some data, which I cleverly will call/name them as 'data' in Mathematica.               data:= {{1,0,0},{2,4,7},{2,6,7},{0,0,23}}      Now plotting them. (FYI, these data points are randomlly chosen)               ListPointPlot3D[data]      I should get a plot, but of course they are all disconnected. What I want to do is to join them. Unfortunately `'Joined -> True'` does not exists in `ListPointPlot3D`, so I do not know how to join them Any ideas? **EDIT** At the moment, I have a recursion. I will just show you the table For instance               Table[x[n, t], {n, 1, 10}]       prints out a list of 10 data points in 3D. It will not work with `Graphics3D` **EDIT** I will write out exactly what I have > x[1, t_] := {0,0,0}; > > A[t_] := {{1, -t, 1}, {t, 2, 0}, {0, 0,t}} > > B[t_] := Inverse[A[t]]; > > x[n_Integer, t_] /; n > 0 := B[t].x[n - 1, t]; > > Table[x[n, t], {n, 1, 10}] I want to plot the points and join them in a curve. If possilbe I would even like to manipulate the plot. The range for $t \in [0,1]$ Everything updated
