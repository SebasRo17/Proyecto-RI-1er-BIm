We have a new developer on our team. He seems to be a smart guy (he just came in so I cannot really judge). He started with implementing some small enhancements on the project (MVC3 web application using Javascript with jQuery and Knockout). Let's say we have two values:               A - quite complex calculation         C - constant         B = A + C      On the screen there is value B and user can change it (normal texbox). When B changes, A changes as well because C is constant. So there is linear dependency between A and B. Now, all the calculations are done in the back-end, but we need to recalculate A as user changes B (in Javascript, I would use knockout). I thought about storing old A and B and when B changes by 10 then we know that new A will be `old A + 10`. He says this is dirty, because it's duplication of code (we make use of the fact that they are dependent and according to him that should be only in one place in our app). I understand it's not ideal, but making AJAX request after every key press seems a bit too much. It's a really small thing and I would not post if we haven't had long discussion about it. How do you deal with such problems? Also I can imagine that using knockout implies lots of calculations on the client side, which very often leads to duplication of the same calculations from the back-end. Does anyone have links to some articles/thoughts on this topic?
