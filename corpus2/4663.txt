I would like to use Mathematica as a kind of report generator. I'm working in a Mathematica notebook and I want to handle Mathematica like this: 1) I want to define one cell as a text cell. In this cell I want to integrate an expression (maybe as an inline cell) lets say a*b (a and b have been defined in an input cell before). 2) After evaluating this cell a*b should be replaced by (assume a=10 and b=5) 50, so that the resulting cell would look like this. > some text ....... 50.. some other text...... More general: I want to have the possibility to call a function or an expression (which has been defined before) in a text cell. The displayed result of the call should be updated, whenever I change the input values.
