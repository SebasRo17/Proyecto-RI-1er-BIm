Most of you already know that the output of ASP.NET web forms is quite ugly when you compare it to the output of ASP.NET MVC. My question is what could the problems of that ASP.NET web forms' output cause to the end users? Is it the slow of browsing and the load time?, but do you think that could be a problem in today's high speed connections? I want to choose an easy way to develop websites and I find ASP.NET web forms to be easier than ASP.NET MVC and I wonder if the problems of the output (ugly HTML, etc) can be a real problem for me?
