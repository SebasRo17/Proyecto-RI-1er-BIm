We are looking at improving the process for handing over tasks from architecture to development. At one end of the scale it there is no architecture guidance you risk getting chaos, with each developer doing things his way. At the other end of the scale where everything is specified, the specification takes longer than the development, and you risk having very boring development tasks. Has anyone found an optimal middle ground between these extremes? Which artifacts do you deliver to development? For example: modules, class structure, or sequence diagrams?
