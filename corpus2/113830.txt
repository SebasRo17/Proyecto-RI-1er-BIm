I've been reading this article by Mike Cohn about Scrum task boards. One query I have is how this fits into a workflow where there is QA stage performed by testers who aren't developers. It seems that many tasks could not easily be QA'd in isolation. A practical alternative could be that the "To Verify" process should be carried out by another developer in the team, and then to have an additional stage after DONE to QA the whole story (probably after deployment to a stage/test environment). Does this seem right?
