I am using _Mathematica 10_ on a computer running _Windows 7 (64-bit)_ with all the most recent updates from _Microsoft_. My problem is as follows:   1. I create a plot using the `Plot[]` function.   2. When I click on the plot, the _Mathematica_ suggestions bar appears under it, with items like `theme ..`, `labels ..`, `axes`, `image size`, `more`.   3. If I click on `theme`, `labels` or `axes`, _Mathematica_ hangs.   4. If I click on `more`, a more detailed menu opens up underneath the plot, containing the same menu items (plus a few more). If I then click on `theme` or `label` or `axes` in this larger menu, _Mathematica_ again hangs. By "hang" I mean that _Mathematica_ becomes unresponsive. CPU usage maxes out at near 100% (for one core of my CPU). I have waited as long as 15 minutes, but nothing changes, the program continues to be unresponsive. At this point, I can only close and restart _Mathematica_ through _Task Manager_. Here is a screenshot showing the `theme` and `labels` buttons that make _Mathematica_ hang up when clicked. I have circled them in red: ![](http://i.imgur.com/GPIWSwH.png) Here is a screenshot showing the _Windows_ ' "Application has become unresponsive" notice: ![](http://i.imgur.com/5jsQ4Mm.png) I have tried resetting the _Mathematica_ interface by holding down the `Ctrl` and `Shift` keys while starting _Mathematica_. This resets the interface all right, but the hanging problem persists. **Can anyone reproduces it?** Any help is much appreciated!
