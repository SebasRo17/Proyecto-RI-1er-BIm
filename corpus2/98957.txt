I understand why you can't develop OS X apps on a Linux computer, but is there a good technical reason why you can't develop iPhone and iPad apps on Linux? Why isn't it possible to compile iOS source code into an iOS executable and run it in an iOS simulator on Linux or install it on a development iOS device? Is it just because the XCode IDE is a Cocoa application? You can develop Android apps on any kind of platform, it seems. I don't see why the same can't be true of iOS.
