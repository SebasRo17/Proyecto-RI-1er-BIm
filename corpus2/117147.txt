I recently checked out a fantastic book from my college library. It is a bit old at 1989, but the language it describes sounds rather nice. And even while I may not be using it soon, I wanted to research their paradigm some more. So I tried to wiki Concurrent c. nothing. I can't find any references to it on the internet really either. searching for "Concurrent c" mostly points you to that one book. (Stack overflow doesn't have even one reference.) Does anyone know where I might find some history on this programming language or other resources?
