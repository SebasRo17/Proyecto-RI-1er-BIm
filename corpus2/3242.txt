For instance, is there some way I can say "let A and B be arbitrary real $m\times n$ and $k\times m$ matrices, `Simplify[Transpose[Transpose[A].Transpose[B]]]`" and Mathematica would simplify it to `B.A`? I know I can set A and B to be matrices containing symbols (e.g. `A = Table[Subscript[a,i,j],{i,m},{j,n}]`), but results can get quite messy if the problem is more complex than `Transpose[Transpose[A].Transpose[B]]` **EDIT** : To answer @Searke and @Artes questions in the comments: I'm currently watching this Stanford online machine learning course. If you look at the lecture notes, pages 8-11, you see a some matrix calculations. I can follow these calculations with pen and paper, but I haven't found a way to derive e.g. this result from page 11 using Mathematica: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Jvlcc.png)
