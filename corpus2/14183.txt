I'm curious because I notice that the Ultimate subscription costs $12,000... for one year (after that, it's $3,800 to renew). Looking at the subscription chart, you do get quite a bit of software that is normally expensive by itself. Is the package meant for 1 person or is it meant for like a business-type bundle of some sort? If it's the latter, I can _kind of_ understand that, but I can't fathom where anybody is going to have 12 grand to plop down on something that only lasts 12 months. Anyway, yeah, my question is, is this a good deal to anyone at all? Maybe it's just me not having any industry experience and this is actually a steal and millions of companies should be buying it right now, but I just can't personally picture this being worth the money.
