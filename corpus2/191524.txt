I just came from an interview in which they asked me several questions about programming and problem solving. Regarding the programming questions, I asked them to let me Google so I can see the code (I quoted that logic is the thing to learn, not the language). At the end of the interview they told me that my skills very good but what would I do if Google has been blocked around our country(It can happen in Pakistan, Youtube is yet blocked). Is it really that a programmer should know the code too?
