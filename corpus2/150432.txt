I have a very small 3-developer programming team that has zero QA people. We would like to hire a QA person but are unable to at this time. Until we can hire a QA person with proper QA training we're going to have to test each other's work. I'd like to hear from anybody who has done this, how one does such training. I am an expert developer, and I respect QA as a separate profession. I don't think I think like a QA person, but I need to start thinking more like one. In the absence of other people doing this job, some of it will fall to me. Is there any book, or tutorials on How to Do a Good Job at Testing and QA on a software product that addresses the idea of teaching a programmer to do QA? Similar question here suggest to them that they run their team with Scrum, which we are currently working towards, but we will have to do without a QA person at least until our team size can increase.
