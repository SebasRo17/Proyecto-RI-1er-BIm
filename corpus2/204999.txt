My understanding of standard programming/computer certifications is that they show you have some core competency about a specific language or technology. There seems to be a little room for variation here, but for the most part I don't feel like I don't see very many "expert" level certifications. How valuable are master level language certifications such as the recent C++ Grandmaster? Do you think they would have a big impact on getting a good job? (I understand that C++ grandmaster is a really extreme, maybe unrealistic, example.) If so, what valuable "master" or "expert" level certifications exist for specific programming languages? Are certifications more valuable for showing core competency or specific specialty knowledge? I am not very knowledgable about this subject so let me know if I made bad assumptions.
