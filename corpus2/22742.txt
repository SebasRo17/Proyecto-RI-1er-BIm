I am usually fascinated by articles defending PHP and the arguments being used. Quite often authors of these types of articles don't mention what experience they have with other languages. Personally I find it hard to imagine that somebody would know either Python or Ruby, and PHP at a high level and still prefer PHP. So if anyone fits this description, I would be interested in hearing why you prefer PHP to either of these languages.
