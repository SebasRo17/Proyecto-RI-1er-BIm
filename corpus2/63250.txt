I consider myself a high level software developer. I enjoy reading a lot, and it's helped me over the course of my career. I think I am doing well. Right now, I spend a lot of time learning new things. I don't suck when it comes to writing code right now, but I'm about to start a family, and I regularly see many seniors with 14-15 years of experience who—because they cut back on learning new things—now suck at programming. They were inspiring figures at some point of time, but they are not anymore. You might argue that basics never change, but it does appear to make a difference when you are coding on Delphi for 10 years and suddenly everyone is using the .NET framework. It's true that an experienced developer will take less time when learning a new framework, but it still **does** demand time and effort. How does a software developer manage the demands of the job while still being able to concentrate on things that necessarily take you out of the job, like starting a family?
