I want to solve a system of differential equations which is not very complicated, but I cannot handle the problem with mathematica!! Please have a look at the problem and result and help me with your comments:               F=3;     ss2 = NDSolve[{3000/7*(u''[x] - 1/56*PHI''[x]*Sign[PHI'[x]]) == 0,                     1000/7*(w''[x] + PHI'[x]) + F == 0,                     125/2744*PHI''[x] - 1000/7*(w'[x] + PHI[x]) == 0,                     3000/7*(u'[3/7] - 1/56*Abs[PHI'[3/7]]) == -1,                     u[0] == 0, w[0] == 0, w[3/7] == 0, PHI'[0] == 0, PHI'[3/7] == 0},               {u, w, PHI}, {x, 0, 3/7}];      And the message Mathematica generates for this:               NDSolve::ndsv: Cannot find starting value for the variable PHI'      Thank you for your attention.
