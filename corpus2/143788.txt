This is really two questions. Im doing a project for the university for storing baseball players statitics, but from baseball data I have to calculate the score by year for the player who is beign displayed. The background is, lets say 10, 000 users hit the player "Alex Rodriguez", the application have to calculate 10, 000 the A-Rod stats by years intead of just read it from some where is temporal saved. Here I go:   1. What is the best method for caching this type of data? Do I have to used the same database, and some temporal values on the same database, or create a Web Service for that?   2. What reading about web caching so you recommend?
