I've just been assigned a large project. The client has had multiple developers across different companies working on their (intended to be) large, MySQL driven eCommerce site. The DB schema is ...pretty good, naming is a bit rendundant but nothing real bad. The real issue is the code is in desperate need of _"OOP-ification"_. Sadly, while actually being fairly nice procedural code as far as simplicity and legibility, there are so far about 3 functions across...about 50 files. :( Thankfully these are handling database connection but there's not a single function, class or even a foreach anywhere in site that deals with page rendering. All static using _implicitly defined_ php variables and some js. Tons of reduncy and inconsistent use of code vs. html. File/directory structure is probably the worst of all **:/** The client very very much needs a custom CMS, especially for inventory control. Dynamic page generation is a must but I doubt they will want me to start over. So I ask: is there a point of attack that will make transforming this code into a more straightforward task?
