1) How the pixel values are defined in mathematica or how it is different from matlab? 2) I am wondering how image properties are different in mathematica, and how they are calculated? ComponentMeasurement: properties: such as "Centroid", "IntensityCentroid", "Area". 3) I want to find basic image processing link for mathematica 8 or 9? I felt documentation is not informative enough, any link or help on this topic will be great.
