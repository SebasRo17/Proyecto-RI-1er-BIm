I am trying to plot $J_m(\chi_{mn} r) \cos(m\phi),$ where $J_m(\chi_{mn}) =0,$ as a `DensityPlot` in polar coordinates (solution to 2D wave equation in polar coordinates). First, some definitions               besselzero = N@Table[BesselJZero[l, n], {l, 0, 25}, {n, 1, 25}];     bzeros[l_, n_] := besselzero[[l + 1, n]];      for speed purposes. For the purposes of this question consider $m=3$ (but there's essentially the same problem for any $m$):               DensityPlot[      Cos[3 ArcTan[y/x] ] BesselJ[3, bzeros[3,1]Sqrt[x^2+y^2]],{x,-1,1},{y,-1,1},      Epilog->{Thick,Circle[]},PlotRange->{-1,1},      RegionFunction->Function[{x,y,z},Norm[{x,y}]<1.]]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SWnqz.png) This is _nearly_ right, except that the sign on the left-hand side ($y<0$) of the plot is wrong (it should not be mirror symmetric around $y=0$, rather continue alternating positive and negative after each $\Delta\phi=\pi/3$). Looking at the `Plot3D` of `ArcTan[y/x]` I realized the cause of the problem was because of how `ArcTan` is defined, so I tried a workaround:               DensityPlot[      Cos[ 3 Piecewise[{{0, x > 0 && y == 0}, {\[Pi]/2,             x == 0 && y > 0}, {(3 \[Pi])/2, x == 0 && y < 0}, {(2 \[Pi])/2,             x < 0 && y == 0}, {ArcTan[y/x],             x > 0 && y > 0}, {ArcTan[y/x] + \[Pi],             x < 0 && y > 0}, {ArcTan[y/x] + \[Pi],             x < 0 && y < 0}, {ArcTan[y/x] + 2 \[Pi],             x > 0 && y < 0}}] ] BesselJ[3,         bzeros[3, 1] Sqrt[x^2 + y^2]], {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1},      Epilog -> {Thick, Circle[]}, PlotRange -> {-1, 1},      RegionFunction -> Function[{x, y, z}, Norm[{x, y}] < 1.]]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/LuSwG.png) This is _nearly_ right, except for those white regions. Is there a better way to plot functions of this sort?
