I am posting the same code found at an earlier question, although the concept here is totally different. The following code corresponds to a building-shaped structure.               w = 100;     l = 200;     h = 30;     m = 70;     backwall = {{0, l, 0}, {w, l, 0}, {w, l, h}, {0, l, h}};     side1 = {{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, h}, {0, l, h}, {0, l, 0}};     side2 = {{w, 0, 0}, {w, 0, h}, {w, l, h}, {w, l, 0}};     floor = {{0, 0, 0}, {w, 0, 0}, {w, l, 0}, {0, l, 0}};     top = {{0, 0, h}, {w, 0, h}, {w, l, h}, {0, l, h}};     front = {{0, 0, 0}, {w, 0, 0}, {w, 0, h}, {0, 0, h}};     leftRoof = {{0, 0, h}, {w/2, 0, m}, {w/2, l, m}, {0, l, h}};     rightRoof = {{w, 0, h}, {w/2, 0, m}, {w/2, l, m}, {w, l, h}};     roofBack = {{w, l, h}, {w/2, l, m}, {0, l, h}};     roofFront = {{w, 0, h}, {w/2, 0, m}, {0, 0, h}};     building = {backwall, side1, side2, floor, front, leftRoof, rightRoof,roofBack, roofFront};     figure =Graphics3D[{Opacity[0.5],Style[Polygon[building,VertexColors -> Map[0.5 + #[[3]]/80 &, building, {2}]],Lighting -> {{"Ambient", White}}]}, Boxed -> False,RotationAction -> "Clip"];     data = RandomReal[60, {100, 3}];     data1 = RandomReal[60, {100, 3}];     redPoints = Graphics3D[{Opacity[0.4], PointSize -> Large,Style[Point[#], Blue]} & /@ data, Boxed -> False,RotationAction -> "Clip"];     bluePoints =Graphics3D[{Opacity[0.4], PointSize -> Large,Style[Point[#], Red]} & /@ data1, Boxed -> False,RotationAction -> "Clip"];     Show[{figure, redPoints, bluePoints}]      and upon evaluation it produces: ![house with transparent points](http://i.stack.imgur.com/MTjV1.png) I have 10000 points that need placing, some with coordinates inside the building while the remaining are outside (like the ones circled above). I have the following two questions:   1. How can I omit the points that are not within the building?   2. How do I fill the entire building with points? Having tried a few things this morning, I still couldn't get it to work as I want so any help is appreciated.
