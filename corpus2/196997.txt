Here's a question that's always bugged me. I'm going to use java as an example because I've almost never run into a problem in java where I didn't need to use helper methods in its class structure. Let's say I have a method that does a thing or two and then calls a helper method:               public void doStuff() {         int x = 4;         int y = 5;         doStuffHelper(x, y);     }      Now I need to create a private method, `doStuffHelper`, that doStuff calls with x and y. For readability I always put the helper directly above or below the function, but I can never quite decide which one is better. What are your thoughts/experiences with it? I know the question seems trivial, but since I don't have any guiding principles on it, I find that it always kills coding time deciding what to do and re-organizing my code if it doesn't work out. If there is no consensus, I think it's time to finally commit to one over the other for me.
