When a given cell has a label (given with the CellLabel->"label" option of the cell), then this label disappears after calling               SelectionEvaluate[ nb ]      when the contents of the cell is selected. Why is that? Is it possible to keep the label after evaluating its content (without making a new cell, so not using the               SelectionEvaluateCreateCell[]      command? Thanks for all help!
