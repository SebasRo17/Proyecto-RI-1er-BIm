I want to transform a list of binary digits into integers. With the `Table` function, I produce four lists of binary digits of length 32. Then I tried to turn these lists into integers, but it didn't work. Any suggestions?               Table[b[i] = 1, {i, 0, 32}];     Table[b[k] = b[i + j] = Mod[(b[i + j - 5] + b[i + j - 32]), 2], {i, 32, 35}, {j, 0, 31}]     FromDigits[{b[k]}, 2]
