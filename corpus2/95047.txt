I am just wondering, is there any practical method or technique or even tricks to get avoid those "unknown unknown" bugs especially those nasty and random ones which are often emerge at the last minutes or at least to keep these things at a minimum level. I ask this because when you work on a new platform or use certain new technology for the first time, how do you justify your design and code are robust enough? Or these things can only be learned by time and mistakes? (I use C++ for most of my working time) Thanks!
