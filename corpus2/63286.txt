Please take a look at the several options listed in the following link: http://www.allwebdesignresources.com/webdesignblogs/graphics/best-software-to- create-a-social-networking-community-with-cms-software/ I am keen on the idea of "open source platforms" (such as Drupal and Elgg), but I am not sure which one is best and why. I am not so keen on the idea of a "Licensed" packaged software (a COTS) that, irrespective of the alleged claim of full flexibility offered by the Software House (such as Social Engine), would, in reality, limit my flexibility at an annual cost. Has anyone had any previous experience with any of the listed softwares? If yes, any feedback on their respective Pros and Cons will be much appreciated. Many tks!
