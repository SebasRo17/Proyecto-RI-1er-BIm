I find myself wanting to be able to do regular expression search and replaces in the Mathematica gui over and over again. Using a regex capable editor (such as vim), I could do something like:                :,$ s/ *+ *s\>//cg      for a prompted search and replace of '+ s', ' +s', '+s', ..., but not '+ sa' (say). Is there any thing that offers similar capability in the Mathematica GUI?
