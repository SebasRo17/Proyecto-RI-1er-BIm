I come from a C# background before my existing role. I am developing a VB.NET app. The code I inherited had option strict set to off and all other directives set to 'None'. I have recently switched option strict on and corrected all the errors. It will take me about one day to correct all the warnings. I am trying to decide whether this is time well spent. The application is mature and is working very well. What is the guidance for setting option strict to ON and correcting warnings. I assume that you should not ignore them. However, I read online today (I think it was on here) were one questioner said he/she never bothers with warnings. Surely this is wrong?
