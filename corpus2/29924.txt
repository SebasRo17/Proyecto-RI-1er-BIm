With `r=RotationMatrix[a,{x,y,z}]` I can compute a 3D rotation matrix from axis/angle representation. Given a 3D rotation matrix `r` how can I compute `a, x, y, z`? Example:               r = {{0.966496, -0.214612, 0.14081}, {0.241415, 0.946393, -0.214612}, {-0.0872034, 0.241415, 0.966496}}      The result should be `a=20. Degree` and `{x,y,z}={2, 1, 2}/3` (or equivalent). **Edit:** I am fine with any answer that gives the same `r` when applied to `RotationMatrix`.
