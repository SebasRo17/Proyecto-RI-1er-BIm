I tried the following:               Directory[]      > >     /Users/John >                 SetDirectory["Library/Mathematica"]      > >     /Users/John/Library/Mathematica >   The documentation for `SetDirectory` says: > For a relative path name, `SetDirectory` sets the directory relative to the > current working directory. So it seems that `SetDirectory` interprets my argument as a relative path name. How can I get `SetDirectory` to interpret my argument as an absolute path name, so that the result is `/Library/Mathematica` instead of `/Users/John/Library/Mathematica`?
