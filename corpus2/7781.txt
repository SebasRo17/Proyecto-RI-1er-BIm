I have the following code which draws a graphic, and colors the regions in it different colors:               g = {{Circle[#, 1 - Sqrt[2]/2] & /@ Tuples[0.5 {-1, 1}, 2]},           {Circle[{0, 0}, 1]}};          graphic = Graphics[GeometricTransformation[g, Tuples[Range[-2, 2], 2]]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BeTcT.png)               image = Rasterize[graphic, "Image", ImageSize -> 800];          regions = MorphologicalComponents[image, 0.9];          newimage = ImageResize[        Colorize[regions,            ColorFunction -> (ColorData["SolarColors", Mod[Sin[#^2], 1]] &),            ColorFunctionScaling -> False],         Scaled[0.5]        ]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Xbk46.png) I'd like the color for the region that is outside all of the circles to be black. What's the best way to do this? (The ideal solution would still work if I set `PlotRangePadding -> None` on the original graphic, which will cause the exterior to be several components instead of just one.)
