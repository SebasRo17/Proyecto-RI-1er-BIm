I'm trying to get better at _Mathematica_ and in the book I'm using (by **Nancy Blachman** ) is the following question (which apparently was taken from another book: **_The Art and Science of C_** ) which reads: On a standard telephone keypad, the digits are mapped onto the alphabet (minus the letters Q and Z) as shown below:                       ABC     DEF      1       2       3     GHI     JKL     MNO      4       5       6     PRS     TUV     WXY      7       8       9      Write a function `phoneSpell` that generates all possible letter combinations that correspond to a given number, represented as a string of digits. For example, if you call `phoneSpell[652]`, your function should generate the 27 possible letter combinations corresponding to that prefix, namely               {"MJA", "MJB", "MJC", "MKA", "MKB", "MKC", "MLA", "MLB", "MLC",      "NJA", "NJB", "NJC", "NKA", "NKB", "NKC", "NLA", "NLB", "NLC", "OJA",     "OJB", "OJC", "OKA", "OKB", "OKC", "OLA", "OLB", "OLC"}      Note that if the argument passed to `phoneSpell` contains a 0 or 1, that position in the output should simply be displayed as that digit, since there are no letters that correspond to it. I've tried various things like first converting the number to a `String` using `ToString` and getting the `Length` using `StringLength`. I've tried a combination of `Outer` and `Tuples` to get the different combinations, but I'm not getting much luck. Any pointers in the right direction will be appreciated. Thanks.
