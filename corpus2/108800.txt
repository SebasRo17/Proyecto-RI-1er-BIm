After seeing this question today on variation of the FizzBuzz interview question, as well as seeing other questions related to it around, I have to ask: is there any _formal_ research on how effective this is as an interview technique? There are plenty of folks who say that it filters out some crazy- sounding percentage of candidates (95%+ in some cases) but how good is it for finding good programmers/developers? There has been some research that shows that soft skills might be better indicators than hard skills for choosing a good candidate for a job role. As well, there might be some intermediate reasons for so many candidates failing this test (nervousness, thinking "it's a trick", etc). **EDIT:** Based on the comments so far, it looks like the idea behind FizzBuzz questions is to determine whether or not the person has good (enough) coding skills to be further considered. I'm not totally convinced FizzBuzz actually does this. Also, remember that FizzBuzz filters _a very large percentage_ of candidates _very early_ in the hiring process, which could mean that significant numbers of good candidates are being removed early on because they can't solve silly problems fast enough. Also, I'll point out that looking at FizzBuzz effectiveness is something that can completely be done in a quantitative manner. This is unlike looking at "fit" or "passion" which are highly variable and highly unscientific (but still quite important for new hiring decisions).
