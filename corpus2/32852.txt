I want to call Mathematica from a C program. Suppose I have two numbers x =2 and y=3. I want to define the x, y in a C program and call Mathematica and I want Mathematica to do the sum and return me the result. I use Linux. I want to know how should I use MathLink here: what should be written in mathematica file and the c file and at last, the compiler command. I want a complete program.
