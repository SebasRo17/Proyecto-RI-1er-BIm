Can I bundle my proprietary JavaScript code with MIT licensed libraries (e.g. JQuery, AngularJS) into the same file, distribute it via HTTP but disallow my users to use my own code as an MIT licensed code? This way I could minimize the number of browser requests, and reduce errors due to network errors. I don't want to let my users copy, modify and reuse my own code outside of my website.
