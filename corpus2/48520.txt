When I receive messages from people using their smartphones I usually see typos and, worst, typos corrected by Autocorrect. Now, I receive messages in English, which is not my first language. I can easily understand what unfixed typos are supposed to mean (I just need to take a look at the keyboard), but Autocorrect-ed typos are an entirely different beast. They usually are totally different words, and the context doesn't help very much. Is there a way in Mathematica to provide in input an English dictionary and an Autocorrect-ed word, and get as output all the words that, slightly mispelled, would lead to the Autocorrect-ed word? Addendum: here's the sentence in which I'm 99% sure that "IMAP" is the result of autocorrection. > It is memorial weekend so IMAP working extra long hour
