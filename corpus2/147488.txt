Using spring mvc to create a restful api, Maven is build tool and tomcat with spring jars is deployment . **Plan A** : each webservice will be its own separate war file/project ? if required I would supply dependices as jar(s) (such as any dao's/dto's/service layer classes used in different webservices? I would share the spring jars between projects from with tomcat lib directory. **Plan B** : Have one large project with different controllers (and subsequent request mappings for restful api) added when needed. Supply the spring dependices with project in maven. Which is better ? I'm aware spring is not jax-rs compliant - what does this mean in practice, whats the difference if not compliant ?
