I was studying about the infrastructure being used by Facebook, as I was developing a website based on social interaction for a university project. Facebook is using Tornado Web Server as its scalable, non-blocking web server, but it's written for Python. I'm trying to find something similar for Java: what should I be looking at? What are your experiences in non-blocking web servers for Java?
