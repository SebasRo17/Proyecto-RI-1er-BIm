So I'm trying to make a world map, where each country is colored according to its timezone. Except, for countries with multiple timezones, the country is filled with vertical stripes of colors corresponding to the various timezones.               colorstripes[zones_] :=        Graphics[MapIndexed[{#1, Rectangle[{#2[[1]], 0}]} &,          ColorData["Rainbow"][(# + 12)/24] & /@ zones]];     Graphics[{EdgeForm[Black],          Texture@colorstripes[CountryData[#, "TimeZones"]],          CountryData[#, "Polygon"]} & /@ CountryData["Countries"]]      ![does not work, everything is black](http://i.stack.imgur.com/o7mdD.png) Yet, my colorstripes function works: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4Z4DO.png) So, I am probably misusing `Texture` in a way, but as it does not give any warning or error, I'm kind of stuck. Do you see what's missing?
