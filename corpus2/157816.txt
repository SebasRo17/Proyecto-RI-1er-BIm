Well, I am reading Programing Windows with MFC, and I came across Unicode and ASCII code characters. I understood the point of using Unicode over ASCII, but what I do not get is how and why is it important to use 8bit/16bit/32bit character? What good does it do to the system? How does the processing of the operating system differ for different bits of character. My question here is, what does it mean to a character when it is a x-bit character?
