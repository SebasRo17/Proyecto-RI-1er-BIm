I am developping a 3D reconstruction application. I recuperate the voxels coordinates (the coordinate of each voxel) of the object that I need to reconstruct. Each voxel have a dimensions like this 5cm*5cm*5cm. I need to reconstruct this volume. I try to use `Image3D` function by put just a 3d binary table representing the voxels that belongs to volume but I could not change the size of each voxel. Any help please?
