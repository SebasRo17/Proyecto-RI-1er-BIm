I have an application I've inherited that I'd call "proto-MVC", and I love the concept of MVC but am new to it. In my ideal dream of a lightweight application, all of the document's content is stored in an array:               <script>     var MVCDocument={         DOM:{            ...         },         listeners[           {..},           {..}         ]     }     </script>      That array defines the content and structure of the page, as well as what programming assets are present at the time. Next, I would have listeners or running processes that monitor the structure of the MVCDocument and react to any changes in it. These processes are the "brains". Ajax calls will modify or annotate the MVCDocument. Changes to the MVCDocument object might in turn modify the listeners/"Brains". CSS would function to style the presentation layer. The problem is that I don't know the right terms to look for examples of what I'm wanting to develop. I prefer NOT to re-invent the wheel. What are some good examples of aps that run based on this premise? and are there more components than just the bones (document array), brains (javascript coding), and clothing (css)?
