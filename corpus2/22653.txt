Creating a BarChart with {1, 2, 3, 0} as               BarChart[{1, 2, 3, 0}, Axes -> False, Frame -> True]      gives me only the first three bars, a chart identical to just               BarChart[{1, 2, 3}, Axes -> False, Frame -> True]        1. Is this an intended behaviour or a bug?   2. (Originally I asked for a workaround. I think I can just use `Axes` instead of `Frame`. Let me ask this instead for the sake of knowledge.) What to do if I need `Frame` but not `Axes`? I'm using Mathematica 9.
