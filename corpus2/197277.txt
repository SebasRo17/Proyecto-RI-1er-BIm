I've created an app that has some sound file that I've downloaded from Macloops. The user can only listen these sound files (he can't create any new sound files using them) with the app. Now, I want to distribute the app over the internet and I'd like to know if I can do this legally. I've only found the following the Macloops' website about copyright : > Macloops membership disclaimer/terms & conditions. > > By joining the Macloops website, you are accepting these Terms and > Conditions. > > You accept that Macloops.com is part of Siliconbeats.com and you grant us > the right to send you occasional emails regarding our latest news and > developments.

There is nothing about using the sound files. So am I allowed to distribute my app?
