I am trying to export a plot generated by `MatrixPlot` to PDF but am having problems with the way the exported PDF is rendered.                 mPlot = MatrixPlot[length,        Epilog -> {Cyan,          MapIndexed[If[#1 != 0, Text[#1, Reverse[#2 - 1/2]]] &,           Reverse[number], {2}]}, Mesh -> True,        FrameTicks -> {{Table[i, {i, 9}],           MapIndexed[{First[#2], regionCodes[[#1]]} &,            Table[i, {i, 9}]]}, {Table[i, {i, 9}],           MapIndexed[{First[#2], Rotate[regionCodes[[#1]], 90 Degree]} &,            Table[i, {i, 9}]]}}, ColorFunctionScaling -> False,        PlotRange -> {Min[length], Max[length]}]      The matrices `length` (plotted as shades of gray in the figure below), `number` (shown as the cyan numbers in the figure below), and `regionCodes` have the following values               length = {{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}, {0, 0.079774, 0.0545131,         0.0484267, 0.0614324, 0.0627509, 0.0572262, 0.0424639, 0}, {0, 0,         0.0600802, 0.100418, 0.0615561, 0.0737833, 0.0732888, 0.0624553,         0}, {0, 0, 0, 0.0740108, 0.0559982, 0.0666054, 0.0749018,         0.0493431, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 0, 0.0774839, 0.0554172, 0.0564699,         0.0491287, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.0798436, 0.0643044, 0.0606039,         0}, {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.107009, 0.0713126, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,         0, 0.0951722, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}}     number = {{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}, {0, 37, 53, 21, 778, 1064, 228,         15, 0}, {0, 0, 27, 40, 761, 1164, 272, 21, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 7, 331,         507, 125, 9, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 0, 5935, 12430, 2917, 245, 0}, {0, 0, 0,         0, 0, 10665, 4323, 393, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 664, 90, 0}, {0, 0,         0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}}     regionCodes = {"New England", "Middle Atlantic", "East North Central",        "West North Central", "South Atlantic", "East South Central",        "West South Central", "Mountain", "Pacific"}      This is `length//MatrixForm` ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/RDYJ0.png) And this is `number//MatrixForm` ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bTfpA.png) The plot looks like this when shown in Mathematica ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gO0DL.png) But the exported PDF is rendered as follows (shown in OS X Preview) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/NAOLh.png) There is a lot of shading and (and anti-aliasing?) going on (it shouldn't!). The only solution I have come up with is to rasterize the plot before exporting it. It does the job, but I don't consider it very elegant.               Export["regionIBD_MatrixPlot.pdf", Rasterize[mPlot, ImageResolution -> 600], ImageSize -> Full]      The funny thing is that if I export it as TIFF, it renders correctly. Is there a way to export the plot as a vector graphics and not as a bitmap?
