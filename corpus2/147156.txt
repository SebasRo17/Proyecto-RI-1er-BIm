> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Do people in non-English-speaking countries code in English? Do developers who don't natively speak English still code using english property and tag names? Like, would a Japanese front end web developer still need to know what border-radius means in English to use it, or would Japanese sites use Japanese CSS? I ask because I'm an English speaking web developer who aspires to be multilingual someday, and I might try to use that combination of skills to travel the world a little. Will I still code in English, even while building sites in China or Japan? If so, would that improve my chances of getting a job?
