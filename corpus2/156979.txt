I need to work with 4-5 programmers on a fairly average PHP application using codeigniter. We're in 5 different locations in one city, and all of the programmers are all not too well educated and I'm assuming that most of them have never used any version control system. Can you recommend some very very easy-to-get-into platform for collaborating on a project like this? I'm talking about something that is only a tad more sophisticated than a shared dropbox folder.
