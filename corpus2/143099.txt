Ever since Notch (of Minecraft fame) announced his next project will include programmable 16-bit CPUs ingame everybody seems to want to write VM's for the specification Notch has written up. I've seen them written in C, C++, Go, JavaScript, CoffeeScript, etc. What's so special about the specification Notch wrote up or is it just that it's the first game that actually contains a CPU ingame that you can do whatever you want with? It sparked my curiosity, but I fail to grasp the thing that makes it so special suddenly everybody needs to write up code for it?
