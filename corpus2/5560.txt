I'm creating a dialog with `CreateDialog`. I want one of its cells to have its text centered. By default (and I like that default), the notebook created has `WindowSize` set to `All`, which I'm guessing adjusts the window width according to the widest cell. _The problem_ The centered cell doesn't show. What's a neat way to make this work? I could live with programatically querying the "real" size of the dialog, so that I can then set it explicitly in `WindowSize`, in which case `TextAlignment->Center` seems to work, but I don't know how. _Sample code_               CreateDialog[{"¿Hasta dónde se lava la cara un pelado?",         Style["bo", TextAlignment -> Center]}];      Same happens with               CreateDialog[{"¿Hasta dónde se lava la cara un pelado?",         Cell["bo", TextAlignment -> Center]}];      However               CreateDialog[{"¿Hasta dónde se lava la cara un pelado?",         Style["bo", TextAlignment -> Center]}, WindowSize -> {300, 100}];
