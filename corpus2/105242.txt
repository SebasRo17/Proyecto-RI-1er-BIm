New to agile and I'm not sure how to start. The idea is to create small parts of the project in sprints. However the project I'm working of requires a database and the database must be almost functional to do anything with the project. So how do Agile projects handle this, do you start by creating the database? How would you do so, for example if using Scrum how would you do the user stories and test the db. Would you rather do parts of the db in a story that also requires code. Say you have a story that is "As a user you must be able to register..." you would create the user table in the database as a part of this story? How can agile help you design the database?
