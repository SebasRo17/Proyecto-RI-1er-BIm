I'm planning on providing some GPL software to visitors after they interact with an advertisement. This advertisement will generate revenue for our company, so this would fall under commercial usage. I understand the GPL requires us to either provide the source or a written promise to provide the source upon request when distributing the software commercially. I'd like to know if providing a link to the the software creator's website, with instructions on getting the source, would be sufficient to satisfy this clause in the GPL?
