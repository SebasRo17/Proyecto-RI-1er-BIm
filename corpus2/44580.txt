I found solutions of two nonlinear equations, but I have three small questions. First I am in confusion because of initial value. The system is mechanical and unknown ϕ is an angle, which I set to be in position of 90 degrees (Pi/2). Is it correct setting in equation initial position? Second question: I am looking for discrete points of an angle values here                ϕ = 90 Degree (Pi/2 Radians)      ϕ = 80 Degree (1.396 Radians)      ϕ = 70 Degree (1.221 Radians)      ϕ = 30 Degree (0.523 Radians)      ϕ = 20 Degree (0.349 Radians)      ϕ = 10 Degree (0.174 Radians)      ϕ = 0 Degree (0 Radians)      Numerical solutions of these values down and in which time                {z[t], z'[t], ϕ'[t], ϕ''[t], z''[t], t}      I solved the system and obtained solutions, but I don't know how to extract these values from the diagrams. Third question: I am looking for to obtain FindMinimum[zsol[t],t] and FindMaximum[zsol[t],t] but Mathematica gives value which is not extrema because I can see from the diagram that it is not extrema.                c1 = 7.5*10^3;      m = 10;      l = 1;      M = 75;      g = 9.81;           {zsol, ϕsol} =         NDSolveValue[          {z''[t] - (M l)/(m + M) ϕ''[t] Sin[ϕ[t]] - (M l)/(m + M)             (ϕ'[t])^2 Cos[ϕ[t]] + c1/(m + M) z[t] == 0,            ϕ''[t] - 1/l z''[t] Sin[ϕ[t]] + g/l Sin[ϕ[t]] == 0,            z[0] == -((M g)/c1), z'[0] == 0, ϕ[0] == Pi /2, ϕ'[0] == 0},          {ϕ, z}, {t, 0, 15}]           Plot[{zsol[t], ϕsol[t]}, {t, 0, 5}, PlotStyle -> {Red, Blue}]      Plot[{zsol[t]}, {t, 0, 5}, PlotStyle -> {Red}]      Plot[{ϕsol[t]}, {t, 0, 5}, PlotStyle -> {Blue}]      Solutions ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Cvid2.png)
