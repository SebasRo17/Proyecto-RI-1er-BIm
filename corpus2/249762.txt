I am working on an application using sockets. Essentially I want to stream data between two clients. Since I can't connect the two clients together directly (they aren't on the same network), I will need to connect the two through a server. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gLpR0.png) My client-side is written in Java but the server-side could be written in any language. I have already explored using socket.io etc. but the issue I ran in to is that Java doesn't have a nice websocket solution. What other options are there out there to achieve the same effect? The solution I have in mind right now is basically "forwarding" the stream from one client to the other through the server, but there could be a better way out there...
