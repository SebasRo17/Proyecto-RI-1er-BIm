I'm a web developer with 10 years of experience in the Microsoft stack. I was brought to the US by my company, but my contract has ended. I want to continue pursuing a career in the US, but it seems there's a focus on networking while still in college. Due to my foreign education, my networking occurred elsewhere. However, because of this network effect, it seems most developers in the US only have to apply to one or two jobs throughout their career. Am I handicapped by not having a professional network in the US?
