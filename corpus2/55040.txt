I've decided what I really want is to do game programming. So the question is, as a 18 years old who wants to learn self taught programming, what is the most suited programming language between C# and C++? (I should state that I don't care about Unix because I believe windows will be still the most used OS) I know the basics of C++, but none about C#. I know that C++ has more tutorials guides, dlls and stuff like that, while C# doesn't, but it's far easier to learn and to use for a single person to develop a program, but I've read even if the program is obfuscated it's easy to get the source of it. Well, I kinda want to focus on basic a lot first, I must say that I have a preference for C++ just because it feels more suitable to me, but I must consider that I work alone. So even if I like it, it may not be the best thing to do. I am really not sure of which one to go for, I've read a lot of threads on various websites and it looks like C# is becoming more popular than C++. But yeah, that said, I also specified I want to do game programming. So I need to know some better points than just "C# is easier because of .net memory handling while C++ isn't" because I couldn't just find it.
