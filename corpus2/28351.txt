I want to integrate an interpolating function `a[x,y]` over a certain region in the xy-plane. My problem is that _Mathematica_ is taking too long. I am hoping someone knows a method which will speed up the calculation. Here is my integration expression               NIntegrate[a[x, y], {x, -12, 12}, {y, -12, 12},        AccuracyGoal -> 8, PrecisionGoal -> 8, Method -> "LocalAdaptive"]      I chose "LocalAdaptive" because I read that it is usefull for integration in higher dimensions. And my interpolating function, `a[x,y]`, looks like this: ![enter link description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PM0GL.jpg)
