I am working on a project that will be acquiring four new Java developers (mid-to-senior level). They will be responsible for writing code for web services and an event-driven UI. This is a .NET project using C# and WPF. We have ten weeks to create a substantial amount of new functionality. Project management has called our time line "aggressive but achievable." The new developers have limited to no experience in .NET. Assuming the new developers are very-talented, how many weeks before they can begin contributing to the project? Or are we doomed? I realize I'm giving very few details, but I would welcome even the roughest of estimates.
