We are starting an Agile project, and the product owner has made a start adding user stories to the product backlog (mostly epics at this stage). Who would be responsible for breaking down epics into smaller user stories - is it left to the product owner, or would you expect the rest of the team to be involved (bearing in mind they won't have any knowledge of the requirements or problem domain)?
