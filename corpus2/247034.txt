I have a client that has been upset with the fact that it takes more time than he thinks to complete a feature / bug in a web application. He is more of a project manager that has hired me as a sub-contractor. He has constantly been questioning the estimates I have given him, and is always trying to get me to agree to do things in a less amount of time than I have estimated. I have made it clear to him that I will not always bill for the full estimate if it does not in fact take me that long to complete. He also told me that if there is code on google (w3schools), that I should use that and not write it myself. I have been doing business with this person for 12 months. Just to clarify what I mean by "Google", I mean that he would always prefer I copy / paste code that I have found from Google rather than writing code myself.
