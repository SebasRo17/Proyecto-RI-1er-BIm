I am a member of some online coding website and today when I submitted a solution in C++, I saw there were much better answers in C++ itself which took considerably less time. The solutions were open so I went on through some of them and found all of them using map datastructure. I could not figure out where exactly it takes an edge. I made some googling but it was not convincing. Please help.
