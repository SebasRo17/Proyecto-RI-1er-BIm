I have the following list:               AA={         {0.,0.,0.,0.,0.,0.,0.,0.},         {0.,-10.9421,-17.3061,-19.0045,-19.0045,-17.3061,-10.9421,0.},         {0.,-16.8109,-27.6012,-24.8577,-24.8577,-27.6012,-16.8109,0.},         {0.,-19.9862,-34.0245,-28.3369,-28.3369,-34.0245,-19.9862,0.},         {0.,-19.9862,-34.0245,-28.3369,-28.3369,-34.0245,-19.9862,0.},         {0.,-16.8109,-27.6012,-24.8577,-24.8577,-27.6012,-16.8109,0.},         {0.,-10.9421,-17.3061,-19.0045,-19.0045,-17.3061,-10.9421,0.},         {0.,0.,0.,0.,0.,0.,0.,0.}     };      This list is the input for a 3D Plot:               ListPlot3D[AA, DataRange -> {{0, 4000}, {0, 4000}},       InterpolationOrder -> 1, Filling -> Axis, PlotRange -> All]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UGrRT.png) How can I calculate the volume of this graph? I've tried `NIntegrate` but it didn't work out for me.
