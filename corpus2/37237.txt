I have a text file with a set of replacement rules, of the form > >     x^3y^2 -> 4, >     xy^2 -> 2, >     ... >   for example. I'm having some issues trying to figure out how to tell _Mathematica_ to read those rules and apply them. So far I've tried               F[x,y] /. "!cat rules.txt"       but that gave an invalid syntax error. Any suggestions? **EDIT** After some initial suggestions, here is some extra information: After using the Import command as suggested by rm -rf, and removing the last comma from the text file, mathematica does not interpret the result as a list of replacement rules. If I now do               replaceList = {Import["rules.txt"]};     F[x3,x4,x5] /. replaceList      Mathematica now says:               ReplaceAll::reps: {x5^3->5,     x4*x5^2->5,     x3*x5^2->5,     x2*x5^2->5} is neither a list of replacement rules nor a valid dispatch table, and so cannot be used for replacing. >>      **EDIT2** Ok all, here is a very concrete example of what I'm facing. Thank you for helping me thus far, I'm sorry to be vague. In a text file called rules.txt I have the following content:               $ cat rules.text      x1*x2^2->1,     x1^2*x3->3,     x1^3->4       In mathematica I have the following code followed with an error:               F[x1_, x2_, x3_] := x1 *x2^2 + x1^2*x3 + x1^3     rules = Import["rules.text"]     {{"x1*x2^2->1,"}, {"x1^2*x3->3,"}, {"x1^3->4"}}      Obviously the formatting of the rules are incorrect, but if we try to brute force it, we get the error:               F[x1, x2, x3] /. rules     ReplaceAll::reps: {x1*x2^2->1,} is neither a list of replacement rules nor a valid dispatch table, and so cannot be used for replacing. >>     ...     (*followed by similar errors for the other replacement rules read in*)      One quick attempt at fixing is to flatten the import table, or do what Michael E2 suggested:               rules = Flatten[Import["rules.text"]]     out = {"x1*x2^2->1,", "x1^2*x3,", "x1^3->4"}          F[x1, x2, x3] /. rules     ReplaceAll::reps:      "\!\({\"x1*x2^2->1,\", \"x1^2*x3->3,\", \"x1^3->4\"}\) is neither a list \     of replacement rules nor a valid dispatch.."      Or,               rules = ToExpression@Import["rules.text"]     ToExpression::sntx: Invalid syntax in or before "x1*x2^2->1, ".     ToExpression::sntx: Invalid syntax in or before "x1^2*x3->3, ".      Which fails also. Please let me know if I can add any more information to make the issue clearer, and thanks again. **EDIT3** I found a workaround solution. If one removes the comma from the text file, so that it reads:               $ cat rules.dat      x1*x2^2->1     x1^2*x3->3     x1^3->4      the following commands resolve the issue:               F[x1_, x2_, x3_] := x1 *x2^2 + x1^2*x3 + x1^3     F[x1, x2, x3] /. ToExpression@Flatten[Import["rules.dat"]]     out = 8      _note_ the importance of the .dat extension. .txt does not work.
