I have a question about face adjacency graphs. Suppose that I have an adjacency matrix               M = {{0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0},           {1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1},            {0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0},           {0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0},           {1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0},           {1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1},           {0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1},           {0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0}}      that is known to be a planar graph. So I use the command `GraphPlot[M]` and give vertex labeling. The result is ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UlwEa.jpg) There are 5 faces in the figure (exclude the outer face). The set of vertices of the faces is `{{1,6,8,2}, {1,6,5},{4,5,6,8,7},{3,4,7},{2,3,7,8}}`. I don't know how to find this list of vertices automatically if I enter any adjacency matrix (I'm sure that all picked matrices are planar graphs due to `PlanarGraph[M]`)
