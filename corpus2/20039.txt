I have data that reflects the arrival time of a flight. {3, -2, 16, 13, -6, 5, 4, -7, 7, 0……..n} _this is for 8:45am and has 150 elements "arrivals"_ The positive values represent the time in minutes past the planned time,{“late”} and the negative, is before planned time {“early”} My question, I would like to find the time of arrival with the highest probability. Can I use this data as is?
