Should you throw an exception if a method's input values are out of range? eg               //no imaginary numbers     public int MySquareRoot(int x)     {         if (x<0)         {         throw new ArgumentOutOfBoundsException("Must be a non-negative integer");          }              //our implementation here           }      Now this method should never be called with a non-negative number, but hey programmers make mistakes. Is throwing exceptions here the right thing to do?
