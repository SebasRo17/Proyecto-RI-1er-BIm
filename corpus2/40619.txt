Array consists of words of different languages. I need to sort elements in reverse alphabetical order and make a list of elements, which consist of english letters. Example of array which consist of english and russian words:               m = {"computer", "экзамен", "elephant", "стол", "bread", "телефон",         "exception", "desktop", "best", "колонка", "zoom", "saphire",         "ярость"};      Sorting with `Reverse@Sort[m]` and `Sort[m]` work with english words only. `Select[m, LetterQ]` can make a list of english words. Problem is a different language (Russian in this e.g.)
