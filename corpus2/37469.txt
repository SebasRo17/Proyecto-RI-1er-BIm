I am just getting started with the SymbolicC package, and am trying to figure out how to handle function pointer typedefs, like, say:               typedef double (*rhs)(double, double);      The problem is that the `CTypedef` function expects its arguments to be `CTypedef[type, var]`, which isn't really how function pointer declarationss in C work. An ordinary pointer typedef is done using `CDereference`, as:               CTypedef["double", CDereference["xp"]]      I'm not sure how to make that work in the context of `CFunction`.
