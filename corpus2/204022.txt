For example I've got following code:               auto z = [](int x) -> int {         if (x > 0) {             switch (x) {                 case 2: return 5;                 case 3: return 6;                 default: return 1;                 }             }         return 0;         };      And later I call this several times. In asm code I see external calls with lambda....something... It's becoming not easy to read and I think it also can cause performance. So maybe I win in meta-programming but do I lose in asm debugging and performance? Should I avoid modern language features, macros and other meta programming aspects to be sure in performance and debugging simplicity?
