I own a VPS with Windows Server 2012 on it. I can install whatever I want on it. In the past when deploying an ASP.Net MVC project, I would right click the project in the solution and `Publish` it. I would then copy over the files to the IIS folder and that would be a `deployment` for me. But this is no longer something I want to do. There has to be an easier way right? How can I streamline the deployment process? I'm 100% in the dark on this subject with .NET. Can I set something up on my server so I can `Web Deploy` to my VPS? Or is there a better alternative? Thank you!
