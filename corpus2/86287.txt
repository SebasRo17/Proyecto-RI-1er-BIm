With the addtion of Extension methods to C# we've seen a lot of them crop up in our group. One debate revolves around extension methods like this one:               public static class StringExt     {         /// <summary>         /// Shortcut for string.Format.         /// </summary>         /// <param name="str"></param>         /// <param name="args"></param>         /// <returns></returns>         public static string Format(this string str, params object[] args)         {             if (str == null) return null;             return string.Format(str, args);         }     }      Does this extension method break any programming best practices that you can name? Would you use it anyway, if not why? If I renamed the function to "F" but left the xml comments would that be epic fail or just a wonderful savings of keystrokes?
