I maintain a relatively popular github repo. When a pull request is good to merge I usually ask the author to rebase it to a single commit before I merge it (especially when there have been multiple small edits). Is this good git practice? Is this acceptable/standard GitHub etiquette? So some benefits:   * I get a nice clean commit history in the commit logs   * I don't need to alter the commit myself   * It delegates some of the work Some possible drawbacks:   * I'm not sure if this is good etiquette   * I'm not sure if this is a good git practice   * I've usually already asked for a few other changes - this is one more and I don't want to discourage contributors.
