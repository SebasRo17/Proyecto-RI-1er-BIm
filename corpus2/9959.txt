How can Pascal's triangle be visualised like this in Mathematica? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IYMmu.png) Or more generally, how can a 'triangular' list like               {{1},{1, 1}, {1, 2, 1}}      be visualized in this way. Also I would like to do 'conditional things' like colouring the number two red.
