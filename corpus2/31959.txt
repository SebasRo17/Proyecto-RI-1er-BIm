The solution and plot of the Differential equation is $\frac{d^2S(r)}{dr^2}+\frac{1}{r}\frac{dS(r)}{dr}-S(r)+3S^3(r)=0$               S0 = S[r] /.         NDSolve[{S''[r] + 1/r S'[r] - S[r] + S[r]^3 == 0,           S[1/10000000000000000] == 2.20620086,           S'[1/10000000000000000] == 0}, S, {r, 1/1000, 15}];     Plot[{S0}, {r, 1/100, 14}, PlotRange -> Full]      I have to use the above info in the differential equation: $\frac{d^2Z(r)}{dr^2}+\frac{1}{r}\frac{dZ(r)}{dr}-Z(r)+3S^2Z(r)-S^5(r)=0$ **And I have plotted like this: but it is not working**               sol = NDSolve[{s''[r] + 1/r s'[r] - s[r] + s[r]^3 == 0,          s[1/10000000000000000] == 2.20620086,          s'[1/10000000000000000] == 0}, s, {r, 1/1000, 15}];     sol = s[r] /. sol;     Z0 = Z[r] /.         NDSolve[{Z''[r] + 1/r*Z'[r] - Z[r] + 3 sol^2*Z[r] - sol^5 == 0,           Z[1/10000000000000000] == -16.17403,           Z'[1/10000000000000000] == 0}, Z, {r, 1/1000, 15}];     Plot[{Z0}, {r, 1/100, 14}, PlotRange -> Full]      The output curve will be like: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dFrMM.png). I have used r instead of $\rho$. I have tried several times to get the output but it shows some following which I don't understand. I have looked the error to get but couldn't. Sorry for the poor question. I have studied but couldn't fix it.
