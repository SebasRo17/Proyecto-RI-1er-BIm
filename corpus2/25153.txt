I have a feeling the solution to my problem is very simpleâ€¦ but my knowledge of differential equations is pretty weak. I am trying to solve a scalar diffusion equation (used in NMR spectroscopy, but from what I understand, modeled after heat and Fickian diffusion). I've tried following model equations, but whenever I ask Mathematica to evaluate, it returns the original equation. What am I missing here? Here is my code:               With[{Dif = 2300, pde = D[u[t, r], t] == Dif/r*D[u[t, r]*r, r, r] -       1/(0.0945 E^(0.000212+0.4077r))*(u[t, r]+1.2004)},       soln = NDSolve[{pde, u[0, r] == 0, Derivative[0, 1][u][t, 0] == 0,       Limit[u[t, r], r -> \[Infinity]] == 0}, u, {t, 0, 10}, {r, 0, 500}]]      Upon evaluation, it returns an error stating that the equation is "overdetermined". Removing a single one of the 3 boundary conditions results in an "underdetermined" error. Is this possible to solve using NDSolve, or do I need to break down the equation? Thanks for the help!
