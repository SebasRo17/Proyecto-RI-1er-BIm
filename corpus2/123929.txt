My task is to implement a distributed semaphore system (links to description) and an application for it. I will be using Java sockets, and it will use watermark arrays and priority queues (not sure where), and so I am curious about how to tackle this project. Specifically, I'd like to know what is a good first-step goal, or a simple subsystem I can implement. At the moment, I just don't know where to focus my attention. The application is a floating license system - like in a computer lab with only one copy of a software (maybe a CAD program), which allows only one PC at a time to use the software. When one machine is using the software, the access to the software is locked. When that machine is done using it, it gives it up and whomever was first in requesting should be next. Here's the pseudo-code algorithm referenced - http://i.imgur.com/q9kRm.png
