I have a list that includes dates. I need to convert each date to be the last day of the quarter that it's in. So for example I want {2013,7,1,0,0,0} to become {2013,9,30,0,0,0}. Actually I don't need the zero's. I was trying to do this with a rule, but ran into problems. I wanted a rule like: 7,_ -> 9,30. Further I was going to try to insert alternatives into this with something like 7,_ |8,_ |9,_ -> 9,30. Is there a way to write a rule to handle this? Or, for this specific problem is there a better way to convert these dates to quarter end dates? An example of a row of data is: {{2009,5,1,0,0,0},"TYAU145A", 92468., 0.5, 46234.}.
