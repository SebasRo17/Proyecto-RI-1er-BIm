I just recently got my first development job, and consider myself lucky to be working from home. However, I need advice... What should I be doing in order to make sure I get the most out of my new job, how can I make sure that I succeed, and what are some particular pitfalls I might run across? I have already set aside a distraction free home office, where should I go from here? Note: I have been reading up on some of the more general work from home stuff here but I am interested in what to watch out for as a junior developer.
