Is unit testing a 100% or not at all kind of deal? I was browsing through my old projects and started adding features, this time with unit testing. However, is this ultimately worthless if I'm going to be re-using past components that do not have unit tests? Do I need to write unit tests for all the previous classes and not bother at all, or is it OK to only write unit tests for the new stuff I'm adding?
