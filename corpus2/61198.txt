I understand the purpose of XML, but I always hear people complain about how BAD it is? I don't really understand whats so bad about it? I usually hear the terms "bloated" and "slow" tossed around. But I guess as programmers, what do you mainly use it for? And do you really consider it "bad"....because if it is, an awful lot of people use it for transporting of data...
