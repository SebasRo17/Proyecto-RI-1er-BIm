In _Mathematica_ help it's written that: > `ListDensityPlot[array]` -> generates a smooth density plot from an `array` > of values. There is also an example:                ListDensityPlot[{{1, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 2, 1, 2}, {1, 1, 3, 1}, {1, 2, 1, 4}}, Mesh -> All]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Mhmmk.jpg) I understand when the input is in the form of $ \{ x, y, f(x,y)\}$, what this function does. But, I really cannot understand what this function does when it has an array as an input.
