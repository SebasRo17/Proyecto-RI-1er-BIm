In most of the projects at work it will eventually show up a package, a class (or multiple packages and classes) named "Utils", where every kind of function is dumped into. It becomes excruciating harder and harder to navigate the project without a properly named structure. I have tried to ask to stop using "Utils". When I find it if and the change to the codebase is small I normally refractor it and remove them, but they always end on showing up cluttering the code. So do you know any strategy to make them stop doing this? Or am I just being a nagger?
