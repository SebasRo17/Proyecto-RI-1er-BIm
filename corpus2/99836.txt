I'm currently 16, and I consider myself a good developer. I've worked as a freelance and with an Israeli company (that serves other international companies) for the past year, and I've completely satisfied my clients with a consistent 10/10 rating to date. However, I've recently been trying to find work experience in real life at an influential software firm, but with limited (and by limited I mean no) success (I've only applied at the smaller firms, all of which were advertising available job positions). It is a requirement to take a week's work experience in my state, but I've already done that at a hospital (to try out my parent's career choice for me 0 a doctor), and want to have a shot at a software development firm. I've sent about 4 emails to different companies about it, but haven't received any replies yet (its been weeks). How do I go about finding work experience as a 16 year old?
