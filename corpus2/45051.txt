I am trying to get units working in mathematica in the following expression for diffusion: $D = {K_B T}/{3 \pi \eta L}$ My code is as follows:               KB = Quantity[1.380650*10^-23, ("Meters")^2*"Kilograms"*("Seconds")^-2*("Kelvins")^-1];     T = Quantity[20 + 273.15, "Kelvins"];     eta0 = Quantity[8.9*10^-4, "Pascals"*"Seconds"];     L = Quantity[200*10^-9, "Meters"];          D = (KB*T)/(3*Pi*eta0*L)      This evaluates to: $2.41258\times10^{-12}\,\text{kg}\, \text{m}\text{/(}\text{s}^3\text{Pa})$ Which under `UnitSimplify` reduces to: $2.41258\times10^{-12}\,\text{V}/\text{T}\,\, ... \,\,(volts\,per\,tesla??)$ for diffusion coefficients I am expecting units of $meters^{2}/second$. Can anyone see whats gone wrong? Thanks
