One thing I have realized working at a large corporation is that it doesn't matter how smart you are because if everyone else doesn't see the value in what you are doing then you are not going to get very far. It's much harder to convince 1000 people that a certain part of the software stack should be in groovy than it is to convince 10 people of the same thing. I'm curious how people go about elevating the engineering culture at large corporations because I've been running into walls left and right and I would like to be more proactive about how I go about it. I have been advocating tech talks and tech demos along with code reviews as potential solutions. Do people have other suggestions? Note that 1000 people and groovy are just representative examples. I am not married to groovy or any other language and 1000 people is meant to indicate large scale and how to go about teaching a large group of people about best practices and engineering principles in general.
