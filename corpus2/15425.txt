I've got two lists that look like this               list1={{"1/01/2010 6:15", 0.0565625}, {"11/06/2010 0:15",0}, {"11/06/2010 0:30", 0},{"11/06/2010 0:45",0}, {"11/06/2010 1:00", 0}}          list2={{"01/01/2010 06:15", 0.04375}, {"01/01/2010 06:30",0.04375}, {"01/01/2010 06:45", 0.04375}, {"01/01/2010 07:00",0.04375}, {"01/01/2010 07:15", 0.04375}}      What I want to do is create a list that looks like this;               list3={{"1/01/2010 6:15", 0.0565625, 0.04375},{{"01/01/2010 06:30",,0.04375},......}      Either list may have gaps in it. It's not important that all the gaps be filled (if the date is missing from both list1&2 then it can be missing from list3). What is important is that it's fast, the data set is about 100,000 records.
