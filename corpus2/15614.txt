I installed Mathematica 9 on my Windows 7 system (installed the font patch afterwards so the BSOD are gone) but the "Extras" package installation fails claiming it can't de-install the Mathematica 8 packages. I de-installed Mathematica 8 and tried re-installing Mathematica 9 again but it keeps claiming the Mathematica 8 add-ons can't be removed. At the end CDF (amongst other stuff?) is not working in the browser. Any thoughts?
