For any positive integer $n$ which is not specified _a priori_ , I can make $n$-tuple vector $v$ by `v = Array[a, 1, n]`. Now, given that $n$ is a positive integer which is not specified _a priori_ , I want to write an iteration sentence which performs over $1\leq a_1,\ldots, a_n\leq 3$. ($a_i$ are integers and hence I will get $3^n$ iterations). For example, if $n=2$, my sentence plays the same role as the following loop:               Do[EXPERIMENT, {i, 3}, {j, 3}]      If $n=3$, my sentence plays the same role as the following:               Do[EXPERIMENT, {i, 3}, {j, 3}, {k, 3}].      I can do it for any given SPECIFIED integer $n$, but I want to write the universal looping sentence which iterates for $1\leq a_1,\ldots, a_n\leq 3$ ($a_i$ are integers.)
