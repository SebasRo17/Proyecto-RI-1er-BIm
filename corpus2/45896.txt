I am writing a business plan for developers in the 2.0 environment; my utmost respect is given to the people doing the work, but my ignorance is preventing me from articulating who I will need to complete it. What is the best way to describe the developer needs of a Web 2.0 Social/Gaming company as an open position for hire?
