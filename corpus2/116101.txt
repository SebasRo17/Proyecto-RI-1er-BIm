I have a confession to make: Formalized automated testing was never a part of my programming background. I now work in a very large company with many developers (most of them _web_ developers of one sort or another), and it's apparent that most of them don't test* either. (*I'm not going to keep saying _formally_ ; please infer it.) If I wait to have the support of my organization to begin testing it will never happen. If I try to "change things from the inside" by pushing testing at management I will run out of steam before change happens. I need to start testing now. But with TDD and its ilk I'm going to end up with lots of testing code right along with the production code. Our version control systems (all centralized) aren't organized for storing testing code. I'll have to find a place for all that on my workstation. Is it possible to begin a personal practice of software testing in a culture that doesn't value or provide the tools for it? What techniques and tools do you use to enable you to test when the official tools and organization don't have a place for tests, frameworks and automations?
