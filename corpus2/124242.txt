I've been looking into several of the JavaScript MVC Frameworks (Backbone.js, Spine, SproutCore,etc.) and it seems to me that all of these are designed to act as 'single-page' applications. All of the examples I see have an index page that act as a front controller, and use `#` or `#!` style URLs for different pages, and handle the entire rendering of the page. I have several projects where I would like to use a more 'traditional' style of URLs, and having more structured JavaScript to handle some of the more complicated parts of the application. are JS MVC frameworks the answer here, or should I be looking for something different?
