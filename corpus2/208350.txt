In most programming languages documentation where they talk about operators `+-*/=<>` they also include `()[]` as operators. There are _unary_ operators, _multiplicative_ operators, _additive_ operators, _bit shifting_ operators, etc. etc. I can find no terminology that separates _parentheses_ operators from the rest of them. Calling them just _parentheses_ operators doesn't seem right, because they can be used in very different contexts. Specify casts, or type conversions.                a = (int)x;      Invoke methods.                fooMethod();      Define order or operations.                x = (2+4)*8;      In the above examples. What is the correct terminology for each type of parentheses. I require this for documentation purposes.
