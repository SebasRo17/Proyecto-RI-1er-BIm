Mathematica supports an exact list of compilable functions: They are listed here: List of compilable functions. However, I would need to add the following functions: ToExpression, StringFreeQ, StringReplace, BinaryRead and BinaryWrite... Is it possible? I know that BinaryRead and BinaryWrite have simple C++ equivalents but how can I add this functionality to the Compile function? Furthermore, Compile only accepts Integer, Floats and Lists and Nested Lists as input. Can it be modified to accept Strings? Could reimplementing the Compile Function work?
