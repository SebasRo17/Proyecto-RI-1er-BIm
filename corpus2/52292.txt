I just realize that probably there is a bug also in calculating the eigenvector of a matrix with numeric values (see here for bug in eigenvector calculation with symbolic value). In particular in my case I have a matrix (of large dimensions say N>100) for which the sum of the columns is constant. It can be proved that in this case the unit vector is the right-eigenvector of the matrix corresponding to the eigenvalue with max real part. However if I try to compute the eigenvector with Mathematica it gives me an incorrect output. Example. Import the example matrix m from here. Check the that v1={1,1,1...,1} is an eigenvector of the eigenvalue l1=-0.987:               m.ConstantArray[1.,Length[m]] + (0.987 ConstantArray[1.,Length[m]]) // Chop      Then calculate the corresponding Eigensystem with Mathematica               {v2,l2}=Eigensystem[m,-1]      You can check that although l1=l2, v2 is not the unit vector.
