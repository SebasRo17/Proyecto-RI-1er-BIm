I want to provide different UI theme based on user who logged in. For that I have came up with following 2 options:   * create separate files for all themes duplicating all the common css. This way I can easily do some login in scripting and get the required css file. But I end up having same css classes code in many different theme files. This is real pain when you have to change something common to all files.   * make a common file and separate theme files containing only theme specific css. This way everytime I need to load 2 css files, one - common file by default and then load theme specific file to override default css classes. Please help me to choose better option. If there is other simple and easy way to do it then please do let me know.
