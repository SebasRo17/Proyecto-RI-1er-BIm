I have a problem that is more serious than it might seem. I've been programming for about three years , and I have learned and improved a lot , I read the code easily to others, understand the problems and transform them into code, I easily adapt to new technology and I love to learn how it all works . That's all fine . The problem I have is that I often forget small details , which then turn out to be critical . For instance , yesterday, after changing a database query to retrieve some data filtering by twenty fields , forgot to load all the data ( the query returned only the data of the primary key of the whole object ) . Other times are smaller things that do not make the whole process fails, but still I am afraid to fail at something serious , that my superiors grow weary of my mistakes , etc. . I would like to know how I can schedule the job to not forget anything or at least soon realize that I have forgotten something or have missed something ...
