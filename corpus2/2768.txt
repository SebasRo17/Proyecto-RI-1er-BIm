What I want to do is in any way produce a picture that looks like this ![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/TVnGC.jpg) > Given a set of words, how can I partition a disk into bricks for these > words, such that it looks good? Here is my sucky construction:                 h = 1.3;       w = 8;       R = 22.2;            f[m_] = Abs[Sqrt[R^2 - (R - h*m)^2]];            Table[             Table[                  {-f[m], 0} + {n*w, R - h*m} + {w, h} Random[]/10,             {n, 0, Ceiling[2 f[m]/w]}       ], {m, 0, Ceiling[2 R/h]}];            coordinates = Flatten[%, 1];      with a list                 colorlist = {"DarkRainbow", "Rainbow", "Pastel", "Aquamarine",           "BrassTones", "BrownCyanTones", "CherryTones", "CoffeeTones",           "FuchsiaTones", "GrayTones", "GrayYellowTones", "GreenPinkTones",           "PigeonTones", "RedBlueTones", "RustTones", "SiennaTones",           "ValentineTones", "AlpineColors", "ArmyColors", "AtlanticColors",           "AuroraColors", "AvocadoColors", "BeachColors", "CandyColors",           "CMYKColors", "DeepSeaColors", "FallColors", "FruitPunchColors",           "IslandColors", "LakeColors", "MintColors", "NeonColors",           "PearlColors", "PlumColors", "RoseColors", "SolarColors",           "SouthwestColors", "StarryNightColors", "SunsetColors",           "ThermometerColors", "WatermelonColors", "RedGreenSplit",           "DarkTerrain", "GreenBrownTerrain", "LightTerrain", "SandyTerrain",           "BlueGreenYellow", "LightTemperatureMap", "TemperatureMap",           "BrightBands", "DarkBands"};       colorlist2 = {colorlist, colorlist, colorlist, colorlist} // Flatten;      such that I can plot it                 Length[coordinates] "Points"       Length[colorlist2] "Items"            Graphics[Point[coordinates]]            Graphics[        Table[         {Text[Style[colorlist2[[i]], Small], coordinates[[i]]]},         {i, 1, Min[Length@colorlist2, Length@coordinates]}]        ]      * * * ![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/CptHV.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/LkMOM.png) * * * Explainations:   * f[m_] parameterizes the left edge of a cricle, then I generate the coordinates by counting from top to bottom and from left to right until I reach 2R or the bound given by f[m_], respectively.   * The vectors "{w, h} Random[]/10" are my attempt to make the thing a little more smooth looking. I like it a little shaky.   * The list of colors is of course just a random example. and I'm sure it could look better in general. * * * There are several problems with my approach. Some of them are optics, for example:   * The structure is to rigit and depending on the values R, h and w, some patterns emergy, like the bows you see in the pic.   * This might be a little difficult to resolve completely, but since some words are longer than others, the words tend to lie above each other. Other problems:   * I essentially have to match the two lists every time I change the list of words. I mean it's not the end of the world, but it's not too nice.   * In the end the words are themed and they will make up clusters, don't know if I can be helped with speeding the sorting up though.   * ... Also, I'd appreciate a hint how I can read in the strings for the script from a text file, where each line contains one of the words.
