I have the following Parametric plot ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/hKVs2.jpg) Generated from the following:               Manipulate[      ParametricPlot[{(A*Cos[t]^2 + B)*{Cos[t], Sin[t]},         C*{Cos[t] + 1, Sin[t]}}, {t, 0, 2*Pi},        PlotRange -> {{-5, 5}, {-5, 5}}], {A, 1, 10}, {B, 1, 10}, {C, 1,        10}]      I would like to find the exact values of $C$ and $t$ such that the inner circle, with one point fixed to the origin is tangent to the outer curve. This would mean, if I'm not mistaken, for $t\in\left[0,\pi/2\right]$, solving the following system of equations for $t$ and $C$               x1 = (A*Cos[t]^2 + B)*Cos[t]     y1 = (A*Cos[t]^2 + B)*Sin[t]     x2 = C*(Cos[t] + 1)     y2 = C*Sin[t]     x1 == x2     y1 == y2      i.e. find the intersection of the curves, but also they should have the same tangent, so we have:               D[y1,t]/D[x1,t] == D[y2,t]/D[x2,t]      But, for some reason I can't find a solution. What am I doing wrong?
