I am trying to evaluate the following:               myExpression=Piecewise[{{-c E^(c s)-(E^(-((-s+\[Alpha]+q \[Beta])^2/(2 (\[Beta]^2 \[Sigma]q^2+\[Sigma]s^2)))) v \[Beta])/(Sqrt[2 \[Pi]] Sqrt[\[Beta]^2 \[Sigma]q^2+\[Sigma]s^2]),\[Beta]!=0},{-c E^(c s),\[Beta]==0}}]     Integrate[myExpression,s]      However, when I try to make this Integral definite, by using {s,0,z}, I get the following error:               Integrate::pwrl: "Unable to prove that integration limits {0,z} are real. Adding assumptions may help"      I do not wish to change the expression of this integral, nor do I care for some cheap trick which removes the error message (like `Quiet`). I simply want to know where this error comes from, and what additional information about my variabales _Mathematica_ would like to know. Thanks! Laurens
