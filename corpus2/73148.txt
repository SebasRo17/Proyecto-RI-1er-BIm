For those involved with the Agile community (either as developers or management) you've all probably heard about the Certified ScrumMaster designation as well as Certified Product Owner, and Certified Scrum Developer. You may have also heard about PMI (Project Management Institute) new "Agile Certification." Isn't Agile (as a philosophy) all about opening up to newer and (possibly) more effective methods of developing? Does there need to be a certification to back up the "skills?" What is the best reason to get an Agile certification?
