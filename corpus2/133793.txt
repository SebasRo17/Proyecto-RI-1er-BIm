A UserControl cannot be dragged-dropped onto a winform. Instead, I must compile the assembly add it to my toolbox, then I can drag it onto a Form. Doing this toolbox approach just to test out a control and then "tweak" it repeatedly is quite cumbersome. Right now, I plan to simply have this toolbox item pointing to a bin/debug assembly which will be repeatedly re-built. I imagine this will come with it's own set of problems. So what is a good strategy for testing UserControls?
