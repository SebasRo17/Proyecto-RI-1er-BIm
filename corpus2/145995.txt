## Background Looking to leverage an existing GIS system for exploring organizational data. ## Architecture The following figure represents a high-level overview of the system's desired features: ![](http://i.imgur.com/SskPD.png) The most basic usage would be as follows:   1. The user visits a web site.   2. The system presents a map (having regions, cities, and buildings).   3. The user drills-down on the map to a particular building.   4. The system provides a basic CRUD interface.   5. The user can view and modify information about personnel (e.g., their assigned teams), equipment (e.g., network appliances), applications, and the building itself (e.g., contact and phone numbers). Ideally, all the components should be open-source (or otherwise free). ## Problem This must be a small project that needs a quick (but functional) prototype, mostly to confirm whether or not such a system would be useful in the long term. ## Questions   * What software components would you use to quickly develop a working prototype?   * What open-source solutions already exist, if any? ## Ideas Here is what I am thinking:   * PostGIS - Define the regions, cities, and sites   * Google Maps - Display an interactive, clickable map   * geoJSON - Protocol between PostGIS and Google Maps   * Seam - CRUD interface ## Custom Development For example, this would entail:   1. Installation and configuration      1. Configure SSH for remote logins     2. Subversion (or git)     3. PostgreSQL     4. PostGIS     5. Java     6. Tomcat     7. Seam     8. JasperReports   2. Enter GIS information into PostGIS   3. Aggregate data sources into PostgreSQL database   4. Develop starting page for map interface   5. Develop clickable Google Maps interface   6. Develop summary reports   7. Develop CRUD interface using Seam for data maintenance Surely something like this already exists? Thank you!
