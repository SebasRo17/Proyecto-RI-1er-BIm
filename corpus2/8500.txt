**Note: this is fixed in version 9.** * * * When I perform the double integral in _Mathematica_ ,               Integrate[(x (1 - x))^z (y (1 - y))^z, {x, 0, 1}, {y, 0, 1}]      which should give $$B(z+1,z+1)^2 = \frac{\Gamma(z+1)^4}{\Gamma\left(2(z+1)\right)^2}$$ where $B(x,y)$ is the Beta function and $\Gamma(z)$ is the Gamma function because the integral is a product of two Beta functions, I instead get this ratio of Gamma functions _times the extra factor $(-1)^{2z}$_. What is going on here? To make matters stranger, if I do the integral instead using two nested calls to Integrate (one to integrate out $x$ and one to integrate out $y$), I get the ratio of Gamma functions without the incorrect extra factor.
