I am running _Mathematica_ via the terminal (Linux) and my `.m`-script contains the command:               ClearAll["Global`*"]     SetDirectory[NotebookDirectory[]];      such that the directory is set to that of the notebook. When I run this with `math -noprompt -script test.m` I get two errors: > `FrontEndObject::notavail A front end is not available; certain operations > require a front end` and > `SetDirectory:fstr: File specification NotebookDirectory[$Failed] is not a > string of one or more characters` In Windows this works perfectly. Does this mean that setting the notebook directory is not supported in the Linux terminal as it is in Windows?
