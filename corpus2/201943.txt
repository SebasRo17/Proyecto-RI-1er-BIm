An SRS is a staple of any serious contract work, and it can be _incredibly_ dull for those who've never had the misfortune of needing to read one through in one go. I'm writing a series of document classes with LaTeX (markup language for profession-quality documents; see these questions and this answer on TeX.SE) and, in so doing, I need to define the core tenets and common logical structures evident through any reasonable SRS. I have unfortunately never had the opportunity to participate in the creation of an SRS from scratch save a simplified, somewhat contrived example during college, so I don't think I know the breadth of what goes into a Software Requirements Specification (SRS). I do know it consists of at least the changelog and the requirements themselves, but beyond that... ? What are the indispensable parts of the document that every SRS should have? * * * I'm still pretty new here, but I'm open to making this CW if Programmers.SE is _all about_ this kind of stuff.
