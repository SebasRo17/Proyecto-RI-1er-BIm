Here is a problem due to Feynman. If you take 1 divided by 243 you get 0.004115226337 .... It goes a little cockeyed after 559 when you're carrying out the decimal expansion, but it soon straightens itself out and repreats itself nicely. Now I want to see how many times it repeats itself. Does it do this indefinitely, or does it stop after certain number of repititions? Can you write a simple _Mathematica_ program to verify one conjecture or the other?
