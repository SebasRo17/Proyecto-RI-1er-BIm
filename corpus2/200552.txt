I have seen the words Fetch and Select used seemingly interchangeably when naming data access layer methods (ex. Person.Select or Person.Fetch). Which one is correct? My instinct is that the point of the data access layer is to abstract data access and thus the term Fetch would be more of an abstraction perhaps than Select would be. But if one can imagine for a moment that SQL was not an existing technology, the term Select on its own might be appropriate.
