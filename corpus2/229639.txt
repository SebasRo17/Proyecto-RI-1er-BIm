I tried to understand how objects can be passed as parameters but it was difficult for me. How can we pass an object as a parameter to a method of another object? I need to understand the idea behind this. **updated:**               public class Student {}          public class Admin {              private ArrayList<Student> students;               public void enrollStudent(Student newStudent)           {            students.add(newStudent);         }     }
