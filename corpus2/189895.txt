We just adopted Scrum and completed our first sprint (yeah!) At the Sprint Review, we demoed a User Story for feature X. This feature X worked exactly how described in the User Story from initial business analysis and details we worked out during product backlog grooming and sprint planning. However, after the user saw feature X in action they wanted some tweaks (not shocking, purpose of the demo and feedback loop). My question is: **(a)** Do we consider the original user story done and create a new user story to handle the new requirements in a future sprint? **(b)** Do we consider the original user story unfinished, roll into backlog with more detailed requirements that will turn into more tasks in the next sprint? If **(b)** , in sprint planning do we re-estimate the story point weight of the story now knowing that 90% of the work is complete? So if it was originally 5 pts it might now be 2 pts?
