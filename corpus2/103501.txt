I'll be working as a development lead for a startup and I've suggested that we use VMs for development. I'm not talking about each developer having a desktop with VMs for testing/development, I mean having a server rack where all VMs are managed and have the developers work from a microPC (ChromeOS anyone?) locally, or even remotely from their home computer. To me, the benefits are the fact that it's extremely scalable, cheaper in the long run, easier to manage and that we utilize the hardware its maximum potential. As for cons, I can't think of any particular showstoppers other than we'll need someone to setup/maintain said setup. I was hoping that some of you might of had a similar setup at your place of employment and be able to weight in with your opinions. Thanks.
