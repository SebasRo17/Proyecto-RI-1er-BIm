Did Mathematica 9 remove some previously available stylesheets? If so, how can I customize a currently available style sheet to be like a previous one or get previous version's stylesheet back? I frequently used the natural beige color stylesheet (Format > StyleSheet > Creative > NaturalColor), but Mathematica 9 seemed to have removed it. Also, how do I check which stylesheet is currently employed?
