So I went through the physics of a baseball and I got the exact same equations as shown here on page 8. I input all of the same parameters into my code, and I don't get the same thing. Any idea where I am going wrong?               ClearAll[t, x, y, z];     parms = {Cd -> .3, Cm -> 1, ωx -> -1500, ωy -> 0, ωz -> 0, m -> .142, ρ -> 1.225, A -> .608, R -> .22};     term = Sqrt[x'[t]^2 + y'[t]^2 + z'[t]^2];     eq1 = m x''[t] == -(1/2 ρ*A*Cd*x'[t]*term) + (4 π*ρ*R^3*(ωy*z'[t] - ωz*y'[t]));     eq2 = m y''[t] == -(1/2 ρ*A*Cd*y'[t]*term) + (4 π*ρ*R^3*(ωz*x'[t] - ωx*z'[t]))-9.81*m;     eq3 = m z''[t] == -(1/2 ρ*A*Cd*z'[t]*term) + (4 π*ρ*R^3*(ωx*y'[t] - ωy*x'[t]));     ic1 = {x'[0] == 0, x[0] == 0};     ic2 = {y'[0] == 0, y[0] == 1.6};     ic3 = {z'[0] == 90, z[0] == 0};     sol = NDSolve[{eq1, eq2, eq3, ic1, ic2, ic3} /. parms, {x[t], y[t], z[t]}, {t, 0, 1}];     ParametricPlot[Evaluate[{z[t], y[t]} /. sol], {t, 0, .01}, PlotRange -> 1.8]      This should be the same as the bottom image on page 13.
