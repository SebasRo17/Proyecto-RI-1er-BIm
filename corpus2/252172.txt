I have an idea for a game map and have researched some into it. What i'm going to do is have a 2D map(s) that a GM can pick from, or they can create their own using predefined images or images of a particular size they can upload. From what i've seen, people are using a 2-Dimensional Array, but this is for tiles. So what my question would be, is there a better way of doing this, for Hexagon? Not necessarily easier, but better. Something that can be used on a large scale, say 1000x1000 hex (100x100 px, 50 radius) Edit: I found this site that explains a way to draw out the hexagons. I think i might follow it, unless someone knows a better way.
