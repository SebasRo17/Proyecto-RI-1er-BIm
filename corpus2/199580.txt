I'm using a REST API through PHP and I'm a bit confused on the CURL_POSTFIELDS behavior, which implies that I must send a querystring or array, but what I'm seeking to do is just to send a string of JSON text. In the API I'm using there is no such thing as a field: https://developer.atlassian.com/display/JIRADEV/JIRA+REST+API+Example+-+Edit+issues So, how can I just send data that doesn't get interpreted as a query string, and without having to use a file?
