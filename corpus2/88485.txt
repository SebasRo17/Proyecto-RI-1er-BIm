I work with someone who, every time they call a function they put the arguments on a new line e.g.               aFunction(         byte1,         short1,         int1,          int2,         int3,         int4,         int5     ) ;      I find this very annoying as it means the code isn't very compact, so I have to scan up and down more to actually make any sense of the logic. I'm interested to know whether this is actually bad practice and if so, how can I persuade them not to do it?
