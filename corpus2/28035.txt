I enjoy programming, but programming at work is just that, work. I would like to further develop my own personal interests in programming. Throughout the week I imagine myself completing a small project on the weekend or finishing up a programming related book. However, in reality I often fall short of my expectations. I often will get just one or two chapters of reading done and even less coding. In reality I will spend time surfing the net, watching television, or visiting friends and slacking off... because it is the weekend. But when Sunday evening rolls around I often reflect on my weekend and I am sorely disappointed with my use of time. So my question is how do you maintain your productivity outside of work? I am sure some programmers could care less about programming on their free time. Although, I think the majority of programmers, especially on stackexchange, are passionate about programming.   1. Should I spend the weekend programming, or will I burn out and resent programming if I dedicate that much time to it?    2. How should I go about programming on my free time? Should I set a schedule? How much time should I dedicate to it? **Most importantly how do I follow that schedule?** Its only human nature to procrastinate.  I know there is a lot of questions here. Feel free to answer the ones that relate to how you remained focused outside of work. I am passionate about programming but after 40 hours of programming it can be difficult to maintain that enthusiasm.
