> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Assign the results from a Solve to variable(s) In the following example:               Clear[g1, z1, a, g2, z2]     sa = Solve[ g1 == 1 + l z1/(z1^2 + a), a]     sb = Solve[ g2 == 1 - l z2/(z2^2 + b), b] /. z2 -> z1 + l      This gives me solutions for `a` and `b` that are in the form               {{ a -> astuff }}     {{ b -> bstuff }}      I want to use this result in a secondary computation, and did so by cut and pasting from the `Solve[]` results like so                Solve[ astuff == bstuff, z1 ]      How can I just extract those results without cut and pasting? I don't like the cut and paste dependency since I'd have to redo it all if I make any sort of correction to the first couple identities.
