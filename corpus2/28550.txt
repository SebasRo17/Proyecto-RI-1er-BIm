I have a `DynamicModule` with several graphic elements. I would like to create a button which would change a parameter and re-run the entire module. Say that we have               h := Plot[Sin[k*x], {x, 0, 10}]      with an initial value of `k = 1`. I want to create `Button["Increase k", k = k + 1; h]` that would run the plot (without using `Print[h]` as `h` is really a large `DynamicModule`).
