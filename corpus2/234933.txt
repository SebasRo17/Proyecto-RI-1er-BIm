There are bunch of console programs and especially games using full redraw (not sure ho this correctly named) of console window. For example, look at output of linux `top` program -> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Top_program.jpg it doesn't just write text line by line all the time making the whole output oh thousands lines, but every second clears the screen and prints updated information. Or another example of `Apache Geronimo`: during startup, it prints to console progressbar -> http://i.imgur.com/BYWf1Sq.jpg My question is, how to reach the same result using Java?
