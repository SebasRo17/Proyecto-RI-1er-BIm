I have a customer that wants me to build a web portal (Asp.net 4.0) that will communicate with a desktop client, tablet and/or smart phone (e.g. iOS and/or Android). I was thinking of using oAuth 2.0. But I'm not familiar with any potential cons to using OAuth. And I don't know how to compare OAuth to other Secure Authorization method/protocols that would be appropriate for this situation. How should I evaluate OAuth to see if it's right for my project or if I should use a different protocol?
