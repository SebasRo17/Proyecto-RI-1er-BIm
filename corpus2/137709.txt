Recently I receive a request: users' emails are stored in the database, and as request of a user, the system will send an email on their behalves. To add more context, it's like sending an email from the vendor, to their customers' email addresses. But it's not a fixed email (it depends on which vendor ask the system). Using JavaMail, I can simply set the `from` field. But something doesn't seem right. When searching for this kind of work, I come across "Email spoofing" - which looks like what I'm going to do. There are some drawbacks for this approach, such as it may make the emails attractive to the spam filters, and so on... Ofcourse I can just do as the client want, but I just wonder, is there any better alternative?
