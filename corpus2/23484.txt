When evaluating the expression               Sinh[x]^2 + Cosh[x]^2 // FullSimplify      I get               Cosh[2 x]      That is indeed a simplification, but there are cases when I would not want that to happen. What if I have a much more complicated expression that I want to simplify generally, but still wish to stay in `Sinh[x]^2` and `Cosh[x]^2`. So under no circumstances do I wish to change to `Cosh[2 x]` or similar expressions. Is there a way to explicitly tell Mathematica **not** to use trigonometric relations? Or to use the trivial `Cosh[x]^2 - Sinh[x]^2 = 1` but none of the composed ones? Preferably, maybe there is a switch that disables the sensitivity of _Mathematica_ to trigonometric relations in an entire notebook?
