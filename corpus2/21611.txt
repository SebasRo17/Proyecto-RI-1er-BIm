I'd like to import an image, superimpose it, reduce the opacity of the overlaid image, and then use a manipulate to rotate the top image to illustrate rotational symmetry. The image below is using image editing software,not Mathematica, but illustrates the effect I am after. ![example of the effect I am after](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ef00G.png) There are many nice images on the net that could be used to illustrate this concept. Can this be done using Mathematica and the image processing commands? I tried importing an image file, then used Show and ImageRotate for example,               g1 = Import[ graphic....]     Show [ g1,  ImageRotate[g1, pi/4]]    but that wasn't at all what I was looking for...      I'd appreciate any suggestions for commands that could achieve this effect. My goal would be to create several Manipulates with various images to illustrate various orders of symmetry with image files (I've already done this with line drawings),
