I've been using RTMFP streaming for around a year in ActionScript 3, and I pretty much know the difference between a near ID and far ID. The near ID is your peer ID, and the far ID is the other guy's peer ID. The problem I'm having is that, to my knowledge, choosing whether to use one term or the other in a given sentence is a little like choosing whether to say "go" or "come". In English, "go" and "come" have opposite meanings, but ironically, they can still be used almost interchangeably. It's because whether you're going or coming is so heavily dependent on perspective, as opposed to anything concrete. Is the choice of words between "near ID" and "far ID" just as ambiguous, or is there some sort of method to the madness? Thanks!
