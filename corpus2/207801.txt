I like IE's persnicketiness (the debugging tools that take you right to your code is even more user-friendly than what I've found in F12 Chrome Dev Tools), but why does it say, "'console' is undefined" re: this line of jQjuery:               console.log("entered submit button click");      How could _console_ be undefined? Neither Chrome nor Firefox complain about it... And ironically, IE shows me this error message where? In the "Console" tab! Shirley it couldn't be case-sensitive, and it expects "Console.log"? BTW and anyway, I'm impressed with IE's F12 tools; I wonder if it's "The Avis Effect" at work - they were #5 (among Browsers) and have thus begun fighting like a rabid wolverine to claw and scratch their way upwards?
