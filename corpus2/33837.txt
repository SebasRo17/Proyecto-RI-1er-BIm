I have nested lists wherein there are a lot of waste levels which looks like               l = {{{{{{2, 2}}, 3}, 2, {{2, 33}}, 4, 5}}};      I would like to reduce it to somthing like               l = {{{2, 2}, 3}, 2, {2, 33}, 4, 5};      I made the function which remove waste levels on the top level:               l = {{{{{{2, 2}}, 3}, 2, {{2, 33}}, 4, 5}}};          strip = Function[{list},                      If[(Head[list] === List) && (Length[list] > 0),                         If[Flatten[list, 1] === list[[1]],                             s = strip[list[[1]]],                             s = list],                         s = list];                      s];     strip[l]      To do it at any depth I tried to do `Map[strip[l]]` without success. How I can to apply my function to all levels? Also, I guess there more appropriate way to solve my problem.
