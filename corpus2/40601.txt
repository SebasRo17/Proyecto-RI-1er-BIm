In electrostatics, one often desires to know the electrostatic potential generated from the outside of a charge distribution; however, I am interested in finding the electrostatic potential _inside_ of a charge distribution. For example, let's consider a parabolic charge distribution: $\rho(x) = x(L-x)$ Where L is the length of the distribution. Now if we wish to calculate the electrostatic potential, we would need to calculate: $\Phi(z) = \int_0^L \frac{\rho(x)}{|z-x|} dx = \int_0^L \frac{x(L-x)}{|z-x|} dx$ In turn one could take the derivative of $\Phi(z)$ to obtain the electric field inside the distribution. My attempt to do this in mathematica:               L = 1;     s[z_] := z (L-z)     fen[x_] := Integrate[s[z]/Abs[z - x], {z, 0, L}, PrincipalValue -> True, Assumptions :> {L > x > 0}]     V = fen[x]     El = fen'[x]     Plot[{V, El}, {x, 0, 1}]      Any ideas? Thanks!
