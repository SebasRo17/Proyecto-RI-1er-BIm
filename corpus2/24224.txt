I have a really complex function that takes a few hours to plot as a function of a parameter. Few days later I realised that I named the axes wrong. Is there an easy way to edit the AxesLabels without running the plot again? (it takes too long!!) I tried `Show[%, AxesLabel-> {newname, newname2}]` but it doesn't change anything...
