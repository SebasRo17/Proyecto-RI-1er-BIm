While developing web sites it can be annoying that I have to login to the site. Every time the session runs out I have to go through a flow like...   Open logon page -> enter username/password -> click link to navigate to my page. I sometimes use Selenium to record this flow, and then automate it. But Selenium doesn't work in all browsers, and it still takes too long to load etc.   I would like to be able to just refresh the page, exactly like I would if the site didn't have a login page. Does anyone use any strategies to achieve this? Any way to disable login during development? Or other tools which can help improve the situation?
