We have a few interns here that have orders from college to integrate speaking, reading, and writing French into their internship.   All of them are working on developing their own web application, and I'm wondering how we can integrate French into their projects.   Here are some things I've come up with:   * Translate the whole project front-end to French   * Write French documentation for the project   * Promote the application in a French community   * Speak French (exclusively?) to our project managers Any other ideas or suggestions? Does anyone else have experience with this?
