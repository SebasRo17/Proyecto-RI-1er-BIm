Someday, my leader told me that _don't reinvent the wheels, use framework built-in classes._ (with a serious mood) when I implement some algorithm has been supported by .NET fx. And seriously, I didn't know about these support before, cause this is the first time I work with .NET).   So I have this questions. For example, for building an Web-App we have some ways:   1. C# with ASP.NET framework   2. Java with JavaEE (and friends like Struts, Spring v.v.) framework.   3. PHP with Zend framework.   4. ... It just takes about 1 months to learn language (C#, Java, PHP...), BUT learning to use a framework **effectively** takes you at least SOME YEARS working (to know every bit of code has been built-in).   So, _how do you learn to use effectively 2 (or more) frameworks?_ Any ideas are welcome!
