Last year I had a sport accident and since then my left eye is a little bit sensitive. Especially if looking in bright and shiny colors, I get tired very fast and can't literally focus on anything. White is the worst color ever! Unfortunately most application that I use in my work environment (Firefox, Eclipse, Visual Studio, Tetris) have a very bright white background. This really hurts my eye. So is there an easy way to generally use color schemes on the laptop so that everything isn't that bright? Obviously I could everywhere change the default color scheme, but isn't there a simpler solution to do that? Or any recommendations what are good color schemes to be less bright but still clearly readable?
