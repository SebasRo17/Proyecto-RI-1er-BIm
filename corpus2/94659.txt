I have seen a lot of people (first comment) hating `die();` instead of `exit;` As the follow-up comments on that post note, `die` and `exit` are the same - the attitude appears to be one of perception, with some feeling that one name is more appropriate in certain contexts than others. But why does it matter? If they do the same thing, why should I care what name I use? Does death by any other name not smell as sweet?
