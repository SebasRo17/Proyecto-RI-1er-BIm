I have two expressions:               w1 = (a+b)/c^2;          w2 = (a^3 + 3 a^2 b + 3 a b^2 + b^3)/c^6;      How can I ask _Mathematica_ to try to find an alternative expression for `w2` that just uses the variable `w1` ? In the above example, for instance, we can write: `w2 == w1^3`, however, its not always so obvious how to proceed in general instances where one is asked to rewrite one expression ONLY in terms of a variable representing another expression (or to check if this is possible). [6-5-2014] I've read through Replace expressions with symbols, and its still confusing exactly how to ask Mathematica to do what I'm specifying in my positing. It would really be helpful to see how to do something like my specific example.
