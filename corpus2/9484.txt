I am writing a bash script to run a bunch of Mathematica `.nb` files serially. So I thought I'd convert my Mathematica cells into `initialization cells`. However, I notice that the initialization cell isn't run on start up unless I evaluate it using `Shift` \+ `Enter` or `Command` \+ `Enter`. Is it not an initialization cell that I am looking for? Steps I took to make my cell an initialization cell:   1. Selected the cell with mouse click   2. Cell > Cell properties > Initialization cell ## Edit I just added `InitializationCellEvaluation -> True` as the first line of my file. However, how should I make this evaluatable?
