I have a $300$ by $2$ matrix called `r` which its elements depend on parameter `g`. I would like to plot this matrix and change the `g` to see how the graph changes. I have used this code:               Manipulate[ListPlot[r], {g, 0, 10}]       However, nothing happens. If I determine the parameter `g`, then I can plot it with `ListPlot[r]`. But, when I use manipulate, I cannot plot it. Any suggestion? Thank you in advance.
