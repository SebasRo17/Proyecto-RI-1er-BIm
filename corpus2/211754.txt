We are redesigning an old VB6 application in Net. The application makes extensive use of a database and includes management of club members and their results in the competitions that they partake in. So, if we are editing a club member's name, address, etc. it is obvious not to send the data back to the database until the entire edit or add operation has been completed by the user. But how to do this when registering and editing scores of matches? The advantage of sending each added or edited score directly to the database is that it enables live updates of the rankings. The disadvantage is that undoing changes may be more difficult and that there may arise performance problems when the connection to the database has a high latency. The latter problem might come up at some stage, but for the unforseeable future we will work with desktop versions of the database. I would be interested in descriptions of best practices and live experiences. Thanks!
