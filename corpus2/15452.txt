I have been using AutomaticUnits in my calculations. In this package all I had to do was to declare the units I wanted e.g. mm, kN, sec, kPa, litres etc. in terms of existing units, and then use them in my calculations. To get an answer in the units I needed I could use `Convert[expression,unit]` eg. `Convert[100kNm/(1000cm3,MPa)]`. This seemed simple and allowed me to write my calculations down in the way I would if I were doing the calcs by hand. I have looked at `Quantity` and the information on units in v. 9 and cannot understand how I can achieve the same results. By the way, the use of Wolfram Alpha is not desirable except as an occasional reference source. I do not always have an internet connection and could not include the verbosity that results. Any thoughts?
