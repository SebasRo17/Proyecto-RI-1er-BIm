I'd like to make a plot of a company's revenue and income over time. I can do this via Wolfram Alpha pretty easily, just by searching "Ford revenue and earnings from 2000 to 2012". As such I can, if necessary, tease out the data from a corresponding `WolframAlpha` call. Rather than resorting to Wolfram Alpha, I assumed `FinancialData` would be more appropriate. Surprisingly, from an initial inspection of the docs, it does not seems like there is an easy way to get these two particular properties. My question is - can I reliably calculate revenue and/or net income (i.e. profit) from the supported properties of `FinancialData`? Perhaps based off of `EarningsPerShare`?
