what can I do to have Mathematica intepret and show a number with exactly the amount of digits I gave as an input? I have a larger talbe with numbers (text file, whitespace seperated) which are formatted in the way that the prescission is given by the number of digits. To I can't work around using the same number of digits for the whole input. For example if I give the input               In: 2.414000         2.550      Mathematica will retun               Out1: 2.414     Out2: 2.55      I would instead like to exactly the nuber, or more precisely the amount of digits I had as an input. So in this case I would like to have see the number including the three zeros, or one zero respectively at the end of them. Here one addition: I very much like the appraoch that was proposed to import strings and convert them! But what will I need to change to convert for example this table here for calculations? I imported it as strings before. \begin{array}{lrr} \text{En[MeV]} & 0 & 1 \\\ 0 & .0317223 & .0237898 \\\ 1 & .1717071 & .1555525 \\\ <\nu > & 22.4140000 & 2.5236700 \\\ \text{$<\nu $($\nu $-1)$>$} & 4.6382 & 5.1013758 \\\ \text{$<\nu $($\nu $-1)($\nu $-2)$>$} & 6.8176 & 8.0012201 \\\ \end{array} Or given as a List:               {{"En[MeV]", "0", "1"}, {"0", ".0317223", ".0237898"}, {"1", ".1717071", ".1555525"}, {"<\[Nu]>", "22.4140000", "2.5236700"}, {"<\[Nu](\[Nu]-1)>", "4.6382", "5.1013758"}, "<\[Nu](\[Nu]-1)(\[Nu]-2)>", "6.8176", "8.0012201"}}
