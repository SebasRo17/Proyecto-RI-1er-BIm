I'm not trained programmer, so be gentle with my ignorance. I'm trying to search changelog files for where an open source project dropped a feature I need. I was just wondering if there may be a good set of terms to describe this. Bugzilla has detailed bug reporting forms. Are design changes also logged using rigorous language? Its something I can see myself advocating as my own small contribution. (^_^)
