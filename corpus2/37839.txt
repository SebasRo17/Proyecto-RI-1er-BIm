I have a very simple equation `2x + y = 10` I want to know which integer combinations of `x` and `y` between `-10 & 20` will yield a solution `10`. I then want to store the various solutions of `x` and `y` and have them as inputs to another equation `x^2 + 2y = z` and in the end I want a list of all the `z` values. How do I tell Mathematica to do that? I tried:               one[x_, y_] = 2 x + y;      Array[{Solve[one[x_, y_] == 3, {20 > x > -10, 20 > y -10}}, [one, 10]]
