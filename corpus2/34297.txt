I know `FrontEnd`SelectionSetStyle` is undocumented, but its name suggests it does what I need. What is its syntax? I have already tried several variations of the following button on some selected code in an input cell.               Button["set",        FrontEnd`SelectionSetStyle[FontColor, RGBColor[{1, 0, 0}]];       Print[CurrentValue["SelectionData"]]]      * * * **Update** Using the kernel, the following code does what I need:               Button["set",       SetOptions[NotebookSelection[InputNotebook[]], FontColor -> RGBColor[{0, .7, .5}]];       Print[CurrentValue["SelectionData"]]]      I assume that `FrontEnd`SelectionSetStyle` can change the font color of the selection while using the front end only. If so, what is its syntax?
