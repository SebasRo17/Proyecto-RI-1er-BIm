I have spent the last 2-1/2 years building a distributed application. We started testing it a couple months ago and we're moving it into production. Everything runs fairly well, but it could definitely run better. I'm looking for some books I can read which will help make sure we're not making any obvious mistakes. I searched online and didn't find anything by any authors I recognize as experts. Others were ten years old. Is there a book out there that's the de-facto standard for describing best practices, design methodologies, and other helpful information about distributed programming in Java? What about that book makes it special?
