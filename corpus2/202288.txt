I'm studying/practicing to be a software developer but I'm worried that my bad credit history will prevent me from getting a job as a developer. I was laid off a few years ago and went through a period where everything went wrong. I was able to bounce back with a couple part time jobs and now I have a dead-end 40k a year job. Currently my credit history shows 2 foreclosures and credit card debt. I'm gradually paying off the credit card debt but my credit history will look horrible for a few years. BTW, an adviser told me to file for bankruptcy but that sounds like it will only makes things worse. I already feel as if I'm too old (34 years old) to enter this competitive career but I don't have much of a choice because software development is my only interest. I currently code .NET desktop apps for personal use and I've been getting into web development lately. I believe I can convince a potential employer to look past my age but I just feel as if no software development company would hire me over a 23 year with a clean slate. From what I've read, "job hopping" seems to be normal for software developers so even if I get my first programming job, when that job ends, I would have to go through the same process of fear again. Does anybody have any advice for someone in my situation?
