I have a project that gets all of its data from API calls. The server that hosts this API connects with it's own database (not even sure what DB it is, etc). More or less the idea of a repository is to separate data and map it, right? I shouldn't be concerned where my data comes from. But if, at the end of the day, they are API calls, should the repository itself be doing all the api calls within its methods? For example if we had a FindBY method in the repository, should that method be the one making the API call?
