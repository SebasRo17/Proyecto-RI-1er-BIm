Lets say I have a list of patterns               p={       HoldPattern[f[x___]] :> {x},       HoldPattern[f[a_,b_]] :> {a,b},       HoldPattern[f[a_,a_]] :> {a,a},       HoldPattern[f[x_]] :>x     }       what is the most elegant way to add another pattern to the list while removing all duplicates? For example let's say I what to add `f[c_,d_]:>code` then `f[a_,b_]` should be mapped as a duplicate but not `f[a_,a_]`.
