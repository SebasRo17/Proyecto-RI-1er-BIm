**tl;dr** How would I represent GUI as agents in a multi agent system. I am learning more about Multi Agent Systems. I like the concepts of such systems, it makes a lot of sense and it sounds very useful when I want to create a large system devised of smaller parts for the Web. So, I created a basic `Agent` class, taught my agents to negotiate and communicate, created an environment for them to be situated in and such. So, in a simple app attempt I have:   * Several "InfoBroker" Agents that handles communications with server services, wanting to obtain information about the world and willing to share it under certain terms (They hold an auction if that matters).   * A few agents that coordinate the communication between my services on the client side (Also "InfoBroker" agents I guess).   * A few working agents, that have a simple goal in their environment, performing calculations and performing (very basic) means-end reasoning in the environment. They're my 'manual labor' in the app.   * A few other things specific to my application. That's all great, but I have no idea where GUI fits in all that? I need to show information about my system to the user, the GUI isn't a small part (consider agents that speak to the DOM in a web app). How would represent GUI as an agent in a multi agent system? Note: I've implemented this in JavaScript, but this seems more language agnostic to me.
