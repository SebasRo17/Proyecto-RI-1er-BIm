I have read up on quite a few of these questions asked on here regarding "how much should I charge for..." such as: How should I charge for programming things which take two minutes to fix? How much should I charge for a web app How much can I charge for this a little job? and these are fine for freelance projects dealing with specific clients for a specific product. My situation has a bit of a curve-ball to it, and this is: how much should I charge a company to develop a product where I retain the 'Intellectual Property' of the final product. I am working with a company to create a web application that will help with some administrative processes. The idea for this project had originated between me and an employee of the company outside of business hours. Thus the product idea was then presented to the company and they are very interested in me developing this idea for them. The CFO of the company wants to pay me for my time to develop this product, yet I would also like to own the IP of this product and resell it to other companies when it is completed. When we do meet to discuss fair wages, what would be the best way to position myself? Presumably in the future with a completed product this would be a 'fee for service' software platform, wherein a company would purchase seats (monthly or annually). But I am unsure of how I should treat this development 'partner'. Their contributions would include helping me tailor the product to fit their needs specifically, along with debugging and testing.. So should I charge an hourly rate? A lump sum? Or start out right away with a monthly subscription type? This project is done on the side, I still have a day-job.. But will be investing a lot of time into this project since it has a lot of potential. (if that factors into any of it)
