We have a site that allows users to generate their own content. If users generate illegal content, we'll be submitting a report to the authorities. In the event that we do have to report a user, we want as much info as possible on that user. With that said, I have two questions:   * Is tracking the user's ip address enough to identify them?   * And, we track the user's ip address in the sessions table which gets wiped clean periodically. Should we archive the sessions data to retain that info or should we put an ip_address field in the our Post and Comments tables instead?
