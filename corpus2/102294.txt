As a part of learning system programming, I am looking to implement a file shredder. The simplest way (and probably seen as naive) would be to replace the data bytes with zeroes (I know OS splits the files and I'll replace bytes in all those chunks). But when I google on this topic, I am surprised to find multiple pass algorithms, some going as high as 35! Could someone elucidate the benefit of multiple pass please? I couldn't find any explanation. Thanks
