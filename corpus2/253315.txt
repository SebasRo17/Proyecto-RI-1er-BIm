If I want to put random source code snippets in a publicly accessible git repository, does it make sense to license by CC-BY(-SA) given that CC-BY licenses are generally not recommended for software? To me there is a difference between a full software project where CC-BY clearly isn't appropriate and small random source code files. CC-BY seems like a simple license where GPL is over the top. The main reason that I ask is that I may take code from StackOverflow (modified or not) which I believe is licensed as CC-BY-SA. Sometimes it would be convenient for me to put it all in one place so I can easily access and find it in the future. While I may be being overly-paranoid, I would like to adhere to the StackExchange CC-BY-SA license. Licensing everything I put there as CC-BY-SA is simple and seems appropriate for snippets (of course code taken from other sources, say with GPL/BSD or whatever will retain their original license if required). Finally can I combine CC-BY-SA with GPL?
