A previous developer has a couple public classes that do not inherit from any other classes but are filled with static properties. Is this another way of creating a struct or enum? Is this an older or newer technique of housing static data to be referenced? I find it odd/different to see a class built in this way but am wondering what other fellow programmers thoughts or feelings are about what this coder was trying to accomplish. This is a made up example of what I am seeing...                   public class CashRegister         {             public static decimal OneDollarBill             {                 get { return (decimal)1; }             }                  public static decimal TenDollarBill             {                 get { return (decimal)10; }             }         }
