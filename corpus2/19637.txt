I want to find the product of the first 20 Fibonacci numbers (the fibonorial). I want implementations using `While`, `Do`, and `For` loops. This is my code using `Do`:               Do[Sum[Print[a = a*fib[n]], {n, 1, 20}], {a, 1}]      But I can't get it working with `While` or `For`. ### Edit My fib code is as follows:               Clear[fib, x, a]     fib[1] = 1; fib[2] = 1;     fib[n_] := fib[n] = fib[n - 1] + fib[n - 2]     fib[10]
