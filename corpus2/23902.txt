I have an ego network (a network of a person (ego) and his friends). It is drawn with the ego at the center surrounded by the friends. It might be possible that all the friends are connected to each other, in which case one can have a complete graph. Mathematica however draws a complete graph with no focal node. How can I make Mathematica draw a complete graph with a center node in it? How can I remove some connections so that it would still be an ego network but not a complete graph? Thanks.
