I have arranged a certain configuration of cubes in 3D using the following code:                Graphics3D[       Table[        {Cuboid[{i, j - i + 1, j + 1}]},        {i, 1, 4, 1}, {j, 1, 4, 1}], Lighting -> {{"Ambient", White}},         Boxed -> False, ViewPoint -> {-1, -1, 1}]      Computing this as it is displays the following graphic: ![cube stack](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3jtEv.jpg) This is fine, but the issue is what happens when you zoom in to this image in Mathematica. Doing so reveals extended edges in some of the corners shown here: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dfl5p.jpg) I would like to know why this is happening, and what I need to do to get rid of the extended edges. Is this perhaps happening because Mathematica is not completely updating the graphics upon zooming?
