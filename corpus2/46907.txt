In the upcoming version of our web app, we've broken IE6, and we don't intend to fix it. We've had a clear warning posted for IE6 users for some months; we've decided it's time not to support it. My question is: how should we communicate this to our users? Some people here feel that we should block IE6 users who would try to access the web app, because it's not going to work for them. Others feel that we should just leave up a warning, saying "This doesn't work in IE6," but not block them; instead, if they click to dismiss the warning, just let them in to the broken site to see for themselves that it doesn't work. Who is right? Is there a better way?
