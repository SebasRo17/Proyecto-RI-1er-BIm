At the office we just got a new colleague who is visually impaired. I'm in charge of organizing the planning poker sessions and the new colleague must participate as a member of the team. We have these nice sets of poker cards with planning poker numbers on them, but that doesn't help of course for our new colleague. Until now we fixed this problem by just naming the estimates, letting the new colleague say their estimate right after the rest had put down their card, then the rest flips their card and I name the estimates in a row. **My question(s):** Is there any one who has experience with this kind of situation and have a better solution? Is there such a thing as Braille poker cards? The current solution does work, but I think this can be improved for us all by for example Braille poker cards.
