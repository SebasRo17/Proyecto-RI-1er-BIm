Well , Here in my Office, we made it a practice to come before 9 AM (in any condition as decided by Management) and start with a Standup Meeting. Here we start with Discusiing with issues of previous day, Any updates from Manager (by leads) and the work plan for today. This meeting may sound good and process oriented , but some times if there is a show down then it ruins the morning mood or if there is a difference in opinion then again it is not a good thing to start with. So, HR and Management decides that initially we will discuss personal matters for 10 to 15mins and then we will jump to technical and official discussion.For 15 minutes everyday, are you serious , I don't get a topic to discuss for 15mins every day with my lead who is much older than me and never discussed anything in personal till now and you want to start with it just like that!!! So it is back to square one. Every one (Amazingly in all the teams) is discussing aagain technical aspects only in the moring /stand up meeting. So here it comes, today I have a Lunch with Management and the Topic for Discussion is :               "How to make Nice Day(Morning/Standup) meetings effective?"      Any Suggestions please.
