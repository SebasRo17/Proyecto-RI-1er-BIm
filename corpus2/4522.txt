I am trying to understand the difference between `Refine`, `Simplify` and `FullSimplify`, and when it's more appropriate to use a particular one. The help files on this are not entirely clear. For example, under the help for `Refine` it says > Use `Simplify` for more simplification rules: >   >   >     Refine[Sqrt[x^2 + 2 x y + y^2], x + y >= 0] >     (* Sqrt[x^2 + 2 x y + y^2] *) >   >     Simplify[Sqrt[x^2 + 2 x y + y^2], x + y >= 0] >     (* x + y *) >   From this, I can't imagine why anyone would ever use `Refine`, if `Simplify` will get it simpler. Yet, it keeps turning up in answers on this site (e.g. here, here, or here), where `Simplify` would also work. Then, regarding `Simplify` vs `FullSimplify`, the help file states: > Use `FullSimplify` to simplify expressions involving special functions: Is there a guideline for which sorts of functions are considered "special functions"? I realize that (based on the "More Information" section and personal experience) `FullSimplify` may take longer, but under what circumstances? Is a good general approach to try `Simplify` first, and then only if one is unhappy with the results, then try `FullSimplify`?
