We've just finishing up the first release of a database driven web application, which is now in regression testing. The application has an advanced search with many different filtering criteria. When the search is first used with only the 3(of 28) minimum required search criteria it takes like 15-20 secs to calculate and retrieve the data for the page to load. This happens only the first time the search(uses a stored proc) is run. The search thereafter take 2-6 secs. The stored procedure has medium complexity around 1500 - 2000 lines. I would like to get it down to run the first time to 6 secs and thereafter like 1-2 secs but I can't seem to find the time to make it faster. My question is, is this acceptable for users if it is only slow the first time the search is run? Has anyone else had a similar experience with creating advanced searches? What was your solution?
