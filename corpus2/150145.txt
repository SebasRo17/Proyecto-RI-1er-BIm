We have an intranet site which was done in .net with plenty of functionality but management wants it to look more visually attractive and get the graphic designer involved. The graphic designer is NOT a programmer nor has any desire to learn how to code. She would be updating the main page only. I was trying to figure out how to make it easy for her to update the site. I was looking into Joomla but it requires PHP, MySQL, and Apache. Our box is .net/iis/sql. Does anyone have experience with this? Just a bit concerned about compatibility issues. or maybe there is an easier way. I'm more of a back end guy than a graphics guy.
