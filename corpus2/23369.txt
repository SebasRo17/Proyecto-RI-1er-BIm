I have the following line of code:               Plus @@ Table[p[x], {x, 0, 20}] /. p[x_] -> Boole[MemberQ[{0, 5}, x]]      The first part of this produces               p[0] + p[1] + p[2] + p[3] + p[4] + p[5] + p[6] + p[7] + p[8] + p[9] + p[10] +     p[11] + p[12] + p[13] + p[14] + p[15] + p[16] + p[17] + p[18] + p[19] + p[20]      What I thought the second part would do is to check each argument to p that occurs in this sum and replace `p[x]` with `1` if `x` is either `0` or `5` and with `0` if `x` is anything else. I thought, in short, the result would be 2. That's not, however, what I get. Instead _Mathematica_ returns 0. What am I doing wrong?
