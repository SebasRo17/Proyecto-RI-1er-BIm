I want to create a bunch of input fields, four in this case, one for each element of the list "x", but since `Dynamic` has `HoldFirst` it is not evaluated. Is there any way to get around this, except for declaring it by hand, or messing with strings, I played a bit with `Evaluate , and`RelaseHold`, but without success.               DynamicModule[{x = Table[0, {4}]},      Column[{        Row[Table[          InputField[Dynamic[x[[i]]], Number, FieldSize -> Tiny],          {i, 1, 4}]],        Norm[x]}       ]      ]
