I've been tasked to create a mobile application as well as an accompanying website. Both the application and website will interact with the same database. To make things easy, I figure creating an API would be best that way I can separate it out from the mobile application and website. Would this be the preferable method? I'm thinking Sinatra would be best for this situation. I'm using Ruby on Rails for the website but feel it would be overkill for the API. I just want to validate my thoughts regarding this issue. Thanks!
