I'm trying to pipe low-level notebook commands to work through terminal and I've tried various ways, but I can't really get to the frontend that's already open. For example Opening a notebook from command line in an existing front end instance this no longer works. I've tried connecting to notebooks kernel, but it didn't work as I expected... perhaps I know too little. I'd imagine it to work like this: math -script file.m or mathematica file.m Where file.m would contain commands to evaluate on currently opened notebooks in an existing mathematica instance. How should I approach it?
