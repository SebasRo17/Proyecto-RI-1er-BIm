I'm new here and pretty new to iOS development. My question is basically, should I learn the old school development methods or just learn how to do things using the latest tools (i.e. Storyboard)? I've had a go with the Storyboard feature of XCode 4.2 and it's very powerful. My only concern is that it requires iOS 5. I don't mind learning the old way of doing things but I've been having trouble finding tutorials/examples for XCode 4.2 that don't use the storyboard. An example would be the with my trouble finding a good tutorial on how to embed a Navigation Controller into a TabBarController. A lot of the material out there seems to be for older version of XCode. Using the storyboard I'm able to set this up with seconds but still haven't managed to get it working without it. So in short :) would you guys suggest I continue my project using the Storyboard or make the extra effort to do things a little more manually?
