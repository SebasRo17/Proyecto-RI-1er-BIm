Using `Plot3D`, I tried to plot $x^3 + y^3+3xy=z$                Plot3D[x^3 + y^3 + 3 x y, {x, -5, 5}, {y, -5, 5}, PlotRange -> {-10, 20},          PlotStyle -> Directive[Yellow, Specularity[White, 20], Opacity[0.8]]]      Now for some reason _Mathematica_ generates this awkward blue plane out of nowhere and I cannot find a way to remove it since I do not even know what it is ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/G7lmF.jpg) I am on _Mathematica_ 8.0.4
