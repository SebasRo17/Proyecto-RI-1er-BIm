We have a small but growing team at work, and are thinking of doing things differently. We develop websites from scratch and do HTML/CSS/Javascript/PHP/MySQL coding. Currently, we all work on things as they come, and everybody could do either of those things. So everybody in the team has currently several projects assigned, and they could be doing different things, so for one project somebody takes care of the front-end things - mostly Javascript/CSS, and for another site it's the back-end part with mostly PHP/MySQL. The issue is that most in the team have a decent basic understanding of things but are still learning the details. And it seems to take its toll in terms of productivity. I think we could improve this by assigning everybody to just specific tasks (only CSS / Javascript / PHP / MySQL... just one thing at a time). This way:   * Tasks are clearer for everybody   * Everybody can better learn one particular thing and not get overwhelmed   * When mastering one skillset, one can upgrade to the next level   * Productivity should go up What do you think?
