I am currently acquiring my associates degree in software engineering. I have been told in order to be successful in a computer science field you have to specialized in something. After researching several areas I have decided I want to specialize in Java Database Connectivity. It earns a decent income and seems interesting. I would like to know what the field is like. What the job, bosses/managers, pay, etc...   I just want to know as much as I can first hand from the people that currently work in the field. What are some tips you would give a new-comer in college and what do you wish you had known before getting into the industry?
