I think we’ve all seen this. Beginners ask questions on StackOverflow that follow the basic outline... > I’m trying to do _(very vague description of the goal)_ but it doesn’t > work/I get an error/exception. Please help! Isn’t it bizarre that so many of them seem to consider it unnecessary to paste the error message? I wonder what the psychology of this is. What is it about error messages that makes people initially assume that they are useless and not worth paying any attention to? The answer I’m looking for is _not_ “they don’t understand the error message”. That doesn’t explain why they wouldn’t consider telling anyone else who might understand it.
