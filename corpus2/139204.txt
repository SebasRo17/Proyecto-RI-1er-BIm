How Photoshop or other image editing software change an images contrast? What contrast mean when we process image pixel by pixel? Or what image contrast means? Here I created a very basic image to understand image contrast. This is a 10Ã—10 pixels image that get a 100% non-legacy contrast adjustment in Photoshop. The only change I saw was in gray colors that were lighter after applying the contrast. Before and after contrast: ![The images before and after contrasts are similar, except for the gray color which is slightly lighter](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CqZhf.png)
