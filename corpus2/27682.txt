Tools like pc-lint or QAC can be used to perform static code analysis on a code base. In my experience the static analysis often yields a huge amount of noise, i.e. warnings on things that are not real bugs but somehow violate one of the rules in a given rule set. Turning off certain rules (either for good in the rule set or via special comments in the code) can be a real cumbersome process. What are the real benefits of static code analysis?
