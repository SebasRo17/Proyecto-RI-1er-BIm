I am working on a MVC 4 project that will serve as an API layer of a larger application. The developers that came before me set up separate `Areas` to separate different API requests (i.e `Search`, `Customers`, `Products`, and so forth). I am noticing that each `Area` has separate Area registration classes that define routes for that area. However, the routes defined are not area-specific (i.e. `{controller}/{action}/{id}` might be defined redundantly in a couple of areas). My instinct would be to move all of these route definitions to a common place like the `Global.asax` to avoid redundancy and collisions, but I am not sure if I am correct about that.
