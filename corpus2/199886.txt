I am the only developer for some of projects. I used to pick environment I like, alike C# and C++. But this time new task could come from another department head who used to write programs ~20 years ago. That person reject all the new technologies alike .net and even C++ with no sane reason. Sure everything could be written in C and it could be fast and stable but forcing me (as only one developer) to write large scale-able project in plain C is not anyhow sane for me.   * Must developers aware of directions like that?   * Must developers fight to pick development environment? My current position is a bit weird. I don't like the situation and I say that I'm able to go and start project in C but I will not tell any development time only apparent minimum and I guess this time will not be anyhow acceptable. That could make me look as really bad developer.   * What will you suggest me in such situation?   * Have you experienced such situations?
