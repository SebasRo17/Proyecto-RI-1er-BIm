Good Day Everyone, I am realy out of option for interpreting the GPL for EXTJS for my work/idea/personal project. I can see that this is an active forum I realy hope, I have a closure on this. First let me explain my project, Iam creating this website which is like a webportal which is intented for End-User, now this webapps uses an EXTJS library which is GPL'ed as with my understanding on this GPL Any application uses GPL license libray should be released to as Open Source a a GPL compatible Linsence, this is when I or my application is a derivework or I have modified the Library and released it. or destribute it. But EXTJS has this dual license which is typically giving me the rights to do what I want. without giving out my code. If my application is intented for end user only, not a derive form of work, not a library, not a development tool, I will not distribute it because it is on the web. with this also the Libraries i will use will remain untouch as it is. and I will have list of library I use and thier respective license to credit them Given this can I not close-source my application and not violate the GPL? is it ok for me to use GPL library so long as the above is meet? The question in short is can i used GPL'ed Library, do not released my code as OPensource compatible License and still NOT violate the GPL'ed terms? Thanks in Advance Nick Ace
