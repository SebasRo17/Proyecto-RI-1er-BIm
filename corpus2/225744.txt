At this point, I'm not much of a programmer, solid html/css, familiar with JS but not a programmer by any means. I'm looking to pick up whatever is necessary for an upcoming project. I need to build an online image repository that will host around 15k photos. Those photos will need to have user entered data associated with them. They will need to be searchable by tags, and batch downloadable. Would you guys do filesystem or db storage? Basically, what type of storage solution would you use?
