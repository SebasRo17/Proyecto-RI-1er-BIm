I run little scientific scripts and C tools on OS X from time to time. For the C tools, I just download the source and compile using the provided Makefile. I usually don't have any problems when using the tools. However, knowing that those tools were written on Linux most of the time, I wonder if the differences in architecture (Linux is System V based, OS X is BSD based) will present issues.
