Mathematica lets me be so lazy that I don't even have to switch to a browser to check the weather report: ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZmUx4.png) The only problem is that it will automatically display the temperature and wind speed in Fahrenheit and miles per hour. Unfortunately I don't speak Fahrenheit and I'd like to see it in Celsius. When using W|A online, it is possible to create a user account and set W|A to metric permanently. Is it possible to set preferences such as this one permanently (at least for the duration of a session) when using W|A from within Mathematica?
