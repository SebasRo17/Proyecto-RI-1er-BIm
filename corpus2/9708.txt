Note: this is fixed in version 9. * * * Calling `EdgeList` on a non-empty graph which was previously empty causes the math kernel to crash. For example,               EdgeList[       EdgeAdd[         VertexAdd[           Graph[{}],           {x, y}],         DirectedEdge[x, y]       ]     ]      and               EdgeList[       EdgeAdd[         VertexAdd[           VertexDelete[             Graph[{DirectedEdge[x,y]}],             {x, y}],           {x, y}],         DirectedEdge[x, y]       ]     ]      both will crash the kernel. I've recently posted this issue to the Mathematica Bug List but haven't received any response. Is this the correct place to report bugs, or should I use the contact page for WRI instead. Can other people reproduce this? Also, how could WRI possibly mess this up / not notice this? Edit: fixed second example.
