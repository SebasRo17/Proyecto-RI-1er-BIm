I am creating some plots with `Show` but unfortunately the `PlotLegends` seems to be out of the bounding box when saving the graph. Sample code:               data1 = {1, 2, 3};     data2 = {3, 4, 5};     Show[ListPlot[data1, PlotLegends -> {"Somedata1"}],      ListPlot[data2, PlotLegends -> {"Somedata2"}]]      Is there a way to include them so they can be exported along with the image?
