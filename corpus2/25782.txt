I'm currently looking to move to using an IDE for web development. The options I'm considering are:   1. Aptana Studio   2. Coda   3. Expresso Please base your answers on the following criteria, in descending order of importance:   1. Supports HTML, CSS, JavaScript   2. Powerful (having good code completion, good debugger, great syntax highlighting etc)   3. Fast and light   4. Supports HTML5, CSS3, and major JavaScript frameworks (JQuery or YUI)   5. Great design (both usability and aesthetics)   6. Supports PHP, Ruby, and Python   7. Has Git integrated I've updated the question to be more objective. I'm mainly looking for an answer that addresses how well each of the IDEs addresses my criteria.
