For the sake of an exercice I want to aggregate price listings with prices coming from a series of web sites in a structured form (XML, JSON...). If I have control on both sides how can I go about making price updates the most efficient possible? Edit: To clarify, I'm looking for a more efficient approach then having a script or application pull in price lists in their entirety from all sources for updates.
