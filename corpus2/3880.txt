Consider this example plot.               Plot[      1-Exp[-x],      {x,0,3},      AxesLabel->{"thickness (μm)","power density (W/m^2)"}     ]      ![Example plot with quirky plot labels](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qLjlE.png) Let us hold the typographical quality of the labels to the standard set by LaTeX. There are four distracting quirks:   1. The "m" in "m^2" is italicized   2. The "2" in "m^2" is set high enough to be _above_ the "m"   3. The parentheses in "(W/m^2)" are comically small   4. The "µ" in "µm" is italicized  Am I entering the labels in the wrong form? How can they be fixed?
