This is a question about the use of symbols in `Minimize` and how to persuade _Mathematica_ to treat them in a specific way (as integers or rationals) that I have not been able to achieve, but analysis of the results of `Minimize` suggests ought to be possible. The context is this: I have the following equation and wish to find the minimum value of `t0` in closed form for a, b in terms of vx, vy, vz _without numeric values_ (as you will see below I can find a minima for specific numeric values of `vx`, `vy`, `vz`).               t0 = g (-vz Cos[a] - vy Cos[b] Sin[a] - vx Sin[b] Sin[a])      In the code block below, you will see in part 1 an attempt to do this symbolically in terms of the ratio `c/d` assigned to the key variables `vx`, `vy`, `vz`; `Minimize` will not do it. In part 2 `vx`, `vy` and `vz` are given a specific exact numerical values and `Minimize` then delivers a result. However, inspection of the result clearly shows (thanks to the relative primaility of the numerators of `vx` etc.) that _Mathematica_ is handling the numerators separately. **Code**               Block[{g, vx, vy, vz, t0, mint,  a, b , c, d},      t0 = g (-vz Cos[a] - vy Cos[b] Sin[a] -           vx Sin[b] Sin[a]); (* eqn to minimize *)       g = 1/Sqrt[1 - (vx^2 + vx^2 + vx^2)]; (* common initialisation *)      (* Part 1 *)      vx = vy = vz = c/d; (* would like vx etc. elements of Rationals... how? *)      mint = Minimize[{t0, 0 <= b < 2 Pi, 0 <= a < Pi}, {b, a},         Reals]; (* fails *)      Print["t0 minimum = ", mint];      mint = Minimize[{t0, 0 <= b < 2 Pi, 0 <= a < Pi, ,          c ∈ Integers, d ∈ Integers}, {b, a},         Reals]; (* fails *)      Print["t0 minimum = ", mint];      (* Part 2 *)      vx = 7/100; vy = 3/100;       vz = 11/100; (* all v made specific rationals *)      mint = Minimize[{t0, 0 <= b < 2 Pi, 0 <= a < Pi}, {b, a},         Reals]; (* succeeds *)      Print["t0 minimum = ", mint];      ]      **Result of Part 2:** > >     t0 minimum = {(1/Sqrt[9853])100 (-(11/100) Cos[2 ArcTan[1/58 >                         (-11 Sqrt[58]+Sqrt[10382])]]-3/100 >                     Cos[2 ArcTan[1/7 (-3+Sqrt[58])]] Sin[2 ArcTan[1/58 >                         (-11 Sqrt[58]+Sqrt[10382])]]-7/100 Sin[2 ArcTan[1/7 > (-3+Sqrt[58])]] >                     Sin[2 ArcTan[1/58 (-11 Sqrt[58]+Sqrt[10382])]]), >                     {b -> 2 ArcTan[1/7 (-3+Sqrt[58])], >                      a -> 2 ArcTan[1/58 (-11 Sqrt[58] + Sqrt[10382])]}} >   where the coefficients are clearly related to the values of the denominators `vx` etc. as follows:               58 = 7^2 + 3^2     10382 = (7^2+3^2+11^2) * (7^2 +3^2)      **Question** Is it possible to perform the minimisation symbolically and if so, how? Can one declare `vx` etc. as `Rationals` directly or by assignment as the ratio of two `Integers`? I have tried including equivalent constraints within `Minimize` (one example given in code above), but to no effect. I also tried defining a function accepting appropriate `Integers` and `Reals`, also without success.               f[a_Real, b_Real, c_Integer, d_Integer] :=       g (-vz Cos[a] - vy Cos[b] Sin[a] - vx Sin[b] Sin[a]);      vx = vy = vz = c/d;     Print["Minimize by defined function of integers = ",       Minimize[{f[a, b, c, d], 0 <= b < 2 Pi, 0 <= a < Pi}, {b, a},        Reals]];      I believe that the answer to this may also have a bearing on the use of `Solve` and simialr functions.
