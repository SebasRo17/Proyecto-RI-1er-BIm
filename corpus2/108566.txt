I am currently a software developer. As a next milestone in my career I am thinking I must establish myself as team leader which leads a small development team in order to meet deliverables, deployments, etc. I've read various post in this site itself which discusses the pros and cons of working from home. But I am not sure if this aspect was quite discussed/debated. I haven't stepped into the team leading role per se, but I would like to know the responsibilities that come with the title, and if (and how) that can be managed while working from home.
