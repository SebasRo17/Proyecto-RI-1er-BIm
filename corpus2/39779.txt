I have two functions of `x`, `f` and `g`. `f[x] = g[x] + 2`, but the exact form of `g[x]` is unknown. It is known that `g[x]` is well-formed, positive, continuous, differentiable, etc., but an exact representation is unknown. What I would like to find are the conditions under which `f[x]` is positive. This is clearly whenever `g[x] > -2`, however, when I use `SolveAlways`:               f[x_] = g[x] + 2     SolveAlways[f[x] >= 0, x]      I get: > SolveAlways::eqf: 2 + g[x] < 0 is not a well-formed equation. >>
