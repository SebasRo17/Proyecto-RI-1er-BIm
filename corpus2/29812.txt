I have a problem and it seems to be connected to an Interpolating function inside of an `NDSolv`e command. The `resistivity[x`] function inside the `NDSolve` command is an interpolation of measurement data. The code works fine with an ordinary function instead of the interpolating function. When I run the code, it does not give an error, but no results are displayed either. Does anybody know what the problem is? The code is:               xydataplot = Reap[          For[i = 1, i <= n, i++,            J = i j;            s =             NDSolve[{y'[x] == (resistivity[y[x]]  J^2)/nC              - alpha/nC (-T + y[x]), y[0] == T}, y, {x, 0, t}];            Te = y[t] /. s;            resis2 = resistivity[Te];            efeld = J resis2;            Sow[efeld];            Sow[J];            ];          ][[2, 1]]~Partition~2;
