I have a collection of products in a product group e.g.:               product-groups/123/products        1. If I need to **add** to the collection, is it OK that I pass only **some** products with PUT?   2. If I need to delete **some** products from the collection, is it OK that I pass **filter data** (an array of ID's) with DELETE? What's the best way to implement the functionality in the spirit of ReST? Edit: the items are links to separate entities, basically ID's of products.
