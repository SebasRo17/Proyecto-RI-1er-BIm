I am reading this article on a new feature of ECMAscript 6, generators, that are landing in the V8 JavaScript interpreter. Not too far from the top, the author suggests an analogy: > generators are like functions, with their bodies taken to the first > derivative. Calling `next` integrates between two `yield` points. I really like this analogy. Has this analogy already been discussed in the literature? Are there similar ones? Does it fit within a bigger framework of analogies? (I made a quick Google search but that was not helpful.)
