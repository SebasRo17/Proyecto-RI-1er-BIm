After some integration process, I ended up with the following expression:               (1/(b (-1 + E^b) Re[b]))E^-Re[b](  b E^b - b + E^Re[b] Re[b] - E^(b + Re[b]) Re[b]                                      + E^Re[b] Sqrt[E^(-2 b) (-1 + E^b)^2] Re[b]                                      + b E^(b + Re[b]) Sqrt[E^(-2b)(-1 + E^b)^2] Re[b] )      all is good, but this expression is supposed to be equal to               1 + (2/b) e^(-b) - 1/b      via simple numerical trials, i can confirm that they are equal. But, it would be great if I can actually make _Mathematica_ simplify that nasty expression into this innocent form. I tried, `Fullsimplify`, it does not work. Does anyone have any suggestion?
