We have had a situation with a scrum sprint where a team member went on vacation for a few days at the beginning of the sprint. This led to us being behind the ideal trend on the burndown chart at the beginning of the sprint, although we caught up later since we knew we had slightly less resource and as a result had committed to deliver slightly less. In our retrospective it was suggested by the Product Owner that we create a vacation story. The time remaining would be reduced down as the vacation was completed. As a result the burndown chart would be corrected for the "hole" that would appear in effort when the team resource was lower, which would otherwise falsely indicate a problem. Is this a good idea?
