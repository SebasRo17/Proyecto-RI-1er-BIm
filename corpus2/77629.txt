I have been programming python and web apps awhile now but never delved very deep into OOP. I use classes all the time but I am pretty sure i am not fully getting what I could get from OOP. So today I popped open Learn Python (mark lutz) which i had read awhile ago, flipped through the oop section in about 5 minutes and realized it contained nothing new. What would you suggest as a next step in becoming better at understand OOP?
