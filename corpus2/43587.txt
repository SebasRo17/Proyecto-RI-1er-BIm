I have a system of coupled PDEs with five parameters that I only know ranges for rather than explicit values, and I was wondering if I could define a parametric equation with ParametricNDSolve and then use FindFit with some data to estimate these parameters? My problem is that I have some coupled equations. Firstly I have a set up equation which seems to work fine, given by               (*Constants!*)     a = 10*10^-7; omega = 3.0138*10^7; Do2 = 2*10^-9; po = 106;     ro = 263*10^-6; micron =       1*10^-6; k = 1; (*eo = 100;*)(* qm = 10^-4;*)     mic = 1*10^-6; De = 5.5*10^-11;          (*First equation - set up eq!*)     s = Quiet[        NDSolve[{D[Ox[r, t], t] -             Do2*(D[Ox[r, t], r, r] + (2/r)*(D[Ox[r, t], r])) + (a*               omega)*((Ox[r, t])/(Ox[r, t] + k)) == 0, Ox[r, 0] == 0,           Ox[micron, t] == 0, Ox[ro, t] == po},          Ox, {r, micron, ro}, {t, 0, 14400}]];     p = Ox /. First[s];      Which gives me a function p[r,t] . I then use this in a parametric set up with parameters $eo,qm,kme,kmn$ and $j$ and initial / BC conditions to solve parametrically for $Ef1$;               (*Second equation*)     eqnDe = D[Ef1[r, t], t] -         De*(D[Ef1[r, t], r, r] + (2/r)*(D[Ef1[r, t], r])) +         qm*((kme)/(kme +            p[r, t])*((p[r, t])/(p[r, t] +             kmn)) + (1 - (p[r, t])/(p[r, t] + kmn))*j)*Ef1[r, t];          l = ParametricNDSolve[{eqnDe == 0, Ef1[r, 0] == 0,      Derivative[1, 0][Ef1][micron, t] == 0, Ef1[ro, t] == eo},         Ef1, {r, micron, ro}, {t, 0, 14400}, {kme, kmn, j, qm, eo}];          b = Ef1 /. l;      This seems to work so far (though Im unfamiliar with ParametricNDSolve) but my problem is that I want to use the output of this and the parameters to find a new value Eb1, related to the above solution by; $\frac{dEb1}{dt} = qm\left(\frac{p}{p + kmn}\frac{kme}{p + kme} + (1 - \frac{p}{p + kmn})j \right)Ef1$ with the initial condition $Eb1[r, 0] == 0$ - the problem is I have tried coded this in and have had no luck. I tried               eqnBo = D[Eb1[r, t],      t] - (b[r,        t])*(((p[r, t])/(p[r, t] + kmn))*((kme)/(kme +             p[r, t])) + (1 - (p[r, t])/(kmn + p[r, t]))*j);           x = ParametricNDSolve[{eqnBo == 0, Eb1[r, 0] == 0},          Eb1, {r, micron, ro}, {t, 0, 14400}, {kme, kmn, j, qm, eo}];      And this produces an error; ParametricNDSolve::fpct: "Too many parameters in {kme,kmn,j,qm,eo} to be filled from {r,t}" Anyone have any idea if what I want to do is possible, and whether this error simply means there's too much to fit? The data I want to fit it to is here. I'd be really grateful for any guidance I can get on this, or improved methods of finding the data I want!
