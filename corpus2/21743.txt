A few entwined/related questions: **Can Wolfram's Player Pro use proprietary packages?** I have searched Wolfram's site pages on Player Pro and don't see anything that provides a clear answer to this question. See:   * CDF, Player Pro, and Mathematica Features Comparison Chart   * FAQ **If yes, does it work the same as in Mathematica?** To load packages automatically in Mathematica I typically use the `"Applications"` directory and then place an `init.m` package with a `Get[]` command in the `"Kernel"` directory. The following code identifies the appropriate directories:                   appDirectory = FileNameJoin[{$UserBaseDirectory, "Applications"}]         kerDirectory = FileNameJoin[{$UserBaseDirectory, "Kernel"}]      **If it works differently, can someone explain how it works and what directory structure it uses?** A related question got placed last year, but as it never received any answers and I thought it might benefit from a more specific formation.
