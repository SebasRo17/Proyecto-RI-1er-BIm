I understand the concept that a Scrum Master should remove impediments. However I'd like to know where exactly the line should be drawn. For example a team member might have an impediment whereby they need to get support to log onto a live server and get some details. They can't progress a bit of work until this is done. Its a blocking issue essentially. But should it be the Scrum master that goes to the Ops department and does this for the developer or if the developer can do it themselves should they just do it themselves. At what point does an issue become a blocking issue?
