I am attempting to make a plot of the solution an ODE. I want to plot the solution using `PolarPlot`, `x` is the polar angle in this case. I cannot get _Mathematica_ to make a plot, and I'm not sure where I'm going wrong. I tried going about it this way:               sol = DSolve[r'[x] == Sqrt[-r[x]^2 - 2*A*r[x]^5 + 3*A^[2/3]*r[x]^4], r[0] == 0, r[x], x]     PolarPlot[sol, {x, 0, 8*Pi}]       but nothing is produced on the graph. Is this wrong?
