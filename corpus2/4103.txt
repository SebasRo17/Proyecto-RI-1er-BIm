Background: the following Manipulate works as expected                db := {{1, 10, 11}, {2, 20, 21}, {3, 5, 11}, {4, 15, 11}, {5, 8, 21}};      Manipulate[        Manipulate[ {a, 1, db[[x, 2]]}, {a, 1, db[[x, 2]]}],      {{x, 1}, 1, 5, 1}]      Now I want to make the inner-Manipulate more flexible... I tried this:                Manipulate[        Manipulate[s, {a, 1, db[[x, 2]]}] /. s -> {a, 1, db[[x, 2]]},      {{x, 1}, 1, 5, 1}]      Where s is supposed to be entirely variable based on some value in the outer- Manipulate, but it fails. Question: I want to programmatically build a(n inner-)Manipulate from values selected in an (outer-)Manipulate. Is this possible, if so how? UPDATE: I modified Piilsy's answer so that it works as follows:                Manipulate[       Manipulate[         Column[Table[{##}[[i, 1, 1]], {i, 1, Length[{##}]}]], ##]          & @@Table[{{x[i], 0.5}, 0, 1}, {i, 1, n}],       {n, Range[6]}]      **Question:Can this code be enhanced, i.e. made clearer?**
