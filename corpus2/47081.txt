![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/a1tAv.jpg) I want to solve this PDE. I have tried to solve it with `NDSolve` but found error 'Boundary values may only be specified for one independent variable. Initial values may only be specified at one value of the other independent'. Please help me to solve this problem: I am beginner in Mathematica. This is cylinderical PDE and in equation omega, lambda and fi have constant values i.e 2,3,4 This is what I have tried.               sol = NDSolve[{w^2 (1/p) (D[T[p, x] (D[T[p, x], {p, 1}]), {p, 1}])            + D[T[p, x], {x, 2}] - 2 l (D[T[p, x], {x, 1}]) - 4 f^2 (T[p, x]) == 0,     T[p, 0] == 1, T[p, 1] == 1, T[0, x] == 10, T[1, x] == 1},      {T[p, x]}, {p, 0, 1}, {x, 0, 1}]
