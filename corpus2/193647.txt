In an Agile development process usually the main focus is on User stories, but sometimes a single requirement may span several user stories. For example, the client may request a search page for all users in a forum, and there are several actions that can occur on each user such as ban user, delete user, reset Password, etc. We may divide this feature into at least 4 user stories:   1. Search for users   2. Ban user   3. Delete user   4. Reset password How would the user interface designer implement such a user interface? Should he/she work on the first user story and then start incrementing more features to the UI? However, I think the final UI will be messed up! If he decides to work on the whole feature (search + actions), what if the actions where of low priority and would be implemented several iterations after the search functionality was done?
