Styles can be used to give your calculation a book-like structure; with chapters, sections and paragraphs. Closing those subgroups of cells you don't want to see is then very powerful to create visual order. I use this to keep oversight of my calculation. The cells containing the actual calculations I close, and only the titles and heads are visible. This works well until I evaluate cells. Whenever a result or message is printed, the cells open automatically, and the notebook becomes a mess again. My question is: how can I prevent these cells from opening ? I have some ideas, but I would like to hear if you have any (better) alternatives. This I what can think of:   * Add a semicolon after each line.    * Use Block[{Print}, Expression} to suppress Print statements The side effect of these methods is that no results or messages are printed at all. I would like them to be printed though. At the same time I want to decide my self when to open a cell or not.
