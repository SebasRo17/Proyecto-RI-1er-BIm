Is object oriented programming always the good way for all types of projects? Is this methodology the best suited for large projects like compilers, interpreters and other large systems? Most of the compilers are written in C so I can't see any compilers written in the object oriented method. I think OOP benefits the most in places like LOB, simulations where you can consider everything as an object. But is it really useful in all places? Also OOP can lead to inefficient code than procedural code. Not to mention that design patterns sometimes increase the complexity of design.
