This may seem an odd question, but I want to create an executable which runs under Windows written in C++. The program needs to be able to update a jar file even if Java is not installed on the target machine. I have seen the src.zip in the Java JDK folder and the jar folder but this is Java code. I assume jar.exe is written in C or C++? Is it possible to see the jar.exe source code? If so where would I find that?
