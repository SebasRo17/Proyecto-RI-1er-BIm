I am looking at buying Rubymine as I am doing a small amount of ruby, but a large amount of html5/javascript. I was going to get Webstorm as I do have a lot of pure html5/js based frameworks/apps that I am working on, however I then read that WebStorm/PhpStorm/Rubymine etc are all based on their IDEA framework, and made out like each framework contained the functionality of WebStorm anyway, other than a few features which were not there out of the box but could be added through plugins. The main features that interest me about WebStorm are:   * JS Unit testing from IDE   * JS Lint/Hint coverage within UI   * DOM/JS Refactoring/Intellisense   * Coffeescript support   * SVN/Git integration   * FTP and remote sync (although not as important as the rest) So given the above, would Rubymine provide the above functionality too? as I would rather have 1 IDE which I can do both in, than having 2 IDEs which have a lot of overlapping functionality. Is there any specific functionality which is ONLY within Webstorm but not in any of the other IDEs?
