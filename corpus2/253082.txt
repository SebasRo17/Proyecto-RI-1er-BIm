First I am not so much expert with the license terms and system but have some basic knowledge. I have been developing theme for one of the Open Source PHP script since two versions. It has been package included with GPLv3 till now. Currently, I am working on new version and now ready to release alpha version. But before I release it, I just want to change the license to Creative Commons. This is just to prevent a bit the copyright/credits notes. I want to allow user to modify, alter the theme and they can redistribute. But they must contains the original copyright and credit notes and the license. I am not sure either I can release new version under CC license and if yes what will be the best option for it. Also will just a logo (not with entire description) will consider the same rights?
