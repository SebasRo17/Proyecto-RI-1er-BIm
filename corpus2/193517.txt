I am a Sr java Developer and have recently joined a new team. Here I have been asked to create a functional document looking at the code of a legacy application. This application was written about 8-10 years back, which is currently running in live environment but due to lack of documentation it is difficult to be setup and run on local development box. I consulted some of the old team members who support it, but none was able to run it on their dev boxes. Now I have to create a functional document out of it (with running it only looking at the code) which will act as a base to re-write this application with new technology and some enhancements. Kindly suggest what would be the best way to move forward? I tried to find out from testers and found that there is no tester currently allocated to this application as it's an old running app on live. There are not much enhancements or bugs coming up. Ans as this re-write project is already queued up, the management is looking into aligning any coming bugs to this new app.
