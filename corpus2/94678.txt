Let's say I want to start developing a project (for the sake of example, let's use facebook, ultimate-guitar, and all recipes or AutoCAD, outlook, angry birds). All of these apps are successful and vary in the degree of "depth" and complexity. As a starting developer most of these apps and especially the web apps seem simplistic to build and design especially if you're using a good framework. How can I gauge, estimate and forecast the complexity of a project?
