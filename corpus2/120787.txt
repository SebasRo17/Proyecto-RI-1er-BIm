So we are thinking that we might want to make timesheet submission easier by having our timesheet system send out a person's timesheet via email to the employee. The employee then should fill out the timesheet and send it back via email for it to be processed. Anybody know of some write up on how other's have done this? I've googled but without luck. Thanks for any thoughts/input.
