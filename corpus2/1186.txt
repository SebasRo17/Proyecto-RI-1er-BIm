A quick question, but which I don't believe has been asked here or at SO. Does _Mathematica_ have a simple way to just download a file from the web? i.e. if I have a list of PDF links (~ 2,000), can I use Mathematica to quickly take them and save them to my system. The obvious way that I've used in the past is to `Import[]` the data, but since we're talking large-ish PDFs I wonder if there's a way to skip that step. I have used wget for this sort of thing in the past, but just seeing if there's an easy way to do it within _Mathematica_. The 'Web Operations' section of the documentation does not seem to have any obvious reference to this. If not, I will obviously just use the 'proper' tool.
