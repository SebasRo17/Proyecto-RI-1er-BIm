We're working on an iOS project and right now, and whenever the designer has some feedback about fonts, colors, positions of elements, what images should go where etc., I have to go back and go through each little detail and make sure it's fixed. I'm thinking there's got to be a better way to do this, where the designer could somehow be directly involved in the application's design. The first idea I got is to create a global plist (or a per-XIB plist) which contains the details of the different elements (size, font, title color, background image etc.) and just let the designer fill that in, and have a special class that looks over the plist and sets the properties accordingly. If I have the time I might implement this. Is there some other method of working that saves the developer all that nit- picking designing time? edit: Or maybe is there some way to do iOS development similar to how CSS works with HTML?
