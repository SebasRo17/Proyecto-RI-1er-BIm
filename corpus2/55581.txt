Can I use the CellularAutomation[] function where the neighborhood is defined by the connections between nodes? For example, if 1 -> 2, 1 -> 3, 1 -> 8, 1 ->1, then the neighborhood of node 1 is the nodes 2,3,8,1. Here is what I have to start with:               Manipulate[     nodes = Sort@Flatten@Table[Range@n, {k}];     rand = RandomInteger[{1, n}, n*k];     rules = MapThread[Rule, {nodes, rand}];     colors = RandomInteger[{0, 1}, n] /. {0 -> Black, 1 -> Red};     GraphPlot3D[rules,      VertexRenderingFunction -> ({colors[[#2]], EdgeForm[Black],       Sphere[#, .1], If[colors[[#2]] === Black, Yellow, White],       Style[Text[#2, #1], FontWeight -> Bold, FontSize -> 12]} &)],      {n, 1, 20, 1}, {k, 1, 8, 1}, {step, 0, 100, 1}]
