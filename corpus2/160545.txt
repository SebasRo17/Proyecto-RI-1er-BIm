I'm a self-taught programmer about to enter the job market. What I want to know is what is the best way to show my experience to employers? What do employers want to know about my programming experience? Do employers want to look at code I wrote or could they want to see the software in action? Or do they only care how much my software is being used/how much it has created revenue? Should I write about my design and programming style? My background: I recently graduated from a university where I studied foreign languages, and it was during this time when I found out that programming is the thing I really want to do. Currently I'm a garage programmer, developing a software for a client for commercial use while continuing to self-teach myself, but my aim is to start a "proper" employment and career. As an added twist I live in Finland at the moment, but I'm looking for employment in China or Japan (I learned both languages while studying abroad). Any help is greatly appreciated!
