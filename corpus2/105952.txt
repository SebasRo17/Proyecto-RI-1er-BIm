As a owner of an open source project you'd want people to contribute and make it better, right? But if you then decide to throw on a nice tasty licencing model for people to use the software [Corporate or otherwise], do you get rights to all the income? if so why would people bother contributing? They could be doing all the work while you, the owner, reap all the rewards? This just seems wrong to me, maybe i'm misunderstanding it.
