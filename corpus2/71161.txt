One of my friends has worked for nearly 10 years, asked me why he needs to learn new things such as unit-testing, MVC, Multi-tier architecture (he creates 3-tier application but designs like 2-tier), Object-oriented programming or etc? He has worked for a decade without unit-testing, uses code-behind and structure programming and it works for him. He can deliver product to customer and he has a high income. What benefit will he see from those methodologies?
