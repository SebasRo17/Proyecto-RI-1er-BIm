I just got something I can't understand, so we have `1 byte`, which is `8 bits`, which is `2^8`. Now `2 bytes` should be `2 * 1 byte`, which is `2 * 2^8 = 2^9`, but actually 2 bytes is `2^16`. What I'm missing here? I mean, it seems like `2 bytes` isn't `2 * 1 byte`, it's more like `1 byte * 1 byte`, but this should give you `byte^2`, which doesn't make sense. Can Please someone explain me some concept I am getting wrong here? Thanks in advance.
