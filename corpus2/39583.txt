I'm trying to insert 2-milliion lines into a SQL Database, and get this error: > JDBC::error: Java heap space The insert is a standart _Mathematica_ SQL statement:               conn = myConn[ip]     columns = {"Col1", "Col2", "Col3", "Col4"}     SQLInsert[conn, "MyTable", columns,data]     CloseSQLConnection[conn]      Where data is a `List`of 2-million elements (rows). The command works just fine for a smaller number of rows. I know I could break data into small chunks, but I would like to know how to solve it increasing the Java heap space.
