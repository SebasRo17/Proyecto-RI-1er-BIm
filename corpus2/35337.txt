I'm trying to programmatically get the width of a character in Mathematica's default fixed-width font, Courier. I believe `CurrentValue` holds the answer but I'm having trouble understanding correct usage. Four examples:               In[1]:= CurrentValue[$FrontEnd, FontFamily]     Out[1]= "Times"      Example 1: Expected Courier, since input is typed in Courier.               In[2]:= s = Style["Confusion", FontFamily -> "Times"]; CurrentValue[s, FontFamily]     Out[2]= "Courier"      Example 2: Expected Times, since I specifically chose that font family for `s`.               In[3]:= CurrentValue[s, "FontMWidth"] / CurrentValue[s, "FontNWidth"]     Out[3]= 2.      Example 3: Expected exactly 1, since since all letters should be equally wide in Courier.               In[4]:= CurrentValue[$FrontEnd, "FontMWidth"] / CurrentValue[$FrontEnd, "FontNWidth"]     Out[4]= 2.      Example 4: Expected about 1.2, based on a quick measurement of the width ratio of Times' M to N. A prior question about fonts and CurrentValue has an example of using `DynamicWrapper` to get information out of dynamic objects, but I'm still curious how to use `CurrentValue` correctly in non-dynamic settings, and why the ratio of `FontMWidth/FontNWidth` is always 2. I'm on Mac OS X 10.8.5 and Mathematica 9.0.1.0.
