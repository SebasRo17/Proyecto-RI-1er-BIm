We are about to hire 1-2 new engineers for the software team (consisting of 3 developers, 1 tester). What are the steps to integrate them into the team? My ideas are :   * read documentation (coding standards, documents in development methodologies we use)   * get them to read the existing code   * assign them some simple tasks   * at the end, make them responsible for the code part What else could we do? * * * The project is in a medical sector (ultrasound system), and is already 5 years going. We have yearly releases, and we are about to finish one release, when we want to add 1-2 engineers. The project is in the maintenance phase (refactoring legacy code, plus adding new features). Things are pretty much on schedule (more or less).
