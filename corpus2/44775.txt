**Problem description** : I have a list of $\\{x,y\\}$ pairs. I'd like to divide $x$ into equal[*] bins, say $bx_1, bx_2, \ldots$, calculate $\left<y\right>$ for every bin and then plot the bin values versus the means. I.e., plot $bx_i$ versus $\left<y\right>_i$ with `ListPlot[]`. **Question** : I've already done it manually, but I was wondering whether:   1. exists a builtin function in _Mathematica_ that does what I want.   2. exists a builtin function that I could use in my own implementation (e.g., `HistogramList[]`?). [*] Bins with the same interval. Equally spaced intervals. * * * **EDIT** : Largely off-topic, but in `R` it turns out to be very easy with the `fields` package:               library('fields')     df <- read.table('my.dat')    # V1 -> off-axis distance, V2 -> energy     st <- stats.bin(x=df$V1, y=df$V2, N=100)     df2 <- as.data.frame(st$stats["mean",])          # Plot mean energy for every distance bin     names(df2) <- c('mean.energy')     plot(df2$mean.energy, type="s",         xlab="Off-axis distance (mm)", ylab="Mean Energy (MeV)")      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bofp5.png)
