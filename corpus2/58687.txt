I recorded a set of experimental rates $r = r(c,T,P)$ at 2 values of $c$ and >15 values of $T$.   $r(c,T,P)$ obeys the following functional form: $$ r(c,T,P) = \frac{c+1}{1+e^{\frac{W-X*T}{T}}}e^{-\frac{Y-Z*T}{T}}. $$ Now I am trying to obtain the the 4 parameters $P=\\{W,X,Y,Z\\}$ via global non-linear regression in a Monte carlo simulation, in which I repeatedly generate a set of Gaussian-noised data based on the error estimates of $c,T,r$. Each dataset is fitted to $r(c,T,P)$ against $c$ and $T$ and the fitted parameters are averaged to get their mean and std-values. For the constrained regression I use Mathematica 8.0 and the function               NonlinearModelFit[myData,fitModel,fitParams,Method-> NMinimize,Method->"SimulatedAnnealing"}]       Allmost all regressions converged. I noticed, that ~3 out of 4 fits can are 'good' (nice interpolation of the data by the fit), while 1 in 4 does not seem to interpolate the dataset properly. Below picture: red and blue curves were fitted to the first dataset at c=c1 (red points) and c=c2 (blue points). I would deem them as good, while the green and yellow curves from dataset 2 are bad. However I don't see any 'significant' difference between the two raw datasets. ![dataset 1 at c=1 \(blue\) and c=2 \(red\), dataset 2 at c=1 \(yellow\) and c=2 \(green\) and respective interpolations obtained from NonlinearModelFit](http://i.stack.imgur.com/yzjnA.png) I played around with the fitting method using various options given by Mathematica, but I found that 'simulated annealing' gave superior results. Varying the parameters of 'simulated annealing' (InitialPoints, PertubationScale,PostProcess ..) did not lead to a better rate of good fits. Looking at the ParameterTables, it becomes obvious, that the errors are reasonable for dataset 1, while errors for Y and Z in dataset 2 are nearly ~0 (all BestFitparameters are not close to Constraints). As shown, there is also a difference in the CurvatureTable. I tried to understand the meaning of CurvatureTable, but the Manual and google are not very informative on this particular subject. As far as I understand, small values of Intrinsic and Parameter effects compared to Conf.Region indicates, that the minimum of the target function of the minimization can be approximated by a plane locally at the BestFitParameters. This should mean, that the solution is stable with respect to small variations of the BestFitParameters. The BestFitParameters should therfore be acceptable?! Now my questions: 1) Is there an apparent reason for the failure of the fits (which I don't see and might be optimized, e.g. wrong fitting routine, functional form of the fitmodel,..?) 2) Can I use the FitCurvatureTable to conclude, that the found solution is likley to be stuck in a local minimum? 3) Will the selection of 'good fits' give a bias to the results and is therefore inappropriate? I would be very glad, if someone could help me with these question or relate me to someone/somewhere that could do so. Since I am not an expert, I would also appreciate recommendations for article/books (beginner compatible) on the presented topic. Thx in advance!
