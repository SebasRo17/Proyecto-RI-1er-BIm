I am trying to understand what is the purpose of making files using commands such as `cmake ..` and `make`, I have tried looking online but there is no concise explanation on its purpose that i could find. Also, is it necessary to use `make` on a project folder that is not built in order to use the source (C++) in other projects. I know this may be a simplistic question, but as i am fairly new to building files, any information or references would be much appreciated.
