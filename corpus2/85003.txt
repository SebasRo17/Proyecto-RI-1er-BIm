What is the best way to develop and maintain legacy code not in version control? Adding it to version control is of course the obvious answer, but if you can't, for some reason, what would you do? A few reasons I can think of why version control wouldn't be possible are:   * Management is against it (doesn't understand it, thinks it would take to much time, isn't worth it, etc.)   * You don't have the administritative privileges to install the required software.   * The code runs/is stored on legacy systems with limited capabilities for version control. So, if real version control isn't available, what do you do? Set up some regular backup system? Or perhaps create version-named folders?
