In many companies there is a formal procedure of reviewing employees' work. For example, a salesperson can stay she'll sell one million units at the beginning of the year. When she comes up for review a year later, she says she's sold two million units. Thus, her manager decides to promote her. But what should developer say? I'll fix a million bugs, I'll write a hundred unit tests? I can't imagine many things that can be measured here, especially If you don't have a roadmap for year and if you working on maintenance. What types of solid performance metrics work for programmers? Or are performance measurements not applicable for developers at all?
