So I've just installed the trial version of Mathematica 9. The first noticeable feature for me is the new built-in physical units. I used `AutomaticUnits` package before, it was almost perfect except that its units aren't usable inside many other functions. But new units can be used everywhere but I can't yet figure out how to implement new units and unit systems or override an old ones. It would be great to have a way to convert units to CGS system. For reference, that's what I usually do using `AutomaticUnits`:               Needs["AutomaticUnits`"];     UnitSet["cgs"] = {Centimeter,Gram,Second,Statcoulomb,Statcoulomb/Second};     DeclareUnit["statC", Erg^(1/2) Centimeter^(1/2)];     toCGS[x_] :=       Convert[Convert[x, "cgs"] /. {"Statcoulomb" -> statC}, "cgs"]
