Probably few of you are interviewing wannabe programmers. I'm 28, never worked as a programmer, but spent few months learning C and solving problems. I loved it so much that I do it every day just because I can, now and started studying CS at local university. Now I'd like to try make living from it and am trying some job interview questions I find on the internet. Some are obvious for me, but some scare me and take me long time to find a solution.   * When you do job interviews, how long you wait for someone to come up with solution? - - Does freezing for some time on problems that take 5-line code disqualify me as a programmer?   * Do you even consider people like me when browsing CV's?   * If you do interview someone like me, what do you ask that person?   * What are your expectations when you meet interviewee like me?
