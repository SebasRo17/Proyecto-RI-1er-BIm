I am trying to implement the following: I have got two vectors `x` and `y` of unequal lengths. The length of `y` is much larger than `x`. I want to define a new `y` such that its length will be equal to the length of `x` by taking appropriate averages of the elements in `y`. For example, if `y` includes 200 elements and `x` 100 elements, then I would define a new `y` such that `y` will be the average of every subsequent two elements in `y`.
