I'm looking for a way to have the axes at the origin in a 3D plot and to label the (x,y,z) axes in the usual way---with x near the end of the drawn portion of the x axis, y near the end of the drawn portion of the y axis, etc. I've tried               Plot3D[x^2 + y^2 + 3, {x, -3, 3}, {y, -3, 3},            AxesOrigin -> {0, 0, 0}, PlotRange -> {-1, 20}, AxesLabel -> {x, y, z}]      which works well for the axes position but horribly for the labeling. (The labels appear all together near the origin; it is not at all clear which axis is associated with which label.) Any suggestions?
