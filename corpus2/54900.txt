When plotting contours with `ContourPlot`, one can use the option `ContourStyle` to change the contours of the plot. With the instruction,               ContourPlot[f[x,y],{x,-1,1},{y,-1,1},ContourShading -> False, Contours -> Range[1,10], ContourStyle -> ColorData[10] /@ Range[10]]      I am able to change the colors of the contours, but they are thin. On the other hand, if I use the instruction               ContourPlot[f[x,y],{x,-1,1},{y,-1,1},ContourShading -> False, Contours -> Range[1,10], ContourStyle -> Thick]      I am able to draw thicker contour lines, however, they are black. I would like to draw the same contours **simultaneously thicker and colored**. How could I proceed ? Mathematica seems to indicate to use `Directive[...]`, but I have not been able to use it...
