I want to define my own ticks in a `DateListPlot`. It works quite well when I use the code in a _Mathematica_ Notebook but breaks somehow when using it via _Mathematica_ 's script engine. First of all the code:               Clear[fticks,plot];     fticks[min_, max_] :=        Module[{nTicks = 9}, Table[{min + i (max - min)/nTicks,          DateString[           DateList[min + i (max - min)/nTicks], {"Month", ".", "Year"}]          }, {i, 1, nTicks - 1}]];     plot = DateListPlot[       FinancialData["IBM", "Jan. 1, 2004"],       FrameTicks -> {fticks, Automatic, None, None}       ]     Export[FileNameJoin[{$HomeDirectory, "test-plot.png"}], plot];      In my `fticks` function I generate some ticks depending on the `min`and `max`values of the `DateListPlot`. This can't be completely wrong since the result works quite well. ![Ticks are working when computed in a Mathematica Notebook file](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vzUeI.png) But as soon as I try to calculate it via the _Mathematica_ script engine, the custom ticks fail. (I've saved the code above in a file located at `~/test.m` as _Mathematica_ uses `*.m` files for its scripting engine).               /Applications/Mathematica.app/Contents/MacOS/MathKernel -script ~/test.m       The result comes without any ticks but a red overlay because of an error. The question is now why is it not working? Interesting is also that while editing the `test.m` file there is also the possibility to run the package. I don't know why but this also works. ![Ticks are not working when computed via the Mathematica script engine](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3t0h3.png) I work in _Mathematica_ 9.0.1.0 running on Mac OS X 10.8. This error also occurs in _Mathematica_ 8 as I've tested. Thanks in advance for your help.
