When working with CSS media queries, I am unsure of whether I should program in a mobile-first style, or a desktop-first style. For example, let's say I'm given a design that consists of a set of blocks that are side-by-side. On desktop, I'll stick to spec, but on mobile, given the reduced screen area, two blocks stacked on top of one another would be better. Which is better, this (desktop-first):               div {         width: 50%;         display: inline-block;     }          @media all and (max-width: 600px) {         width: 100%;         margin: 0 auto;         display: block;     }      or this (mobile first)?               div {         width: 100%;         margin: 0 auto;         display: block;     }          @media all and (min-width: 600px) {         width: 50%;         display: inline-block;     }      Wordpress' latest theme follows the mobile-first method, by using `min-width`, but am I correct in assuming that older browsers without media query support would be unable to parse these directives, and load the "mobile" css? What are the advantages/disadvantages of both?
