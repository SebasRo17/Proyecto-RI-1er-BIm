There seems to be a growing trend for CMS systems to manage not only data capture and workflow, but to be an end-to-end product that manages presentation and end user content (like comments/forums). I thought it was a pretty ridiculous, but it seems like this approach is gaining more and more traction. It seems to me that the two concepts should be completely orthogonal. The CMS needs to either publish content to database or XML repo or expose an API (RESTful or otherwise) and remain agnostic to presentation. I'm sure there are some efficiencies in coupling, but at the expense of lock-in and inflexibility. I guess my question is, should I go with the flow or is this something I should keep fighting against?
