I have a Rails server that connects to a json API on another server to get data to build the pages dynamically. These pages, however, don't change very much and not very often. I was thinking I could cut down the page load time, also, cut down the calls to the JSON API significantly if I just periodically called the JSON API and wrote the html files as static html pages. What is a way for building the html files in ruby / rails from scratch?
