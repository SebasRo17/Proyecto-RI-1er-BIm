I have a tester that while testing will have an error occur (ok so far), but then he frequently reports it right away. We (the developers) then later find that the tester has not tried to reproduce the issue and (when asked) cannot find a way to make it happen again. Now these are still bugs, I don't want to ignore them. But without repro steps I am kind of stuck. Sometimes there is a stack trace (though frequently it is not useful because this is compact framework and there are no line numbers). But when there is one I can take the stack trace and crack open the code and start guessing, but that does not lead to testable "fixes". What do you do in scenarios like this?
