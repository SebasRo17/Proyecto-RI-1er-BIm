I've found Yeoman extremely useful for building out prototypes locally and static mockups that I can share with a team. However, it seems that including its directory structure within the context of a larger framework like Rails, Django, .NET, would be extremely cumbersome, and I can't picture what an efficient workflow might be. There are scads of tutorials that refer to Yeoman and Front End Workflow, but for collaborative development within a larger team environment there seems to be little out there. How to use Yeoman within a framework that is not simply providing a restful API? How to integrate Yeoman within the workflow of a team?
