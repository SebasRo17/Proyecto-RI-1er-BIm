_Disclaimer: I know that datatypes are a little bit subjective to which scripting/programming language you are using, I like to write in Python as a matter of preference; though I am happy to hear about any lanugage/implementation._ What is the best datatype to store a three-state variable? Something capable or representing Positive, Neutral, and Negative. Example: Integers `-1`, `0`, `1`.   * Pro: Very concise.   * Pro: Potentially efficient, Could be stored as a single 2-bit signed integer.   * Pro: could be used as a scale, such as a floating point multiplier. Example 2: `0`, `null`, `1` (or any permutation)   * Pro: Non-neutral use case can be binary.   * Con: Requires dynamic datatype    * Con: Potentially not concise. Example 3: `+`, `` (empty string), `-`   * Pro: Very concise.   * Con: May utilize string logic to determine state.   * Pro?: Intuitive graphical representation.  Perhaps there is some clever binary logic that can do something clever that I can't even imagine, perhaps there relies too much considerations of the use case. Also, are there any considerations when adapting a ternary state to store in a database engine? Like Innodb for reference.
