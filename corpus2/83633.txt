I am stumped by a request from my manager. I work for a small startup and we developed a web application for a fixed rate with a maintenance agreement for a MUCH larger company. Knowing horror stories about how large companies will only pay their bills to the last second we decided that we would like to protect ourselves by being able to license this web application in a way that if we don't get paid the software no longer works. I have seen this done before for desktop applications however this will be a web application that they will host internally and will not be accessible from the Internet. What is the best approach to do this, we would like it to have a small footprint and would like the ability to renew the license key that they have distributed. Has anybody done something similar? Are we completely out of our minds? Does anybody have any better suggestions?
