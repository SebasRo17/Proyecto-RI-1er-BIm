I have two discrete uniform distributions over same support:               Dx = DiscreteUniformDistribution[{-8, 8}];       Dy = DiscreteUniformDistribution[{-8, 8}];      I use random variables X $\sim$ Dx, Y $\sim$ Dy to model condition in some if- else clause in C code. For example,               if (3 * x + 1 > y) {        ...      }      So, I model this condition by random event 3*X + 1 > Y. Then probability I look for is:               Probability[       x > y,        {Distributed[x, TransformedDistribution[3 * x + 1, Distributed[x, Dx]]],        Distributed[y, Dy]}     ]      Unfortunately, Mathematica produces nothing. As for me, this is very strange behavior because Mathematica also cannot compute mean for the product distribution of {X, Y}. Maybe, this problem is caused by different support of X and Y. How can I compute this probability?
