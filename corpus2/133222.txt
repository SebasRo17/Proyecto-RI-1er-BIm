I work in a small (7 developer) development team and we all work on our own projects. Some of the barriers to team work are the languages and platforms we work on (.NET vs mainframe RPG programming) but other barriers are just that we're all so busy we haven't taken the time to take a step back and organize teams. Me and two other .NET developers are taking initiative to starting a small team but we're all a little stuck on what to do. We're starting with sharing knowledge on the products we work on so we can back each other up but we eventually want to tackle projects as a team instead of individually. What advice would you give a group of guys like us trying to start up team work?
