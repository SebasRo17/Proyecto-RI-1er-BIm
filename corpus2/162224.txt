This is my first time choosing a hosting company. It is for a web site made in asp.net mvc3. So I was thinking choosing a provider would be easy since I found this page http://www.microsoft.com/web/Hosting/Home which contains hosting offers. Now hours later, I am still searching. The reason is that as soon as I start investigating about particular company, something stands out that I do not like. Here are some examples what I noticed when checking various companies in more detail:   * **Company "about us" page is lacking in information about their company.** Few of them had just general description what they do and nothing else, while some others had information like company name but had no address.   * **Checking company name in Business Registry Searches gave no results.** Two of the companies I checked had both company name and address but I was unable to find them in the registry.   * **Putting company domain into Google gave mostly results from that domain or web hosting review sites but not much else.** I am assuming that good companies should have search results from other sites too.   * **Low Alexa Traffic Rank.** There was one company which had a site that looked very professional but their alexa traffic ranking was like 2 million. Are there any other factors I should pay attention to when choosing a hosting company? Do I have legitimate concerns or am I just too paranoid?
