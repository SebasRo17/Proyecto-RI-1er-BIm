Currently in my Silverlight app I'm polling the database for changes to cached objects and am looking for advice on how to update the views that are displaying these lists. Example: I have a static class that has lists of objects (Areas, vehicles drivers etc.) that I will be using throughout the application. I have a timer in my shell that will poll the database passing a timestamp of the last update. So if the timestamp has changed the updates will be passed back and the lists will be updated. How do I update the views that will be displaying these lists. If the user is editing a record that displays a combobox bound to this list how will this data be updated and if the user has made a selection from the list will this affect the selection? Bear in mind that some users will be adding to these lists that I will be inserting to the database. Am I going about this in the right way?, or has anybody implemented this with success in their application?
