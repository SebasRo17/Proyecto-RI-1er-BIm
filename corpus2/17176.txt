I have defined a function `PassVeltB` in some complicated way. But now I would like to add a little documentation that gives the user information on how it is to be used. I know that the `?` symbol could be placed before a built-in function to generate useful information about that built-in function. Is there a way I can add helpful information about my `PassVeltB` function in a similar way?
