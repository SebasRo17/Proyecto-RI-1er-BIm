Consider this example:               FindInstance[Exists[{x, y}, x > 1 && y > 1 && x > Sqrt[x + y]], {x, y}]      which finds values of $x$ and $y$ such that $x>\sqrt{x + y}$. Why does Mathematica output `{{x->0, y->0}}`? The condition is obviously violated in all three parts: none of $x>1$, $y>1$, or $x>\sqrt{x+y}$ are satisfied by $(0,0)$. What's going on here? Am I misusing `FindInstance`? Or `Exists`?
