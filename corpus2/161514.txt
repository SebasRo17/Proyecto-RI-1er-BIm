I am a mercurial person. I even use it as an incremental backup tool. I used to use SVN and CVS. In a recent project, I had to to use clearcase and encountered lots of issues with it. For example, I could not figure out how to recursively include a whole tree of code without writing a script or using awk or find. Is there a way to accomplish this easier? I also believe (but not sure) that clearcase integrates issue/bug management with the code. I would not like to have the managing of my code revisioning tightly encumbered with the issues, any suggestions? My further questions are:   * Is clearcase in obsolence as a version control env? Is it likely that in the project I am working compelling me to use clearcase simply because it is a legacy project?   * It gives me an impression that it is obsolete, over-engineered and should be phased out. Is that the current situation with clearcase among programmers?   * Are there compelling reasons/features/functionality in clearcase that it is preferred over SVN, GIT or Mercurial?   * Perhaps, there is a whole ecosphere of reasons why the project is using clearcase and that I need to drop my mercurial mentality and spend time getting immersed in the clearcase ecosphere I have yet to discover?   * Is the lack of features in clearcase the reason for the lack of features in the clearcase GUIs?
