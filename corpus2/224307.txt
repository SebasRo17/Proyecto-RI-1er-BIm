Our team of 12 is currently considering implementing a style guide. The question came up if long term productivity benefits outweigh the short term productivity loss as everyone adapts. What has been your experience with style guides? I should also note our code base is rather large and we'll probably have to run our code through uncrustify or something similar to bring the entire code base into conformance with the guide.
