Let me introduce my situation: I have Java EE application and in one package, I want to have classes which will act primarily as cache for some data from database, for example:   * class that will hold all articles for our website   * class that will hold all categories   * etc. Every class should have some `update()` method, which will update data for that class from database and also some other methods for data manipulation specific for that data type. Now, I would like to call `update()` method for all class instances (there will be exactly one class instance for every class) from one place. What is the best design?
