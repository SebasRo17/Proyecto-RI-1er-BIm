I came across this question a second ago, and I'm pulling some of the material off of there: Is there a name for the 'break n' construct? This appears to be a needlessly complex way for people to have to instruct the program to break out of a double-nested for loop:               for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {         bool broken = false;         for (j = 10; j > 0; j--) {             if (j == i) {                 broken = true;                 break;             }         }         if (broken)             break;     }      I know textbooks like to say goto statements are the devil, and I'm not fond of them at all myself, but does this justify an exception to the rule? I'm looking for answers that deal with n-nested for loops. **NOTE:** Whether you answer yes, no, or somewhere in between, completely close-minded answers are **not** welcome. Especially if the answer is no, then provide a good, legitimate reason why (which is not too far from Stack Exchange regulations anyway).
