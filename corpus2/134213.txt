> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  What's the recommended control naming convention for XAML markup? Because the old answers now doesn't apply any more as Google Group(s) no longer exists I'm looking for some other resources about this topic. I usually do it like this   * Location (where I place the control)   * Look (how it looks beside its position)   * Behaviour (other bindings like commanding etc.) And this worked fine for me but still I was wondering if there was an actual standard or even recommended guidelines I could follow.
