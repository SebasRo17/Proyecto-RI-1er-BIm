I graduated 2004 CECS and the only experienced I had was at intern for 2 years. At that time I had c and c++ knowledge. I took a 10yrs break and now want to go back into it. I am interested in c#. I have been reading books about c# and some basic programming doodles. Currently trying digest PRO c# 5.0 and the 4.5 .net. What recommendation I need to do to get back into the software field? Should getting a certification Programming in c# Exam 70-483 help me or should I just try to write something to show my current skill and post it on internet?
