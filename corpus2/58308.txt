Maths newbie so please go gently. Imagine if you would: 4 teams in the semi-final of a soccer tournament A,B,C,D. A,B and C all have 20% chance of winning the tournament. D however, is the favourite with a 40% chance of winning. The lunch time game is between A and B where A wins? So...the question is how do I calculate the new probabilities of B,C or D now winning before the evening semi between C and D Second question if I can? what the probabilities after D wins the evenings semi match? Thanks in advance.
