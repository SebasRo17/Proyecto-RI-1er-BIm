Further to my previous question, is there a concise way - amenable to automated setting in a package so that it can be accessed globally - to eliminate some legend item that would otherwise show? For example, in this example, I'd like to only show the orange rectangle and text "Preliminary estimates". ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Wcznl.png) I tried a couple of replacement rules, by analogy with belisarius’s answer for reversing stacked bar chart legends, such as the example below, but it doesn’t seem to make any difference.               BarChart[RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[0, 0.6], 40],       ChartStyle -> Join[ConstantArray[Green, {39}], {Orange}],       ChartLegends ->       Placed[Join[ConstantArray[None, {39}], {"Preliminary estimates"}],       Bottom]] /. Pane[Row[x_]] :> Pane[Row[Last[x]]]
