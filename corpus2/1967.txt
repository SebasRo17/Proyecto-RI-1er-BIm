Using Mathematica 8, I can check the version of the .NET framework used by `NETLink` as follows:               Needs["NETLink`"]     InstallNet[];     LoadNETType["System.Environment"];     System`Environment`Version@ToString[]      > "2.0.50727.5448" As you can see, it is the old 2.0 framework. However, my machine has version 4.0 of the .NET framework installed. Is there a way to configure Mathematica to use the newer version?
