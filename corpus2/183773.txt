In ASP.Net MVC, in the razor view, you can type this kind of code:               @Html.EditorFor(model => model.Name)      (in this case, it creates a textbox for the field Name of the object which is defined as the type of the model) Now when i see the definition of the EditorFor method, it is this:               EditorFor<TModel, TValue>(this HtmlHelper<TModel> html, Expression<Func<TModel, TValue>> expression);      So i tried implementing that kind of method myself, but i realy don't see what this means **`Expression<Func<TModel, TValue>>`** Who can explain to me what an expression is, and the Func, and the Expression of type Func? The explanations i found where all so abstract it didn't give me a clue....
