Writing a single var declaration per function is considered to be good for readability and maintainability. But, when I went through some of standard libraries, their dev version doesn't strictly follow this. For example, Underscore code has multiple var statements in many function which are spread randomly and declared as required. Is there any reason to not to follow the single-var-rule?
