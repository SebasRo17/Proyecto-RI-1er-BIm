I am learning Java and I was wondering about when it would be best for me to try to develop something for Android? I have two specific concerns. 1.How is the Android API different from the main Java API? Are they similar or radically different? 2.I have heard that you need to make multiple versions of a given application for different devices. Is this correct? I have no idea where to start when answering these questions.
