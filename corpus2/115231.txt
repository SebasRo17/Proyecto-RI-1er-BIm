Which learning path would you recommend to be able to create complete application from requirement analysis, design (with various diagrams) to coding and testing? It's not easy to get this knowledge when man does not work for a software company. Is there on the internet some example of this process from requirements to complete application? It won't need to be very complex, something for a beginner who knows UML, database design and a few programming languages (intermediate level). I prefer the resulting application in Python or C (but in C there aren't classes, so maybe here will be less design). I don't like C++ much. Java is acceptable too. This is rather easier example of what I'm looking for. The emphasis should be more on design, there don't need to be complex algorithms but show rather putting some working system (e.g. information system with 3 layer architecture) together.
