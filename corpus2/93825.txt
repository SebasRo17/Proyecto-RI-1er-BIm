I would like to learn about reverse engineering, but I'm little bit confused with many different assemblies. So to say... Let me explain! Everytime I start reading assembly tutorial it states it is for MC8600 or x86 or some other CPU. I found here explanation why there is so many assemblies. And I found here and here some useful stuff about RE and assembly. Nevertheless, I'm still little bit scared that I will be learning assembly for 2-3 months, then take some "real-world" application and won't be able to do RE because I know, let say, MC8600 assembly and it's compilled on x86 CPU. So, the question would be... If I want to learn assembly which can be used on modern application (not only for RE), which assembly should I learn? Thank you in advance!
