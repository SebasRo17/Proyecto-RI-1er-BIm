I recently looked a Flow-Graph question. Consider 8 boxes with following values               Box 1 = 2     Box 2 = 7     Box 3 = 2     Box 4 = 1     Box 5 = 5     Box 6 = 7     Box 7 = 1     Box 8 = 4      Now follow the instructions:   1. Put the number from Box 7 into Box 1   2. Add the numbers from Box 1 and Box 2 , and put the result in Box 1   3. Change Instruction 2, Increase the number in Box 2 by 1   4. If the second box number mentioned in instruction 2 is greater than the number in box 8, stop. If not, go to step 2. What number is in Box 1 now? Note: When you are told to put a number into a box, it is understood that whatever number was previously in that box has just been erased. When I tried to solve:   1. b[1] = 1   2. b[1] = 1+7 = 8   3. b[b[2]] = b[7]+1 =b[7]=2   4. b[2] > b[8] 7 > 4 : true result: 8 But the solution is 11! how? I got stuck.Am I misinterpreting something?
