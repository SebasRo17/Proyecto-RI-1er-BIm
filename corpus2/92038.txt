I programmed for the iphone (and a bit for mac) for the last 1 or 2 years and now I want to learn Java. I know OOP and am also farmiliar with a bit of the c syntax! Are there any books like java for objective-c programmers or some stuff like that? If you think c++ would be a better idea than Java (for game programming) please also give me tips for that. I'd really like to stay in OOP.
