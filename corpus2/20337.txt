I've upgraded to Mathematica 9.0 on Ubuntu 12.04 with the latest Nvidia driver (304.64). I load CUDA by using, as usual, `Needs["CUDALink`"]`. `CUDAQ[]` reports True.   `CUDAInformation[]` reports: > >     {1 -> {"Name" -> "GeForce GT 330M", "Clock Rate" -> 1265000, >        "Compute Capabilities" -> 1.2, "GPU Overlap" -> 1, >        "Maximum Block Dimensions" -> {512, 512, 64}, >        "Maximum Grid Dimensions" -> {65535, 65535, 1}, >        "Maximum Threads Per Block" -> 512, >        "Maximum Shared Memory Per Block" -> 16384, >        "Total Constant Memory" -> 65536, "Warp Size" -> 32, >        "Maximum Pitch" -> 2147483647, >        "Maximum Registers Per Block" -> 16384, "Texture Alignment" -> 256, >         "Multiprocessor Count" -> 6, "Core Count" -> 48, >        "Execution Timeout" -> 1, "Integrated" -> False, >        "Can Map Host Memory" -> True, "Compute Mode" -> "Default", >        "Texture1D Width" -> 8192, "Texture2D Width" -> 65536, >        "Texture2D Height" -> 32768, "Texture3D Width" -> 2048, >        "Texture3D Height" -> 2048, "Texture3D Depth" -> 2048, >        "Texture2D Array Width" -> 8192, "Texture2D Array Height" -> 8192, >        "Texture2D Array Slices" -> 512, "Surface Alignment" -> 256, >        "Concurrent Kernels" -> False, "ECC Enabled" -> False, >        "TCC Enabled" -> False, "Total Memory" -> 1073414144}} >   It seems that everything works. But if try to perform the following:               randM = RandomReal[1, {1000, 1000}];     CUDADot[randM, randM];      I get: > CUDADot::notinit: CUDALink is not initialized. What does it mean? I already tryied googling looking for the error message... nothing found. Thanks in advice to whom can shed light.
