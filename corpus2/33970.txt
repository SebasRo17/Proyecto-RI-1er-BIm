I am trying to compute `t0`:               eq[n_, β_, λ_] := Hypergeometric1F1[1/2 (1 - λ/β), n + 1, β/2]     EDL[n_, β_, k_Integer: 1] := λ /. FindRoot[eq[n, β, λ] == 0, {λ, (2 k - 1) β}]     t0 = Table[EDL[0, β, 1], {β, 50, 100}]      When I tried this code I have a problem for $\beta$=(82, ..., 97), the answer is not accurate and I got the error message: > FindRoot::lstol: The line search decreased the step size to within tolerance > specified by AccuracyGoal and PrecisionGoal but was unable to find a > sufficient decrease in the merit function. You may need more than > MachinePrecision digits of working precision to meet these tolerances. So, I want to change the machine precision, so I tried:               t0 = SetPrecision[Table[EDL[0, β, 1], {β, 50, 100}], 30]      But I still have a problem. Please help me to change and set the machine precision.
