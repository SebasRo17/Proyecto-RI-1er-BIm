I'm developing an ERD for a graduate student manager program (it's for a university class, so it's a fairly trivial implementation). In this snippet of the model, I'm trying to work out the 'application' and 'committee' entities/relationships. Basically, a committee - comprised of staff members - can be formed and assigned to review an application. Here are the entities I've come up with:   * **application:** Comprised of a student's application data submitted through a form (student id, date submitted, degree, etc.).   * **committee:** Self-explanatory. Group of staff members that can review applications.   * **staff_member:** Any faculty member.   * **committee_membership:** An associative entity I've created to resolve the many-to-many relationship between committee and staff member since a committee can have many staff members, and a staff member can belong to many committees.  Is this an effective implementation of what I'm trying to do? I'm still trying to wrap my head around associative entities and when they are needed. It seems strange to have the 'committee' table with a single column. Also - and I know I've given you limited information - do my relationships look generally correct? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6fo25.png)
