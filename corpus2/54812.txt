I have two datasets:               dataset1 = {{3514147200, 5.83}, {3514233600, 7.48}, {3514320000, 7.86}, {3514406400, 6.74}}     dataset2 = {{2407708800, 131.3}, {2407795200, 131.7}, {2407881600, 130.9}, {2407968000, 131}}      By down sampling to get the datasets to be the same "length", I know that there is a correlation of approximately 0.95 between the two datasets. I have created a **very large** polynomial from `dataset2` to approximate `dataset1`.               polynomial[x_] := -1.19937*10^11 - 16.2653 x - 9.10704*10^-10 x^2 + 4.74474*10^-19 x^3 + ...      When `polynomial` and `dataset1` are plotted together, I can see that the polynomial is close to the data. I am looking for a way to measure the " _distance_ " between the dataset and the polynomial. I tried using `KolmogorovSmirnovTest` but it wasn't much help, any ideas about how to do this?
