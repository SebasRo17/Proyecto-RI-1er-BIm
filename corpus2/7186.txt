I want to include a figure in a paper I am writing on Combinatorial Geometry which features a non-convex polyhedron given by the following vertices, EDIT: I was unaware that Mathematica could convert coordinates from spherical to Cartesian, so I will post the correct spherical coordinates as follows:               {{0, 0, 0}, {1, 0, 0}, {1, Pi/3, 0}, {1, Pi/3, ArcCos[1/3]},      {1, Pi/3, 2 ArcCos[1/3]}, {1, Pi/3, 3 ArcCos[1/3]},      {1, Pi/3, 4 ArcCos[1/3]}, {1, (2 Pi)/3, (ArcCos[1/3])/2},      {1, (2 Pi)/3, (3 ArcCos[1/3])/2}, {1, (2 Pi)/3, (5 ArcCos[1/3])/2},      {1, (2 Pi)/3, (7 ArcCos[1/3])/2}, {1, (2 Pi)/3, (9 ArcCos[1/3])/2}, {1, Pi, 0}}      Does anyone know how I can generate such a figure using Mathematica? I assume I will need to also somehow define which vertices are connected by an edge with a list, but I am unsure how I would do that as well. I have tried using the "Computational Geometry Package", and have been reading through the tutorial for about an hour, but I have no idea what a "vertex adjacency list" is or how I could make this work in 3-dimensions; the package tutorial seems to only comment on triangulations in the plane, etc. Any help is greatly appreciated! EDIT: I will attempt to describe this non-convex polyhedron and include pictures and a figure. ![Real image](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8d9hA.jpg) ![figure](http://i.stack.imgur.com/m4L7M.png) I will quote from my paper: > The inspiration for constructing a simplicial 3-complex $\mathcal{K}$ for > which 12 tetrahedra touch at a vertex comes from the configuration of 4 > tetrahedra sharing an edge; see Figure 3. Let $v_{0}=(0,0,0)$ be the origin > and connect the two vertices $v_{1}=(1,0,0)$ and $v_{12} = (-1,0,0)$ to > $v_{0}$ by an edge. Label these edges as $e(v_{0}v_{1})$ and > $e(v_{0}v_{12})$ and notice that their union forms a straight line of length > 2 in $\mathbb{E}^3$. Around each of these edges we arrange four tetrahedra > as in Figure 3, and we rotate the cluster of four tetrahedra sharing edge > $e(v_{0}v_{12})$ by $\pi/6$ in order to ensure that an extra four tetrahedra > will fit in between the two clusters of 4 tetrahedra (explained in more > detail later). Considering the vertices of these tetrahedra, we obtain a > point set $P$ (with $|P|=12$) where the minimum distance which can occur any > of the points is of unit length. Figure 3: in the context of my paper, this figure shows that at most 4 tetrahedra can share an edge with conditions I impose. If you imagine one of the tetrahedra removed so that there is a bigger space, these are the "clusters of 4 tetrahedra" I described above. ![figure 3](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GKAcn.png) * * * (The bonus question was solved, thank you Mr. Wizard.) BONUS: If anyone knows how to check with Mathematica if all of the points are at least a distance of 1 away from each other that would be very helpful.
