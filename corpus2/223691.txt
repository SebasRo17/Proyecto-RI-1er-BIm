In java, to print the date we could do either of the following: **Fully qualified**               public class MyMain {              /**          * @param args          */         public static void main(String[] args) {             // TODO Auto-generated method stub                  System.out.println(new java.util.Date());              }          }      **Using an import**               import java.util.*;          public class MyMain {              /**          * @param args          */         public static void main(String[] args) {             // TODO Auto-generated method stub                  System.out.println(new Date());              }          }      What are the advantages and disadvantages to for each way? For me, using an import seems tidier, as you can see at the top of your class, just what packages are being used.
