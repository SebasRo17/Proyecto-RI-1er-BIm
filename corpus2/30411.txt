I would like to map Ctrl-U to "kill line" when using Mathematica 9.0 in command line mode (i.e. not within the front end, but when called from a Unix command line by "math"). I am aware that (on a Mac) the directory /Applications/Mathematica.app/SystemFiles/FrontEnd/TextResources/Macintosh contains the file "KeyEventTranslations.tr", however this file seems to only affect the front end, not the behavior of the kernel when called from the command line. I also know that Ctrl-C and Ctrl-G are already mapped to "Kill line" (although they don't seem to have corresponding entries in "KeyEventTranslations.tr"). But I would prefer to use Ctrl-U since this is what I am using in all other applications. (Note: Ctrl-U used to work in Math 8.0).
