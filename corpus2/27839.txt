Here are some very contrived code snippets, highly unlikely to appear in real code, but still I am curious why they behave like this:               Function[List, {1, 2, 3}][Hold]     (* Hold[1, 2, 3] *)          Function[Function, Function[Slot[1]]][Hold]     (* Hold[#1] *)          Function[Slot, Function[Slot[1]]][Hold]     (* Hold[1] & *)          Function[Function, Function[x, 1]][Hold]     (* Function[x, 1] *) (* Why not Hold[x, 1]? *)          {Function[Null, Null][1]}     (* {Null} *) (* Why not {1}? *)      I think I understand the first 3 cases.   Could you please explain the last 2 results?
