I'm a java developer that is tasked with creating some scripts that will handle large xml document file transfers by hitting some web service api's from windows xp client machines. There may be other document formats involved like .pdf, .doc, .xls or .txt, but I'm not sure on that at this point. I've looked into powershell, groovy, perl, but I'm not sure which one would be the best to use as I've not done work with any of those and there may be a better alternative than these three I've listed. So for security, ease of deployment, and maintenance for the script (not overly complicated to write or large), what would fit the best for these requirements?
