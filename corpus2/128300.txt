I'm currently using Codebase for all my project management (where I'm learning Agile). I use it for tracking bugs, user stories (via tickets), wikis, files and git hosting. However, I'm looking to improve on this and find some tools better suited to things like bug tracking, managing stories, git hosting, collaboration, client feedback etc. I'm part of a small team of 3 or 4 developers. Does anyone have any recommendations? My initial thoughts based on research was:   * Project Management: JIRA   * Bug Tracking: JIRA   * User Stories and Agile: Pivotal Tracker   * Git hosting: JIRA   * Storage: Dropbox However it seems this is quite disjointed in that it could prove more work than its worth. Appreciate any advice on the above or tools which you've used and found work great for small-medium teams and suit Agile. My SPECIFIC requirements are: Bug tracking, managing stories, git hosting, remote team collaboration, client feedback, time tracking, storage, build management, project lifecycle progression data... I also found Assembla which seems excellent. One of my team members believes in "the right tool for the job" and that there is no single tool to manage all of this. I was hoping for a central location.
