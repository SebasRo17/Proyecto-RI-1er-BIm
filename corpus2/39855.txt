I want to chart data using a BarChart, the labels on the x-axis should consist of three values, however I can only use one of the values (the street name), where I would like to include the city and country name. The relevant piece of code:               rEntities = {{1261, "C/O C T Corporation System", "Boston",      "UNITED STATES"}, {1017, "C/O National Registered Agents, Inc.",      "New York", "UNITED STATES"}, {1004, "49, Avenue J.F. Kennedy",      "Luxembourg", "LUXEMBOURG"}, {799,      "C/O National Corporate Research, Ltd.", "Dover",      "UNITED STATES"}, {793, "C/O CT Corporation System", "Boston",      "UNITED STATES"}}          BarChart[#, ChartStyle -> "DarkRainbow",      PlotLabel -> Framed[Text[Grid[{         {Style["Entities with same address", Blue, FontSize -> 18]},         {Style["Address's with 200 to 6999 entities", Red,            FontSize -> 12]}}]]],      ChartLabels -> (Placed[       Rotate[Style[#, Black], Pi/3] & /@ #2, {{.7, 0}, {1, 1}}])] & @@     Transpose[rEntities]      ![only 1 field on x-axis](http://i.stack.imgur.com/omzTP.jpg) What I would like to see would be the city and country as well. For example: "C/O C T Corporation System, Boston, UNITED STATES" under the blue bar. "49, Avenue J.F. Kennedy, Luxembourg, LUXEMBOURG" under the olive bar, etc. Thank you in advance!
