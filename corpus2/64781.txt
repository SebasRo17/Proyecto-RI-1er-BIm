This question relates to a one I asked earlier: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5448574/under-what-conditions-could-we- justify-an-attempt-to-introduce-a-one-size-fits-al When re-reading "Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software" by Eric Evans, I noticed that the possibility of achieving a common terminology (domain language) is taken for granted. Where does a domain language begin? Which code layers (or whatever the grouping) should reflect this domain language?
