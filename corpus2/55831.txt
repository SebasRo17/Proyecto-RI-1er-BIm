Following is the polynomial equation that gives me a single real root:               y[ts_, cp_, wg_, pa_, ps_, m_, dair_] :=        Solve[(.024*((9.81*ds[ts, cp, wg, pa, ps, m, dair])/               uj[ts, cp, wg, pa, ps]^2)^(1/3))*x^(5/3) + .2*x^(           2/3) - ((2.85/w[wg])^(2/3)) == 0, x];      I do get the result that I seek: > {x-> 303.6} I would like to use this result in my further calculations.   I have tried a couple of things which I have found here on the forum: Using the output of Solve   Extract numerical value using Solve   Assign the results from a Solve to a variable(s) But still can't get it to work. Ultimately I would like to have a variable that holds a value of this particular equation, so I can use it in my further calcs. **EDIT:** Here is what I have tried to do:               x /. y[288, 1520, 0.0186, 0.1, 10, 30, 1.21]      Result : > ReplaceAll::reps: "{y[288,1520,0.0186,0.1,10,30,1.21]} is neither a list of > replacement rules nor a valid dispatch table, and so cannot be used for > replacing." And               answ = x /. y[288, 1520, 0.0186, 0.1, 10, 30, 1.21]      Result: > z /. y[288, 1520, 0.0186, 0.1, 10, 30, 1.21] **EDIT 2** (Complete set of equations)               mj[cp_, wg_, pa_, ps_] :=        Sqrt[((γ[cp, wg] + 1)*(po[cp, wg, ps]/pa)^((γ[cp, wg] - 1)/γ[cp, wg]) - 2)/(γ[cp, wg] - 1)];     po[cp_, wg_, ps_] := ps*(2/(γ[cp, wg] + 1))^(γ[cp, wg]/(γ[cp, wg] - 1));     γ[cp_, wg_] := cp/(cp - (8.3141/wg));     tj[ts_, cp_, wg_, pa_, ps_] := ts*(pa/ps)^((γ[cp, wg] - 1)/γ[cp, wg]);     uj[ts_, cp_, wg_, pa_, ps_] := mj[cp, wg, pa, ps]*Sqrt[(γ[cp, wg]*8.3141*tj[ts, cp, wg, pa, ps])/ wg];     ds[ts_, cp_, wg_, pa_, ps_, m_, dair_] := Sqrt[(4*m)/(π*dair*uj[ts, cp, wg, pa, ps])];     y[ts_, cp_, wg_, pa_, ps_, m_, dair_] := Solve[(.024*((9.81*ds[ts, cp, wg, pa, ps, m, dair])/uj[ts, cp, wg, pa, ps]^2)^(1/3))*x^(5/3) + .2*x^(2/3) - ((2.85/w[wg])^(2/3)) == 0, x];     w[wg_] := wg/(15.816*wg + .0395);      Input used:               ts = 288  cp = 1520 wg = .0186 pa = .1 ps = 10 m = 30 dair = 1.21
