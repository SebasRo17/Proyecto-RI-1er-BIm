Here's a common scenario for developers who want to integrate static analysis in their workflow. Any suggestions on how to get this working with a minimum of pain? The situation is similar to the one discussed here: http://enterprise-it- solutions.blogspot.dk/2011/02/maven-configure-checkstyle-pmd-eclipse.html The dev system uses a centralized build server based on Maven and Hudson. The developers use Eclipse and Java, and use a standard tool (git, svn or baazar) for source control The developers need a local version of the static analysis tool to avoid having to deal with a dozen quality issues at once when they want to check in a change. The build server (Maven + Hudson) has a Findbugs configuration that defines "Current standard for quality". For each programmer, there should also be a standard configuration for Findbugs that is at least as restrictive as the server-side configuration, and perhaps even identical to it. The programmer should be able to change his local configuration, because - let's face it - he's gonna do that anyway at least once, yet it should be relatively easy to reset to standard. Changes should only flow from the server to the developers, not the other direction.
