I decided it was time I investigated CDFs, so I created the following simple `Manipulate` using Mathematica version 9.0.1.0:               Manipulate[      Plot[       Sin[a x], {x, 0, 2 Pi}       ],      {a, 1, 10},      SaveDefinitions -> True]      ![simple manipulate](http://i.stack.imgur.com/kpSYg.png) Then I selected File>CDF Preview>CDF Player ![file cdf preview](http://i.stack.imgur.com/n9PuG.png) which produced a new window: ![cdf preview](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TfhqT.png) Not very interesting (a bit like yesterday's paper â€” flat, lifeless, inactive), but perhaps that's what it's supposed to look like at this point. I pressed on, and used the wizard (File>CDF Export>Standalone...) to save a CDF version of the notebook. ![cdf wizard](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DDRzw.png) I put the new CDF file in a trusted directory, then opened the Wolfram CDF Player (version 9.0.1.0) and tried to open the file. Nothing happened - no console messages. I know that the CDF Player works, because I can open CDFs downloaded from demonstrations.wolfram.com. The CDF file itself can be opened in _Mathematica_ and works as expected. I tried opening it in CDF player with _Mathematica_ running, and also after quitting _Mathematica_. I also tried with CDFs made using File>SaveAs... -> CDF. I've read the CDF-tagged questions here, but can't find anything that addresses my basic inability to create a simple CDF.
