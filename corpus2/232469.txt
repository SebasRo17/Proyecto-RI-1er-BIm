I am learning SQL Server 2012 along with C#. In the past, I took database class in college, and have good grasp on SQL language and can write queries. However, looking at SQL Server documentation (or Oracle), it appears that DB engine (along with all the technologies that comes with it) are highly complex and are requiring significant time and effort to learn. Besides writing SQL queries, how deeply should programmer know about internals of database engine ?
