I want to solve $dx/dt=\sqrt{(1-x^2)}$, where $x$ is complex. When I solve it by hand and analytically for some initial value and draw the imaginary part versus the real part, I obtain an ellipse, as expected. I tried to solve it with _Mathematica_ , but I failed. Here is my code:               s = NDSolve[{x'[t] == (1 - x[t]^2)^0.5, x[0] == 1 + I}, x[t], {t, 0, 10},           Method -> "ExplicitMidpoint",   "StartingStepSize" -> 1/10];          ParametricPlot[Evaluate[{Re[x[t]], Im[x[t]]} /. s], {t, 0, 10}, PlotRange -> Full]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/W4uG3.png) I would appreciate if someone could help me to fix the problem.
