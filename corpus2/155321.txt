When I did my undergraduate studies in elecrical engineering, there was this book called "Basic Electricity" by Van Valkenburgh. If you read that book cover to cover, your fundamentals in electrical engineering would be bulletproof. I would recommend it all my juniors and I absolutely loved it. Is there such a book in the field of computer science? I am not so concerned about the algorithms. I am looking more into something that tells me how does everything work beneath the covers. TCPIP, memory management, DNS, routing, SSL, buffer, queuing etc.
