I have been using jQueryMobile for a bit now, and there are some things I like about it and others I do not. First I will give a bit of background. I have a light weight mobile application that has a few configurations and 6 pages. Ideally I Would like to load all pages into the DOM (they interact with each other quite often and pages will be switched in the same frequency). The application will post for some JSON every **_n_** seconds and refresh the values on the page (yes it is primarily a information display app). with the jQuery Mobile framework the only real thing I like is how easy it is to have a standardized UI a crossed all devices and browsers, I'm really not using too much else out of the framework other than the basic page navigation (if you are familiar with the framework; a bare-bone multi-page design is all i need). Why I want to step away from jQueryMobile is how weighty it is. Not only do you need to include the mobile library, but also the base jQuery libraries. This I do not like because I'm not using jQuery anywhere else on the site. Any suggestions on light-weight mobile frameworks that have a similar rendering as jQueryMobile?
