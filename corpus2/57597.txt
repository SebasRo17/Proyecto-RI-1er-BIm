I'm trying to find the value of $z(y)$ at a particular time, say $y=0.5$. I've solved the differential equation. I tried using `z3 = z[3] /. sol`, but it's not working:               eqn2[w_, x_, y_, z_] := 3*z'[y]  == 2 (z[y] - 1)  + (1 - y^2 w) x     eqn3 = eqn2[1, 1, y, z]     sol = NDSolve[{eqn3, z[0]  ==  1 }, z[y], {y, 1, 5} ]     Plot[Evaluate[z[y] /. sol], {y, 1, 5}, PlotRange -> All]     z3 = z[y] /. sol /. y -> 3      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/LgmUX.png)
