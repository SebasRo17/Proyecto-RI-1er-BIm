Say I have an equation of the form $$u s + \frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{p s + q} = 0$$ (or _any_ form that can be written as a standard quadratic, really, the above form is just an example; they'll all be equal to 0 from the start, however) and I want it in the form $$ s^2 + b s + c = 0 $$ i.e. the coefficient on $s^2$ is 1. How do I do this using Mathematica? More specifically, I'm interested in finding $b$ and $c$, but if the equation is written in this form, grouped properly, doing that is very easy by eye.
