I am planning to create a utility, which will query the database and store some information (on another table in the database). Its a multi-threaded utility and require to run for every 5 or 10 minutes/later may be thrice in a day. I see two options to achieve this in C#/DotNet programming.   * creating windows service having timer approach inside it.   * a console program and schedule it using windows task scheduler. Which one do you prefer and why?
