I bought the de-facto book for learning about data structures and algorithms (CLRS). The book is though quite good but the singularity is in the proofs. The book is filled with Lemmas, theorems, peculiar symbols and unimaginable recurrence relations which are very hard to understand. I am able to somehow get the algorithms but the discrete mathematics just not for me. So should I leave them out and just concentrate on algorithims?
