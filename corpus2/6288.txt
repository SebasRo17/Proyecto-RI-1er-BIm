In the examples I have seen, graph vertices in Mathematica are usually explicit small integers. However, Wolfram documentation says that vertices can be any arbitrary expression (eg., george, x^2, London, 5). Nevertheless, it seems that vertices are always _referred to_ by number, that is, by the position of the vertex expression in `VertexList[gr]`. This can be confusing. For example, if I build a graph like this, using nonconsecutive vertex numbers,               Graph[1<->2, 2<->10, 10<->3, 3<->4]      then I still have to refer to the vertices as if I had made each vertex number equal to its creation order, as if I had built the graph with strictly consecutive vertex numbers:               Graph[1<->2, 2<-3 ,3<->4, 4<->1]       Am I understanding this correctly?
