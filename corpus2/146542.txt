I am writing unit tests for a web frontend implemented in Django. I have written unit tests that check that all views return the correct status code (200, 302 etc) so that template errors (which give 500) are found. I also do HTML validation with `tidylib`. What else is there I should (or _can_ ) do? Models are unit tested elsewhere, forms have dependencies (namely on models) so is there way to unit test them - in general case there is something one can do, but what can I do (without a huge effort) leveraging the Django/python unit test framework?
