I've read through some very good resources on the internet trying to find out if my initial proposed testing process is a valid option. So please any advice or recommendations are appreciated. Currently we have a `Dev` and `Test` environment which has served our needs fairly well so far. We are having QA and UAT test off the same `Test` environment, however our QA testers are complaining that having both teams test in the same environment is causing problems with verifying test scripts and I can see how this could be a problem. However, I don't want to have to wait for `QA` to be done testing before `UAT` even takes a look at it, this seems to be against the ideal's in agile development. I suggested the following new process/architecture to allow parallel QA and UAT testing: Have separate `QA` and `UAT` environments that allow different modules/versions to be tested in parallel. So we can have `QA` testing `ModuleA` while `UAT` is testing `ModuleB`. We basically need/want them to test different modules (or the same) in parallel without interfering with each other. I presented this to our Systems Engineers (so they can build the environment) and they said that `UAT` should never happen until `QA` is done. From my understanding of the agile process at this time, I would like to push my proposed process further, but maybe I'm overlooking something? Thanks!
