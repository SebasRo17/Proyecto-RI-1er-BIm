I have forgotten a slang programming term. This thing is an intentional bug or a decoy feature used as a distraction. An example usage, "Hey Bob, QA is doing a review today. Put a `$THING` into the module so they actually have a problem to find". This can be used negatively, to have a very obvious intentional flaw to discover as a distraction from a real problem. This can also be used positively. Its like how you always let rescue dogs 'find' a victim when searching a disaster area. It can also be used to verify that a QA process is actually catching flaws. What is the term I am looking for?
