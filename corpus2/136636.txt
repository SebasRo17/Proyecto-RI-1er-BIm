Interested to know how people deploy software to their customers I have the following requirements:   1. Customers on various OS's prob. linux and Windows   2. Can't release the source code   3. Ideally want option to develop GUIs not just cmd line stuff   4. Can't assume anything is pre-installed on customers machines   5. Would like to use a nice,high productivity language I've used python for various stuff but am not sure how you could deploy it without releasing source code and without knowing your customers have python installed I know you can make exes but its not really designed for that and your effectively compiling in the interpreter each time Is there another similar high level language that can be properly compiled and distributed as a binary, possibly with a few supporting shared libs or something?
