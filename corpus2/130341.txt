> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Does making source code available affect your ability to generate revenue? Initially I was going closed-source all the way, or at least until we have a good reputation, and open-sourcing will only improve that rep. Recently though, I've been thinking about open-sourcing the entire solution. Various popular SaaS solutions have open-sourced under AGPL and are generating revenue. For instance, Gitorious (http://gitorious.com/subdomain) is AGPL but they make profit. OpenERP makes profit using the same sort of mechanism as Gitorious, advertising that they maintain the servers and keep servers online. I am building an ecommerce solution, and am considering offering free use of part of the system, pay per/month to use the entire system. By making the solution open-source, couldn't a competitor just download my project and offer it at a cheaper fee per/month? If I open-source, will that increase or decrease my revenue?
