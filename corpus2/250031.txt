Am trying to learn how to program before i go to uni and i stumbled upon a question which i have been unable to do. In the function write code to input two integers m and n and calculate and display the sum of all the integers from m to n e.g. if 4 and 8 were entered (in either order) the sum to be calculated would be 4+5+6+7+8. The sum should be calculated using a loop to repeatedly add numbers to a total. You are not allowed to use a formula to calculate the result. i have been able to do the basic addition but to keep adding is where am stuck at like if enter a value for m = 6 and n = 9, it should print out as 6+7+8+9 and add the values All contributions will be greatly appreciated. thanks
