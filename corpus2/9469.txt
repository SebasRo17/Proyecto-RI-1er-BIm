I have a `SetterBar` with 3 values. I want that when I hover the cursor on any of the `SetterBar` value,it changes its color and again go back to its original. But when I select some value out of 3 values. It should show selected values as Red and rest White. I have tries this way but when I hover cursor of any one of these values, all changes color. This I dont want.                col = Yellow;      SetterBar[x,{            inp1 =  EventHandler[InputField[a, FieldSize -> 3,Background -> Dynamic[col]],             {"MouseMoved" :> (col =col /. {Yellow -> Green, Green->Yellow})}],                        inp2 = EventHandler[InputField[a, FieldSize -> 3,Background -> Dynamic[col]],             {"MouseMoved" :> (col =col /. {Yellow -> Green, Green->Yellow})}],             inp3 = EventHandler[InputField[a, FieldSize -> 3,Background -> Dynamic[col]],             {"MouseMoved" :> (col =col /. {Yellow -> Green, Green->Yellow})}]       }, Enabled -> True]
