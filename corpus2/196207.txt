So I am working on a small Project at my company, I am a mere trainee engineer (halfway through a Software Engineering degree), where we are developing an intranet - based project management and people management system - it incorporates Employee appraisals, personal skill management and development and so on. Ive been working on this project for a little while, under the direction of a more senior engineer and there has been another trainee working on it too. However soon, a big contract is coming up and the other two have been press- ganged for some of the work, which will tie them up for a long, long time. This leaves me alone to work on this (really fun and full of learning) project alone. Dream come true! Or is it? I've been worried about how I'm simply going to manage the work of three people, are there techniques, tools I can use? The more I think about it, the more intimidated I am (but still relishing the idea of a good challenge). I have to think about planning, diagramming, release notes, test specs and my own hallways testing (where I grab a random person and say "break it!"), not to mention the actual programming work! So in short, **how can one person adapt to taking on the workload of three people?**
