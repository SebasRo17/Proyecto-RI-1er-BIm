I'm looking for a way to clearly diagram how multiple applications communicate via a service bus. The best I've come up with so far is a sequence diagram, but I really don't like that. Sequence diagrams necessarily relate some sort of sequence, and that's really not what I want. Furthermore, since every service communicates with the service bus and sequence diagrams place each service on a separate column, as the number of services increases, you end up with a lot of overlapping arrows. For example, given 4 services `FOO`, `BAR`, `BAZ`, and `QUX`:   * `FOO` publishes messages of type _publish_ and _regen_.   * `BAR` publishes messages of type _requeue_.   * `BAZ` subscribes to messages of type _publish_ , _regen_ , and _requeue_ , and publishes messages of type _transmit_.   * `QUX` subscribes to messages of type _transmit_.   * Any service can publish any message type at any time (there is no implied sequence). What kind of diagram should I use to clearly and unambiguously represent this information? Here's the best I've come up with so far:   ![Sequence diagram](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Dhhqg.png)
