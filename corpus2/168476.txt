This came up with another question I had here, I have decided on a programming verification system that requires a hardware verification system, a software key, and a name/password system. Now people are saying that hackers will bypass any new security, which may be true, but I have a few questions. There has to be a balance between programmers programming and hackers stealing software, otherwise programs wouldn’t be made, and we wouldn’t be where we are today. What is that balance? 5%, 10%, 20%, 50%?   1. What is too much security for the end user?    2. What is too little security so the hacker can just push through without issue?    3. If your software becomes popular, what should you expect or accept as acceptable loss?    4. Why should we accept black hat hackers as a way of life?
