As a very new software PM/Team Leader, I just want to know what is the best practice of a way to deliver a full required information about a task to the developers in my team. In this time, I just provide them with:   * GUI Interface (if it used)   * DB Schema (if it is used)   * Blueprint of main classes. I think that's not enough. We usually have long discussions about the details; I just want to decrease the area of the discussion. What should I do? Do you think we should at least have a code review process?
