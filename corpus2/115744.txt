I haven't touched algorithm complexity stuff in quite a while, so I am trying to do a refresher. I am trying to figure out the number of steps in the following for loop.               for(i = 0; i < n; i++){         //code         for(j = i + 1; j < n; j++){            //code         }       }        The inner loop will be executed ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fsIDr.jpg) times   I mean t times for each value of j. Right? In the worst case tj will be equal to n-i. Since it will run for n-(i+1)-1 times. Well is my approach on this analysis correct?
