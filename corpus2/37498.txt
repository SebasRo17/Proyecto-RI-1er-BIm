In the last 6 months, I have changed desks at my office 4 times. I don't mind, as it's due to expansion of the company and acquiring new office space and getting everybody settled. However, I truly miss the semi-private office I sat in 2 desks ago. I am now sitting in a large room with a number of other people. My problem with this isn't with my co-workers; everybody here is great. My problem is that based on the configuration of the room, no matter which desk I sit in, my monitors WILL be facing an open window. This causes a glare on my monitors, and it drives me crazy. I prefer a dark IDE theme as I find it easier on the eyes, however this just makes the glare that much worse. How should programmers cope with public office settings? Secondly, how should I cope with my specific problem? Should I give in and adopt a light IDE theme that will reduce the visibility of the glare but increase eye strain, or should I stick to my guns and find another solution?
