I'm writing my first programming language that is object orientated and so far so good with create a single 'class'. But, let's say I want to have to classes, say `ClassA` and `ClassB`. Provided these two have nothing to do with each other then all is good. However, say `ClassA` creates a `ClassB`\--this poses 2 related questions: -How would the compiler know when compiling `ClassA` that `ClassB` even exists, and, if it does, how does it know it's properties? My thoughts thus far had been: instead of compiling each class at a time (i.e scan, parse and generate code) each "file (not really file, per se, but a "class") do I need to scan + parse each first, then generate code for all?
