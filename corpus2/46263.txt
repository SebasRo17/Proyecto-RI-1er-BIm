I'm tuning a function to data over 4-5 variables using Differential Evolution. The objective function calls frequently interpolation function. I came to a point, where compiling the objective function should make things much faster. But interpolation function cannot be compiled. Is there compilable implementation of linear interpolation function over 2 variables that is faster or of similar speed with uncompilable internal interpolation function?
