What is going on with returned data in the following examples? It appears `ImageData` returns different types depending on the what data is passed into `Image`. How do I force `ImageData` to always return the RGBA `{{{0,0,0,0},{255,255,255,255}}}` version of the data?               ImageData[Image[{{{0, 0, 0,0}, {255, 255, 255,255}}}, "Byte"],"Byte"]        {{{0, 0, 0,0}, {255, 255, 255,255}}}      Now if I pass a compressed form of the same image I don't get back the RGBA representation of the image, but the same compressed form.               ImageData[Image[{{0, 255}}, "Byte"], "Byte"]        {{0, 255}}      Is there a way to construct an `Image` that insures _Mathematica_ always returns the RGBA form of the data? Basically I am looking for a function in the form of `ConvertToRGBA[i_Image] := ...`
