I run an offshore development team that produces a host of financial products. We are currently planning the work needed in order to gain PCI compliance. The offshore team is run by an outsourcing operation who employ the staff directly. In other words the developers are not directly employed by us, but are exclusivly resources to projects for our company. All our infrastructure is UK based (source control, development machines etc). Developers/Testers offshore remote desktop to the development environments they need to use. Is there anything in this setup that we should be concerned about from a PCI point of view? We have just started researching but I cannot find anything related to these points so any advice would be apprciated. Thanks!
