It seems like a lot of my clients get roped into buying less-than-adequate enterprise software then dumping it on us (as consultants) to implement. I've seen some of these slick vendor demos where they show off a heavily customized demo app and pass it off as an off-the-shelf solution that does exactly what you need while cleverly hiding the fact that it took thousands of developer hours to build and conveniently ignoring the operational gotchas that will cost you a fortune in maintenance even after you pay them for licenses. I know of sites like Gartner and Real Story Group that will sell you an expert analysis, but I'm looking for a site more like Stack Exchange or Yelp where developers, users, admins, etc give honest feedback on the quality of commercial software and maybe give some insight into pricing and value. Does such a thing exist?
