I work for a small product based company. We are about to re-write our existing product from scratch. We are planing to adopt Agile methodology for our development. Now my question is as we have all the requirements even before start of project (as we are re-writing the existing product), is it worth to dive into Agile world? Isn't agile more useful when you don't have all the requirement upfront and you get your requirement in phases? Secondly, let's say if we jump into Agile, whats the best practice to design database? Let's say in our first iteration we just create a login system (user can login, logout etc). Do we just need to create Users table without worrying about other tables? And other tables would be evolved as our product would progress?
