What design and implementation issues did programmers have to solve when they decided first to use structures and classes? When did this happened and who were the pioneers behind these ideas? Note, this is double question, because structures and classes are related. I realize that structures are quite older than classes. It would be great if the answer would talk separately about both of them and cite some sources.
