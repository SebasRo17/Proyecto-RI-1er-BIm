I'm reading about SOA and the four tenets required to make a SOA application. I have tried different sources, but the explanations are twisting. I'm searching for something that is a bit less abstract. Is my interpretation correct? The four tenets is:   1. Services have explicit boundaries   2. Services are autonomous   3. Services share schema and contract, not class   4. Services interoperate based on policy My interpretation is:   1. The methods that a client may use shall be easy to use and well defined.   2. Services shall not be dependent on others. Change of one service shall not affect another in any way.   3. A scheme represent the data that will be sent, contract contains the defined methods for a service. To make a system loosely coupled, you share scheme and contract instead of classes and objects.   4. A policy to use a service may be that a particular type of binding is required so it may be used. Anyone that wants to use this service must connect to it with this type of binding.
