I have been asked to go for a technical test/evaluation for a job as a junior developer, mainly using C++. This is my first test/evaluation, and it is 2 hours long. My C++ is a bit rusty as I have been doing projects recently on PHP. This is a UK company, however im guessing technical testing of candidates will be pretty much the same everywhere. What should I expect in one of these tests?
