If I want to find a minimum cut between two nodes in a weighted graph, I would use FindEdgeCut as follows:               g = Graph[{1 \[UndirectedEdge] 2, 2 \[UndirectedEdge] 3, 1 \[UndirectedEdge] 3,          3 \[UndirectedEdge] 4}, EdgeWeight -> {2, 3, 5, 123}];     FindEdgeCut[g,1,4]      This function, however, returns the edge 3-4, so obviously the edge weights have not been considered. I can find the minimum cut by using the maximum flow and so on, but I was wondering whether this error is more easily fixable or maybe it's just me and I don't see the error.
