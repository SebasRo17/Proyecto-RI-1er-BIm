Do there exist studies done on the effectiveness of statically vs dynamically typed languages? In particular:   * Measurements of programmer productivity   * Defect Rate Also including the effects of whether or not unit testing is employed. I've seen lots of discussion of the merits of either side but I'm wondering whether anyone has done a study on it. **Edit** Sadly, only one of the papers shown is actually a study and it does nothing but conclude that the language matters. This leads me to ponder: what if I proposed doing such a study with volunteers from this site?
