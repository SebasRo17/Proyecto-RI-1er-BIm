I currently use the Windows IME on Windows Vista to allow myself to type Chinese characters (not in _Mathematica_ ), and by default typing `Ctrl``Space` switches between the English keyboard and the Chinese keyboard. When in Mathematica, I would like to use the default shortcut `Ctrl``Space` to move out of subscripts and superscripts. Is it possible to retain the functionality of this keyboard shortcut in Mathematica? I cannot figure out how to remove the shortcut from the IME, which is an acceptable solution, since i do not use this shortcut to switch languages.
