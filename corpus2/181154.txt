I'm a bit confused about the difference between nominal and structural type systems. Can someone please explain how they differ? From what I understand:   * Nominal: Type compatibility is based on type name.   * Structural: Type compatibility is based on the type structure, e.g. in C if 2 variables are struct types with different names but the same structure, then their types are compatible. Now about explicit and implicit: why is it different from static and dynamic typing? In static typing, types will be explicit while in dynamic typing, types are implicit. Am I right?
