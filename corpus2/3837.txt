In a package I am developing, I accidentally left this line               Protect[      uncompleted prior to running the package. Mathematica produced this error message               Syntax::sntup: Unexpected end of file (probably unclosed parenthesis)                   (line 102 of "DataListPlot`").      which includes the line number of the error. Since the code was short and it was the only thing in that cell, it was straightforward to find. But, in general, how would one find a specific line in a package? Also, is it possible in the standard package interface to add line numbers, like in WorkBench?
