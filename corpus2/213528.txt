I'm trying to teach myself programming and I'd really appreciate some help with this issue. I've just read a tutorial on pointers but I have a problem with the example. The function copies one string to another. In the original function a copy is being made with ptr. What is the meaning of this? because as far as I can see it's unnecessary. Is there anything wrong with my revised function or am I missing something? //Tutorial example               char *my_strcpy(char *destination, const char *source){         char *ptr = destination;         while(*source != '\0'){             *ptr++ = *source++;         }         *ptr = '\0';         return destination;     }      My revision               void my_strcpy2(char *destination, const char *source){              while(*source != '\0'){             *destination++ = *source++;         }         *destination = '\0';     }      Thanks.
