I have a function that linearly "remaps" a value from a given interval to an other interval? The function remaps a value from a given interval [oldMin, oldMax] to another interval [newMin, newMax] using this formula:               newVal = newMin + (newMax - newMin) * (oldVal - oldMin) / (oldMax - oldMin)      If it helps identify what type of transform it is, the above formula is just a reformulation of the following equation. All I did was re-arrange the terms to express `newVal` on the left hand side of the equation so it is a function of all the other parameters: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wukZX.png) Is there a standard name for the remapping transformation?
