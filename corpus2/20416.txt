Although I've read on various websites until 2007-2008 that CS majors in decline, I don't understand why--I haven't entered the job market yet. Bruce Webster has an excellent chart regarding the topic: http://brucefwebster.com/2008/03/05/the-decline-in-computer-science-students/ What are some factors that lead to this decline? Is there still deficient amount of graduates? Are more people just skipping higher education altogether to get inside the industry? Does a "Software Design" major exit now? So many questions.
