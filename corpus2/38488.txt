I would like to use _Mathematica_ to perform an optimization of a portfolio composed by 10 stocks. I did the first part to compute yields and expected yields, but I don't know how to finish the optimization.               portf = {"AAPL", "BA", "IBM", "BMW.DE", "DIS", "R", "PEP", "BRBY.L", "AXP", "BTI"}          priceShift = FinancialData[#, "Price", {{2004}, {2011}, "Month"}][[All, 2]] & /@ portf      I am interested in the minimization of the portfolio variance (i.e. risk) for a given return.
