(I am affraid that this is a duplicate, but I read several already asked questions and non of them helped me. If it's already answered, please tell me) I have expressions like this               expr1=F1[0]*F2[3]*F3[2]+4I*F1[1]*F2[2]*F3[1]-2*F1[0]*F2[-2]*F3[2]     expr2=4*F1[0]*F2[2]*F3[1]-I*F1[1]*F2[0]*F3[-1]-1*F1[1]*F2[0]*F3[2]+2*F1[6]*F2[1]*F3[1]      in general the expression is always of this form               expr= c1*F1[z1]*F2[z2]*F3[z3]+c2*F1[z4]*F2[z5]*F3[z6]+c3*F1[z7]*F2[z8]*F3[z9] + ...      with c1,c2,c3 complex, and z1-z9 integers, and there can be arbitrary many F1*F2*F3-terms. Now I want to find the coefficients of this expressions. I tried               CoefficientList[expr, F2[__]*F3[__]*F4[__]]      but it didnt give any result. Now I found a semi-solutions (which works if all z>=0; by mapping each function call to a prime-power thus they are unambiguous):               exprnew = expr /. {F2[v2_] -> x^(2*v2), F3[v3_] -> x^(3*v3), F4[v4_] -> x^(5*v4)}     CoefficientList[exprnew, x]      **Best-Case:** I want               CoefList[expr] -> {c1,c2,c3}     CoefList[expr1] -> {1,4I,-2}     CoefList[expr2] -> {4,-I,-1,+2}      Thanks for help!!
