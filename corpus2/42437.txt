Basically I have the same question as here: Multiple NIntegrate but since I don't have enough "reputation" I cannot comment there. I want to solve the following multiple Integral numerically at given Points R, m:               Qb[R_, m_] := 3/m^2 + 8/(Sqrt[Pi] m)     NIntegrate[Exp[-c^2] (-4 m^2/(R Sqrt[Pi]) Integrate[     Exp[-x^2] x^2, {x, 0, Infinity}] - 2 m^2/(R Sqrt[Pi])     Integrate[Exp[-x^2] x^2 Integrate[If[R < Sqrt[c^2 + x^2 - 2 c x z],      R/Sqrt[c^2 + x^2 - 2 c x z], 1], {z, -1, 1}], {x, 0, Infinity}])     (3 c^2 - 2 c^4), {c, 0, Infinity}]      But I get error messages: _NIntegrate::inumr: "The integrand (3\ c^2-2\ c^4)\ E^-c^2\ (-44.7156-50.4562\ !(*SubsuperscriptBox[([Integral]), (0), ([Infinity])](*SuperscriptBox[(E), (-Power[ <<2>>])]\\ *SuperscriptBox[(x), (2)]\\ (*SubsuperscriptBox[([Integral]), (-1), (1)]If[Less[<<2>>], Times[<<2>>], 1] [DifferentialD]z) [DifferentialD]x))) has evaluated to non- numerical values for all sampling points in the region with boundaries {{[Infinity],0.}}."_ What is the right way to do this with Mathematica? Edit: To make the problem slightly simpler you can leave out all constants and get rid of the x-integration:               Qb[R_] :=      NIntegrate[     Exp[-c^2] NIntegrate[     If[R < Sqrt[c^2 - 2 c z], R/Sqrt[c^2 - 2 c z], 1], {z, -1, 1}],     {c, 0, Infinity}];     Qb[3.7]      or as an even simpler example               NIntegrate[NIntegrate[y, {x, 0, 1}], {y, 0, 1}]      In **this** case it works to replace the inner NIntegrate by Integrate, but if the inner integral is too complicated for analytic evaluation Mathematica cannot handle it.
