Can SQL queries be compiled into byte code or equivalent to enhance performance? I know that most database servers support prepared statements, but is that the same thing as compiling? Most applications have to prepare statements on run- time so there is no benefit of pre-compiled byte code. Since it's prepared each time the application runs. I'm also not referring to stored procedures, but strictly SQL statements you execute to get a result set.
