I am a college student, and I love to program, period. I code all kinds of things in different kinds of languages. Although I enjoy programming, I have an extremely hard time sticking to one project for a long time. I attribute this shortcoming to my high level of curiosity, exploring different technologies, languages, libraries, etc. What would be best? Should I settle down more and spend time on becoming an expert in one or two programming fields, or should I be more of a jack of all trades, trying out all kinds of new technologies, languages, programming methods, etc.? I'm guessing that somewhere in the middle would be best. I'm always amazed at how many developers are able to create one or two projects, and develop on them for years. What techniques do you guys employ to help you stay focused on a project?
