# Background Looking to separate lists of ingredients from instructions. Users scan recipes from 3x5 cards, magazines, cookbooks, etc. OCR software converts scanned images into plain text--typically a single text paragraph without line breaks (see below for an example). # Problem Users must manually separate the list of ingredients from the instruction text. I would like to automate this step as much as possible (perfection not required; reducing manual effort by 80% is a win). # Assets System assets include:   * 350 culinary verbs (e.g., cook, boil, mash)   * 400 equipment nouns (e.g., bowl, thermos, toothpick)   * 8300 normalized ingredient nouns (i.e., no plurals, no duplicates)   * Natural Language Processor that parses ingredients into quantity, measure, noun, and adjectives. # Ideas   * Use a neural network and unsupervised training   * Use Bayesian statistics to separate the ingredients from instructions   * Use word clustering with text mining techniques? # Question What algorithm(s) would provide the greatest accuracy to identify the most likely boundary between ingredient and instruction text? # Input Example input text produced by the OCR:               Maple-Roasted Parsnips with Pecans and Cranberries Earthy parsnips roasted until tender with cranberries, pecans and spices would make a nice side dish for roast pork, Cornish hen, turkey or chicken, baked ham, or baked salmon fillets.
