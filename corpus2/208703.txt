I have recently came across some code where the variable names are in french, I could not use google translate because only part of the code needs translated, and it would not be that practical to copy and paste each of the variables into the translator. How can i easily translate the variable names? what translator could i use? Here is some french that i tried to translate.               #include <stdio.h>          int main()     {         unsigned int nombre;         unsigned int diviseur;         unsigned int reste;              for (nombre = 2; nombre != 0; nombre++)         {             for (diviseur = 2, reste = 1; (diviseur < nombre) && (reste > 0); diviseur++)             {                 reste = nombre % diviseur;             }             if (reste > 0)             {                 printf("%d\n", nombre);             }         }              return;     }      But when i tried to translate the code using google translate i got this bad translation.               # include stdio.h          int main ()     {         unsigned int number;         unsigned int divisor;         unsigned int left;              for (count = 2, number = 0;! number + +)         {             for (divisor = 2, left = 1, (divisor <number) && (rest> 0) + + divider)             {                 remainder = number% divisor;             }             if (left> 0)             {                 printf ("% d \ n", count);             }         }              return;     }
