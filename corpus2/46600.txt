**This post has been edited heavily in response to the comments: my initial question was very confusing.** I am trying to write my game-theoretic model in _Wolfram Language_. There is only one remaining step and I am not sure if it is within reach of _Wolfram Language_ (or _Mathematica_ ). I describe a simplified version of my problem below. # Cournot game There are $M$ firms. Each firm $i$ can produce some output $q_i\geq0$ at a cost of $c_i$ per unit. Once the firms have (simultaneously) decided on their outputs, the price is set in the market according to an inverse demand function $P(Q)=\alpha-Q$, where $Q=q_1+\ldots+q_M$ is the aggregate output and $\alpha>0$ is market size parameter. Firm $i$'s profits are $q_iP(Q)-q_ic_i=q_i(\alpha-q_1-\ldots-q_M-c_i)$. Each firm maximizes its profits taking outputs of the opponents as given. By differentiating the profit function with respect to $q_i$ and imposing the necessary condition for maximizing a function, I obtain the equilibrium outputs: $$q_i^*=\frac{1}{2}\left(\alpha-\sum_{k\neq i}q_k^*-c_k\right) \text{ for } i=\{1,\ldots,M\}.$$ A quick derivation on the piece of paper gives me the explicit solution: $$q_i^*=\frac{1}{M+1}\left(\alpha-Mc_i+\sum_{k\neq i}c_k\right)$$ **Here's the thing: I would like to obtain exactly this result (the above equation) in _Mathematica_. Is it possible?** Note: I don't want to substitute any numbers for $M, c_1, \ldots, c_M$ or $\alpha$. They are general, exogenous parameters. In other words, the above problem boils down to inverting a $M\times M$ matrix of the form: $$\left[\begin{array}{cccc} 2 & 1 & \ldots & 1\\ 1 & 2 & \ldots & 1\\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ 1 & 1 & \ldots & 2 \end{array}\right].$$ Can one do this without specifying $M$? I hope I expressed myself clearer this time.
