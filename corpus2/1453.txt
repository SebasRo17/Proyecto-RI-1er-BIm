I'm querying a SQL database with `DatabaseLink` and resulting `SQLDateTime` objects are shifted by an hour during daylight saving time. The dates are stored in the database without a DST shift, so it seems like Mathematica is applying the change. How can I eliminate the spurious shift? A workaround, such as getting `AbsoluteTime`-style integers instead of `SQLDateTime` expressions would be fine.
