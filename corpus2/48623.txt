I have a rather simple question that has me flummoxed. Let's say I have two matrices:               m1 = {{a1, a2}, {b1, b2}};     m2 = {{u1, v1}, {u2, v2}};      I am looking to typeset `m1 Â± m2` similar to:               Text@TableForm[m1 + "\[PlusMinus]" m2 ]         * Works for the most part, but I want to remove the + sign from the output   * I also want to control the text sizes for the `m1` and `m2` independently so that the `a1`, `a2` etc appear in a larger text and `u1`, `v1` appear in a smaller text I tried:               Text@TableForm[m1 + "\[PlusMinus]" m2 ] /. "+" -> "x"      But that does not seem to work. Help much appreciated.
