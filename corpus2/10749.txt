I am trying to find roots of confluent hypergeometric function and I wonder if I can choose the initial guess by the choice of $\beta$.               eq[n_, \[Beta]_, \[Lambda]_] :=                                     Hypergeometric1F1[1/4 (2 - \[Lambda]/\[Beta]), n + 1, \[Beta]]     ED[n_, \[Beta]_, k_Integer: 1] := \[Lambda] /. FindRoot[eq[n, \[Beta], \[Lambda]] == 0,                                             {\[Lambda], (4 k - 2) \[Beta]}]      My goal is to plot the function (x-axis:$\beta$ and y-axis:$\lambda$). To do that, I need good $\lambda$-values for each $\beta$. The problem is that for each $\beta$ we can have lots of roots, so I want to choose $\beta$ depends on the previous $\lambda$-value for initial guess to find the next root. For example, Start from $\beta=0$. For $\beta=0$, I want to find a root, $\lambda$, around $BesselJZero[n,k]^2$. Next, For $\beta=1$, I want to get a root around $\lambda$-value at $\beta=0$. Then, for $\beta=2$, I want to get a root around $\lambda$-value at $\beta=1$ and so on. For the iterative way I think I should use "for loop" or "if", but I am not sure how to use it. Could you help me out? Thank you.
