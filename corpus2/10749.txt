What languages are more suited for long term projects ( _will have to be recompiled in 20 years, with the minimum amount of changes in the source code_ ), in terms of minimal amount of rewriting what's already written due to changing of the versions of the language & changing of compilers & OSs (i.e. backward compatibility), as far as we can judge from past references? (we can't tell what the future will bring, so no _predictions_ here - just base your answer on so far known ones) IMHO, yes, *nix oriented ones will have some advantage in here. For example,   Perl (good, AFAIK), vs.   Python (bad with it's v2.5 -> v3.x rather large backward compatibility breakup - it has also been said that back compatibility will not be kept in future versions). If you could explain your arguments as to why did you choose a particular language, along with what were the larger changes in it.
