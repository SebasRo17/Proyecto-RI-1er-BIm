### Historical context This year we have the 330-th anniversary of the Battle of Vienna \- one of the great formative events of European history, it took place on September 12, 1683. Kara Mustafa, Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire, had laid siege to the Hapsburg capital and was on the verge of capturing it when a relieving Christian army under the overall command of Jan III Sobieski, King of Poland, swept into the Turkish ranks. During the siege of Vienna by the Islamic power, before Sobieski's forces joined (on September 11) the rest of the Holy League, there had appeared a comet (later called Flamsteed) on the sky at the end of July and could be seen until September. ### Newton's Principia Mathematica on the comet In the third book of Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica Isaac Newton says: > The comet of 1683 (also according to the observations of Hevelius) at the > end of July, when it was first sighted, was moving very slowly, advancing > about $40'$ or $45'$ in its orbit each day. From that time its daily motion > kept increasing continually until 4 September when it came to about > $5^{\circ}$. Therefore in all this time the comet was approachin the earth. > This is gathered also from the diameter of the head, as measured with > micrometer, since Hevelius found it to be on 6 August only $6'5''$ including > the coma, but on 2 September $9'7''$. Therefore the head appeared far > smaller at the begining than at the end of the motion, as Hevelius also > reports. Accordingly in all this time, because of receding from the sun it > decreased with respect to its light, notwithstanding its approach to the > earth. ### Astronomical Data With help of built-in `AstronomicalData` we can easily draw the orbits of the comet and the first `4` planets:               Graphics3D[       {{#1, AstronomicalData[#2, "OrbitPath"]} & @@@          Transpose[{ {Orange, Green, Blue, Red}, Take[ AstronomicalData["Planet"], 4]} ],         {Magenta, Line[ AstronomicalData[                           AstronomicalData["CometC1683O1"], "OrbitPath"][[1, 28 ;; 195]]]}       }, Boxed -> False]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4RslT.gif) ### Question I'd like to find the exact date and time of the perigee of the Flamsteed comet and to inset points of locations (at that time) of the first $4$ planets on the graphics.
