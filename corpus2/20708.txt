I run a small Drupal consulting shop and we've been trying different groupware solutions for what seems like ages, yet nothing we've found seems to be a good fit.   * We don't need CRM-overkill such as SugarCRM offers -- it's just too much for our small size.   * We do need git integration (at a minimum, an easy way to associate commits with issues)   * Time tracking on configurable or 15m increments   * per-project issue tracking   * billing (incl. recurring billing for support contracts, etc)   * some sort of per-project notes/wiki for things like login credentials, client contact info, etc.   * Contact logging (Client foo called at 2:20pm and asked to add bar to the spec, signed addendum with pricing due to client NLT CoB today, to be returned by CoB tomorrow)   * Open source solutions are greatly preferred to closed ones   * **Most of all, it should be very efficient to use.** Several solutions just fell out of use here because they required too many clicks for simple, frequent tasks like logging time spent on an issue or noting a call from a client. It shouldn't take 20 minutes to make a note. **Edit:** I almost forgot to mention: we're a mixed Linux/Mac shop with no Windows users.
