I'm currently studing the behaviour of some integral for which I cant find an analytic solution. As this function depend on a vector on the unit sphere, I first defined it with 3 parameters before making a second one taking eulers angle and calling the first one. However, when I try to plot my function I don't get my result. Either :   * I get my first graph, and the worksheet resets   * Mathematica exits I'm using 9.0.1.0 on linux (Archlinux 3.13.6-1 x86_64) Here is my worksheet               w[a_, b_, c_] :=       NIntegrate[(a x + b y + c) (x^2 + y^2 + 1)^(-2)*        HeavisideTheta[a x + b y + c], {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1}]     w3D[theta_, phi_] :=       w[Sin[theta] Cos[phi], Sin[theta] Sin[phi], Cos[theta]]     w[0, 0, 1] + 4 w[0, 1, 0]          Plot[w3D[theta, 0], {theta, 0, Pi}]     Plot[w3D[theta, Pi/4], {theta, 0, Pi}]     Plot3D[w3D[theta, phi], {theta, 0, Pi}, {phi, 0, Pi/2}]      Edit: adding               PrecisionGoal -> 10, AccuracyGoal -> 5      to my Nintegrate solves the problem
