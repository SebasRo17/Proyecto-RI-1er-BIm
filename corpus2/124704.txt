We are wanting to have developers build an in-house payroll and time sheet application using symfony2/doctrine2. We are simply at conceptual stage at this point and this will be our first time and getting developers to build an application for our company. Hence, it is very important to us that we provide the most valid and important information to what will be our new developer team. What documents or tools should we provide to the new team to maximize the odds of success with the project and help the developers be productive from day dot?
