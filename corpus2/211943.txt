I've been working as a programmer for almost 3 years now. Goes without saying that this is the first job that I got as a programmer after graduating from college. Anyways, I went for an interview at another company feeling that I need to move on (2-3 yrs is about the norm for a programmer right?) and in the interview I started wondering... They asked me whether I had any experience in web services, I didn't. And they asked me a whole bunch of other server-side related experience and frankly I didn't know what they were talking about nor do I remember what they went on about. What I do at my current company is this: We have a few databases, I then write the code for the front end program (Vaadin) and the code to then connect to the databases and do all the necessary CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) functionality. And that's pretty much it... So what I'm wondering is, is this what the average developer does? Or is there more to it than what I'm doing? There's no way for me to know since this is my first developer job after all.
