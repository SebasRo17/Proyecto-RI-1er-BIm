How to effectively create a polygon that looks like a realistic inkblot? So far, I could come up with this (borrowing from Ed Pegg Jr.'s Rorschach demonstration):               RandomBlot[num_, opts___] := Module[{pts},        pts = RandomReal[{0, 1}, {num, 2}];        pts = pts[[Append[Last@FindShortestTour[pts, Method -> "TwoOpt"], 1]]];        Graphics[{Polygon@           Table[BSplineFunction[pts, SplineKnots -> "Clamped"][a], {a, 0, 1, 0.001}]}, opts]        ];          blot = RandomBlot[40, ImageSize -> 200, AspectRatio -> 1]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ibwxP.png) There are two problems with this:   * it is a bit slow due to `FindShortestTour`   * the blot contains corners being too sharp and has 'bays' reaching too far inward.  Compare it to a desired outcome: ![inkblot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/loyng.gif) **Update:** I should mention that it is not necessary to actually create a Rorschach-like image, so mirroring is not a requirement.
