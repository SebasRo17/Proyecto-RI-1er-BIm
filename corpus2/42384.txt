Here is a plot with the default frame ticks               S1 = Plot[Sin[x], {x, -7, 7}, Frame -> True, Axes -> False]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ejz2e.png) Now, if I define myself the range as well as the step separation of the left frame ticks by               S2 = Plot[Sin[x], {x, -7, 7},        Frame -> True,        FrameTicks -> {{Range[-1, 1, 0.2], Automatic}, {Automatic, Automatic}},        Axes -> False]      I get the following output ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OVoxs.png) Well, there are two obvious issues. First of all, 0 should be not be shown in CPU accuracy. Moreover, all ticks should have the same number of decimal digits so, -1. should be -1.0, 1. should be 1.0 and 0 should be 0.0. How can I get this?
