There are a lot of variants of the CSV "standard" (or lack thereof). I've never personally see any that use an escape character (like `\`) instead of surrounding each field with double quotes. Instead of `foo,bar,"foo,bar"` it would be `foo,bar,foo\,bar`. This would be handy for situations where a file needs to manually inspected or edited by hand. When counting commas to find the right field, it seems that it would be easier to tell which ones were not field separators if they escaped instead of quoted. I don't see how it would make a difference from a parsing perspective, though. Why quote instead of escape?
