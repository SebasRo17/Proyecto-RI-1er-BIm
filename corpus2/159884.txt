I work for an IT company as a developer. We are currently working on a large software project, a multi-vendor automatic database clustering solution. We've upheld good coding standards and as a result our code is highly modular and reusable. Many of the modules we've developed could be of great benefit to the open-source community. There are quite a few developers on our team that contribute to various open- source projects but so far we have not been successful with persuading the employer to consider open-sourcing some of the modules. A few of us decided that we'd like to contribute code to open-source community while at the same time develop code for the company. Since our employer is not sympathetic towards this cause, contributing code we write during work hours is probably not an option. We have decided to take an alternate approach, write code during our spare time that we can use for both the company and open-source community. We would like to know what are the caveats of this approach, pottential legal issues and whether someone has a similar experience so we could elaborate our plan further before putting it on the table at work.
