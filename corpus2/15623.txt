When it comes to "interview test" questions, the subject of FizzBuzz often comes up. There is also a Coding Horror post about it. Now, if you bother reading sites such as this, you are probably less likely to be in the demographic of programmers who would find FizzBuzz anything but trivial. But is it really true that 99% of programmers will struggle with it? Really? What is the evidence to back this up? Some real-life examples would be very helpful in answering this question.
