I am considering utilizing Python for creating an application. The purpose of this application is solely to interact with the Windows API. My question, therefore, is: Is PyWin32 mature and complete enough to be relied upon, or would I be better off doing this in C++? The reasons why I wanted to use Python are:   1. Easier access to coders   2. Easier to develop and maintain Python code than C++ code I saw that we are currently on Build 242 (or something) of PyWin32, which gives me exactly no idea about the maturity. I can see that there has been releases since 2004, though, but that does not really say a lot either.
