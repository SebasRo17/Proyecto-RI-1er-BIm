I'm never sure how quickly I should be adopting new technology. I often just don't until there is a need from a client, or I have a new project that makes it easy to just start with a new version. How often do others adopt new technology? Is there a reason to jump right in? Is there a good reason not to? Are there some good rules of thumb, or guidelines? Approaches?
