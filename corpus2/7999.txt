I would like to be able to define the gain function of a system from its parameters. Specifically, I'd like to define a function that accepts two inputs, call them $b$ and $w$, and returns a function that accepts a single parameter, $v$ and returns $1/\sqrt{(w^2 - v^2)^2 + b^2 v^2}$ . What's the right way to do this? Presumably I'd like to be able to write               gain[b,w][v]      to evaluate the function, with parameters b and w, at v. But I'd also like to be able to write               f[v_] = gain[b,w]      and have `f[v]` be the same as `gain[b,w][v]`.
