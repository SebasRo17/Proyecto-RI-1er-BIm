I am trying to reproduce the following graph on Jensen's inequality for the probabilistic case (source: wikipedia) but with   * the exponential function as Y,   * the normal distribution on the X-axis and therefore    * the log-normal distribution on the Y-axis coming out or the transformation. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ADQ42.png) I am not really a well versed user of Mathematica and here I don't have any idea whatsoever how to achieve the task. Thank you for your help. **EDIT** : To be more specific: I know how to plot the original distribution. What I don't know is how to turn the resulting distribution around by 90Â° in the same diagram.
