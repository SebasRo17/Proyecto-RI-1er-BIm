I am developing an open source program which for my school project. I have done some research on it, but there are still few questions. It is a school project, it is not any advance application and I am willing to share my work.   1. Is that mean if I release my program with license, people will afraid to change my code because it may result in law sue?   2. Can I claim my product as "open source" if I don't have license, I can define some rule of it (but without law protection)?   3. Do i have to apply for those license (e.g. GNU), I have to submit my product code or only fulfill in a form?
