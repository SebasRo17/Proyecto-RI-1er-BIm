I have got a file with field values (RF simulation of a resonator) which consists of 3 columns: `X` and `Y` cartesian coordinates and the field value `E(X, Y)` with 9500 rows. The problem is that my external field simulation software is not able to print the required field on a regular mesh (polar or cartesian map) as shown below: > >       -15.00000      -26.00000   345000.00000 >        15.00000      -26.00000   361000.00000 >        12.20000      -27.40000   490000.00000 >       -12.20000      -27.40000   583000.00000 >        -9.27000      -28.50000  1050000.00000 >         9.27000      -28.50000  1140000.00000 >        16.50000      -28.60000   436000.00000 >       -16.50000      -28.60000   491000.00000 >         6.24000      -29.30000  1520000.00000 >        -6.24000      -29.30000  1730000.00000 >         3.14000      -29.80000  2110000.00000 >   My goal is to create from the data above an interpolated surface from which I could generate a nice field matrix with a certain resolution. My first idea was to use Gnuplot for this job so the scatter plot looks like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YMCVO.png) ..and then interpolation of the field points on a regular grid like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/EzSmc.png) However, Gnuplot is great but it cannot write this interpolated field back into a file for further post processing. Now I am trying to apply the same procedure in Mathematica (ver 9) For this, I wrote the following simple commands:               stream = OpenRead["~/efields/em.dat"];          data = ReadList[stream, {Number, Number, Number}];          f = Interpolation[data];          ListPointPlot3D[{x, y, f[x, y]},        {x, Min[data[[All, 1]]], Max[data[[All, 1]]]},        {y, Min[data[[All, 2]]], Max[data[[All, 2]]]}]       Unfortunately this did not work and _Mathematica_ returned with 2 error messages: > Interpolation::udeg: Interpolation on unstructured grids is currently only > supported for InterpolationOrder->1 or InterpolationOrder->All. Order will > be reduced to 1. >>   >  ListPointPlot3D::nonopt: "Options expected (instead of {y,-480.,-26.}) > beyond position 1 in * Can anybody provide some support hints on this issue. Lets start with the basic:   1. How to plot the data correctly as scatter plot ?   2. How to create a surface from the randomly distributed field values ?
