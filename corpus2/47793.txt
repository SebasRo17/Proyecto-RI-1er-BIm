I have a system of differential equations which are in the form               Dt[a01,t] + u*Dt[a01,x] + v*Dt[a01,y] + w*Dt[a01,z]      I have ten of these equations and my variables inside the derivatives are a01 through a10 (with some exceptions). In general, in any equation, I have all four derivatives (t, x, y, and z). I'd like to be able to extract the coefficient matrices so that I can write my system of equations in the form $$ \delta a/\delta t + A_x \delta a /\delta x + A_y \delta a/\delta y + A_z \delta a/\delta z $$ where "a" is my vector of variables. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
