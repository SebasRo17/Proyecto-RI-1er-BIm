In below code i placed internal style sheet with in body tag, instead of having in head. For Single-Page-Application I am considering to do this for styles that is only applicable to that page alone, rather than having separate pagespecific.css file. Is there a scenario where this has downside as i am not putting the same in head section?               <!-- myPartial.html starts here -->      <!-- Like to keep styles unique to this html right here in this file -->      <div>       <style>         body { background-color: red; }         #myText { color: white; }       </style>            <span id='myText'>Hello</span>     </div>     <!-- myPartial.html ends here -->
