Learning how to develop a small embedded HTTP server for a class assignment, and the examples given on how to use `com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer` use an `InetSocketAddress` which extends `SocketAddress` as the link between client and server. However, all of my previous network programming assignments used `Socket` and `ServerSocket` to create raw connections between a server and client to send custom protocols back and forth. Clearly these two classes are different as they don't share any common ancestor other than `java.lang.Object`. What is inherently special about each that makes them fundamentally different?
