**Background info** ( _May Skip_ ): I am working on a task we have been set at uni in which we have to design a grammar for a DSL we have been provided with. The grammar must be in BNF or EBNF. As well as other thing we are being evaluated on the Lexical rules in the grammar and the Parsing rules - such as if rules are suitable for the language subset, how comprehensive these rules are, how clear the rules are ect. What I don't understand is if these rules are covered in a grammar defined in BNF (it's a new topic for us). **The Question** : Does a grammar for a given language that has been defined in either BNF or EBNF contain / provide rules for **_Lexical Analysis_** and/or **_Parsing_**? ( _or do these have to be specified else-where?_ ) Also what would be considered a lexical rule? And what would be considered a parsing rule?
