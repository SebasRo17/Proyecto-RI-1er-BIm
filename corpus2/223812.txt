I would like to know what should be the best way to keep data on a server related to the following points:   * **Chat** logs   * **Heavy text content**   * **User references** like amounts of ids (1,4,14,524,23220,...) I'm using **PHP** and a **mysql** database but as obvious I know the topics above don't go well into mysql at large scale and maneuvering. So I would like to know how ( **no, i'm not asking for your work, just your 3-line orientation** ) exactly should I keep the data :) * * * Ok basically I keep my users in a sql table and another only for their friendships in which I have a field containing references related, _allegedly_ , to chat logs. Now the thing is I don't actually understand whether I should have that content in a file, keep the file path in that sql field and then retrieve the file when needed, parse it and display it to the user or keep it in a database such as mongodb, raven, couch because I've never used no-sql database and wanted to know of experienced people on it. Same goes for the **heavy text content** and user references. For example, in my users table I have a field containing its friends in the following manner 1,4,5,6,14,51,... and since I've been told this is bad practice and **certainly** should be used whilst dealing with large amounts of data that would need to be changed constantly I came here in a hopeful act of guidance and enlightment.
