Are design patterns (e.g. factory pattern, observer, etc...) required to be known to write good code? I often have no idea of what people mean when they talk about _inserting pattern name here_ pattern and sometimes I realize I‘ve implemented that pattern without knowing it even had a name. I‘m a self-taught programmer so I try to learn about patterns as I go, but are they necessary? I find them over-engineered sometimes, like just fancy design concepts that programmers sometimes overestimate and force themselves to use them even if they can write clean and working code that is however not a common pattern.
