Regression coefficients are the constant that indicate the rate of change in one variable as a function of change in another. Standardised regression coefficients are the same, but refer to a change in number of standard deviations. Using LinearModelFit and the "ParameterTable" property I am able to obtain unstandardised regression coefficients (parameter estimates), but I would like to know if there is a also a way to quickly obtain standardised regression coefficients. What I am currently doing:               model = LinearModelFit[data, x, x]     model["ParameterTable"]
