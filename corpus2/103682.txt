I'm not so much looking for code (although if you want to link to tutorials it would be appreciated) as I am trying to get an idea of what people in the know are doing. Our system is written in PHP. As part of an Electronic Medical Record System, I need to be able to **securely** exchange documents (Word, PDF, etc.) with business partners. I also need to transmit identifying information with the documents (patient name, medical record number, etc.) If I Google exchanging files in a web service, I am given a bunch of information about a variety of methods. But, what's not easy to see is how old the information is, how commonly the methods are used, and if there is something out there that if I just knew what I was looking for, would blow my socks off. TLDR - If you were going to use a web service to exchange files, and your system was written in PHP, how would you go about doing it, and why?
