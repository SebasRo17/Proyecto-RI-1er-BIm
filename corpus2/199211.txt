I have a picture that I elaborate with my program to obtain a list of coordinates. There is a matrix represented in the image. In an ideal test I would get only the sixteen central points of each square of the matrix. But in actual tests I have some noise points. I want to use an algorithm to extrapolate from the list of the coordinates the group formed by 16 coordinates that best represent a matrix.   * Example of found points:   ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HhriV.png)   * Example of desired result:   ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WfCHq.png) How to do this? Note: The matrix in the image can be rotated a little too, so a rotation- independent algorithm would be great.
