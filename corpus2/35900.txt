I was thinking about hosting my private project on my server (i may use 'gitolite') and have a copy on my local machine as backup (git clone then automated git fetch every few minute). I want to know what happens if there is a bug gitolite or somewhere else on my server and the source code and git repository has been tampered with? Will my backup also be corrupted? will i easily be able to revert the source using the history?
