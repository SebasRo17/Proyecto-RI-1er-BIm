If I do `.1 + .1 + .1` in Python, I get `0.30000000000000004`. (I am not asking about Python in particular, and do not want Python specific answers.) The only problem I can see with this is `0.30000000000000004 != 0.3`, so I need to take care in how I compare floats. Are there any other problems I need to be aware of with float rounding? I can't imagine that last digit being much of a problem in real life. For example, if I ask for a "0.30000000000000004 meter metal rod", I'm not going to later complain that "this rod is 0.00000000000000004 meters too long!" (I can just cut the extra off, right? :) Even with a lot of float calculations going on, I can't imagine the rounding getting so far off that it matters. Am I missing something? When do floating point rounding errors really matter?
