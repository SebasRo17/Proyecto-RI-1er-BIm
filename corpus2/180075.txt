I am developing a rather eye-candy application which is to be released on Mac App Store. Due to its graphics intensive use, it would save a great deal of time on UI end if the app could be released with a fixed size main frame-dialog. I did try doing a search regarding App Store policies on the matter but could not find anything. Is the distribution of fixed-size frame [productivity] apps are allowed within the App Store if they conform with other design guidelines?
