I have a cost function that depends on 4 parameters: `CostFunction[{tx,ty,tz,ox}]`. I used `NMinimize[]` function with `SimulatedAnnealing` method to determine its minimum. I looked for an example that uses the `InitialPoints` option but I did not find any. For this reason I am posting my question. My code is like this (I cannot post the `CostFunction[]`):                 NMinimize[{             CostFunction[{tx, ty, tz, ox}],             tx >= 0 && tx <= a, ty >= 0 && ty <= b, tz >= 0 && tz <=c, ox >=0 && ox <= d},       {tx,ty,tz,ox},       Method -> {"SimulatedAnnealing", "PerturbationScale" -> 3, "SearchPoints" -> 10}]       The above code works correctly but when I add the `"InitialPoints"->{0,0,0,0}`, I receive the following error: > `NMinimize::parchange: "Inappropriate parameter: \!\(\"InitialPoints\"\) -> > {0,0,0,0}, changed to Automatic"` Another option is not very clear `"RandomSeed"` ? What is wrong, please?
