I have a structure of folders.   1. Main Directory( has init.m, and name.m files)   2. Subfolders under Main directory      1. library ( has the packages, pacakge1.m, package2.m)     2. Data (some xcel sheets and other data files) The init.m has the following commands `Get[FileNameJoin[{NotebookDirectory[],"library", "Package1.m"}]]; Get[FileNameJoin[{NotebookDirectory[],"library", "Package2.m"}]];` Package1 has `function1` and `function2` definitions. Package2 has `function3` and `function4` definitions. The Names.m file has the following the commands               Get[FileNameJoin[{NotebookDirectory[],"init.m"}]];     DeclarePackage["Package1`",{"function1", "function2"}];     DeclarePackage["Package2`",{"function3", "function4"}]      After evaluating the name.m file, I was expecting that calling `function1` should execute the `Package1`function1`. However it is not happening. This is what I understand of _Mathematica_ so far. I don't want to touch the init.m file in the Autoload folder of the userbase directory as I don't want to modify the contents. I just want my init.m in the local folder to run. Workarounds anyone?
