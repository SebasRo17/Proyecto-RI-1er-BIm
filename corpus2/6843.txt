Suppose I have               v[x_] = (1.453 Sech[x + 1])^2 + I  Sech[x + 1] Tanh[x + 1]      And I have to solve the equation:               mu1 u1[x] - u1''[x] - v[x] u1[x] == 0      for `u1[x]`. The conditions that are given are:               u1[-2] == 1, u1'[-2] == 0 .      I have tried `DSolve` but it shows errors: > Solve::inex: Solve was unable to solve the system with inexact coefficients > or the system obtained by direct rationalization of inexact numbers present > in the system. Since many of the methods used by Solve require exact input, > providing Solve with an exact version of the system may help. How can I Solve this equation in Mathematica symbolically?
