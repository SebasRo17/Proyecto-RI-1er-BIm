I need to calculate the area enclosed in a two-dimensional listplot and following an answer to a similar question I tried this way:               imgnorm = (mnorm =      MorphologicalComponents[      Erosion[Binarize[        ListLinePlot[{list}, ImageSize -> Large, Axes -> False]],        0.5]]) // Colorize          listareas = {area1 = 1/. ComponentMeasurements[{mnorm, imgnorm}, "Area"], area2 = 2/. ComponentMeasurements[{mnorm, imgnorm}, "Area"]}      It works fine, however it is not precise enough for what I need to do because part of the area is taken by the black line. The list is quite big and the points don't form a polygon. EDIT: Here is the plot: ![list plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DOsRf.jpg) Any help would be appreciated, thank you in advance.
