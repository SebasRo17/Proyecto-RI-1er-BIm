I am trying to improve the backup situation for my application. I have a Django application and MySQL database. I read an article suggesting backing up the database in Git. On the one hand I like it, as it will keep a copy of the data and the code in sync. But Git is designed for code, not for data. As such it will be doing a lot of extra work diffing the MySQL dump every commit, which is not really necessary. If I compress the file before storing it, will git still diff the files? (The dump file is currently 100MB uncompressed, 5.7MB when bzipped.) Edit: the code and database schema definitions are already in Git, it is really the data I am concerned about backing up now.
