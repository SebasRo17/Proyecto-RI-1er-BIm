Where I work, we currently have three teams all working on one product. We've had some talks and agreed that there could be a lot of benefits to doing an 'exchange' program where a member of one team would work with the members of another team, for a period of time (min: 1 day, max: 1 week). Considering we already pair program (almost) 100% of the time, the 'exchanged' programmer won't be completely lost and there wouldn't be a large drop in productivity. Goals of the program would be:   * Exposure to new tools/libraries   * Getting to know your coworkers   * Making all developers more versatile between teams Everyone is pretty excited about the idea, but we're having trouble with how to organize the logistics of such a program. Has anyone instituted something like this and if so what helped you organize it? _Edit_ Specifically looking for examples of:   * How often do you exchange   * Tips on keeping track of exchanges/scheduling   * If you've done such a program, how has it worked out for you? Would you have liked more 'process' or keep it ad hoc?
