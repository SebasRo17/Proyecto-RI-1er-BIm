One of my team members consistently avoids making comments in his code. His code is not self-documenting, and other programmers have a difficult time understanding his code. I have asked him several times to comment his code, however he just gives excuses or claims that he will do it later. His concern is that adding comments will take too much time and delay the projects. What argument can I present to him to convince him to properly document his code? On that note, am I wrong to focus on the code comments or is this indicative of a larger problem which should be addressed?
