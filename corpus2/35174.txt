I have an ODE system I'd like to specify as a vector equation in `NDSolve`. I'm not clear on how to use `WhenEvent` for a system specified in this way. Ultimately I'd like `WhenEvent` to change the value of one of the state variables in the vector equation when it reaches a threshold. For example, the following code doesn't work because `WhenEvent[y[t]==0, ...]` is applying a conditional test to a list of values. Replacing this with `y[t][[1]]==0` also doesn't work.               sol = NDSolve[{y'[t] == {{.1, -.2}, {-.1, .2}}.y[t], y[0] == {1, 1},       WhenEvent[y[t] == 0, y[t] -> 1]}, y, {t, 0, 10}]      Ideas anyone?
