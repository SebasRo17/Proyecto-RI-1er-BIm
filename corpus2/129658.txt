What was the first programming environment (probably language) to use the words "boxing" and "unboxing" to indicate encapsulating a primitive type in some kind of wrapper to allow it to be used in more object-y contexts? (Or something like it.) (I recently noticed that "boxing" is a very critical concept in the J programming language, and so I suspect it may be from APL. A coworker of mine thinks it might be from LISP.)
