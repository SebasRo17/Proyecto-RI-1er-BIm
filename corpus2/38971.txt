Sometimes I run into a situation when there are graphics objects (mostly plots) that take a while to draw. Good practice would suggest you do all your evaluation outside `Plot` or whatever other plotting function, but sometimes one forgets or it is the drawing process that takes so much time. So **the question is** whether it is possible to change things such as `PlotLabel` font, `PlotStyle` or other strictly aesthetic properties of the plot without asking Mathematica to recalculate all the points.
