I generated a spline function called `f` using the `BSplineFunction` with domain `{t,0,1}`.               f = BSplineFunction[{{0., 5.81152}, {-0.909122, 5.73997}, {-1.86805, 5.5031},        {-1.79586, 5.52709}, {-2.40811, 5.28912}, {-3.4109, 4.70527}, {-4.68131,   3.501},        {-4.93131, 2.99958}, {-5.09697, 2.6673}, {-5.34697, 2.16588}, {-5.59697, 1.66446},        {-5.84697, 1.16304}}, SplineWeights -> {10, 10, 10, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 10, 10, 10}]      I then wanted to find the point at which the function intersects the line from which points used to generate the spline were taken from. Graphically, I know the intersection occurs within the domain of `f`.               k[t_] = {-4.93131 - 0.915666 t, 2.99958 - 1.83654 t}      However, running the code:               FindRoot[First[k[0]] == First[f[t]], {t, .5, 0, 1}]      where `k[0]` is the end of the line produces a negative number. Is there a way to solve for the meeting points of those two functions?
