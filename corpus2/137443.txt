I'm a PHP developer with familiarity with Rails and a focus on MVC development. My company is moving more and more to SharePoint and I feel I need to learn to build application within the SharePoint system. I have some brief introduction to C# but that's about it. I've used some SharePoint Designer and the web interface but not that heavily (most of my "development" so far for SharePoint has been html/css/javascript page manipulation in SPDesigner). What, and in what order should I be learning to eventually develop applications for SharePoint? Also, any good resources for each step?
