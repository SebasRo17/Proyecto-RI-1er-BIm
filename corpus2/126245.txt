I am writing an uber simple blogging platform. The application reads a set of static files that are the articles in the blog, and serves them up. The **only** time any content on the site will change is when a new article is added, or an existing article is changed. I intend to load 100% of the content into the applications memory, and only update it if the static files are changed. I.e. a permanent cache. For a simple blog, the static files are never going to amount to more than a few MB, so application memory wont be a problem. Are there any reasons not to do this? And why do blogging (/other) platforms with content that only changes at set intervals not use this method?
