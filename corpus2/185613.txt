Say I have a typical MVC setup. The controller passes on some input to the model, and asks it to do something with it. But the validation of the data fails, or there is some other problem. What's the best way of getting these errors passed back to the controller, which will then pass them to the view to be displayed to the user? At the moment, I just have an `errors` array in my model. When any errors occur, I simply add the error messages to this array, and `return false` to the controller, so it knows that errors occurred. And in the controller, I do this:               boolean result = model.process( input );          if (! result)     {        view.displayErrors( model.getErrors() );        return;     }     else        view.displaySuccess();      Is there a better way of handling this?
