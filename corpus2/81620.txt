I'm looking to add serious scripting into my Java app and JavaScript would be a great language choice. My concern though is the Rhino project and its future. While Groovy/Jruby etc have seen constant updates, and engines like V8 and SpiderMonkey make continuous and significant performance boosts; Rhino languishes with its last release in March '09. I've seen some work on hacking Rhino:   * Great Thundering Rhinos! presentation from Oracle   * Explore and implement JDK7 InvokeDynamic Google Summer of Code project But nothing solid about actually merging this code into the project and getting an active committer community around it. What is the Rhino road map? For example, is there any plan to bring `invokedynamic` to the Rhino world?
