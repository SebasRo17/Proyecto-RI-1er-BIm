I tried to search if similar questions existed but I have not found anything. Can someone help me with this code?               Plot[Normal[Series[Cos[x], {x, 0, 4}]], {x, 0, 3}]       I am getting an error message               General::ivar: 0.00006128571428571428` is not a valid variable. >>      I would like to plot a series expansion... Thanks in advance. Regards, Umberto PS This is a very reduced piece of the work I am working on, just to be able to reproduce the error...
