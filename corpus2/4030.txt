There are many ways to extract different parts of lists in Mathematica. For example, the first part of a list `v` can be accessed either as `v[[1]]` or `First[v]` or `Take[v,1]`. Likewise the last element can be accessed as `v[[-1]]`, `Last[v]` or `Take[v,-1]`. Similarly `v[[2;;]]` is equivalent to `Rest[v]` and to `Drop[v,1]`, and `v[[;;-2]]` is equivalent to `Most[v]` and `Drop[v,-1]`. The more specialized functions `First`, `Last`, `Rest` and `Most` are marginally more efficient. On the other hand, it makes sense to use the more general `Part` (`[[ ]]`) or `Take`/`Drop` if it is part of a calculation that also requires parts to be accessed that do not have a specialist function. Beyond these considerations, are there any reasons to prefer `Part` over `Take`/`Drop` or the more specialized functions, other than personal preferences over coding style?
