http://babelstone.blogspot.com/2005/11/how-many-unicode-characters-are- there.html says there are 1 million unicode characters and around 240k of which are already assigned. 1 million > 240k > 65k However, http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.visualbasic.strings.chrw says that chrw accept 65k characters. Not only that chrw accept integer. Integer is 4 bytes in vb.net right and can store way more than 65k characters. The numbers do not match up and so what am I missing?
