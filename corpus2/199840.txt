I came across this question in a textbook, but there are no solutions and I'm not sure how to solve this. The question is: Suppose Host A wants to send a large file to Host B. The path from Host A to Host B has three links of rates R1=500Kb/s, R2=2Mb/s and R3=1Mb/s. Assuming that there is another busy flow that travels through the same set of links (say from Host C to Host D), what will be the throughput for this file transfer? I know that the throughput for no traffic would be the min(R1, R2, R3), so would the throughput with traffic be the max(R1, R2, R3)?
