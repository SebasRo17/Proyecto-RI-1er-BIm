I'm working on a large project and I would like to put together some technical documentation for other members of the team and for new programmers joining the project. What sort of documentation should I have? Just `///` code comments or some other file(s) explaining the architecture and class design? I've never really done documentation except the occasional word doc to go with smaller apps, and I think this project is too large to doc in a single word file.
