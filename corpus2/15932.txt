> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Setting the default font for PlotLegends Using version 9 The option setting for `LabelStyle` in plots (I've tried this in `Plot[]`, `DateListPlot[]`, and `ListLinePlot[]`) doesn't appear to affect `PlotLegends[]` at least the way I've tried it:               Plot[{Sin[x], Cos[x]}, {x, 0, 10},       LabelStyle -> (FontFamily -> "Helvetica Neue"),       PlotLegends -> {"Sin", "Cos"}]          Plot[{Sin[x], Cos[x]}, {x, 0, 10},       LabelStyle -> (FontFamily -> "Helvetica Neue"),       PlotLegends -> {"Sin", "Cos", LabelStyle -> (FontFamily -> "Helvetica Neue")}]      Both sets of code give the exact (to an eye) output: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UHyWk.png) Note the legend font remains in some default (TimesNewRoman) setting, where everything else in the plot properly goes to "Helvetica Neue". I've also tried wrapping `Style[]` around each of the legend names to no avail. Any thoughts on how to do this or work around it? * * * I stumbled upon a workaround, but it doesn't seem very elegant to me so I remain open to other solutions:               Plot[{Sin[x], Cos[x]}, {x, 0, 10},       LabelStyle -> (FontFamily -> "Helvetica Neue"),       PlotLegends ->        SwatchLegend[{"Sin",          "Cos"}, {LabelStyle -> (FontFamily -> "Helvetica Neue")}]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mU7Tf.png)
