Why does `Epilog->Inset` crop the first and last letters here ("a" and "g") when `FontSize` is set to large values (which varies with font family):               Plot[Cos[t], {t, -32 Pi, 32 Pi}, AspectRatio -> 1/4, PlotRange -> All,       Axes -> True, ImageSize -> 600,       Epilog ->        Inset[Graphics@         Text[Style["a   b   c   d   e   f   g", FontSize -> 30]], {0, 0}]      ]      This renders as: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mBAew.png) Are there options or a hack which still uses `Epilog -> Inset`, as opposed to using `Show` and passing the text as `Graphics` (which works correctly)?
