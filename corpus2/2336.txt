I'm looking for a good reference/book on programming neural networks in mathematica. I've been working through Freeman's "Simulating Neural Networks with Mathematica," but it is from 1994 so is quite dated. Is anyone familiar with a more recent book on the subject? For background, I'm very comfortable with pure mathematics, somewhat comfortable with general programming, and have been teaching myself to be proficient in mathematica. I'd like to play around with implementing neural networks on mathematica for use in forecasting of high frequency economic data, so anything with a finance bent is an especially welcome reference.
