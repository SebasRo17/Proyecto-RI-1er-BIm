In a new winform app that I am still preparing, I got the idea that I could by sponsored or have some kind of logos of companies that want to place they logos there. The application is for sports training and completion management, carrier management, etc. As any one seen something like this? How can it be done? How can I interest the companies to sponsor the app? UPDATE ----------------------------------------- I have canceled this one. I asked a coupled of client of mine that deal daily with sponsors, and they make you do stupid thing in your project. Dow it would be nice to have some extra cask to lower the price of the App, and be able to get more market. I will pass this one out. The only intromissions I like in my projects come from the people o actually use it every day.
