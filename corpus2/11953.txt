If I have some function I know numerically only, say f(x) and each point $x$ takes significant time to compute so I have them all stored in some file as f(1)=0.232423, f(1.1)=0.3243432,....Then is it possible to tell NIntegrate only sample on the grid x=1,1.1,1.2,1.3...... and try to integrate this function? Then is the best method to keep refining my grid (gathering more and more data in my file) until the result of integration stops changing?
