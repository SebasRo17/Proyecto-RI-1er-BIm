We have a stream of points with about 1000 points per second. For each point, we have a complex vector (hundreds of dimensions). Our goal, for each point is to link it to the 5 closest points that we've already seen. We determine "closest" by computing a distance (euclidian or other) between 2 points. Obviously, in a perfect world we would have enough money and time to compute the distance between a new point with each of the points we've already seen and it would keep the 5 closest. The world is not perfect and we're looking for a solution. Has anyone worked with this before?
