Question -- I currently have a large monolithic Java application which I am working to break up into services components. One of the components I want to separate out is the service which handles and presents users and profiles. Currently the core service uses a MySQL backend and is written in Java, and is only hosted on one set of servers (web, app, db). My primary goal is to get the user/profile service to be n+ scalable across multiple web, and app servers and trying to figure out a way to do it across the database layer. What are some of the best practices to achieve high scalability with this environment? (We currently have a few million users, but expect to grow past that). Thanks!
