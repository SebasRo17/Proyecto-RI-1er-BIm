Are there any packages that allow the simulation of Bayesian Networks with Mathematica? I found what seemed to be a promising package (Dynamics) on a Brown University URL, http://www.cs.brown.edu/research/ai/dynamics/tutorial/Mathematica/ReadMe with an example notebook here http://www.cs.brown.edu/research/ai/dynamics/tutorial/Documents/GraphicalModels.html but unfortunately it seems that it is not included on their public FTP server. Thanks in advance...
