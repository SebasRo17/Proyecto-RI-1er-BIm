What does "toolkit design" mean and what are the basic steps to design a toolkit for a specific task/project? It appears in a task description which says: "This task deals with the design of detailed specification of the various tools that are employed in order to implement [insert some development task here]" So what I understand is that: it's required to design and provide the specifications of a toolkit which will be used for doing some specific tasks. But how is toolkit design done? Searching Google hardly gives any meaningful result. They are mostly about "design toolkits" which is not what I'm looking for. For example this guy has designed a software toolkit in some of his previous projects http://logonpro.com/resume.doc
