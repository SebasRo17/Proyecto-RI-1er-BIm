I've recently joined a company where I'm working as the scrum master on an agile development project building a web app. The team is just about to be the maximum size for an agile team (expecting 9 next week). We have talked about potentially splitting the team into two teams, not so much to shorten standups (which aren't excessive at the moment) but to stop people from being completely bored in sprint planning sessions (which again aren't excessively long). There are two very distinct layers to the project - high technical backend dev (like seriously complex), and UI design/build/integration. It seems that when the backend guys are talking technical the UI guys zone out, and vice versa. It seems like the logical way to split the team if only to be more time efficient, but I have one massive reservation in that all I might really be doing is reducing collaboration and knowledge sharing. The two teams just won't really have a good idea about what the rest of the team are building. Does anyone have any experience in dealing with something like this?
