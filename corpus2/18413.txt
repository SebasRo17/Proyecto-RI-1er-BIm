I would like to export a phrase to my result data as a heading. I'm exporting the data correctly with                Export["file.dat", table].       But I'm doing several simulations with different parameters and I would like to write down this parameters in the file. I'm trying with                Write["file.dat", {"Resonance simulation Data =", DateString[], "Parametros: Nz = ", Nz, " CP = ", CP, " K1 = ", K1}];       but this erases the precedent data if it's put after the `Export` or it is erased if it came before. How could I do this?
