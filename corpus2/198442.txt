I have a database sanitizing function that I use when the user enters some data into my website. I escaping the mysqli characters with mysqli_real_escape_string(), but I wish to also output the content with htmlspecialchars(). The problem is, let's just say the user enters something with a single quote; that will be escaped by the sanitize function and will be output as \'. Is there any way to store it like that, and then output it as '?
