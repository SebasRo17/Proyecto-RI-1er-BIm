I'm in the initial planning phase of a re-write project and I'm deciding between silverlight/silverlight oob/wpf. TL;DR at the end. It's a LOB app that handles leads/customers/appointment calendars. Not too complicated. I'm independently researching these options elsewhere, but I thought I'd ask around. Some rough initial requirements/foreseeable problems are: I have to be able to call an exe on the system with commandline args (sip phone). > Makes SL a problem The userbase is distributed and I want to limit the traffic that goes over the wire as much as possible and avoid some nasty concurrency issues > I can see this being a problem using WPF Software deployment/updating has to be _dead simple_. Some users are highly non-technical (see: 70 years old, on a computer for the first time) > This isn't a huge problem now with the ClickOnce app we are replacing, and I > have control over the machines that it gets used on. However, it's simpler > for users if they don't even have to click the clickonce "Install" button. I > don't know how this is handled with Silverlight OOB. The company is planning a hard expansion in 12 months so hardware deployment should be fast/easy. The idea is to get an internet connection at a new location, plug in some computers and be able to work without the need for dedicated IT people or server setup. > Makes SL appealing Integration with other services (financial software, asterix server) isn't an immediate goal, but it is an eventual goal to be part of the system. This is made much simpler/more efficient if a single service is setup to integrate with those secondary services and doesn't have to transfer all of that data over the wire > Makes SL appealing Making multiple 'versions' is out the window. I don't know what it's like maintaining a silverlight + silverlight oob version (if there's even any problems) > Might make WPF a better option. TL;DR: From my vantage point, a silverlight app makes the best sense for 90% of the users - the other 10% can't use it because they need to run an exe. Silverlight OOB might be a happy middleground but I don't know at the moment what the execution model for it is like (is there still a concept of server- side code? If so, that would possibly be ideal) and I don't know how deployment/updating works for it.
