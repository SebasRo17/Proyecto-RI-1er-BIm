I have a set of data that looks like `{{x1, y1, z1}, {x2, y2, z2}, ...}` so it describes points in 3D space. I want to make a heatmap out of this data. So that points with a high density are shown as a cloud and marked with different colors dependend of the density. In fact, I want the result of this script just for 3D:               data = RandomReal[1, {100, 2}];     SmoothDensityHistogram[data, 0.02, "PDF", ColorFunction -> "Rainbow", Mesh -> 0]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/VoXLo.png)
