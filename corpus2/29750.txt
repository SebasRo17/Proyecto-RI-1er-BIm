The following code returns the first three integer elements of `Sqrt[Range[100]]`:               Cases[Sqrt[Range[100]], _Integer, 2, 3]     {1, 2, 3}      The following code looks like the preceding code but returns a different result:               Cases[Sqrt[Range[100]], _Integer, {2}, 3]     {2, 3, 5}      As we can see in the following picture, the argument `{2}` is not documented (it has no braces in the documentation): ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/r0OZG.png) What does the second code with `{2}` instead of `2` mean?
