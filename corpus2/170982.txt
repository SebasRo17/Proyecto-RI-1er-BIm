I'd like to write a program in java (not a servlet, not jsp, not a webapp) which allows me to do simple things, such as connecting to a FB account and retrieve the status or posts on the wall. I know facebook no longer supports official JavaAPI, so I was wondering what are the best (and most simple, being the program very basic) unofficial api out there. If possible, i would also like some example-code. searching through the web, I've read that you need two secret keys to create a facebook application, and I have not a fb account. Is it indispensable to have an account? thank you everyone
