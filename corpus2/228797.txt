I'm a freelancer in a freelance job site and I started the work with a client in a project with a contract on this freelance job site. Until now all is OK.Firstly I started but developpement of some issues and I guessed he want relooking a site already exist on line,today in the next task of job I found that the client wants to clone the site from another one not relooking and he is not the admin of the site to clone. He will provide me a different template (not the same logo and color) but with the content about the same. My questions are:   * If this method of cloning is illegal, will it be his responsibility to deal with the legal issues? Maybe I'll create for him just the server side code. Will that mean I'll have any responsibility if the admin of the other site asks him about the copyright violation?   * Can I do this in a painless way? I'll make him the code, and when the contract is done, will it be OK for him to launch the site by his own name and domain? Please I make some modifications,can I have a serious answer and please reply just if you are sure and maybe you had the same issue...
