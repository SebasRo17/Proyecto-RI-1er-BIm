I am building a web application and RESTful web service. I have been reading various articles about the best way to authenticate the requests to the web service. The best option for me seems to be to use HTTP basic authentication. Pretty much every article ive read says that authentication should be encrypted over SSL or equivalent. Im not totally sure what this involves. Does this mean that my whole web service will have to be on a secure server? Will this slow things down?
