I would like to solve the Helmholtz equation with dirichlet boundary conditions in 2 dimensions for an arbitrary shape. (for a qualitative comparison of the eigenstates to periodic orbits in the corresponding billiard systems): $\Omega =$ some boundary e.g. a circle, a regular polygon etc. $ \triangledown^2 u(x,y) + k^2u(x,y) =0 \quad x,y \in \Omega \\ u(x,y) = 0 \quad x,y \in \partial\Omega $ There seems already to be a solution here, unforuntalty I'm not experienced enough with Mathematica to extract a minimal working example from this code and adapt it to my needs. **Is there a way to use NDSolve (or ParametricNDSolve) to calculate the eigenvalues k and corresponding eigenstates for the problem?** As far as I understand Mathematica can handle FEM and finite difference methods, which could be used to solve this kind of equations?
