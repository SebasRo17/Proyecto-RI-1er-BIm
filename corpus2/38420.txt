If I enter               Solve[(x-2)(x+2)==0,x]      then the answer comes up as               {{x -> 2}, {x -> -2}}      I want to make two variables sol1 and sol2, and sol1=2 and sol2=-2. I don't mean I want to make sol1 and sol2 from {{x -> 2}, {x -> -2}} I want to make them directly before anything such as {{x -> 2}, {x -> -2}} comes up. As long as I get sol1 and sol2, I don't need such answers like {{x -> 2}, {x -> -2}} I know it's possible because a year ago I could manage to do it after hours of trial-and-error. But I don't remember now.
