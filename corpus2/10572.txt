Supose I have a rectangle which area is $x^2$. In some cases I may not know what is the size of each side, for $x=12,$ we have several possibilites:               {{144, 1}, {72, 2}, {48, 3}, {36, 4}, {24, 6}, {18, 8}, {16, 9}, {12,        12}, {9, 16}, {8, 18}, {6, 24}, {4, 36}, {3, 48}, {2, 72}, {1, 144}}      I want to plot each one of these rectangles, all them aligned by their center. Until now, I did this:               n = 144;     a = Select[n/Range[1, n], IntegerQ];     b = Reverse[a];     c = Table[{a[[x]], b[[x]]}, {x, 1, Length[a]}]      Which finds all the sizes of the sizes which satisfy $a\cdot b=x^2$. But I can't figure out how to do the next part, can you help me?
