I'm creating some questions for my math classes. The one below refers to the Sierpinski gasket. ![question](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BwFud.png) I found some great demonstrations to create the gasket. So that's good. Solving the problem is easier to do if the diagram has all the triangles shown, eg. as below... ![triangles](http://i.stack.imgur.com/hAtlw.png) I'm wondering if someone could create a function to create the gasket and then switch to a version where all the "little" triangles are shown? I'd like to be able to ask similar questions with the gasket at different levels. The reason for having ALL the triangles is it lets the student find the fraction of the shaded triangles compared to the total number of small triangles.
