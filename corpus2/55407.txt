The answer to this might be simple, but why would `ReplaceAll` return such a weird result when replacing a number in a list of numbers:               {1, 2, 3, 4}/.2 -> 5     (* {5., 10., 15., 20.} -> 5 *)      even though it does fine with this?               {1, 2, 3, 4} /. x_ /; x == 2 -> 5     (* {1, 5, 3, 4} *)      As far as I know, `2` after `/.` represents a pattern that matches the number 2. For example, these both work:               Cases[{1, 2, 3, 4}, 2]     (* {2} *)          Position[{1, 2, 3, 4}, 2]     (* {{2}} *)      All the examples of `ReplaceAll` in the documentation seem to replace only symbols, and I couldn't find a similar questions on SE, hence this question.
