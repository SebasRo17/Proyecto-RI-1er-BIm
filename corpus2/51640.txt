I have a (somewhat involved) function `f[x?NumericQ, y?NumericQ]` and for some reason it behaves differently when given a `Table` than when given a `RegionPlot`.               Monitor[Table[f[x, y] > 2, {x, 2, 50, 1}, {y, 0, 500, 1}], {x, y}]      shows the values of `x` and `y` as the grid is scanned and returns the table. However,               Monitor[RegionPlot[Tan[x, y] > 2 {x, 2, 50}, {y, 0, 500}], {x, y}]      returns nothing and the monitor gets stuck on unevaluated `x, y` after the initial point of the evaluation (close to (2, 0)) has been done. Any idea about   * What kind of trouble might arise in `RegionPlot` that did not happen with `Table`   * How I could investigate what's going on in the `RegionPlot`
