Recently, I've _really_ been getting into programming. I've always loved it, but now it's all I think about. 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. And now that I'm working a lot and about to graduate and get a full time job, I'm looking to sharpen those skills. Lately, all of my programming has been in Java and Javascript. I've nearly mastered the quirks of Javascript, but I'm still "new" to Java. I've written a lot of code, but I don't know the ins and outs. (For instance, I just discovered the try with resources statement.) TL;DR - I'm looking for some articles to hone my Java skills and really know the ins and outs of the language. Anything from refactoring tips to advanced security guides to performance optimizations. Where can I go to become a better Java programmer. (Besides my IDE. I spend enough time there. :p )
