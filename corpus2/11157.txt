My question is probably best illustrated with this small sample code:               Manipulate[      Plot[{eqn1, eqn2, eqn1-eqn2}, {x,-5,5}],      {{eqn1,r-x,"y1="}},{{eqn2,E^-x,"y2="}},      {r,-2,2}     ]      I would like to be able to have the user input two equations which including a variable `r`, and then use the slider to manipulate this variable. The issue is that `Manipulate` changes `r` within the input field, and then doesn't update the graphs. Is there a way of allowing the user to input an equation which contains one of `Manipulate`'s variables without having it change that variable within the input field?
