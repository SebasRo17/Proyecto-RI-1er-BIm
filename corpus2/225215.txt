I work for a company of <60 people. I understand that larger companies typically are ISO9000/9001 certified, as a matter of quality assurance. I also understand that for a company my size, such certification is not cost- effective. However, one could still make a case that as a matter of QA best- practice, I think it makes sense to try to follow the ISO standards anyway, at least insofar as reasonably practical. Am I correct in all these beliefs? If all the above is correct, are there any "high points" that would be particularly beneficial for a company my size to follow, or any parts of the standards that seem less relevant?
