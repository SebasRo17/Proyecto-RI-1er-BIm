I am a "one man team" ASP.NET C#, SQL, HTML, JQuery programmer that wants to split workload with two other guys. Since I never actually thought of possible issue in a team of programmer, there are actually quite a few that came to my mind. delegating tasks (who works on what which is also very much related to security). I found Team Foundation Service could be helpful with this problem and started reading about it. Are there any alternatives? security (do now want for original code to be reused outside the project) How to prevent programmers from having access to all parts of code, and how to prevent them from using that code outside of project? Is trust or contract the only way?
