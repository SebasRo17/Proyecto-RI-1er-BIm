As Semantic Versioning (and common sense) declares - the major version is incremented in case if non backward compatible change is introduced. Now let's assume we have a project called `Project` that has a current version `1.0.42` and a library `Lib` it depends on that is of a `2.1.3` version at the moment. Does that mean that following semver ideology we should constraint the dependency of the `Project` to be `Depends: Lib (< 3)`? From my experience - no one does that, but I find it semantically correct and very self-descriptive. What do you think of this?
