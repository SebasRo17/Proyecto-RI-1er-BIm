Something came to my mind today. I have been doing a lot of the following               new Object().doSomething();      I create an object and call on of its functions, then forget about the object. I don't need it past this one instance. Does this signal a bad coding style. Is it best to convert these methods to a static function so a new object does not need to be created every time?
