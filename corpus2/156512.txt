I have a c++/cli tcp client application sending a data in a specific format like **`L,20100930033425093,-5.929958,13.164021`** to a main application on port 9000.The main application is actually done by the other vendor and I dont have the source code for that. Now,I can communicate to the desired application using the IP and Port No.But the data supposed to be visible on the Main Application GUI is not showing up. But I used a different socket server demo application with same IP as the main application to receive the data I am sending.It works perfectly fine. Now I do not know where the error is or whether the stream is received on the other side. How can I effectively solve this situation. I am asking this in a broader picture to get some ideas. Any suggestions or discussion on this will be helpful?
