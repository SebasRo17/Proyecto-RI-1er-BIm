I am building a hobby marketplace (comic books). Users are able to list comic books they own for trading with other members. The problem I'm running into is that I would like to standardize the listings so I can display multiple options per title. Like this: User 1 lists: "Amazing Spider-man #4" on site.com/amazing-spider-man-4 User 2 goes to list "amazing spiderman 4" -> direct him to place the listing on site.com/amazing-spider-man-4 instead. Then this starts to get a bit complex... so in a theoretical example, there could be numerous volumes of each series. i.e. Amazing spider-man #4 (released in 1965) and then again, due to a reboot another Amazing spider-man #4 (released in 1981) or whatever. Is the answer to this to create a database and populate it with all series titles, issue counts and volumes, and then require the user to select one of those before making a submission? Such a data-source does not exist with reliable "volume" information, so I'm not sure how I'd do it.
