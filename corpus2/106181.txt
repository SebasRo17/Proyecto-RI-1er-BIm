Does W3C or any other organisation has standard or protocol to constraint all developers to make sure they must use american english while they develop any sort of interpreter? To avoid something like, > I was writing code and tried to align image in centre(spelled in british > english) > > align='centre' > > above didn't work!! > > There is no spelling mistake, above spelled word meaning is "middle" > > when I wrote > > align='center' it worked, > > Does this mean HTML is written in "American English"? What if a developer from British background writes a renderer for web browsers such as gecko? **EDIT** Sorry I am not ranting but, I was wondering if W3C has any standards written somewhere which states that any future code or html tag written for HTML language must be in US-EN. Does anyone have idea whether W3C have some constraint on this?
