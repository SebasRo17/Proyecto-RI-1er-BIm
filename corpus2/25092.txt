I have a question about `Simplify`: When I do a simplification the returned result is not as simple as I want. When I ask for the Norm of an complex expression, _Mathematica_ just returns `Norm[expr]`. I don't know how to make it simpler, is this the final form that Mathematica can give?               Simplify[Conjugate[h^4 k^2 + 2 I h^2 k m V + (-1 + E^(2 I k l)) m^2 V^2],        {k, V, m, h, l} âˆˆ Reals]      When evaluating the above code, Mathematica just returns `Conjugate[...]`, but what I need is a form without `Conjugate` in the front, just replace $i$ to $-i$ as usual math calculation.
