I am new to working with Windows Services. Although I have learnt to create Windows Services in VS2010  I would like to know some practical ways in which windows services could be used? I tried Googling with the current context in mind only to find more tutorials on how to create Windows Services. **EDIT on Bounty Offer:** All the answers are great but I was looking for more **practical examples** on windows services and their implications? This will help developers know when it is appropriate to use them with the case study.
