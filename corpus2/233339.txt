I've found a library (that I'd like to fork, if it makes any difference). On NuGet, the project file says it's distributed under the MIT license (with a link to the license). However, in the GitHub repository of the project, I don't see any mentions of the MIT license (or any other license) either in the source code files or in a readme. I'm a little concerned about this, since NuGet is a repository for binaries and I'm interested in the source. **Should I assume that the source code is covered under the MIT license, judging only by the NuGet metadata of a package?** Or does this mean that the permissions apply only for the binary and not for the source?
