I want to do a 3-dimensional FFT on this function $\frac{\cos (x) \cos (y) \cos (z)-\sin (x) \sin (y) \sin (z)}{\left((1.0001+\sin (y)+\cos (z))^2+(0.0001+\cos (x)+\sin (z))^2+(0.0001+\sin (x)+\cos (y))^2\right)^{3/2}}$ for it looks intractable via analytical Fourier expansion. Let's denote the number of numerical sampling points in each dimension as $N$. FourierParameters -> {a, b}. $a=-1$ for $1/N^3$ normalization in conformity with commonly used coefficients in FourierSeries. $b=-1$ for forward, not backward transform.               nn = 10; step = (2 \[Pi])/nn; mx0 = 1.0001; my0 = 0.0001; mz0 = 0.0001;      data = Table[ ( Cos[x] Cos[y] Cos[z] - Sin[x] Sin[y] Sin[z])/((mz0 + Cos[y] + Sin[x])^2 + (mx0 + Cos[z] + Sin[y])^2 + (my0 + Cos[x] + Sin[z])^2)^(3/2), {x, 0, 2 \[Pi] - step, step}, {y, 0, 2 \[Pi] - step, step}, {z, 0, 2 \[Pi] - step, step}];     s = Fourier[data, FourierParameters -> {-1, -1}]; s[[1, 1, 1]]      As far as I've tried, using **Fourier[ ]** in _Mathematica_ , the transformation result doesn't converge even when $N=500$, oscillating drastically with respect to $N$ in fact. Besides, I also tried some FFT routine from MKL library by C++, which showed similar behavior. I checked the programs with many other non-singular functions, they turned out to be good. So I guess the problem may be caused by the special form of the singular function (denominator can be zero at some points). I tried $\frac{1}{0.9-\sin{(x+y+z)}}$. It doesn't oscillate so much, but still considerably. Can anyone shed some light on this problem? Thanks in advance!
