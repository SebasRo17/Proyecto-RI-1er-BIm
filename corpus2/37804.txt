The Help page of `FindRoot` says: "by default, `FindRoot` uses Newton's method (Newton-Raphson) to solve a nonlinear system".   But I still have the following puzzles:   1. How will the Jacobian be calculated in each iteration : symbolically or using finite difference approximation only?   2. Is there any dumping method of the step being used when the Jacobian at any step is invertible?
