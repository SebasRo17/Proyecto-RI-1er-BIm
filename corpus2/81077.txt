I have read this question and after a very long time it's clear I still don't understand anti-patterns. perhaps, it raised a new level of curosity to know why should I read Anti design pattern if they are actually nothing but a "Bad Practice". Is there any chance I should implement those anti design patterns in my application ? **EDIT** > When Jeff said: “A basic rule of programming is to never write what you can > buy or get for free,”. Which I believe is the way to implement copy & paste programming then should I say that SO is ,in some way or another, following Anti-Pattern?
