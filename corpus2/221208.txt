How would you go about parsing a sentence like "Bought two kilos of steak from Acme supermarket" into a data structure like the following JSON representation:               {       item: {name: "steak", tags: "meat,beef" },       quantity: { value: 2, unit: "kg"},       source: "ACME Supermarket"     }      ? I'm looking for a high-level conceptual overview of where to start e.g. some papers or introductory material that don't require PhD level knowledge. For context, this is part of the preliminary investigation for a personal expense tracker I'm planning to build. To break it down a little further, I'm interested in basic named entity recognition, and categorization strategies. I don't have a CS education, so you may want to keep that in mind when answering :) Thanks in advance. Not interested in 3rd party web services, since this is a learning exercise, and is intended to work offline.
