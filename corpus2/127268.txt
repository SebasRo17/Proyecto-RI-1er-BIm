I have a GitHub repository with toy programs that I write when I learn something. For example, when I read an about an algorithms or data structures, I write up a quick implementation of of it to make sure that it works and I understand it. I sometimes solve algorithm and data structure puzzles and that gets pushed into the repository. Would this repository be worth linking on my résumé, or would it actually be a detriment to my chances of getting hired?
