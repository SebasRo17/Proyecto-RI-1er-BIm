I am performing a calculation in _Mathematica_ which relies on calls to an external program that acts as a black box for calculating a function $f$, and I would like to know if it is possible for Mathematica to interact with a command-line interface that asks for user input. At the moment I am writing the arguments to my function $f$ in some external file `inputFile.txt`, and then running the external executable using one of the Run-related syntaxes:               inputstream=OpenRead["! ./external-program.x < inputFile.txt"]     ReadList[inputstream]      For the record, I'm running Mathematica 9 on Ubuntu 12.04. While this is a perfectly OK way to do things, it does mean I need to write to a file, have `external-program` read it, and then delete the file. For a long calculation with many such calls, it is overhead that I'd like to avoid. My external program does allow for command-line interaction, at least with a human user on a terminal, and this does not require piping in an already- written file. In practice, you run               ./external-program.x      on a command line, and you are then required to input the multiple arguments and press `Enter` after them. **Is it possible to automate this sort of behaviour from within _Mathematica_?**
