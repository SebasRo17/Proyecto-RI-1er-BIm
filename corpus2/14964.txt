I've written a function that encrypts a text using the RSA algorithm. It then decrypts it using prime factorization, and takes the time it took to decrypt it and puts it in a vector together with the length of the N variable in the RSA algorithm. I do this with a length of N from 28 to 61. I can then plot this is a graph, and try to estimate how long it would take to prime factorize an N length of 100 or larger. My problem is that I can find no suitable way to fit my values into a graph that then makes a reasonable approximation of the time it would take for say an N of the length of 100. I am using `Fit` and `FindFit`, but all of my results either end up negative for `Length[N] = 100`, or they end up something like 2 years, which is not a reasonable answer. These are my values with the length of N at index 1 and then the time in seconds at index 2.               {{28, 0.016}, {29, 0.}, {32, 0.062}, {33, 0.063}, {36, 0.062}, {37,        0.109}, {40, 0.187}, {42, 0.265}, {43, 0.281}, {45, 0.858}, {48,        4.04}, {50, 4.805}, {52, 7.941}, {54, 12.512}, {54, 11.497}, {57,        19.952}, {60, 103.803}, {61, 102.009}}      I can plot it as follows:               plot = ListPlot[TidN, PlotStyle -> Red];     a1 = a /. FindFit[TidN, a*b^x, {a, b }, x]     b1 = b /. FindFit[TidN, a*b^x, {a, b }, x]     modelplot = Plot[a1*b1^x, {x, 32, 100}, AxesLabel -> {x, y},        PlotRange -> {{20, 70}, {0, 50}}];     Show[modelplot, plot]      This results in the following: ![enter image description here](http://i.imgur.com/ISwEk.jpg) I then try to estimate the time it would take to factorize the length of an N of 100, like this:               a1*b1^100/(3600*24*365)      This gives the result in years, which isn't reasonable at all. It should, I believe, be more close to 100 years:               0.628951      How can I plot this better, and how can I find a function that estimates large numbers more easily? I can of course let my computer run and gather more data points from which I can establish a better function perhaps, but should this really be necessary since I already have 18 points to start from?
