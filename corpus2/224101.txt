I want to have the home page (root of the website), check if a cookie exists for a user being logged in, and then based off of that determining whether or not to load the sign up page (landing page) or the feed of the user logged in. Where would I have this check occur? I've kept it in the controller for now, but based on some articles I've read (such as Skinny Controller, Fat Model, I'm not sure that's the right place to keep it in.
