Some JVMs would compile Java byte code into native machine code. We know that there are lots of optimizations we could apply for that. Recently, I also learn that a branch operation may block the CPU and affect the performance significantly, if a CPU makes a wrong prediction. Does anyone know if any JVM would generate machine codes easier for CPU making right prediction based on runtime statistics collected?
