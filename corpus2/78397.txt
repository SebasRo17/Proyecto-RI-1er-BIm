Is it possible to create a web application/service in PHP in which the backbone of the application/service is really a linux script and PHP is just relaying the data from the script? The linux script requires certain types of hardware and drivers in order to execute smoothly. I will be hosting the web application and linux script however not the hardware or drivers. I'm thinking of writing up some javascript code that will check if the end-user meet the hardware/driver requirements & have some sort of connection, if so the linux script will execute and utilize the user's hardware to process data that is then passed to PHP. YIKES!? ;o Is my approach for this correct or is there an easier way? Thanks!
