What is the current status of these projects, and has any one (or two) emerged as a clear leader? To demonstrate my motives for asking this question, cast your mind back several years. Prototype and jQuery were going head-to-head with other players like MooTools fighting to survive as well. Fast forward to today, and the general consensus is that jQuery is the best general purpose JavaScript library. Has something similar happened in the last several years with these JVM-based languages? Have certain languages fallen into disrepair and abandonment? From what I've read, it seems that Scala is certainly well-prepped to become the favorite, but then again, nearly everything I've read is several years old. * * * I've done a bit more research - I had the idea to check out search volume through the years by using Google Trends. It seems that Jython and JRuby have relatively little interest while Groovy's volume is decreasing and Scala's volume is constant (at worst) or increasing slightly (at best). Is this an accurate assessment? * * * And yes, I'm referring to non-Java languages on the JVM such as Jython, JRuby, Groovy, Scala, Clojure, etc.
