Is it possible to use the option `EvaluationCompletionAction` to notify me (e.g. with a `Beep[]`) when an evaluation that took longer than, for example, 30s is finished? One of the default settings for EvaluationCompletionAction is `"ShowTiming"` which indicates that the frontend is in some way aware of the duration of evaluations. Ideally, I would want something like this:               SetOptions[       $FrontEnd,       EvaluationCompletionAction -> Which[duration > 30, Beep[]]     ]      Is it possible to do this? And could anyone point me in a direction how to accomplish this?
