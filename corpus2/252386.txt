I have been researching why the origins for most graphic applications are located in the top left corner of the screen. From everything I have read, they are located there because that is where the electron gun on a cathode ray tube would start to scan, from top to bottom. _Other than this historical reason, is there any usefulness to having the origin in the upper left hand corner versus (which is personally more natural to me) the bottom left hand corner?_ From my knowledge, I can't think of any reason that one origin might be more useful than the other. In terms of math, I don't think it should make any difference, as long as the relation between the pixels/point in the image stay the same you should be able to apply any mathematical transformation in the same way using either origin. I am specifically looking for examples that show why it would be better to use one origin over the other, and not just for the reason that "this is the way it was done before" or "its easier this way because device x uses it" because all of those reasons relate back to the historical reason.
