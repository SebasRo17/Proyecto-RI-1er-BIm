I tend to think very independently, often coming up with unconventional, sometimes unorthodox, ways of solving problems. I do not like to listen to authority, such as having to write code a certain way or following strict guidelines and formats. Would the software engineering field be tough for someone like me? If not, what fields of computer science do allow for that?
