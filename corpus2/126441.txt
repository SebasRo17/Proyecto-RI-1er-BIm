I am actually considering learning C++. I want to become a quantitative financial analyst, and going to pursue my CFQ soon. Java is not heavily used in this field, but C++ is for its complexity. For someone who already has knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript (intermediate), and PHP (intermediate), how hard would the switch be to pick up C++ over the course of a year? How long would it take to get certified in C++? And how hard is it to learn? I have built CMS websites, and some decent applications for the web. I took a college course of beginning programming in Java as well. Basically switching positions as a web designer to a C++ programmer and use Matlab. I have heard the language is very complex, but easier to program than languages like Java.
