I am using Mathematica to layout some mathematical formulas for publication. The guidelines specify that in case of nested parentheses the encompassing ones need to be bigger than the inner ones. So is there a way to make parentheses bigger easily? Below is an example of what I want. It is made by inserting an invisible column at the beginning of the grouping, but that creates a ugly gap in the formula. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QwKye.png)
