I was instructed by my project manager that frequent deployment in PROD or to test server should be avoided. But I don't understand why? We roll our testing copy to PROD on every sprint end but suddenly client would ask a simple change to the existing application which would require a re-deployment. When every thing was well tested and QA approved. why should we avoid frequent deployment? How it was done universally?
