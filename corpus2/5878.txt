Take for example               head[b_[PatternSequence[_, _]]] := 9      I know this example serves no purpose as is. It also happens in useful examples such as               head[b_[_, arg : PatternSequence[_, _]]] := {arg, b}      The definition is made propely, but it issues the message > `Pattern::patvar:` First element in pattern `Pattern[1,_]` is not a valid > pattern name. >> A simpler example of the problem, suggested by @celtschk in comments               b_[PatternSequence[_, _]] :> 0      and               b_[PatternSequence[]] :> 0      Particularly interesting is an example @OleksandrR found, in which the mysterious numbering of patterns becomes more evident               (p : {a_, b_, c_})[PatternSequence[]] -> Null      > `Pattern::patvar:` "First element in pattern > `Pattern[4,{Pattern[1,_],Pattern[2,_],Pattern[3,_]}]` is not a valid pattern > name."
