I have a possible C# dev job lined up but before I can interview, I need to pass a test with the employment agency. Now even though I am a senior developer with over 10 years of programming experience and more than 3 of these years with c#, I am really not looking forward to this test and I think there is a good chance I will fail it. In my experience these tests are unpredictable asking you stuff you seldom use in everyday work situations. I need your best advice on what I should be revising on - a good book or website for example. I have less than 1 week to prepare and it is essential I pass this. Thanks in advance. EDIT: To further justify my concerns of writing such tests - Consider the following question: 12) An Event is :                  a) The result of a users action - correct answer        b) The esult of a party        c) code to force users action      The correct answer according to the test is A, but since I've been doing SOA development (often when events can be based on system events (not user actions) I'm 100% sure an event doesn't have to be driven by a user action. This was also a C# question (not an ASP.net question). Based on my understanding, I couldn't really spot a correct answer but B seems the best of the lot (if the definition of party is : any entity that can trigger an event. These kind of questions scare me.
