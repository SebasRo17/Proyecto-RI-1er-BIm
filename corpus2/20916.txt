I'm attempting to view and rotate a Graphics3D object with a very large set of geometric primitives ($\approx 10^6$ objects such as spheres or lines), and everything is functioning very slowly. Are there any tricks for speeding up object display / manipulations or to spread the burden of redrawing the image over multiple cores? Also, how can I specify that the object should initially appear larger in the Mathematica workbook? More specifically, I mean that I would like to specify that the output for some Graphics3D[...] command should initially be displayed at a specified size in the workbook?
