I'm an undergraduate student studying computer science. I have been working at a company as a student researcher and next week I am to demo my complete project to my boss and the other developers. It is the most complex and largest program I have developed. My questions are: What is the most effective way to demo? Are there any good articles concerning this issue? What are key points to show? How do you do demo? I began this project before I knew much of TDD so it was not developed this way. Most of my testing/validation was done as I wrote the program with print statements and myself just verifying results. I will want to prove the program works and based on my testing it is bug free. My only proof really is it does what it should do... This is a little disconcerting for me. Any question answers, comments, suggestions, links and all else greatly appreciated. Thank you!
