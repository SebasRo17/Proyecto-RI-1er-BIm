What I am trying to do is give the users/visitors the option to alter the whole website based on their taste. So they can move for example the sticky bar from top to bottom, alter background colors, news box from left to right etc. For users I will probably store all the information in the DB but I am not sure how I should handle this afterward. Should I store all the settings into a cookie instead of grabbing that info from the DB all the time and "rebuilding" the website based on their taste or do you have any other idea?
