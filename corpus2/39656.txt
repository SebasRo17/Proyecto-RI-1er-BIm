I've been learning C#/.NET 4.0 for about 2/3 months, it's my first serious programming language (I've looked at PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and VBA before but never massively in depth) and I'm starting to become a bit stuck:   * I have hit a ceiling with my learning due to lack of a 'big' project...   * Lack of working on complex projects is giving me doubts in my abilities... 2 weeks ago I had an interview for a Junior Programmer job, and managed to answer most of the questions that were answered of me, but I still didn't get the job due to lack of practical experience, I'm unsure of what to do! As I said before, I wouldn't mine contributing to an Open Source project, but I don't know where to start, I presume the 'big' projects only want good coders :( Is there any form of online programming test that will show me how 'good' (or 'bad') I am at the moment? :) Thanks for any help.
