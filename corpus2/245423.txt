this question in my opinion straightforward. How can I catch an DllNotFoundException in C# as it is just an attribute to some methods use like this:               [DllImport("NativeLib.dll")]         private static extern void print_line(string str);      When are these functions being invoked ? As I instance the class containing the methods ( sounds odd to me as it's being "static" )? Or as I want to use the methods?
