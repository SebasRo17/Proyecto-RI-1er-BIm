Composition and aggregation both are confusion to me. Does my code sample below indicate composition or aggregation?               class A {          public static function getData($id) {              //something          }               public static function checkUrl($url) {              // something          }           class B {         public function executePatch() {                $data = A::getData(12);           }              public function readUrl() {                $url = A::checkUrl('http/erere.com');          }              public function storeData() {                 //something not related to class A at all          }       }     }      Is class B a composition of class A or is it aggregation of class A? Does composition purely mean that if class A gets deleted class B does not works at all and aggregation if class A gets deleted methods in class B that do not use class A will work?
