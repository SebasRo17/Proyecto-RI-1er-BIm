Is it possible to record all the output of a `Mathematica` script to a file? I am looking for the `Mathematica` equivalent of fortran `./a.out > out.dat` which record all the output string to the file `out.dat`. Using `OpenWrite[]` and `WriteString[]` can record only the part I can specify but not the error messages which also can appear during execution. For example consider the script `test.m`               Print@"Start";     x=1/0;     Print@x;     Quit[];      If you run `math -script test.m` it will produce a message about encountering 1/0 apart from the string "Start" and "ComplexInfinity" due to the `Print`. I want to record all these messages in a file. Is it possible? > **Clarification** When you run a script in terminal it produces different messages, both user defined (with `Print`) or machine generated (like error messages). In a note book they are automatically recorded. But when running the script in background in a remote machine, it is not possible to keep track of all the messages. So I am looking for a way to record them in a file so that I can get an idea of the progress at any instance by looking at that file.
