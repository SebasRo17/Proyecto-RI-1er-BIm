I am at a complete loss at this. I have a table with 2 columns and _n_ lines. Some of the lines are repeated. What I want to do is add a new column that counts the number of repetitions of each line. Example               a={{1.1, 2.2},{1.1, 2.2}}      then I need something that will add a column `{2,2}` to the end of the table, resulting in               {{1.1, 2.2, 2},{1.1, 2.2, 2}}      Keeping in mind that I don't know in advance how many times a line will appear in the table. If it helps, the same line will always appear in subsequent positions Thanks
