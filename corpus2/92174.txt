I have searched for the full form of " **OOPS** " in Google, but unfortunately, there are many ambiguous answers. Some say it's " **Systems** ", and some say it's " **Structure** ", and some have even mentioned it as " **Synopsis** ". Can anybody please enlighten me, to find the full form of OOPS, with some proper & correct reference? Many thanks to everyone, helping me out.
