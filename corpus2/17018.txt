Is it possible to create interactive code in Mathematica (via EventHandler[] or Manipulate[] perhaps) that continually updates some calculation based on external data in the time when no user input is received? As a trivial example, code that shows the current time, with seconds, continually updating, and which allows the user to click on any of the numbers to change their color. Thank you.
