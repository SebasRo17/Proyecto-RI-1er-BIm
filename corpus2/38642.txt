Just browsing through Code Complete last night and I came across the explanation of abstract data types. I must have read it 5 times, and the Wikipedia article doesn't help much either. So what I'm looking for is a simple explanation of exactly **what is an Abstract Data Type**? Any solid examples? In C# or VB? I understand that String is supposed to be one, why is this? And why isn't Int32 one? Or is it? Any pointers much appreciated.
