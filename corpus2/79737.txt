I've been working with the Oracle RDBMS for a few years and today, after installing one for the n-th time, I was left wondering, why do we install it in /u01, /u02, etc.? Of course you could install it somewhere else, but for some unknown reason, this convention is used everywhere and I haven't seen any serious Oracle installation in, for example, /opt Any history lesson I missed?
