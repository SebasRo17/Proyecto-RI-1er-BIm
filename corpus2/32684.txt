If I create a text cell and type some greek text, most of the symbols are italics as if the cell had an _Input_ style. It doesn't happen with latin characters. I recollect that it is impossible to fix it, but I can't find the source where I read it. Perhaps someone knows a workaround ? The following screenshot is from _Mathematica_ 8/Linux. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0p2KG.png) **EDIT1** : I _just_ noticed that writing capital greek letters works fine (the letters are normal, not italics). The following screenshot is from _Mathematica_ 9.0.1/OSX Mavericks. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Qvxky.png) Does that piece of information ring any bells to anyone on what might be the underlying problem ? **EDIT2** : I also found this link describing a workaround by using custom modified unicode mapping files. I can't check it right now as I'm not near my Linux installation. **EDIT3** : I did try it though in _Mathematica_ 9.0.1/OSX (although the article talks about _Mathematica_ 7&8/Linux), and it works great! Here is the relevant screenshot: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qjjJx.png) **EDIT4** : As pointed out by @ybeltukov in comments, the workaround is to set the third column of `UnicodeFontMapping.tr` to 0 (zero) for Greek letters so that the default font is picked for them. **EDIT5** : This workaround doesn't anymore apply to _Mathematica_ 10\. I cannot find the `UnicodeFontMapping.tr` file.
