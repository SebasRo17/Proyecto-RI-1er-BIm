It's simple to ping a server in C#, but suppose I have servers A, B and C. A connects to B. A asks B to ping C, to check that B can talk to C. A needs to read the outcome. Now, first of all is this possible without installing an application onto B? In other words, can I perform the entire check from just running a program on A? If so, can anyone suggest the route I would take to achieve this? I've looked at sockets but from the examples I've seen these require a client AND server application to function.
