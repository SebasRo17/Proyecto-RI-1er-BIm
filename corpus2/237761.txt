I'm interested in building verifications into a REST service to help with service monitoring. For example, one could run assertions like `http://example.com/posts/verify?min-posts=5&since=1-hour-ago` which would respond with an error unless 5 new posts had been created in the past hour. Are there any existing services like this, or best practices? I'm particularly interested in a recommended error code for failed verifications, as I can't really see anything appropriate in the 4xx series. Errors like "Precondition Required" and "Internal Server Error" are more about the actual request or processing of it, than the meaning of it.
