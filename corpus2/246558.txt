If I am planning a structure for support testing in Linux, a structure that will contain packages, such files as shell and build scripts, app configurations, DBs, sources, tests and jars for to be managed, applications for be managers, users, permissions, etc., what diagram could be used for it? Just now I am using the Component Diagram with some stereotyping, but it is not at all convenient in the part of permissions/users stuff. There are such diagrams as RBAC, but they are not UML, and it remains unclear how to combine them. An example picture and/or a real experience description would be highly appreciated. But any fresh thought will be useful, too.
