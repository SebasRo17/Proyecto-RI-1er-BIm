Tools and frameworks make complex tasks simple. This seems like something that would be supported by KISS(keep it simple stupid). Tools and frameworks also have the potential to introduce leaky layers of abstraction, where the complexity of the issues are far more problematic than anything you would have written yourself. I am not interested in the effectiveness of tools and frameworks, since that is more of a religious opinion, and can be kept private. What I am interested in is whether or not tools and frameworks are favored by KISS. Obviously some layers of abstraction are accepted by just about everyone, but there are plenty of examples of edge cases where it is harder to tell. For example: For a web service in .Net, would KISS favor a basic WCF service (super easy to create; fairly difficult understand/see what is actually going on under the hood) or a basic REST service (more challenging to create; easier to understand/see what is actually going on under the hood)? Note: There are plenty more examples of this, so feel free to suggest more appropriate ones.
