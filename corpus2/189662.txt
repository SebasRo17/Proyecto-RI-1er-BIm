The first application (web-based) will be located at site1 and once the information is processed, it will be sent to the second application(web-based) located at site2. Application2 needs to be able to do the same thing as application1. Because of this, there has to be a way to share the database to keep data in sync. I wanted to go web-based for these two applications, but the issue arises, what if the internet is down? If application1 goes down due to a blackout or lost of internet, application2 should still be able to do what it needs to. I was thinking the database/server will be on Amazon EC2. Even if I go with a standalone application for site1 and site2, it still needs some sort of internet connection to talk to a shared database/server right, possiblity through tcp connection? Because of this, I dont see why it shouldn't just be a web-based applicatin then. This the disagreement I'm having with my team. I want to know the pros and cons of making these two application either being a stand-alone or web-based.
