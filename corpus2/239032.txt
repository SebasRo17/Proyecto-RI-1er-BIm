Assume an interface that allows queries on a spatial tree               public ISpatialTree     {         int FindChildIndex(Vector point);         bool IsLeaf { get; }         ICollection<ISpatialTree> Children { get; }     }      and another one that allows changing the tree:               public ISpatialTreeWriter : ISpatialTree     {         void Add(Vector point);         bool Remove(Vector point);         void Clear();     }      I am looking for a name to denote the writeable interface. Ideally it would be reasonably short and readable word. It's not only for this example, but I would like to use a convention for all code in the project because this is a common case. Does anyone know of a good convention for this problem? What conventions are used in other projects? Words that were discussed include Writer (ambiguous, often used in other contexts), Mutator (confusing), Rw (unreadable, not a word). A good solution would be a single word, not longer than 6-8 letters and that makes it obvious that this is the writer interface.
