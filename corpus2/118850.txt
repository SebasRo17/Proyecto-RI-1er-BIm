Take the following tree:                         50                              40            30          20        10       Which node will be balanced first? 50 or 30 **Case 1: 50**   The tree is                            30               20    40            10          50      **Case 2: 30**   The tree is                             40                 /   \               20     50            10    30       Well, both are AVL Trees, so are both correct?
