I have a set of $(x,y,z)$ coordinates which sparsely cover a surface, e.g.:               data = {{51, 15, 0.1}, {300, 11, 0.99}, {140, 22, 0.123}, {54, 12, 0.66}, ...};      What is a good general method, in _Mathematica_ 9, of interpolating and plotting a surface for this sparse data set? `Graphics3D[BSplineSurface[data]]` doesn't seem to get the job done; the output is a planar rectangle.
