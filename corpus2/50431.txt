Is there a command that tells Mathematica to try to write the terms (if possible) of an expression as total derivates? Example: I want to tell mathematica to write               -Sin[t]+g[t]       as               D[Cos[t],t]+g[t]       instead. Is this possible? Mathematically, this is basically (up to some constants) equivalent of Mathematica testing if the terms are analytically integrable (i.e. if they have closed form expressions).
