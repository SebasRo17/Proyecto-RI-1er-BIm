I have a bug in my application that I'm building. I asked a question on S.O. and one of the users asked me to post or send all the code to him so he could look at it. I totally understand the request. It is valid and understandable. However, I'm having doubts on if I should. Obviously, I give him/her the keys to the kingdom and I will not have any recourse if he/she would do something malicious. **I also want to add that I mean no-disrespect to the user on SO that offered their help. I'm just airing a concern.** I do want to have my bug fixed but there is no guarantee that this person would be able to fix it. Should I release the entire source code and hope for the best? Or keep it and try to figure it out on my own? What would you do?
