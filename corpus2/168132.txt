I'm wondering if I can create an EPUB (free and open e-book standard) reader in JavaScript. The basic requirements would be:   1. Server parts of the EPUB reader from a server API.    2. Read the EPUB data in JavaScript.    3. Render it on page.    4. Provide some extra functionality, like text highlights or page notes.  I have no information about how I could do this. I'm willing to try a prototype project. What are the steps that I could take towards implementing such a thing?
