> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Where can I find examples of good Mathematica programming practice? I'm a high school senior and am using Mathematica for a research project. However, I find it a bit slow to learn Mathematica by watching videos. I know that there are many helpful videos of Mathematica topics online, but I was wondering if there are any books or reference manuals I can read offline. I've looked at the question at What is the best Mathematica tutorial for young people? But again, it only lists online resources. So are there are any books out there detailing an introduction to Mathematica?
