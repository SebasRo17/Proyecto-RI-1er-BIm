Assume that in my free time I have developed library X before signing a contract or being employed by company A. I then sign a contract with company A and begin working. It becomes apparent that library X will be incredibly useful and save the company lots of time and money. What is the industry standard practice in this area in terms of bringing this code into the company? Would it be possible to license library X to company A?
