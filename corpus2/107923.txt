Code that we no longer use builds up. So what should one do when one doesn't need it anymore? Deleting it feels wasteful, especially large chunks, and there's always the chance the exact same thing will be needed again later. Commenting the code out is nice because it leaves it in place for later, but then the code can start to get cluttered. Version control keeps everything clean and in the right place without the fear of deleting anything, but finding the right code in the version histories is often a project of its own. It's also not great practice to commit code that doesn't work just because you might need it later. **Q:** Does anyone have a good solution to managing obsolete code?
