In another question, I asked about why developers might don't like **daily scrum**. We talked to developers and we decided to not hold daily scrum for a while (to give it a try and customized scrum in our first attempt). This is the output of consulting with developers directly. On the other hand, we don't want to lose good parts of daily scrum, like getting a chance to coordinate developers everyday, or watching the work progress like a Key Performance Indicator, to take actions early. As an alternative to daily scrum, we're thinking about asking developers to provide daily reports with the following conditions:   1. No need to follow any specific format. Each and every format is accepted.   2. Even if the work is not done, we want to hear the amount of progress.   3. There is no need to mention the time spent on each task.   4. Development obstacles and coordination requirements should be mentioned.   5. There is no need to be obsessed with daily reports. It's not taken that strict. Do you think that this can decrease their productivity? Have you had any daily report experience? Do you have any suggestion for us, so that we can get sure that we're not micromanaging?
