...in percentage. For example 60/40 or 90/10 or 100/0. My hypothesis is that the bigger the proportion of time you spend thinking the smaller your code can be as a result (and the less time will be needed to write it down). Think more, write less, in other words. Do you think it is true? As a side note, I think in typical software companies thinking is not part of the culture anyway: you are usually supposed to be sitting there at your computer _typing_ something. You will almost definitely be noticed by your managers if you wander about with a blank look thinking over your next steps with your code. Too bad.
