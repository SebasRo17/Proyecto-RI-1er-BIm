I've to compute this expression $$ \hat{H} = \frac{1}{4}g_2\int d^3R\int d^3r\ \bar{\Psi}(\vec{R}+\frac{\vec{r}}{2})\bar{\Psi}(\vec{R}-\frac{\vec{r}}{2})\left[ \delta(\vec{r})\nabla_{\vec{r}}^2 +\nabla_{\vec{r}}^2\delta(\vec{r}) \right]\Psi(\vec{R}+\frac{\vec{r}}{2})\Psi(\vec{R}-\frac{\vec{r}}{2}) $$ where $\bar{\Psi}$ is the conjugate of $\Psi$. How can i calculate it with Mathematica? I don't know how to represent the differential operator and doing this kind of integral with Mathematica. ///// **Edit** ///// Instead to give me negative vote, you can explain me what i've to add to my question.
