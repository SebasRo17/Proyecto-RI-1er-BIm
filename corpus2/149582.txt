I am developing this Android game (Technology wise 3D with OpenGLES2 and shaders, some nice AI with http://www.steeringbehaviors.de/ ) during my free time. The goal is to launched in the "Android Market" and apply for a mobile game development company.And during the interview to show my "game project". I was wondering if the company is not game company ,but a mobile development one ,is it still okay to show it even if they didn't ask about it ?
