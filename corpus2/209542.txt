I am working as Software Developer for Financial Company and we are using standard Java/Java EE stack with Oracle db as backend and using Spring/Hibernate framework with JBOSS Application Server. So this is pretty much standard stack and it's an legacy application. Now, I read blogs on Infoq.com and corporate engineering blogs and see people are trying out new technologies like NoSQL(Mongodb, Cassandra), Cloud Computing(AWS), Big Data(Hadoop and it's related eco system) and distributed computing frameworks(Zookeeper, cluster based cassandra...mongodb...hadoop configuration !!!) but I cannot use those technologies in my current project as it's an legacy application and there is no scope and messing around with core components. So my question is,   1. How can I learn and come to speed on all this new technologies?   2. What approach should I take? (I do lot of reading from Infoq and HighScalability about different architectures but never get an experience where i am migration my complete application to ec2 instance and analyze what are benefits of doing that or what all scenarios should we consider with that kind of project) Any thoughts?
