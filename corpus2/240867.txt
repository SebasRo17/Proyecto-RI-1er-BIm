Lately I started studying about different interesting concepts that exist in languages other than Java. Since the only language I've ever programmed with is Java, a lot of these concepts are very new to me. So this question may be very naive :) . I learned recently about first class functions and function pointers. Why are there no function pointers in Java? Or at least some variation of them, like delegates in C#? Maybe it's just the excitement of learning about this concept, but it seems to me like it could be a powerful feature in the language.
