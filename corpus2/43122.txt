I have this list               list = {{1, 3}, {3, 7}};      representing a time series from t = 1 to t = 4. How would I go about filling the missing values so that my list looks like this in the end:               list = {{1, 3}, {2,Na}, {3, 7}, {4,Na}};      Of course, the length of my list and position of missing values might vary so I need a general function to do this, not just               Insert[list,{2,Na},2]
