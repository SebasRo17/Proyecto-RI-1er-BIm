I'm looking to test potential candidates on their ability to develop concise, reusable code. I feel like a good test of that skill would be to give them a very small scale application or class hierarchy with problems ranging from obvious to complex, and have them take a shot at re-factoring it (or at least verbally explaining some things they would change). I would be looking for things like application of object-oriented design principles, use of design patterns, re-usability, showing clear intent, etc. Before I try making this myself, I'm wondering if anyone could suggest some existing template programs that people have created for the same purpose. I don't care too much about the language, but C# or Java would be preferred because of their wide use. Thanks in advance!
