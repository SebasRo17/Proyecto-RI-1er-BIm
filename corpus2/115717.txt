This year I'm basically going to attend for the Certified Software Quality Analyst (CSQA) examination. I'm attending the classes for it, even though I'm reading the books and notes provided by the teachers, I need to know some good resources for CSQA examination. The resources that will be provided will be good if it contains some tips, the way they ask question, and it will act as a good CSQA examination references. Thanks in advance..
