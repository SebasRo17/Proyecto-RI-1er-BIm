I keep hearing that c# is "better" than vb... but as far as I can see, aside from syntactical differences, both compile down to the same IL. I've found some good articles by googling that explain what the differences are between the two and so I feel comfortable in "diffusing" conversations between developers arguing over vb / c#. =) But I did read an article that said vb.net 2005 had better support for com interop stuff. But i'm wondering if this is still the case? This is of interest to me because we are in the middle of redesigning an old vb6 app that communicates with some older COM components. Does anyone have recent experience with .NET and COM interop? Thanks.
