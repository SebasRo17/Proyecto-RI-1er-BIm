**Is there anyone out there who has mastered to retrieve some data programmatically from Eloqua?** First of all, I'm more or less a newbie, as far as JAVA. I can follow tutorials, take directions and will Google till my fingers bleed. I understand the basics and am slightly familiar with OOP. My main problem is that I have a Friday deadline (and tomorrow is Thanksgiving). At any rate, all the Eloqua code snippets (that I've been able to find) illustrate one aspect of a specific issue, and that's it. In my case, **I would greatly appreciate a JAVA project of some sort** , with all the necessary files to do web services (WSDL, SOAP and perhaps WSIT) and the main class and all that included. No, I don't want you to do my work for me! Just give me enough to find my way around, enter the information I need to retrieve and all that. I'll take it from there. Any pointers, links or suggestions?
