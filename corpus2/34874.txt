So, I'm looking ordering myself a new development desktop soon and setting up a PROPER office environment by the end of this year. To boost productivity, I'm going to purchase three new monitors. I find that two just isn't enough when I'm debugging or doing something intensive. That said, I had something pointed out to me the other day that I never really noticed nor cared about before - _is the difference between a 16:10 and a 16:9 monitor noticeable when programming?_ Do you really miss those few extra lines, or is it something that you don't notice at all. I notice HP only seems to sell 16:9 monitors (as far as I have found). Is this becoming something of a new standard with the recent growth and cleaver marketing of of "HD 16:9"? **To summarize** : Has anybody made the switch from 16:10 to 16:9 (or vise- versa) and actually noticed the difference while programming?
