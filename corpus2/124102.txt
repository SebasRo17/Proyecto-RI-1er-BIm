I have an application that writes to its own Event Source. The Event Source itself is created upon install to prevent user vs admin access issues at runtime. Should writing to our own Event Source fail, the event is instead written to the Application log (two events actually, on for the original event data, and another saying 'Could not write to own event log because...' or something similar). We've recently discovered a problem that when the Application event log is full, the exception is unhandled. Now granted, I could just eat the exception (similar to what this answer says). So what is the best behavior? The application is attempting to log the issue and attempting to log that there is a problem. Should I eat the exception, let the logging operation fail silently and continue execution? Or should I let the exception bubble up the call stack so that user/developers know of the issue? What's the recommended approach under these conditions?
