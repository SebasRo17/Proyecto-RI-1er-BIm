I have problems to give the right time complexity in O notation for the following loop:               k := 0     for i := 0 to N        for j := k to M          // something        k = k + 1      Where N = M. Without the modified starting value of j of the inner value this would be of course O(N * M), but with the decreasing running time of the inner loop in every step of the outer loop I am quite confused. How can this be approached?
