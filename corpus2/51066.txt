What is the scalar product operator for complex vectors (or matrices) in Mathematica? The usual $Dot[]$ doesn't work. E.g. here is what the Mathematica gives $$\{1,0\}.\{I,0\}=I$$ but the answer should be $-I$, since the scalar product of complex vectors is defined as follows: let $$a,b∈C^n \,\,\, then \,\,(a,b)= ∑_{i=1}^na_i \bar b_i$$ where $\bar b_i$ is the complex conjugate of $b_i$.
