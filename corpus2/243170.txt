Lets say I have library "A2" as a dependency in a project. Library "A2" is derived from library "A1"(A2 is a fork of A1 with some modifications to the original source code) where someone has done few changes to the library "A1" 's source code. Lets say there is a new version of "A1" I want to use the new version but no modification to its sourcecode at all. I am planning to identify what are the changes done to the original library when deriving library "A2" out of it and decorate the latest version of the library with those changes. Is it a good approach to solve this? if not can someone suggest the best approach to solve this kind of problems?
