I would assume that instances of the same class would actually share their methods, and just have save different attributes in their namespace. How often do you arbitrary add methods to a single instance? Yet for example in Python that's not the case. Instances' methods are all different objects. Even if you decorate them as `@classmethods`, (or use `__slots__`) they seem to be different objects in memory. Can someone give me a definition of what I'm describing here, or even given same details on why this model was chosen? What happens in other languages?
