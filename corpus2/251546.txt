Sorry if my (simplified) example is too broad. Given this model (written in C#):               class Ball     {     }      Let's assume that a ball can be launched. To implement this feature, I can define something like:               class Ball     {         void Launch();     }      or something like:               class BallLauncher     {         void Launch(Ball ball);     }      In which situations is better use first approach and which the second one? In fact, this example tries to simplify an actual real underlying model. In that model, I need to upload files (`Package`) to a repository. Then, I don't know if the repository should upload (physical copy) a package (files) to itself or it is the package who should upload itself to a repository.
