We have 6 people in my group. My boss and the others are all SQL developers with little understanding of programming, design patterns, good object oriented design, etc. But, they have all taken a Java course in college. When new projects come up, I am usually asked to give a time estimate for how long my part will take. If this project is needed with quick turn around and they don't like the estimate I have given them, they will look at previous modules/portlets I have built and say things like, "It basically looks the same as Project X, so you should be able to just copy/paste that code and modify the SQL a little. You should be able to do this in 1/2 the time you gave us". Recently, it got so bad, my boss called me into a daily status update meeting with the group there, and each of the SQL developers asked me why I couldn't just copy/paste the existing code. They even `took the wiki documentation I created` from the previous projects and **began explaining my documentation to me**. Has anyone else ran into this? How do you handle this?
