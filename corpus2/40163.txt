Current implementation of `Interpolation` does not allow arbitrary precision spline interpolation. Yu-Sung Chang say here that "it is not hard to implement it manually for arbitrary precision using `BSplineBasis`." I am new to splines and not familiar with `BSplineBasis`. **What is the best way to implement arbitrary precision spline interpolation in _Mathematica_?** I am interested primarily in an analog of the `Method -> "Spline"` of `Interpolation` which I investigated in this answer (btw, what are the names of such spline and of this kind of parametrization?). Also Ｊ. Ｍ. gives in this answer interesting implementation of a spline with centripetal parametrization but it is not clear how to use it for interpolation. P.S. I need an implementation where the degree of a spline is arbitrary. At the moment I am more interested in even-degree splines.
