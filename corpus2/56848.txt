For example I have two lists of such structure               L1 = {{"Australia",a1}, {"USA",a2}, {"Norway",a3},...}     L2 = {{"Russia",b1}, {"Norway",b2}, {"Japan",b3},...}      I would like to sort countries of the list `L2` in the countries' order of `L1` to compare it entirely (I mean the values matching for each country). Thus I would like to gain something resembling this as a result where `L3` is the sorted `L2`:               L1 = {{"Australia",a1}, {"USA",a2}, {"Norway",a3},...}     L3 = {{"Australia",b26},{"USA",b13} {"Norway",b2},...}
