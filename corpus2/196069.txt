I'm writing a Web Service that will be consumed by a Mobile client. The Mobile client has to make several chained requirements checks to determine whether the user may initiate a request, and if so what type. If any of the checks fail then the user is redirected to a UI explaining why. I can't decide whether I should expose an operation for each check on my Web Service, or expose a single coarse-grained interface that simply returns all the check value results in a single DTO. Is the coarse-grained interface premature optimisation? I can always provide both the fine-grained and coarse-grained interfaces because the coarse-grained interface will use the local fine-grained methods to build its DTO.
