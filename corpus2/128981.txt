I'm a student and I've been programming for not very long. Particularly, I'm learning CodeIgniter framework - The book I'm reading is "Professional CodeIgniter". In the book, the author mentioned Agile Methodologies ( and I find it somewhat little bit difficult to understand ). I want to know if it is essential to learn the methodology first before starting to produce software or should I learn coding to be good at it first?
