So usually when working with the MVC you have a controller that controls the input a model that process it and makes it ready for the user and a view that display the "result" to the user. Now when creating this pattern you seperate the code into their relevant place. for instance the controller code goes into the controller, the gui code goes into the view and so on. Now my question is if we look at all of the design patterns out there for instance the observer pattern. How would you apply such pattern to a code structure that already implements the MVC pattern? for that case many of the other patterns aswell such as composite, factory and command pattern? Doesnt the structure of the MVC pattern make it harder to implement other good pratice design patterns?
