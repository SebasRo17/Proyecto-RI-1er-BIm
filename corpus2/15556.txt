I have a $N \times M$ list of lists, or rather, a list of records and I want to map a function over its columns (e.g. find the mean temperature, age, etc.). `Map` would apply the function to each list within the list, but I want to slice vertically, rather than horizontally. How can I do this? Example: Return a list of means for `{{1, 4, 7}, {2, 5, 8}, { 3, 6, 9}}` rather than `{1,2,3}`, etc. The list:               {{1, 2, 3},       {4, 5, 6},      {7, 8, 9}}
