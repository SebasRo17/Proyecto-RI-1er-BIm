I'm working on a report which needs to explain in non-technical terms the effects of a cumulative error, and why it is of importance to use absolute calculations. Definition of 'cumulative error' from dictionary.com: > an error that gradually increases in degree or significance during a series > of measurements or calculations; an error that grows during observation Ideally I could give **a real world example** so they grasp the concept of it without knowing about the specifics. The first one I though of is 'Chinese whispers' which is pretty well known, but I wouldn't exactly classify it as 'real world'. Does anybody know of better examples?
