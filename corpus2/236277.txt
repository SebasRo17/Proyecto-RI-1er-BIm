The project I'm currently working on has an issue: bugs and tasks are often assigned to people who are too new or too inexperienced and their work ends up producing more bugs down the road. The problem is that parts of our software are much more "dangerous" to work on than others due to code quality issues. I've been trying to combat this issue by estimating the risk associated with tasks and paying close attention to which developers get assigned which tasks. We use JIRA so I started labeling issues to keep track of this estimation. I've noticed that I've ended up using several metrics to categorize a bug/task:   * How clear/straightforward it is. E.g. whether it's something that will need a lot of design work or just a simple UI bug fix.   * How maintainable the affected area of the code is. Is it a well-designed area or a big ball of mud.   * How much of the program I think will be affected by the required change. My labels are kind of messy since I didn't have a clear idea when I started what the possible categories would be and I still don't. I'm thinking about requesting a new field be added (something like "Risk") so that we can require an estimate before assigning the work to someone. Has anyone dealt with this sort of thing before?
