I was reading the Scrum documents and it says that the tasks in Sprint should be "potentially shippable". I am confused by what this means. Suppose in Sprint 1 the goal was, "user registration form". How much detail do I need to add for something to be ready to ship? For example:   1. I can show the simple form with fields without any fancy styling and mark them as done   2. I can just do client side validation as mark as done but server side is also the option or both   3. I can also add some jQuery fancy tool tips, hover overs, captcha, colors, labels for the form   4. Then there is whole lot of styling about how to show error messages on screen I can do endlessly on one topic. So how do we divide that and when I can think of that as shipping ready. Or do I need to write each smallest possible thing like showing errors, popup or light box text as subtasks and put them as sprint. This would lead to 1000s of tasks for whole project. I mean then again if some work for Internet Explorer and some for Firefox then again do I need to divide those as tasks as well. Time has to be spent on them and when manager asks me what you did in that time, I won't have any tasks to tell but in reality they all are part of User registration
