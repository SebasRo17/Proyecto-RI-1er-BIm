Do I have to clear all my definitions whenever I experiment with different parameter values for my model? For example, I have a simple model as follows:               w[t_]:=w[t]=w[t-1]+h     w[0]=0         h = 5      I want to do:               Table[w[t], {t, 0, 10}]      with varying h. But every time I change h, I have to clear the definitions with               Clear["Global`*"]      Otherwise, the result for w[t] remains the same. This practice is ok with this simple model. But when the model is pretty big, it really is time-consuming. I was expecting to get a new result directly by changing h. Any helpful comments in this direction?
