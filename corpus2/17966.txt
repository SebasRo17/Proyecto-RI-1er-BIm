This crashes my kernel               Compile[{{x, _Real}, {center, _Real, 1}, {point, _Real, 1}},      (1` + (x - 1`) Exp[-Norm[point - center] 10`]),      RuntimeAttributes -> Listable][3`, {0`, 0`}, {{1`, 1`}, {{1`, 1`}}}]      Changing the input parameters doesn't seem to change anything. Changing `(x - 1`)` to `x` or to `(3` - 1`)` solves it. Passing a proper matrix `{{1`, 1`}, {1`, 1`}}` solves it too. Removing the `10`` solves it too What could be going on?
