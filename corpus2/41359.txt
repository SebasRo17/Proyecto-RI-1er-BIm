I often have data in the form of               YEAR    JAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC     1950    -1.022  -1.146  -1.289  -1.058  -1.419  -1.36   -1.334  -1.05   -0.578  -0.395  -1.151  -1.248     1951    -1.068  -1.196  -1.208  -0.437  -0.273  0.48    0.747   0.858   0.776   0.75    0.729   0.466     1952    0.406   0.131   0.086   0.262   -0.267  -0.634  -0.231  -0.156  0.362   0.309   -0.34   -0.124     1953    0.024   0.379   0.263   0.712   0.84    0.241   0.416   0.253   0.524   0.092   0.049   0.314     -0.093  -0.312     and so on ...      I want to convert this into time/value tuples of the type that can be easily plotted using DateListPlot. I have written some very hackish code that does the job, but it feels messy and unsatisfactory. Does anyone know of an elegant 'Mathematica' way to do this?
