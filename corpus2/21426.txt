I tried               Plot3D[Exp[-x^2 - y^2], {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2},      ColorFunction -> (ColorData["TemperatureMap"][#3] &),      PlotLegends -> Automatic]      in an attempt to add a colorbar legend to the plot, but this did not work. It did work here:               DensityPlot[Exp[-x^2 - y^2], {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2},      ColorFunction -> "SunsetColors",      PlotLegends -> Automatic]      Any suggestions in how I can get it to work in the first bit of code? Thanks.
