I've read a lot about TDD and I've tried to develop using TDD without success ... I always stop staring at the screen... I've learned that I should not write tests for methods or class. I should write tests for behaviors. That's because objects interact with each other and this interaction should be tested. Following the example bellow: > Imagine that, I, as a company owner, would like to save my customers > information to consult that later. That's my business value. Just to learn, I would not like to use any framework or library, just plain PHP and PHPUnit. Ok, now, where should I start? I think that my users must enter an url to go to the form ... So should I test if it's loading the page? Is this a good start? If it's true, how could I test it?
