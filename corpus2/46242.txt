Suppose that I use `Graphics`, `Text`, and `Style` to type one letter in the subscript of a letter and one in the superscript of the same letter. In the Writing Assistant in Mathematica 9, I click the ![button](http://i.stack.imgur.com/P8OSX.png) button to help typeset the string in this command:               Graphics[Text[       Style["\!\(\*SubsuperscriptBox[\(A\), \(B\), \(C\)]\)", 30,         FontFamily -> "Arial"]]]      The graphical output is the following. ![example](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Dic0L.png) Why do the letters A, B, and C appear italic, even though I did not specify them as such? I want the letters to all be regular font. The italicization does not happen if I take out the `Graphics` directive, and just use `Text` and `Style`. But I have to use `Graphics` because I will ultimately include it in a plot.
