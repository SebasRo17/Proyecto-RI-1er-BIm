Let's assume I want (for fun at start) to play with some new DSL (domain specific language) idea. And I really want its user[s] (probably only me at first) to interact thru a web interface. I'll probably implement it in C++ (probably using LLVM). Should I use an HTTP server library (like libonion or microhttpd) to talk directly HTTP or should I use FastCGI? I could also use libraries doing both like cppcms or wt... In particular, I am noticing that several recent web frameworks (Opa, Ocsigen, ...) do not have any FastCGI interface but only HTTP one.... (but Ur/Web seems to have both) So my feeling is that FastCGI is really out of fashion.... Any opinions on that? Do you know recently started project using FastCGI ? (and what about SCGI?)
