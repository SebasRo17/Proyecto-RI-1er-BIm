The equation $$ \sin x + \sqrt{3} \cos x = 1,$$ where $x \in [-2\pi, 2\pi]$ has four roots $-\dfrac{3\pi}{2}$, $\dfrac{\pi}{2}$, $\dfrac{\pi}{2}$ and $\dfrac{11\pi}{6}$. Sum of roots of the given equation is $\dfrac{2\pi}{3}$. How do I tell Mathematica to do that? I tried               Solve[{Sin[x] + Sqrt[3]*Cos[x] == 1, -2*\[Pi] <= x <= 2*\[Pi]}, {x}]         **edit** from comment I repaired the given equation to               Solve[{Sin[x] + Sqrt[3]Cos[x] == 1, -2[Pi] <= x <= 2*[Pi]}, {x}]       and used               Simplify@Total[ x /. Solve[{Sin[x] + Sqrt[3] Cos[x] == 2, -2 Pi <= x <= 2 Pi}, {x}]],       and I got the answer               -4 [Pi] + 8 ArcTan[1/(2 + Sqrt[3])].        How do I get the answer -((5 [Pi])/3)?
