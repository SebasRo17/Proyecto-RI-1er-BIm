In the application database there is a configuration table with this schema: Table: ReleaseProperty   1. ReleasePropertyID   2. ReleaseID   3. Name   4. Value Currently to retrieve a specific property I pass to the Repository class the arguments ReleaseID (that come from the current web page address) and a Name, that is basically hard coded E.g.               var property = ReleasePropertyRepository.Select(ReleaseID, "MyProperty");      I don't like to use hard coded strings around my code, and the only idea to improve the quality of this code is to use a container class for constants.               var property = ReleasePropertyRepository.Select(ReleaseID, Constants.MyProperty);      Is there any other way to develop a better code?
