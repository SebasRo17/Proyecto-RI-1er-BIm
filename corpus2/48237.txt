My friends and I have been struggling to classify exactly what is an integration test. Now, on my way home, I just realised, that every time I try to give a real world example of an integration test, it turns out to be an acceptance test, ie. something that a business person would say out loud that specs out what the system should be delivering. I checked the Ruby on Rails documentation for their classification of these testing types, and it's now completely thrown me. Can you give me a short academic description of an integration test with a real world example?
