I would to select the first valley of the list of coordinates below. It should be `{3, 1}`.               list = {{1, 7}, {2, 4}, {3, 1}, {4, 4}, {5, 9}, {6, 8}, {7, 3}, {8, 1}, {9, 4}, {10, 9}};      I thought it could be done like this               Select[list, #1[[2]] > #2[[2]] &, 1]      but that does not work. How can it be done then?
