I have a problem: Now Microsoft has changed, and in respect with the C++ Standard, and starting from from Visual Studio 2005 now:   * Access Violation are not to be catched in `catch(...)` However, if one compile with `/EHsc` or other similar flags under VS2003 and before, then Access Violation are really caught in `catch(...)`. Yes, really. In my new company, they have protected their whole application accordingly. And now I have a **whole application** with hundreds, maybe thousands, of `catch(...)` compiled in VS2003. Those `catch` don't put an end to the process. Sometimes they hopefully trace something like "unexpected error in...", but only sometimes. How can I explain to them it's plain wrong ? That it hides corruptions until a point where it's impossible to tell what is going wrong ?
