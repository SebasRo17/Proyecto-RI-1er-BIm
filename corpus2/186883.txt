My coworker who is a senior guy is blocking me on a code review because he wants me to name a method 'PerformSqlClient216147Workaround' because it's a workaround for some defect ###. Now, my method name proposal is something like PerformRightExpressionCast which tends to describe what the method actually does. His arguments go along the line of: "Well this method is used only as a workaround for this case, and nowhere else." Would including the bug number inside of the method name for a temporary workaround be considered bad practice?
