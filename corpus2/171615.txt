In refactoring code, I came across code that had comments. Looking closer at the comments, I could see that the code was clearly not doing what the comments said. **Without access to the coder nor documentation** , and without clear direction regarding the code (i.e. defects as to the fact that the code is operating incorrectly), is the best practice to assume that the code is correct, and clean up the comments?
