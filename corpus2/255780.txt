AFAIK there's just `java.util.Formatter` and `java.text.Format` and AFAIK none of them is extensible. I mean not subclassing, but the possibility to specify how to handle objects by class, e.g., saying > please format `char[]` as string and > format `byte[]` in hex It's no big deal to do it manually, but it's verbose and then the `Formatter` (or `String.format`) make little sense if I have to do half the work manually (`java.text.Format` is a different story as it's meant for i18n). Also things like               String.format("%1$tY-%1$tm-%1$te", new Date())      aren't exactly appealing. So I'm asking for ideas how to create such a thing, e.g., how to structure it and possibly what else should it do.
