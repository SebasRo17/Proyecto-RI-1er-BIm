This is a question driven by curiosity. I am learning Oracle database and Oracle database handles Blob data in a separate tablespace, which I believe reduces overhead while trying to read large Blob data. I am wondering how MySQL handles Blob? I am actually planning to start a project and I wish to give a try on saving images in MySQL databases instead of standard approach of saving files in the file system. Thank you.
