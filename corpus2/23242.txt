I'm currently trying to use data gathered as a function of time (here, the fluorescence of a biological sample), but am new to _Mathematica_ and don't know how to properly specify axis relations (and units, etc.). Using ExcelLink 3.5, I've imported the data for one of many drugs whose effect on the fluorescence function I want to analyze. Because of how the information was imported, the listed data I've collected for $f(t)$ is in a list, with no reference to what the independent variable (x-axis) values should be. I made my plot with               ListPlot[{28,32,37,66}]      producing x-axis values of `{1, 2, 3, 4}` by default, and not t in minutes, which would be `{300, 600, 1200, 1440}` in my case). How can I make a plot with the proper x-axis values?
