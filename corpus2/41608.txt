Suppose I have function, which is in fact a list of $n$ functions with $n$ parameters               f = {#1 + #2^2 + #3^3, #1^2 + #2^3 + #3^4, #1^3 + #2^4 + #3^5}&      I want to get a function that is in fact matrix of all possible partial derivations $ \left( \begin{array}{ccc} \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_2} & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_3} \\\ \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_2} & \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_3} \\\ \frac{\partial f_3}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial f_3}{\partial x_2} & \frac{\partial f_3}{\partial x_3} \end{array} \right)$ , i.e               g = {{1,2#1,3#1^2},{2#2,3#2^2,4#2^3},{3#3^2,4#3^3,5#3^4}}&      I tried to do that myself by adapting the answer Find partial derivatives when the number of variables is unknown, but I don't understand the cumulative use of `Apply`, `Seqence` and `Map`.
