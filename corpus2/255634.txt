I built an ASP.NET MVC application, and now I want to move it to Amazon AWS from my development server. My question is: How does one migrate an ASP.NET application to Amazon AWS? Here is what I have researched/found so far:   * Sessions don't work across instances, so I need to use DynamoDB or memcached to store state. I looked into various clients like Enyim as a possible solution to the session state problem using Amazon ElastiCloud.   * Amazon has a web service for SMTP emails. So I will need to rework the code that sends SMTP emails to send through Amazon SES, and reroute incoming emails to a separate mail server by changing the DNS records.   * There's an SDK for managing user identity (Amazon IAM). I will need to change the authentication code to use this web service. Perhaps there are more points that I am unaware of. So, how does one migrate an MVC app to AWS?
