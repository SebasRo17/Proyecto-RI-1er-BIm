I have a rather simple question, but I have not been able to figure out how to implement a solution in _Mathematica_. I would like to define a variable size square matrix, say an N x N matrix A, whose entries A_ij are of the form Kroneceker-delta_ij (N+1-2k)/2. (In fact, the matrices I want to deal with are N dimensional irreducible representations of SU(2)). Eventually, I would like to compute traces of products of certain matrices, but I can not even get tr(IdentityMatrix[N] = N) to work. How should I approach this problem?
