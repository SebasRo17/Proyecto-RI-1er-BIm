I am trying to get my head wrapped around OOP after programming in more procedural languages for a number of years. My question: What is the best practice for handling variable values outside of source code? For example, I have file directory values and regex patterns that may need to be manually changed from time to time. I would like to avoid changing these values directly in the source code. I am thinking of creating a text file that will hold key/value pairs. I would then create an object to set these values so that they can be referenced by any methods in my code. Is this the right approach or am I violating any OOP principles? Thanks
