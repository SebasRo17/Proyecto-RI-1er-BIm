I'm developing a .Net application that uses google protocol buffers. Historically the application used the approach, advocated by the protobuf-net team, of decorating the classes with attributes instead of using .proto files. I am now in the process of migrating part of the application's client to another technology and there is a strong desire to start using the .proto files as the authority so that the two technologies can inter-operate. My plan is to automatically generate the C# from the .proto, however, my question is should I check the resulting files back into source control? Note I expect the process of code generation to be fast. How do I choose appropriate approach for above case? What is considered the best practice?
