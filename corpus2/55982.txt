I discovered by playing around that               Text[DisplayForm@SubscriptBox["\[Lambda]", "k"]]      produces the same result as               Text["\*SubscriptBox[\"\[Lambda]\", \"k\"]"]      and, further, that the `\\*` is essential. This finding suggests that `\\*` means `DisplayForm` when inside a string. After more playing around, I found that               Text["\!\(\*SubscriptBox[\"\[Lambda]\", \"k\"]\)"]      produces the same result, but only if you have the bang _and_ the parens, that is, that `\\!` and `\\(`+`\\)` are _both_ necessary; either construct alone will not work. Where can I find the documentation for this magic? I don't know what to search for because I don't know what these kinds of constructs are called.
