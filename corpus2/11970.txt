I find the default Mathematica IDE lacking. I am missing a simple project file tree on the left (as in eclipse, visual studio etc.) The following would be very cool: All your files (in a given directory) would be displayed in a Mathematica Palette. Clicking them changes to the clicked file or opens it. Has anyone seen something like this? Can anyone put together a quick proof of concept? It should not be that difficult ...
