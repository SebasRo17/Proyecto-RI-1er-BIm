A couple of months ago I moved to Germany. Taking some projects on my own, I've recently had the opportunity to develop with a company-based framework, that was very well documented, but in German. My German is pretty good, however my programming terminology is somewhat lacking. Long story short, I was wondering, how common is it to document code in a language other than English? Sorry to seem English-centeric but it seems like a bad habit.
