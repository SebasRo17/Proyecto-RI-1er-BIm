I want to find x on curve $y(x)$, where curve $y(x)$ is perpendicular to point $(x_0,y_0)$. for this I minimize the distance between points $(x,y(x))$ and $(x_0,y_0)$, here's an example for point $x_0=4,y_0=3$.               y[x_] := 2 + 0.36 x     NMinimize[(4 - x)^2 + (3 - y[x])^2, x]      But somehow this does not give the right answer though _Mathematica_ seems to be finding the right minimum.               {0.171388, {x -> 3.85977}}      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6pITB.jpg) **Update:** In a more practical case, with `Ei` some data to be fitted, and `sol2` the fitted coefficients of `U[...]` (refer to the end of the question for detail), this is what I tried:               Do[      int = FindMinimum[{(Ei[1][[1, 2]] - U[x, 1] /. sol2[[2]])^2 + (i - x)^2}, x];      AppendTo[perpendicular, int],       {i, 1, 30}]          cc =        ListPlot[{         Evaluate @ Table[{i, Ei[1][[i, 2]]}, {i, 15, 23}],          Evaluate @           Table[{x, U[x, 1] /. sol2[[2]]} /. perpendicular[[i, 2]], {i, 15, 23}]},          Filling -> {1 -> {2}},          PlotRange -> {0, 5},          AspectRatio -> Automatic];          qq =        Plot[U[x, 1] /. sol2[[2]], {x, 15, 23},          PlotRange -> {0, 5},          AspectRatio -> Automatic];      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tn09u.jpg) This is the fitting function:               U[r_, o_] :=        Sum[-ehh (1 - (1 - Exp[-Ahh (raa[i, j, o] - rshh)])^2), {i, 2,            5}, {j, 7, 10}] +          Sum[-ech (1 - (1 - Exp[-Ach (raa[i, j, o] - rsch)])^2), {i, 1,            1}, {j, 7, 10}] +          Sum[-ech (1 - (1 - Exp[-Ach (raa[i, j, o] - rsch)])^2), {i, 2,            5}, {j, 6, 6}] -          ecc (1 - (1 - Exp[-Acc (raa[1, 6, o] - rscc)])^2) /. x -> r;      And this the the fitted coefficients:               sol2 = {ehh -> -4.07603, Ahh -> 3.75309, rshh -> 1.44794, ech -> 0.223024,              Ach -> 1.51935, rsch -> 2.84276, ecc -> -4.52077, Acc -> 2.99396,              rscc -> 2.60361}
