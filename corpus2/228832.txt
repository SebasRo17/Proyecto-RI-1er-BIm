I'm implementing the Chessboard class to represent the chessboard. I've to implement the **transformations** (reflections and rotations) on the chess board possible. The possible transformations includes the combination of:                1. Vertical Reflection      2. Horizontal Reflection      3. Diagonal Reflection      Thus, we've **8** possible transformations for chess board. There are **64** squares on the Chessboard numbered **[0..63]**. Thus, to represent the total resulting values after the transformations is **8*64** (No.of Transformations * Chessboard_Size). There are two fundamental ways to represent the **transformed_board** using Arrays:               One-Dimensional Array with transformed_board[8*64]     Two-Dimensional Array with transformed_board[8][64]      **Questions** :   * Which approach is better?   * What are the pros and cons of each approach?   * How will effect the performance with respect to time factor?
