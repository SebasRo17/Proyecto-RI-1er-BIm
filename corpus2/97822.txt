I've been learning C++ for about a month now, and before I go any further, I'd like to clear up this tedious question I keep on having. I know what a GUI is, but I don't really know how it works, and maybe examples of popular ones? Although I know command line programming is the bare fundamentals, I think it'd be fun messing around with a GUI. Although I have around 3 million other questions, I'll save them :D
