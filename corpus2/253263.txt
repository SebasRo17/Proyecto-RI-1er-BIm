Who exactly presented the idea that letter "X" should be used for closing/exiting a window or an application? According to Medium.com, > The first appearance of [x] in GUI design was likely the **Atari TOS** , > possibly influenced by the Japanese **batsu** and **maru** conventions. > Thanks to a last minute design change in **Windows 95** , and the mass > adoption of Windows worldwide, [x] has become the standard symbol for > ‘close’, a symbol that dominates web, app and software design today. It is stating that letter "x" for closing/exiting a app originated around 1995 but according to my senior, letter "x" for exit was used first in 1980's in **wordstar 4** on CP/M OS. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/aDnDY.png)
