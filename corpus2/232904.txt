My web application calls a third party API. If I successfully call the API but invalid data is returned which cannot be processed by my system what is the most appropriate HttpCode to return to the user calling me?   * 500, I'm not convinced. Although it was an internal error it's due to external factors   * 503, Perhaps, although very vague   * 400, 4XX errors are usually related to the client contacting our server and so could be misleading. Which is the most appropriate response to return to my client?
