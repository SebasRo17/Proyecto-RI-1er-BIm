Is there an easy way to get Mathematica to numerically solve a compatible system of overdetermined PDE, and plot the solutions? For example, consider the "toy" example $\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial x} = (1+x y^2) u, \qquad \dfrac{\partial u}{\partial y} = (1+y x^2) u$ with initial data, say, $u(0,0)=1$. (The actual system I want to solve is nonlinear and has many more dependent variables.) One could apply NDSolve to the first equation, with $y=0$, to get $f(x)=u(x,0)$ defined over the $x$-axis. Then for each of several values $x_i$, solve the second equation with $x=x_i$ and initial value $u(x_i,0)=f(x_i)$. This produces a family of interpolating functions, each of which is a snapshot of $u(x,y)$ for some fixed value of $x$. But I'd like to put the plots of these together to form the graph of a function of two variables. Better yet, I'd like some way of automating this, so I don't have to choose the values $x_i$ by hand.
