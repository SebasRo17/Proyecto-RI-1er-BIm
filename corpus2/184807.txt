ISTQB does not distinct between these (it reads "Branch/decision coverage") but some sources do say it is different. I would have two question. The essential one is about the difference. And the other one - does this whole concept belongs under the unit testing? Or white box testing? Thanks From the ISTQB: > branch coverage is closely related to decision coverage and at 100% coverage > they give exactly the same results. Decision coverage measures the coverage > of conditional branches; branch coverage measures the coverage of both > conditional and unconditional branches. The Syllabus uses decision coverage, > as it is the source of the branches. Some coverage measurement tools may > talk about branch coverage when they actually mean decision coverage.
