I built a simple burn down chart with Google Spreadsheet, as shown below. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IfXtt.png) The project consists of 99 tasks. And the user finished 5 tasks on the first day. So the "Actual Tasks Remaining" point is below the "Ideal Tasks Remaining" point on the first day, which is different from the burn down chart shown in the Wikipedia at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn_down_chart. I'm wondering whether I should add a date before the first date so that the "Actual Tasks Remaining" point will overlap the "Ideal Tasks Remaining" point on the first day.
