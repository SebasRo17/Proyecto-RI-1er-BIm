Thought this is a rather simple thing, but I was not able to find a solution: I have a _polynomial_ expression like:                expr1=a^2-b+c*d      expr2=a-b      expr3=-a+b-c      and i want to replace every negative sign to Plus                expr1new=a^2+b+c*d      expr2new=a+b      expr3=a+b+c      The problem is that               FullForm[a-b]     (* Plus[a, Times[-1, b]] *)      thus I cannot use simple replacement. Do you know a simple way for that? **Update** This example does not work with simple replacements:               expr4 = (1 - I) a;     expr4 /. {-1 -> 1}     FullForm[expr4]          (* (1 - I) a     Times[Complex[1, -1], a] *)
