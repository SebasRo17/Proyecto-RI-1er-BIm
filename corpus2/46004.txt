While discussing a question about virtual functions on Stack Overflow, I wondered whether there was any official naming for pure (abstract) and non- pure virtual functions. I always relied on wikipedia for my information, which states that pure and non-pure virtual functions are the general term. Unfortunately, the article doesn't back it up with a origin or references. To quote Jon Skeet's answer to my reply that pure and non-pure are the general term used: > @Steven: Hmm... possibly, but I've only ever seen it in the context of C++ > before. I suspect anyone talking about them is likely to have a C++ > background :) Did the terms originate from C++, or were they first defined or implemented in a earlier language, and are they the 'official' scientific terms? UPDATE: Frank Shearar helpfully provided a link to the description of the SIMULA 67 Common Base Language (1970). This language seems to be the first language to introduce OO keywords as _class_ , _object_ , and also **virtual** as a formal concept. It **doesn't** define _pure/non-pure_ or _abstract_ , but **it does support the concepts**. Who defined them?
