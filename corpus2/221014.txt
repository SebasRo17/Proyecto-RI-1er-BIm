I have inherited an application that stores data in multiple tables in Microsoft Access; the Access DB is only used for storage, all data processing is handled by the app (VB.net). Is this good practice? I need to build a similar app from scratch and am unsure of what is 'normal' practice. I have tried Googling the question in various formats and checked through numerous results (including many on this forum) but all questions seem to relate to where you are programming within Access rather than simply using it for data storage. I guess I could be more specific and say would SQL Server Express or similar be a better option and if so why?
