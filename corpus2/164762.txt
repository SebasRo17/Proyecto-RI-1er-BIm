My company has many clients wanting mobile applications and having the payments come into our account and then sorting the payments would be a real pain. So can a company have a main account to publish applications (free and chargeable) and still have some sort of client account for each app (so they could view sales and receive full payment directly)? I would like to know for Windows, Android and Apple please.
