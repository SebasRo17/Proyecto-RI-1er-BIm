When certain parts of code are unusual or unclear, common practice is to leave a comment explaining why it is so. However, sometimes a filesystem may have unusual configuration, such as a directory with 0477 privileges. **Is there any convention for leaving comments about this?** I am writing a 'Developers Wiki' for the company as that would be the place for such things. However I would prefer something **more standard if it exists** and more accessible when, for instance, the next guys has to SSH in from home in the middle of the night and he might not think to check the wiki (or even have access to it).
