I'm working on Android application development. There is a question that always comes to my mind that: How XML interacts with Java code?. I mean `Button` inside XML is a view, but `Button` inside Java is a class. For populating and XML layout we use `setContentView(R.layout.name)`. What I want to know is how this XML code interacts with Java, what technique is used and what code is behind this. If any know please tell me in brief.
