I'm trying to take a formula, take it's integral which yields a formula with logarithms, and then directly plug in values with units and get an answer. However if the units go into any of the logarithms I get conditional expressions. Is it possible to set up the equations so I can just plug in units? Here's my code:               Pideal[n_, T_, V_] := (n*R*T)/V     PvdW[n_, T_, V_, a_: a, b_: b] := (n*R*T)/(V - n*b) - (n^2*a)/V^2     W[V1_, V2_, P_] := Integrate[P, {V, V1, V2}]     Wideal[V1_, V2_, n_: n, T_: T] = W[V1, V2, Pideal[n, T, V]]      Here's the problem spot:               Wideal[5 Liters, 10 Liters, 1 Mols, 298 Kelvins]      I can work around this fairly easily, just leave out the Liters because they cancel out anyway. (`Liters = Quantity["Liters"]`, etc) However when I get to a more complicated equation that doesn't work so easily without making sure to put back in what I leave out.               WvdW[V1_, V2_, n_: n, T_: T, a_: a, b_: b] =          W[V1, V2, PvdW[n, T, V, a, b]]     WvdW[5*Liters, 10*Liters, 1 Mols, 298 Kelvins, 0, 0]      This doesn't work for the same reason, even though the Liters cancel out Mathematica doesn't assume that. However if I leave them out, I still have problems with the Mols, which appear in and outside of Logarithms, even though they're multiplied by 0.               WvdW[5, 10, 1 Mols, 298 Kelvins, 0, 0]      Finally, I haven't even gotten to using b which also appears in the logarithm, and even though the volumes add up and cancel out, Mathematica doesn't assume so.               WvdW[V1*Liters, V2*Liters, 1 Mols, 298 Kelvins, 0, 0 Mols Liters^(-1)]
