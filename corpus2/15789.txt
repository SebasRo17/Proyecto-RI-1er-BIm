> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Preserving labels when using graph functions I'm using               g = SocialMediaData["Twitter", "FriendNetwork"]       to get a nice graph with tooltips for the vertices, etc. Next, I get the weakly connected components via               wcc = WeaklyConnectedComponents[g]      and then I do               sg = Subgraph[g, wcc[[1]]]      to get the largest component. But, all the properties are gone in `sg`, i.e. I no longer have the tooltips, etc. Any suggestions?
