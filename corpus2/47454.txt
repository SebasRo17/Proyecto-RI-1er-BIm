I'm essentially doing coin flips, using RandomReal to populate a bunch of lists, each with 8 elements. I then want to select only those lists for which all elements are greater than a certain number, e.g. .5. So far I have this:               class = RandomReal[1, {100, 8}];     pass = Select[class, #[[1]] > (.5) &]      but this doesn't work. I suspect a simple Select function would do the trick, but I can't seem to get the syntax right to test every element of the nested listed against a certain number and then only return those lists for which every element passes. Or indeed simply to return the number of sublists for which every element passes. Thanks.
