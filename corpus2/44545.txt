I am trying to generate a plot for `S2[w]`. My code is below               L := 50     Umc := 4.31     Su[ω_, σ_, τ_] := (σ^2 *τ/π )*1/(1 \     + (τ *ω)^2)     Sw[ω_, σ_, τ_] := (σ^2 *τ/(2*π \     ))*(1 + 3*(τ* ω)^2)/(1 + (τ*ω)^2)^2          Ru[s_] := InverseFourierTransform[Su[ω, 1, L/Umc], ω, s]          S2 [ω_] := Integrate[Ru[s]*Cos[2*ω*s], {s, 0, Infinity}]          Plot[S2[ω] , {ω, 0, 1}]      I have no idea what I am doing wrong. The function outputs number for the prescribed range when I tested. Your help would be much appreciated. Thanks!
