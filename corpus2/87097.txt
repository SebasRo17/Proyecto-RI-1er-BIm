My brother has come up with an interesting business idea that could be commercialised. For over a month I have been creating the foundation for SaaS. I have been treating this as commercial project so designing using patterns and best practices. One of the reasons I want to include this in my Resume is my full time job doesn't involve current trendy ASP.Net technologies (e.g Linq/Entity Relationships, jQuery, ASP.Net MVC 3, Silverlight, etc) so the resume lacks impact. In my full time job I work on a 7 year old well designed product and since our data and web layers work well it would be stupid to re-engineer them only because recruiters think Linq, ASP.Net MVC and jQuery are cool. How can I include my personal project in Resume so that it doesn't sound like experiment or quick'n'dirty pet project?
