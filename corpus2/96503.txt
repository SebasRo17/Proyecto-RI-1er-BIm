I'm heading into my first job (i.e. they're bringing me on for a full position) in Software Development and am quite nervous about how the whole salary negotiation thing goes. Glassdoor.com says that my position for my (lack of) experience offers something ridiculously high like 85k. Salary.com says that Software Developers with no experience in my location get about 65k. From some research, I know I shouldn't say a number before they do. But let's say they offer me _Xk_. What should I counter with? Do I say things like "My research shows that people around my experience level for this position at this company earn much more...", etc?
