I have typically used PowerPoint or plain PDFs of slides to give presentations, but with heavy mathematical content, it can be tedious to create these presentations and make them look good. How can I best make use of Mathematica to give presentations? (I would prefer a slide-by-slide type format to what I've seen a few people doâ€”using a regular notebook with the font size pumped up and collapsing/expanding sections as they go along.)
