I would like to evaluate $$s = 1 - \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{7}-\frac{1}{8} - ... + \frac{(-1)^{\textrm{binary digit sum}(n-1)}}{n} + ... $$ where the signs follow the Thue-Morse sequence. When I try to evaluate `Sum[ (-1)^Total[ IntegerDigits[ n - 1, 2]]/n, {n, 1, ∞}]` using _Mathematica 7_ I get > >     Log[2] >   This is incorrect. $$\log( 2) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n} \approx 0.693147$$ but $$s \approx 0.39876108810841881241$$ I checked this using _C#_ and finite sums within _Mathematica_. This value is not in the inverse symbolic calculator, but since that is incomplete I still have some hope for an analytic summation. The difference between these series can be expressed as a sum of positive terms $$\frac{2}{3\times 4} + \frac{2}{5\times 6} + \frac{2}{9\times 10} + \frac{2}{15\times 16}+\ldots+\frac{2}{n \times (n+1)}+ \ldots$$ where the sum is over all odd $n$ with even binary digit sum, so it is definitely the case that $s \lt \log( 2).$ I also tried `Sum[ (-1)^Total[ IntegerDigits[ n - 1, 2]]/n, { n, 1, ∞, 2}]` which equals $\frac{3}{2}s \approx 0.59814163216262821861$, but which instead evaluates to > >     Sum::div: Sum does not converge >   >     Sum[ (-1)^(1 + n)/n, { n, 1, ∞, 2}] >   So, is this a known bug?   What sorts of related sums are affected?   Is there a way to get the right answer from _Mathematica_?
