Is booth algorithm for multiplication only for multiplying 2 negative numbers `(-3 * -4)` or one positive and one negative number `(-3 * 4)` ? Whenever i multiply 2 positive numbers using booth algorithm i get a wrong result. example : 5 * 4 A = 101 000 0 `// binary of 5 is 101` S = 011 000 0 `// 2's complement of 5 is 011` P = 000 100 0 `// binary of 4 is 100` x = 3 y = 3 m = 5 -m = 2's complement of m r = 4   1. After right shift of P by 1 bit 0 000 100   2. After right shift of P by 1 bit 0 000 010   3. P+S = 011 001 0 After right shift by 1 bit 0 011 001   4. Discarding the LSB 001100 But that comes out to be the binary of 12 . It should have been 20(010100)
