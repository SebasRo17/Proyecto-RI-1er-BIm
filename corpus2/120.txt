In my investigation of the possibilities offered by the Notation package, I came over a limitation in the complexity of the left hand side symbol. For instance, although I am able to enter                Notation[        ParsedBoxWrapper[          OverBar[SuperStar[af]]]        \[DoubleLongLeftRightArrow]        ParsedBoxWrapper["afstarbar"]]      without Mathematica complaining, **evaluating** `afstarbar` **returns an incorrectly formatted symbol** (the whole symbol is replaced by a red error square instead of displaying $\overline{af^*}$). The output is:                OverBar[SuperStar[$CellContext`af]]           An unknown box name (OverBar) was sent as the BoxForm for the expression.      Check the format rules for the expression.      I am unfamiliar with the concept of "boxing", but I tried the following:               Notation[       ParsedBoxWrapper[         MakeBoxes[           OverBar[SuperStar[af]]]]       \[DoubleLongLeftRightArrow]       ParsedBoxWrapper["afstarbar"]]      And the display is slightly better, as the $af^*$ is here, but the bar is replaced by the red error square and the output is:               \!\(\*OverscriptBox[     SuperscriptBox[\(af\), \(*\)],      Notation`Private`singleBlank[]]\)          An unknown box name (Notation`Private`singleBlank) was sent as the BoxForm      for the expression. Check the format rules for the expression.      Any trick on how to get the symbol to display correctly with the Notation package?
