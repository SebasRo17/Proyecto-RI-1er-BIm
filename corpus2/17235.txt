I want to make a sequence like follows               r[1]=     r[2]=     r[3]=     r[4]=     ....     r[n]=      The above `r[i]` represents coordinates which I have to type in manually one by one. So I make such a sequence to make the typing easier and more confortable. (even without having to type the `=`, I am so lazy, I admit). If the problem involve n coordinate, I just generate a sequence of length n. So I naively write as follows               Table[r[i]= ,{i,1,n}]//TableForm      But with `=` there, I can't make such a list. So how could I generate a sequence of such incomplete expressions (like the above expressions, the `=` has no right side, this makes _Mathematica_ can't table it)?
