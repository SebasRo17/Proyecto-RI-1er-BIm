It seems like there are a plethora of methods for dialing in and checking out what's going on on a client's PC. But they seem to boil down to just 2. Dialing in and checking it out with VNC and Remote Desktop. VNC seems abysmal with more graphics laden OS's and it sometimes is too much to ask to get a access to a terminal server (especially when the client doesn't have one). What other methods are out there for connecting with clients to diagnose and fix bugs they they can reproduce, but may not necessarily be able to adequately describe over the phone. Alternatives to VNC and Remote Desktop are appreciated, but really looking for a better way to do it than just to dial in and check it out - or the most effective way to use VNc and Remote Desktop.
