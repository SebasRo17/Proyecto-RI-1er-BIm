## Context I am using _Mathematica_ to create live documents - documents that are both interactive and show mathematical derivations. Now, I'm aware that there are certain symbols that are available via:               \[CapitalSigma]      or `esc`S`esc` However, some of the symbols I want (`\in`: $\in$, `\subsetneq`: $\subsetneq$) do not belong in the greek letters. Is there a list of something similar to this but lists _Mathematica_ symbols instead of $\LaTeX$ symbols? Thanks!
