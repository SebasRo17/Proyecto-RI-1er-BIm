I'm a CS grad and have been programming for past 5 years. I like it. As an experienced programmer I'd like to transition more towards the Space industry. **What skills** do you think a programmer would already have/ need to get to make that transition? Also **why** these particular skills and **how** do you see them relating to the Space industry?
