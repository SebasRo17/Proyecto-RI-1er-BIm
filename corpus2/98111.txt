A potential freelance client wants a copy of all the phone numbers in an entire country of several million people in CSV format for their telemarketing system. They have sent me a link to an online phone number lookup service. There are also ways to list the phone numbers of a given region, 30 numbers at a time, with a next link at the bottom of the page to go to the next 30. I could write a spider to crawl the site and basically copy their database, but is this kosher, legal or ethical? Someone else I asked said it depends on the terms of service, but the site doesn't have a terms of service. What do you guys think?
