I am looking to take my java certification very soon, and I have a question about the different types of associations described in the official oracle guide book. The book describes the 4 as the following:   * Direct = "has-a"    * Composition = "composed-of"    * Aggregation = "part-of"    * Temporary = method parameters or local variables inside a method etc.. I understand the examples they provide, but when shown a piece of code I can never figure out why it is one type over another. To further my frustration these don't seem to be common terms in uml diagrams and composition or aggragate is usually described as a "has-a" relationship depending on where you read. Here is a link to the book. http://www.amazon.com/Programmer-Study- Guide-1z0-803-Oracle/dp/0071789421 Pages 386-388 describe the different associations. Code examples would be very helpful.
