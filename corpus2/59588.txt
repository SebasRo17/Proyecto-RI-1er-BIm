I have a `ListPlot3D` with custom axis labels that I am scrolling with `Manipulate`. My issue is that the axis labels scroll away as the plot is scrolled. The commands below reproduce the problem that I am having. Thanks, Edmund               tickLabels = {{1, ""}, {2, ""}, {3, ""}, {4, ""}, {5, "lv1"}, {6,      ""}, {7, ""}, {8, ""}, {9, ""}, {10, "lv2"}, {11, ""}, {12,      ""}, {13, ""}, {14, ""}, {15, "lv3"}, {16, ""}, {17, ""}, {18,      ""}, {19, ""}, {20, "lv4"}, {21, ""}, {22, ""}, {23, ""}, {24,      ""}, {25, "lv5"}, {26, ""}, {27, ""}, {28, ""}, {29, ""}, {30,      "lv6"}, {31, ""}, {32, ""}, {33, ""}, {34, ""}, {35, "lv7"}, {36,      ""}, {37, ""}, {38, ""}, {39, ""}, {40, "lv8"}, {41, ""}, {42,      ""}, {43, ""}, {44, ""}, {45, "lv9"}, {46, ""}, {47, ""}, {48,      ""}, {49, ""}, {50, "lv10"}};          Manipulate[      ListPlot3D[       Table[i + j RandomReal[{1, 5}], {i, 50}, {j, 15}][[window - 9 ;; window]],       AxesLabel -> {"x", "y", "value"},        Ticks -> {Automatic, tickLabels[[window - 9 ;; window]], Automatic}],        {window, 10, 50, 1}]
