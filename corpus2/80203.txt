We are implementing some web services, and need to ensure that some of our methods **always** return non-null values. We've investigated two ways of doing this:   * Using code contracts, and returning the default value using `Ensures` constraints on the return value.   * Using an aspect-oriented programming approach using PostSharp. Both approaches work, but I'm wondering whether there are any other approaches that we should consider. How would you enforce non-null return values? * * * Looks like there was a similar question on SO, and Jon Skeet recommends the Code Contract approach.
