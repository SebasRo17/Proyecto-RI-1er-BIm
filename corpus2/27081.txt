I would like to do something like this:               In[1]:= ToExpression["\"\\[CirclePlus]\""]     Out[1]= ⊕          In[2]:= list_ ⊕ element_ := Append[list, element];          In[3]:= a = {1, 2};          In[4]:= {a = a ⊕ 3, a}     Out[4]= {{1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}             In[5]:= {a ⊕= 4, a}          (* Desired result: Out[5]= {{1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 4}} *)     (* Actual result: syntax error *)          Syntax::sntxf: "a⊕" cannot be followed by "=4".      Is it possible to workaround this error and make the compound assignment operator `⊕=` work? * * * Another example: I would like to create a new infix operator `@@@@` (or other) to express `Apply[f,expr,{2}]` in a short form like `f @@@@ expr`. If precisely this is not possible what are the valid "names" I could use?
