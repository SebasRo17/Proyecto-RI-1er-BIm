I'm helping to reogranize several redmine projects; although I have a lot of experience with issue tracking systems, I've never worked with redmine before. What is the best way to organize Issues in Redmine so that they can be easily grouped by:   * feature (e.g. "Upload a file", "Login to site", "Send message")   * system component (e.g. front-end, back-end, database), and   * target version ("beta 1", "beta 2" "GA") Right now, most "Bugs" are child issues of "Features"; unfortunately, this means that the Target Version of each bug is automatically populated with the Target Version of the parent feature. Is there some way to fix this?
