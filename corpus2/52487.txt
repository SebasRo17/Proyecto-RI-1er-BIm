I've been looking to apply to various web development intern jobs, and I feel comfortable with the PHP/CSS/HTML that they are asking for, but what does MySQL proficient mean? I've designed my own databases in phpAdmin and used them in the CMS I created, does that mean I'm proficient in MySQL? Do you just need to be able to create a database and then update/delete/insert fields in there? Would knowing this much allow me to put MySQL on my resume?
