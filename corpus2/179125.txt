This question is regarding a homework project in my first Java programming class (online program). The assignment is to create a "stringed instrument" class using (among other things) an array of String names representing instrument string names ("A", "E", etc). The idea for the 12-string is beyond the scope of the assignment (it doesn't have to be included at all) but now that I've thought of it, I want to figure out how to make it work. Part of me feels like the 12-String should have its own class, but another part of me feels that it should be in the guitar class because it's a guitar. I suppose this will become clear as I progress but I thought I would see what kind of response I get here. Also, why would they ask for a String[] for the instrument string names? Seems like a char[] makes more sense. Thank you for any insight. Here's my code so far (it's a work in progress):               public class Guitar {               private int numberOfStrings = 6;     private static int numberOfGuitars = 0;     private String[] stringNotes = {"E", "A", "D", "G", "B", "A"};     private boolean tuned = false;     private boolean playing = false;          public Guitar(){         numberOfGuitars++;     }          public Guitar(boolean twelveString){         if(twelveString){             stringNotes[0] = "E, E";             stringNotes[1] = "A, A";             stringNotes[2] = "D, D";             stringNotes[3] = "G, G";             stringNotes[4] = "B, B";             stringNotes[5] = "E, E";             numberOfStrings = 12;         }     }          public int getNumberOfStrings() {         return numberOfStrings;     }          public void setNumberOfStrings(int strings) {         if(strings == 12 || strings == 6) {             if(strings == 12){                 stringNotes[0] = "E, E";                 stringNotes[1] = "A, A";                 stringNotes[2] = "D, D";                 stringNotes[3] = "G, G";                 stringNotes[4] = "B, B";                 stringNotes[5] = "E, E";                 numberOfStrings = strings;             }             if(strings == 6)                 numberOfStrings = strings;         }//if         else             System.out.println("***ERROR***Guitar can only have 6 or 12 strings***ERROR***");     }          public void getStringNotes() {             for(int i = 0; i < stringNotes.length; i++){                 if(i == stringNotes.length - 1)                     System.out.println(stringNotes[i]);                 else                     System.out.print(stringNotes[i] + ", ");             }//for     }
