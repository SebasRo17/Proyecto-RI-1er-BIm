In his video http://www.wolfram.com/broadcast/video.php?channel=362&video=1643, Wolfram gives the following example: the output from               dict = Nearest[WordData[]]      is a `NearestFunction` object -- a function that may then be evaluated at an input such as:               dict["eleephannt"]      > {elephant} How can one determine which other functions `func` similarly generate a `funcFunction`? (Not sure if the Title correctly captures the meaning of my question!)
