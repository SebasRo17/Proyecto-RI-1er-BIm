I was poking around the AdventureWorks database today and I noticed that a number of tables (`HumanResources.JobCandidate` and `Sales.Individual` for example) have a column which is storing xml data. What I would to know is, what is the advantage of storing basically a database table row's worth of data in another table's column? Doesn't this make it difficult to query off of this information? Or is the assumption that the data won't need to be queried and just needs to be stored?
