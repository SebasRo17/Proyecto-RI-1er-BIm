I want to make use of _Mathematica_ as the backend to solve some computations used in my LaTeX input file. As I have no knowledge to make it in _Mathematica_ , I used Maxima as explained in the following steps that I got somewhere on the internet. ## Step 1 Download and install Maxima. ## Step 2 Create a batch file named `cas.bat` (for example) as follows.               rem cas.bat     echo off     set PATH=%PATH%;"C:\Program Files (x86)\Maxima-5.31.2\bin"     maxima --very-quiet -r %1 > solution.tex      Save the batch in the same directory in which your input file below exists. It is just for the sake of simplicity. ## Step 3 Create the input file named `main.tex` (for example) as follows.               % main.tex     \documentclass[preview,border=12pt,12pt]{standalone}     \usepackage{amsmath}          \def\f(#1){(#1)^2-5*(#1)+6}               \begin{document}           \section{Problem}     Evaluate $\f(x)$ for $x=\frac 1 2$.          \section{Solution}     \immediate\write18{cas "x: 1/2;tex(\f(x));"}          \input{solution}          \end{document}      ## Step 4 Compile the input file with `pdflatex -shell-escape main` and you will get a nice output as follows. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nJdTH.png) ## Questions Apparently the output of Maxima is as follows. I don't know how to make it cleaner.               solution.tex                                                 1                                            -                                            2     $${{15}\over{4}}$$                                          false      Now, my questions are   * how to implement the scenario above in _Mathematica_?   * if _Mathematica_ also produces the unnecessary texts, how to remove such texts?   * if _Mathematica_ also produces the same output format, how to obtain just `\frac{15}{4}` without `$$...$$`?
