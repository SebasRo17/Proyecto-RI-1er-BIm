I'm not a software developer, but I have previously developed a project- specific Access application for another employer. My current employer would like me to help organize their workflow and data for an upcoming project, and I was considering using Access again. In previous projects the staff used large piles of Excel spreadsheets; now they would like to keep their data more organized as well as automate some processes. I've found that it is difficult to create forms in Access that are pleasant and usable, due to the limited control over forms. Are there better options for quickly developing a business application, such as MS LightSwitch, Delphi, or .NET? The team that will be using the application is small - less than five users.
