I'm looking for a simple definition of the concept of “client-server” I'd like something similar to this definition of **_state_**. > ... That "thing/information" that you need to remember is called "state". Edit - This isn't a homework question (nor am I a student). My goal is to come up with a compact way of explaining REST to average developers. I didn't want to prejudice the response though.
