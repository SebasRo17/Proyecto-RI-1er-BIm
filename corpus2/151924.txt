I need to package an internal project as a debian package. That project will never ever be downloaded by anyone outside of our company, but the debian packaging system insists on there being a `copyright` file. What should I choose for this file? There's a remote possibility that a sysadmin could stumble upon that package and would like to read its licence. What should it then read?
