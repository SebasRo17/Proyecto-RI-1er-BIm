I have two issues with the following code. (1) It executes too slowly. If I use "Speed" instead of "Quality" for PerformanceGoal, I get the speed but an undesirable delay in proper rendering of the contour. Perhaps the calculation of the expression to be contoured is the cause of the slowness. If so, can that be accelerated? (2) How can I make the z-axis vertical. Note its appearance with some jaggies.               Manipulate[           ContourPlot3D[         {z == 10*x*y*Exp[-x - y], z == k}, {x, 0, 6}, {y, 0, 6}, {z, 0, 3},          ContourStyle -> {Red, Opacity[0.9]},         AxesOrigin -> {0, 0, 0}, Boxed -> False, Mesh -> None,          PerformanceGoal -> "Quality",         MeshStyle -> Directive[Thick], AxesStyle -> Directive[Thick],          BoundaryStyle -> Directive[Blue], ContourStyle -> Opacity[0.8],         ViewPoint -> {-4, -8, 4}, ImageSize -> 2 {420, 370}],         {{k, 0.5, Text@Style["k", Italic, FontSize -> 18]}, 0, 1.35, 0.01,          Appearance -> "Labeled"}      ]
