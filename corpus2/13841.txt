I'm currently studying atmospheric-gravity waves and their dispersion relations. For analysis I need to plot the dispersion function: \begin{equation} \omega^4 - \omega^2\cdot C_s^2(k_x^2 + k_z^2 + \dfrac{1}{4H^2}) + (\gamma - 1)g^2\cdot k_x^2 = 0 \end{equation} where, $C_s^2$, $H$, $\gamma$ and $g$ are some constant values. I used `Solve` to get $\omega$ as a function of $k_x^2$ and $k_z^2$ - $\omega = \omega(k_x^2, k_z^2)$. Code for solving:                  Solve[\[Omega]^4 - \[Omega]^2*(Subscript[k, x]^2 +              Subscript[k, z]^2 + 1/(4*H^2)) + (\[Gamma] - 1)*g^2*Subscript[k, x]^2 == 0, \[Omega]]      What I want:               Plot[f, {k, 0, 20}]      where `f` is any solution of `Solve`. It plot nothing, because _Mathematica_ didn't know about $k^2 = k_x^2 + k_z^2$ relation.
