I am reading a book on Java Programming, and want to confirm I understand the definition of the word "vector". Wikipedia says vector is "A one-dimensional array", source http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector. Wouldnt it be simpler to call the array simply an array? Is there any reason we need to use such fancy language as "vector"? Is there a difference between an array and a vector?    ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/daFEx.png) Source: Cracking the Coding Interview, 4th Edition, by Gayle McDowell, page 47. FAQ   Q - Why didnt you post this on english.stackexchange.com?   A - Because I think only computer science oriented people will have a good answer.
