In the current semester at the university we are working on OOP with C++.   I would like to understand the difference between a pointer and a reference operator. The differences that I understand are:   1\. Cannot change the object that the reference variable is binded to   2\. we can use the reference variables to refer to the binded object without having to type the & operator (in contrast with the pointers where we would write *pi = 5;) Also,does a reference variable contain the address of the object that is binded to?   In example:               int i;     int &ri = i;       Here ri contains the address of i? And the reason why when overloading ++ operator in this example of enumeration we are using the dereference or reference(*) operators before the name of the function.
