I'm developing a web application for a university project. My professor wants we to use a multi-tier architecture (Client, Web, Business and Data tiers) with EJB. For the Web and Business I have chosen to use the MVC pattern. Anyway, little by little, I build the tiers in this way: the View (JSP and Servlet) ALWAYS forwards any request from the client to the Controller (Session Beans), which checks if the user can see the page, and if he can it sends to the Servlet the right data (taken from the Entities). Since the MVC pattern provides an interaction between Model and View, I think that I don't use it (my View interacts only with the Controller). So I'm asking: which is the name for the pattern I'm using? Or is it still the MVC?
