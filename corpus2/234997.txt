final String str = "do not change me";     str = "why not?"; //it will result in compile time error saying that final fields can not be re-assigned once created i.e. the reference cannot be changed          String str1 = "hello world";           System.out.println(str1.replaceAll("h", "q"));         str1 = str1.replaceAll("h", "q");         System.out.println(str1);  //An immutable object on the other hand means that, there is no way for you to change the object or its contents other than changing the reference.      Is the above understanding of definition of a **final** object and **immutable** object correct?
