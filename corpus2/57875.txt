I'm trying to numerically solve 2 partial differential equations `eq1` and `eq2` given the boundary conditions in `cond1` using the following code               T = 325;     R = 8.314      p = ceq[t, z]*R*T;      q = (30000*p)/(1 + (2000*p)^0.38)^(1/0.38);     L = 0.0695 ;     cinlet = 0.9;      eq1 = D[c[t, z], t] == D[c[t, z], z, z] - D[c[t, z], z] - D[q[t, z], t];      conds1 = {c[0, z] == 0, c[t, 0] == cinlet, D[c[t, L], z] == 0, q[0, z] == 0};     eq2 = D[q[t, z], t] == (c[t, z] - ceq[t, z]);     NDSolve[Join[{eq1}, {eq2}, conds1], c[t, z], {t, 0, 100}, {z, 0, L}]      It currently provides the error that `D[c[t, L], z] == 0` is simply `True`. But even if I remove this one boundary condition to get `conds1 = {c[0, z] == 0, c[t, 0] == cinlet, q[0, z] == 0};` I get an error: `NDSolve::derarg: "The derivative operator Derivative[1,0] in .... should act on the pure function"` I'm not sure how to avoid this error. Any help would be appreciated.
