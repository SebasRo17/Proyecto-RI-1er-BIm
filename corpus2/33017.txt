I was asked a question one day: find an integer n such that the first five digits of 5*7^n is 12345. It's very nice that I can quickly write code like this:               Block[{n=1,x=5},       While[RealDigits[x=7.*x][[1,;;5]]!={1,2,3,4,5},n++];       n]//Timing          {55.86399999999998,456370}      It takes less than a minute. Later, I found that using the function `FindInstance` I could find a solution in much less time (but not the minimal solution):               FindInstance[{m+Log[10,1.2345]<Log[10,5.]+n Log[10,7.]<m+Log[10,1.2346],n>0},{m,n},Integers]//Timing          {0.3119999999999869,{{m->12872681,n->15232174}}}      Furthermore, I modified the code to be able to find the minimal solution like this:                NestWhileList[           n/.FindInstance[{m+Log[10,1.2345]<Log[10,5.]+n Log[10,7.]<m+Log[10,1.2346],First@#>n>0},{m,n},Integers]&,           n/.FindInstance[{m+Log[10,1.2345]<Log[10,5.]+n Log[10,7.]<m+Log[10,1.2346],n>0},{m,n},Integers],           #!={}&]//Timing              {11.872000000000007,{{15232174},{15188314},{10277666},{5410878},{2955299},{499720},     {497170},{496660},{496150},{494620},{493090},{492580},{492070},{490540},{490030},{489520},{489010},{478300},{456370},n}}      The time it takes is one fifth of that classic method. So, I found a new way to solve this class of questions (just in Mathematica)? My question is, can this method be used for other questions, and which mathematical method does the function `FindInstance` exactly use?
