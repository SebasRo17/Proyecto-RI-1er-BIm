I have seen some of the related posts, which ask about doing matrix calculation on tensors unknown dimensions. One of the posts mentioned that version 9 has some capability, but it was concerned about simple matrix algebra, but not calculus. I would specifically like to know if with the addition of Tensor package in version 9, if the following is possible: $a, \lambda \in R^n$, and $C\in R^{n\times n}$ Here $n$ is unknown/symbolic variable. I am trying to find derivative of expressions which involve matrix-vector products such as (to give a simple example) $f(a,\lambda)=\dfrac{\lambda^T Ca}{\sqrt{a^T C a}}$ I would like to know if using Mathematica we can find expressions of $\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial a}$ etc. Thanks.
