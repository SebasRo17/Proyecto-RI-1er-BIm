I would like to write a program in _Mathematica_ to look for the integer $n$ such that the following definition holds for any $1 < m < n $ $$\frac{f(n)}{f(m)}>1+\frac{\log(n/m)}{\log(n) \log(\log(m))}$$ where $f(n)$ is for example number of divisors of $n$ (and also count the number of resulting sets). I wrote the following code, but the problem is that when it finds the first `j1` in the next step of the `For`, it looks for the value `j2` for which $$\frac{f(j_2)}{f(j_1)}>1+\frac{\log(j_2/j_1)}{\log(j_2) \log(\log( j_1))}$$ but I want it to find the `j2` such that $$\forall j,\ j_1 \le j < j_2 \implies \frac{f(j_2)}{f(j)}>1+\frac{\log(j_2/j)}{\log (j_2) \log(\log(j))}$$ **Note** : In the following example `k[*]` is a special and known sub sequence of integers.               i = 20;          count = 0;          list = {i};          For[j = i, j <= 100, j++,              If[ f[k[j]]/f[k[i]] > 1 + Log[k[j]/k[i]]/(Log[k[j]] Log[Log[k[i]]]), i = j;              AppendTo[list, i];             count = count + 1         ]     ];          list          Print["count= ", count]
