I'm bit of a novice to JavaScript so I've been wondering on positive and negative sides of using polling compared to using events in JavaScript? When does one use one or the other? By polling I consider any effect that is triggered on something that repeats itself usually using `setTimeout`. But also for example:               function render() {        Bloop.renderComponent(box, document.body);        requestAnimationFrame(render);     }      Is also polling since `requestAnimationFrame(render)` which is called before each frame is called. Basically anything that fits this definition
