I am considering outsourcing the development of an iOS app to various independent developers. I will have have various testers of the app. We all work for separate companies. Some of these testers will be customers, who I would like feedback from. As there are multiple developers involved I expect there to be a new release on a daily basis. How can this be done? Would each of the testers need to buy some sort of license to avoid having to go through the app approval process? Is there any smooth way to do this so that it will not be a hassle for our friendly customers, who are willing to test our app?
