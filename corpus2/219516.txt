when using closure in other languages, it just feels nature, variables from outer scope are captured automatically , without the need of declaring such captures. in c++11, good to see we have closures, but why they make it so uncomfortable to work with, not only have to declaring the capture, but also read write controls? not likely implementation considerations, but what kind of philosophy is leading to this awkward spec ?
