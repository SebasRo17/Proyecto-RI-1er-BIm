The `Play` function will happily accept arbitrary values for its `SampleDepth` and `SampleRate` options. For example, if I do:               Play[Sin[2 π 440 t], {t, 0, 1}, SampleDepth -> 240, SampleRate -> 480000]      … this will evaluate without a problem, and when I hit the play button, I will hear the sound. But I know that my computer hardware is not capable of outputting sound at 240 bits and 480 kHz. So what sample depth and rate am I actually hearing? Does Mathematica use some standard rate for output (maybe 16 bits at 44.1 kHz)? Does it use the maximum capability of my hardware (in my case, 24 bits at 48 kHz)? Or something else? Is there any way to query Mathematica for my system's audio capabilities?
