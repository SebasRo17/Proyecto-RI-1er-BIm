I am plotting to data curves using ListLinePlot. I like the look of Filling, but this is going to be printed, so I want something both black and white friendly, but giving more definition and separation than changing the opacity of the filling. Ideally, I would either have one hatched and the other filled solid gray, or both hatched in opposite directions or something such that they can be identified separately. This is what I have so far that I may just use if I can't find anything better:               data1 = exPDMIABSA[[1]];     data2 = exPDMIAwater[[1]];     ListLinePlot[{data1, data2},       PlotStyle -> {Black, Directive[Dashed, Black]},       Filling -> Axis,       FillingStyle -> Directive[Opacity[0.7], Gray]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bCvyV.png) Three related questions I've found are RegionPlot (or FillingStyle) using hash lines? and Filling a polygon with a pattern of insets and How can I make hatching filling of plot but none seems to address this situation. They seem to be dealing with shapes and (region)plots and not ListPlots. While it is entirely possible that they are very closely related, I'm not sure how to use any of those answers for my situation. Thanks
