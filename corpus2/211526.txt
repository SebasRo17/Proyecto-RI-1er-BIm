I'm designing a function that given a UTC timestamp will convert it to the local time. The question I have, should the current times DST settings be applied to the conversion, or the timestamps DST settings? If going with the former, current DST setting applied to timestamp - it would mean 4pm that was recorded with DST+1 would be 3pm with DST+0 and 4pm with DST+0, depending on the time of the year you checked the date at. If going with the latter, the timestamps DST setting would be applied to it - so 4pm recorded with DST+1 will always say 4pm, no matter what time of the year you've checked it at. Which is more preferrable in practice?
