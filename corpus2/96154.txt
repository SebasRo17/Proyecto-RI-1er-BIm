I have more than 6 years of experience with .Net (C#/ASP.NET) and Visual Studio. But recently I'm tempted to switch to Linux/Mono. It comes up with some questions:   1. Can I run my old Visual Studio projects and source codes in Mono correctly?   2. My clients use IIS for ASP.NET and MS Windows for Winform and Console projects. Does my migration affect them? In other words does my Mono projects runs in Windows/IIS without any change or problem?   3. Does Mono is dependable considering recent changes of Mono, Novell, Xamarin and Attachme?   4. Can I continue using my favorite open source and none open source projects like NHibernate, Castle, Cuyahoga, log4net, Microsoft Enterprise Library and DNN?   5. Can I host Mono ASP.NET web projects in Apache without any problem?   6. Can I use my skills in ASP.NET webforms and MVC in Mono exactly?
