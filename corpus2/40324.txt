I have a problem in using EventLocator in Mathematica 9. However, this error doesn't show up in Mathematica 8 on my labtop. My code is,               η=G[x[n],y[n]];          pde = {x''[n] == -(1 - (x'[n]^2 + y'[n]^2)/(4*x[n]^2))*(3*x'[n] +              2*x[n]^2*\!\(     \*SubscriptBox[\(\[PartialD]\), \(x[n]\)]V\)/V) + (x'[n]^2 - y'[n]^2)/          x[n], y''[n] == -(1 - (x'[n]^2 + y'[n]^2)/(4*x[n]^2))*(3*y'[n] +              2*x[n]^2*\!\(     \*SubscriptBox[\(\[PartialD]\), \(y[n]\)]V\)/V) +           2*(x'[n]*y'[n])/x[n]};     bc = {x[0] == saddle, y[0] == 0.01, x'[0] == 0, y'[0] == 0};     Sol = NDSolve[{pde, bc}, {x, y}, {n, 0, 1000}, MaxSteps -> 50000,        AccuracyGoal -> Automatic,        Method -> {"EventLocator", "Event" -> η - 1,          "EventCondition" -> (n > 60)}]      The error message is, > NDSolve::evboo: The value of the event function at n = 61.76853457162405` > was not True or False. When not True, the value will be considered as False. > >> This is quite strange as there is no problem in running this on Mathematica 8.
