This may sound silly or obvious but this is my case; I work at a company that recently implemented SAP and I was the responsible to generate/migrate the master data of the company which let me learn a lot from this system. SAP comes with its own language known as ABAP and since the system went live I've been learning and programming with it. Before ABAP I worked as a freelancer in other projects with VB6, VB.Net, C# and ASP.Net building a lot of stuff, here I've made some utilities that are been using daily, so I came with long experience in programming. At first ABAP was difficult but eventually after long analysis, googling and trial and error I became the guy who makes basically all the development in SAP from reports, to user-exits, enhancements, BADIs, tables, dynpros, etc. Daily I learn more and more because of all the requests I receive which makes me investigate and code a lot everyday. It has become challenging and funny at the same time. You could be very productive in ABAP once you get into. Ok, the question is - can I post how I resolved a certain thing in SAP? That implies that I'd publish production code. I feel doubtful about this.
