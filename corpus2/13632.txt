Few months ago, I was invited to a forum in a local university to discuss about programmersÂ´s job market. The forum joined teachers and companies representants for understand this issue. The final conclusion of debate was that the students are focused on tech part of software but they don't get understand the business concepts because classes has a little bit or none focus at that. The university has commited to insert more business concepts on some tech courses. What do you think about this? More business concepts really would help companies and students or tech courses must focus on tech things? **EDIT:** The event was focused on Business Intelligence. So, companies were interested in programmers who had easy understanding to business rules too. I think that, in this area, is essencial have these knowledgment.
