We all know that the hardest parts of computer science deal with cache invalidation and naming things; my problem is the latter. I have a process that raises events when various things happen. Rather than creating all of the objects for all potential events before the process is started, I have created classes that create the necessary dependencies for the event when the event is called, then calls the next sub-process. I have no idea what to name these classes. A typical example might include a logger, mailer and anything needed to render a view for that event, such as templates. Not every action needs these things or else I'd just create them and be done with it.
