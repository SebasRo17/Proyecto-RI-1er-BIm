Hey guys I have a pretty simple code that consists of an RMS calculation. The issue is that I am getting quite a few error messages when I run it. The following equations are highly published physics equations with confirmed results, so I am at a loss of why mathematica will not give me an answer:               lambda[z_] := Exp[-(z^2/2^2)]     fo[x_?NumericQ] :=      NIntegrate[     1/(x - xprime)^(1/3) lambda'[xprime], {xprime, -Infinity, x}]     rms[y_] :=      Sqrt[NIntegrate[     lambda[x]*(fo[x])^2, {x, -y, y}] - (NIntegrate[     lambda[x]*(fo[x]), {x, -y, y}])^2]          rms[Infinity]
