Using “Create Hyperlink” dialog window I can create a link to a tagged cell in my notebook (it's “Destination notebook: Current notebook” radio button). Now, I can't figure it out how to create such links with `Hyperlink[]` command. I tried               Hyperlink["label", {"", "tag"}]     Hyperlink["label", {None, "tag"}]     Hyperlink["label", {Automatic, "tag"}]      etc., but nothing works.
