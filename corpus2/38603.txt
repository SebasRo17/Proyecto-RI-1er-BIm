I have a question pertaining to my code below: I require to find the values of the roots `E2` that will set the function `f1[E2] - f2[E2]` to zero. I know how to obtain the roots one at a time: for instance a root of `E2` lying between, say 0 and 2. But I would like to know whether it is possible to get _Mathematica_ to generate all the roots that lie within a certain interval at once, say those lying between 0 and 10. I have tried using `NSolve` and `Reduce`, but I got nothing, so any help will be most appreciated!               xmin = -6.5;      xmax = 6.5;      xmatch = 1.5;      eq1[x_, x0_, E2_] := {Derivative[2][y][x] + (E2 - x^2) y[x] == 0,                            y[x0] == 0, Derivative[1][y][x0] == 1/10^6};           y1[x_, E2_] := y[x] /. NDSolve[eq1[x, xmin, E2], y, {x, xmin, xmatch}][[1]];      f1[E2_] := Abs[D[y1[x, E2], x]/y1[x, E2] /. x -> xmatch];      y2[x_, E2_] := y[x] /. NDSolve[eq1[x, xmax, E2], y, {x, xmax, xmatch}][[1]];      f2[E2_] := Abs[D[y2[x, E2], x]/y2[x, E2] /. x -> xmatch]     f[(E2_)?NumericQ] := f1[E2] - f2[E2];      (* The following trial doesn't success *)     NSolve[f[(E2_)?NumericQ] == 0 && 0 < E2 < 10, E2]     rts = Reduce[f == 0 && 2.5 < E2 < 10., E2]     c2 = N[E2 /. {ToRules[rts]}]     Print["The value of E2   was=", c2]      * * * this is the code that i have written to numerically try to solve the DEs to obtain the roots E2. i am able to obtain the roots by plotting "exp" versus E2. however, when i try to use the erzek root finder, an error message is generated               xmin = (-8.5);          xmax = 8.5;          xmatch = 0.50;          eq[x_, x0_, E2_] := {y''[x] + (2 E2 - x^2) y[x] == 0, y[x0] == 0,         y'[x0] == 1/10^6};          exp := (# - #2) & @@ ((y'[xmatch]/y[xmatch] /.
