I'm using the following kind of code to do the legends of my plots:               PlotLegend -> {"Test1","Test2"}, LegendPosition -> {0.05,      0.2}, LegendBackground -> White, LegendBorder -> White, \     ShadowBackground -> White, LegendSize -> {0.75 ,      0.35}, LegendBorder -> None, LegendTextSpace -> 3      Which gives something like ![Example of legend for a plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1kthh.png) I would like to increase the size (width) of the line (color/type) of one item of the legend. I know it depends on the size of the whole box, but is it possible to control that independently ? **EDIT** The "package" of _Jens_ looks like the perfect solution for me. I used it to produce the following plot. In this case I use only one legend entry for both the data and the corresponding fit, but as he mentions in his answer they can be split. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9gptQ.png)
