So I've been looking at furthering my knowledge into embedded and lower level hardware programming, however, every time I look for jobs that mentions _"embedded"_ it's always high level stuff. To me, that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. So what exactly does "embedded" entail? When I think of _embedded_ I think of lower-level microcontroller programming and such. If _embedded_ is not the proper title for this, then what should I be searching for?
