### CASE 1 (Definition and declaration in same source file) Suppose both my prototype and definition of global function is in .cpp file. Where should I write inline keyword to make compiler know?   1. In the prototype   2. In the definition   3. Both ### CASE 2 (Definition and declaration in same header file) If I have declared prototypes in .h file I want to make that function inline in more than one .cpp file using it, then should I define the function (to be inlined) in that .h file and include it to individual .cpp files? If yes, then in this case where inline keyword should be used? ### CASE 3 (Definition in Header file and declaration in Source file) If the prototype is in a header file, definition in a source file (in which other functions use the inline function), where must the inline keyword be used?   1. In the declaration in header file   2. In the definition in source file   3. In both
