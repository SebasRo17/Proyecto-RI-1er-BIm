This is my oldest question on SO. It still hasn't generated a useful answer there, so I thought I'd give it a try here. The question was: I don't seem to be able to find the method to generate the table of contents for a Mathematica notebook. AuthorTools, an old v5.1 utility package is still hidden in Mathematica, but it doesn't work for me. The TOC should contain correct section numbers (if present in the stylesheet) and list page numbers (this requires taking page size settings into account).
