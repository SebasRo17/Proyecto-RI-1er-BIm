Question: Is there value in denoting a key as "Primary"? This question is not about the definition of a primary key. It is not about the fact primary's aren't nullable. It is not about implementations such as MySQL which automatically perform clustered index voodoo behind the scenes on primary keys. **NOTE** : The question is not about the benefits of auto-number-ID surrogates over natural keys. Suppose a table has 3 candidate keys. All non-nullable. All immutable. I find no value denoting a key as "secondary" or "tertiary". I don't find the concept of precedence useful when dealing with multiple keys. I find the same logic against "secondary" and "tertiary" flags applies to the "primary" flag. I even feel the word "candidate" is not useful for a key. It implies the candidate is not as important as the key that won the primary election. I don't feel precedence has any place in describing keys. The attributes of the key itself (unique, non-nullable, etc) should be sufficient. Would the relational model be missing anything if we did not have the "primary" attribute to describe 1 of a table's keys?
