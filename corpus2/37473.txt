I have a signal that I'm trying to study its time-frequency features by continuous wavelet transform. By choosing different wavelet order, I get some differences in the results.

The zoom out of above figure looks like               ListDensityPlot[Abs[cwd[All, "Values"]],       PlotRange -> {{100, 400}, {20, 28}, {Min[Abs[cwd[All, "Values"]]],          0.02 Max[Abs[cwd[All, "Values"]]]}}, ClippingStyle -> Automatic,       ColorFunction -> "TemperatureMap", AspectRatio -> 1/GoldenRatio]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xoXmJ.png) . From this plot, the weak signal is not easy to see because there are "stripes" from the other strong signal. However, if we use a higher order of wavelet, for the same region, we can see clearly the weak signal               cwd2 = ContinuousWaveletTransform[data, GaborWavelet[10], {Automatic, 12}];     ListDensityPlot[Abs[cwd2[All, "Values"]],       PlotRange -> {{100, 400}, {20, 28}, {Min[Abs[cwd2[All, "Values"]]],          0.02 Max[Abs[cwd2[All, "Values"]]]}}, ClippingStyle -> Automatic,       ColorFunction -> "TemperatureMap", AspectRatio -> 1/GoldenRatio]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/U9yDG.png) **Question** :   1. Why there are strong "stripes" in the low order wavelet case? Are those "stripes" a "true" feature of my signal or it's an artificial effect from the wavelet transform?   2. In general, what are the guide lines to choose the order of the wavelet?
