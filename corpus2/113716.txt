Right now I'm trying to create a Heap that requires 8-byte alignment, and was looking around online for some good methods that would minimize the amount of fragmentation. Less fragmentation is ideal, and even the ones that will slow down a lot are a consideration (but speed is also a sub-goal here) Has anyone had any experience with Heaps who could let me know what to watch out for when going about this? Any input is appreciated
