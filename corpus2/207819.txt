I would like to be able to see what code in thousands of lines of source code is run most often and takes the longest. The purpose of this would be for optimization. Being able to see what parts of the code are run most often is important for optimization, because those parts are where I should focus to speed up. At the same time of course, some code is run very often but takes virtually no time, so its also important to be able to see what code takes the longest. I guess the best of both worlds would be a program that adds up the amount of time a piece of code takes, including ALL of the times it was run (therefor figuring out what slows down your code most overall). Is there a kind of tools for this?
