I was wondering if it's possible to change the style of a`Point` with another symbol e.g.: cross, x etc... It may sound weird-it is a Point after all, but I would like to have crosses instead of points in the following code                 Manipulate[Module[{data, inside, insidepts}, SeedRandom[n];       data = RandomReal[{-1, 1}, {m, 2}];       insidepts = Cases[data, {x_, y_} /; x^2 + y^2 < 1];       inside = Length[insidepts];       Text@        Style[         Column[          {Graphics[{PointSize[0.0001], Red, Disk[{0, 0}, 1], Blue,             Point[data]}, ImageSize -> If[format, 500, 350]],           Row[{"inside: ", inside, "\toutside: ", m - inside, "\ttotal: ",              m}],           Row[{"Ï€=4 x ", inside, "/", m, " = ", 4. inside/m}]}], "Label"]],      {{n, 1, "random seed"}, 1, 1000, 1, Appearance -> "Labeled"},      {{m, 1, "sample size"}, 1, 100000, 1, Appearance -> "Labeled"},      {{format, False, "large format"}, {True, False}},      AutorunSequencing -> {1, 2}]
