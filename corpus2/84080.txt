Like the title says, I would like some advice from knowledgable web developers on figuring out security issues for my e-commerce site. I am designing the database as well as the code that communicates with the database to make changes, etc. I have a few questions, but in general a good checklist on what to do to make the security pretty tight, seeing as I will be dealing with credit cards. I will not be storing credit card numbers. Links to good places would be helpful. My main concern is keeping the database secure. I am pretty new to web development, and I am just concerned about thst. I do have a question about the design of a database used for online transactions. Is there a better way to make the schema than to just put all the user info into one table: ex.               customer(customerid, firstname, lastname, username, password,              address, city, country, zipcode)      Would it be better to store user credentials in another table and link them with the customerid? Sorry if I am not getting too specific, but I am new to web development and mainly have experience in offline programming. Again my main concern is security issues. If anyone has a great article on security, that would do just fine as well. Thanks for your time!
