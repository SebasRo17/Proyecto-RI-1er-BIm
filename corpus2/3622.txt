I often develop an application entirely myself. But did I really? I feel strange about that claim and never know when that is true. I mean I designed it, coded it, but I used XYZ plug-in. Can I still claim that I did it all myself even though I didn't create the plugin I used? Consider this conversation? > **ME:** I designed and developed this app entirely myself. > > **Other:** Cool, how did you program XYZ part? > > **ME:** I didn't program that part I used XYZ plugin. > > **Other:** So you didn't really program it _ALL_ yourself than did you? I mean if I must give them credit for the plug-in I used, then do I have to give the language authors credit for the language I used and the IDE authors credit as well? Where do I draw the line? This is just something that always crosses my mine as soon as I am about to take full credit for a project, and was wondering others opinions on the matter.
