Happy Star Wars day. I was playing around with the image manipulation functions in _Mathematica_ in an attempt to recreate the Star Wars crawl. There's an HTML/CSS implementation which is in my opinion pretty impressive and I'm wondering if it's possible to obtain the same quality out of Mathematica (ideally using features that can be exported as a CDF). For starters, I was focusing on the crawl (with the "long time ago..." and diminishing Star Wars title components to be added eventually). The text and theme song:               text = "It is a period of civil war.       Rebel spaceships, striking       from a hidden base, have won       their first victory against       the evil Galactic Empire.\n       During the battle, Rebel       spies managed to steal secret       plans to the Empire's       ultimate weapon, the DEATH       STAR, an armored space       station with enough power       to destroy an entire planet.\n       Pursued by the Empire's       sinister agents, Princess       Leia races home aboard her       starship, custodian of the       stolen plans that can save her       people and restore       freedom to the galaxy....";     theme = Import[       "http://www.moviewavs.com/0093058674/WAVS/Movies/Star_Wars/starwars.wav"]      One can get the gist if the effect fairly succinctly with a combination of `ImagePerspectiveTransformation` and `TranslationTransform` after rasterizing the text:               i0 = Rasterize[Panel[Style[text, Yellow], Background -> Black],         RasterSize -> 400, ImageSize -> 300];     Animate[      Show[With[{a = 5.25, b = 5},        ImagePerspectiveTransformation[         ImagePerspectiveTransformation[i0,           TranslationTransform[{0, crawl}]], {{1, 0.5 b, 0}, {0, a, 0}, {0,            b, 1.}}, PlotRange -> All]        ], ImageSize -> 600],      {crawl, -3, 1}, AnimationRate -> 0.075, AnimationRepetitions -> 1,       Initialization -> (EmitSound@theme)]      There are some problems with this approach, however:   1. Text quality isn't great. The quality can be improved by adjusting the Rasterize options; however I noticed a significant performance hit in doing so.   2. The transformations result in white bars above and below the crawl.   3. The theme song repeats and is not easily stoppable.   4. The notebook size bloats to 2 MB even with the low res settings   5. Use of Animate won't work when it comes to exporting as a CDF I am interested in finding solutions to these problems.
