So the project I've been working on is now going to be frozen indefinitely. It is possible that if and when the project unfreezes again, it won't be assigned to me or anybody from the current team. Actually, we inherited the project after it had been frozen before, but there was nothing left by the prior team to help us understand even the basic needs of the project, so we wasted a lot of time getting to know the project well. My question is what do you think we should do to help the people after us to best understand the needs of the project, what we have done, why we've done it, etc. I am open to other ideas of why should we leave some tracks to the others that will work on this project also. Some steps we already have taken:   * technical documentation (not full but at least there is some);   * source-control system history;   * estimations on which parts of the project need improvement and why we think so;   * bunch of unit tests.   * issue tracker with all the tickets we've done ( **EDIT** ) What do you think of what we've already prepared and what else can we do?
