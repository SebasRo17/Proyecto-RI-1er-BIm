I know I can define               vars = Map[Subscript[x, #1] &, {"tem", "pressure", "hum", "lat", "alt", "space", "corner"}]      and               vars = Array[Subscript[x, #1] &, {8}]      But how can I add both kinds of subscripts in my "x"s to get something like x"tem""1", x"tem""2", and so on? Based on the answer I got here, I tried to write general form in this way.I am quite sure there would be much better interactive way to do that.This is just starter version of mine:               Outer[Subscript[x, Subscript[#1, #2], Subscript[#3, #4],      Subscript[#5, #6], Subscript[#7, #8]] &, {"a", "b"}, {1, 2, 3,      4}, {"i", "j"}, {1, 2, 3, 4}, {"m", "n"}, {1, 2}, {"A", "B", "C",      "D"}, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}];
