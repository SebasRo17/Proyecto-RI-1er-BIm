I've been searching around for info on contract / freelance programming as far as steps to take in the initial communication with a client (someone who has contacted me regarding a project). I am wondering if anyone has links to good resources as far as what I should send them (should I send them a document outlining "my process", etc?). Often the initial requirements that they send are vague and I want to immediately "take charge" of the process and starting asking them questions, talking about price, etc but I don't want to be too overbearing so I'm just curious if there is much out there written about this, my google searches aren't turning up much that is good about this sort of thing.
