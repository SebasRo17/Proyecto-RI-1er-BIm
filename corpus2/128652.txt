So I have including the files to my projects by simply : `#include "myheader.hpp"` and adding the headers into the solution explorer. But recently I have realized that I may omit the step of adding the headers to the solution explorer because it does not change anything. The only important fact is to define proper include directories in project properties. Am I missing something here ? Can someone clever explain this to me ?
