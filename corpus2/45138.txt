There is a list with numbers 1 to 8 ( `p1` ) and another list (`j`) which contains 4 numbers which shows different 4 positions of the elements in list `p1`. I want to take 4 elements from `p1` related to the 4 numbers of positions from the list `j` and multiply those selected 4 numbers from list `p1` by 2. The code below is a function that do the procedure that I have mentioned above :               p1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8};          DoMul[p1_] := Module[{nmu, e1, j, mul, Replacement},     j = {1, 6, 7, 8};     i = 1; While[i <= 4,     e1 = Extract[p1, {j[[i]]}];     mul = 2*e1;     Replacement = ReplacePart[p1, j[[i]] -> mul];         ; i++];     Replacement];       The problem is that I do not know how to update `p1` in each iteration ( There are 4 iterations ) and the result will be :               {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 16}      but the correct answer must be :               {2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 14, 16}      Does anyone know how to update the `p1` list in each iteration?
