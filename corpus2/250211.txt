I have read that Java is pass-by-value, and I've been reading about it in this question at StackOverflow, but I'm still a bit confused, regarding the close() or shutdown() methods in various classes. What I want to know is, suppose that I do this:               public Constructor(){              if(isProceeding){             InputStream iStream = new InputStream();             processStuff(iStream);         }     }               public void processStuff(InputStream stream){         //do stuff         stream.close();     }      Does the iStream variable actually get closed in processStuff() method or a copy of it gets closed and iStream itself is still left open?
