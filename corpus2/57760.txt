## Description: In _Mathematica_ the functions like `Thread`, `Inner`, `Outer` etc. are very important and are used frequently. For the function `Thread`: ThreadUsage1:               Thread[f[{a, b, c}]]      > >     {f[a], f[b], f[c]} >   ThreadUsage2:               Thread[f[{a, b, c}, x]]      > >     {f[a, x], f[b, x], f[c, x]} >   ThreadUsage3:               Thread[f[{a, b, c}, {x, y, z}]]      > >     {f[a, x], f[b, y], f[c, z]} >   And I understand the `Usage1`, `Usage2`, `Usage3` easily as well as I use them masterly. However I always cannot master the usage of **`Inner`** and **`Outer`** so that I must refer to the _Mathematica_ Documentation every time when I feel I need using them. I find that I cannot master them owing to that I cannot understand the results of **`Inner`** and **`Outer`** clearly. Namely, I always forget what construct they generate when executed. The typical usage cases of `Inner` and `Outer` are shown below: ## InnerUsage:               Inner[f, {a, b}, {x, y}, g]      > >     g[f[a, x], f[b, y]] >                 Inner[f, {{a, b}, {c, d}}, {x, y}, g]      > >     {g[f[a, x], f[b, y]], g[f[c, x], f[d, y]]} >   ## OuterUsage:               Outer[f, {a, b}, {x, y, z}]      > >     {{f[a, x], f[a, y], f[a, z]}, {f[b, x], f[b, y], f[b, z]}} >   ## Questions:   1. How to master the usage **`Inner`** and **`Outer`**? Namely, how can I use them without referring to the _Mathematica_ Documentation?   2. How to understand the result of `Out[3]`,`Out[4]`,`Out[5]` figuratively? Namely, by using graphics or other way.
