Let's see. I've seen in several places, including Advice for Computer Science College Students, by Joel Spolsky, that a graduated Computer Science student must know C. **How do I know if I know C or not?** I have developed a few projects in C (an implementation of the _ext2_ filesystem with FUSE, and a few others), but I suppose it means more than just knowing pointers, free, etc.
