For example, let's say a non-technical person comes to me with their rough initial specification. And I sit down with them over a couple weeks and help them hone, formalize and better plan the application that they want built. What is this called? Information architecture, software architecture, specification writing, software planning, requirements analysis? What is the best, most recognizable term for this?
