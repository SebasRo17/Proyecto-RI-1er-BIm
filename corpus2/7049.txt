I'm trying to generate a list of 1000 random numbers with WorkingPrecision->1. Is there any particular reason that I'm getting some entries as 0.06? I have tested the following lines:               X=RandomReal[UniformDistribution[],1000,WorkingPrecision->1]      or               X=RandomVariate[UniformDistribution[],1000,WorkingPrecision->1]      Is there a way to omit 0.06 and get true 1 precision, or am I missing something?
