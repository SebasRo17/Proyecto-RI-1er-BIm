I have solved a set of coupled differential equations and now I need to convert them into different dependent variables and sketch their trajectories. Here is the code I have written so far:               zeta1 = x[t] + I y[t];     Eqn1 = (I/zeta1 + 1/Im[zeta1])/(8 Pi Conjugate[zeta1]);     s = NDSolve[{x'[t] == Re[Eqn1], y'[t] == -Im[Eqn1], x[0] == 1,      y[0] == 1}, {x, y}, {t, 0, 10}];      The new coordinates are obtained as follows:               p[t] = -x[t]^2 + y[t]^2          q[t] = -2 x[t] y[t]      Any ideas how should I do this ?
