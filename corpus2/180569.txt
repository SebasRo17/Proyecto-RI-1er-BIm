I'm a beginner-level C++ programmer, but I understand the concepts of the language fairly well. When I began to learn external C++ libraries, like SDL, OpenGL (maybe something else too), to my great surprise I found out that they don't use C++ concepts at all. For example, neither SDL, nor OpenGL use classes or exceptions, preferring functions and error codes. In OpenGL I've seen functions like glVertex2f, which takes 2 float variables as an input and probably would be better as a template. Moreover, these libraries sometimes use marcos, while it seems to be a common agreement that using macroses is bad. All in all, they seem to be written more in C style, than in C++ style. But they are completely different incompaitable languages, aren't they? The question is: why modern libraries do not use the advantages of the language they are written in?
