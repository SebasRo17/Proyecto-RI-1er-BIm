When reading about best practices and code reviews, I have come across a word/phrase that people on forums have used to describe code that should be a warning sign that the programmer may have missed something or made a mistake. A sample sentence would have gone something like this: "Often if you see a single if statement with 10 ands/ors, it is a **___ ____**, though in certain cases it can be correct." What is this word? I want to include this in a code review document I am writing.
