This is a followup to my question here. I have to make a web GUI for a library that manages remote clusters via SSH. The main point is that this library spawns threads and subprocesses (Popen) internally (for the SSH connections), so I think I am I/O bound by these SSH connections. I want to prevent my server from going down as soon as I get 20-50 simultaneous requests. I have no idea of how to proceed with the architecture. I don't know if I can solve this at the server level with a more powerful server (gevent??) or if I should do something like using background threads (twisted reactor??) Some considerations:   * I work with django so the server (if I finally have only one) must be WSGI.   * I need both blocking and non-blocking calls via SSH.   * I will probably need shared state between successive requests as well.
