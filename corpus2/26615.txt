I have a list generated by `Table` as below.               Table[{a x1 + b x2 + c x3, a y1 + b y2 + c y3, a z1 + b z2 + c z3},        {a, -5, 5}, {b, -5, 5}, {c, -5, 5}]      but it can't be used as an argument to `Point`. That is,               Point[       Table[{a x1 + b x2 + c x3, a y1 + b y2 + c y3, a z1 + b z2 + c z3},          {a, -5, 5}, {b, -5, 5}, {c, -5, 5}]]      doesn't work. How do I adjust the list returned by `Table` to make compatible with `Point`?
