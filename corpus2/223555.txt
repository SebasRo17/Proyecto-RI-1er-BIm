I have about 10 google docs spreadsheets. I would like to add / process rows from each of them and display the summation of this data in a new tab in each spreadsheet. So if somebody adds a row to one of the spreadsheets, the summation tab should be updated in all of them. 2 questions:   1. Is this possible using google docs scripting?   2. What is the best way to share the same script and run it against all the documents?
