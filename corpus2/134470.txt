So I was given this project for a client, but the person who wrote the site originally did a terrible job (worse programmer than I am). They've got all sorts of kludgy fixes and I'm having trouble figuring out what variables are doing what. Like, for example, one section says this:               $id = "";     $cuid = "";     session_start();     if (isset($_SESSION['id'])) {         $id = $_SESSION['id'];         $cuid = $id;         $valid_user = $_SESSION['valid_user'];         $cuname = $_SESSION['cuname'];         $website = $_SESSION['website'];         $site = $website;         $email_contact = $_SESSION['email_contact'];          }     $cuid = $_GET['cuid'];     include_once("dbfunctions.php");     if (isset($_SESSION['id']))  {         $cuid = $_SESSION['id'];     } elseif (isset($cuid)) {         $_SESSION['id'] = $cuid;     }      Which just seems to repeat the same thing, over and over. How am I, as a newer programmer (about a year experience, mostly in Python, now with about 6 months experience in PHP) supposed to deal with this sort of thing? More senior developers can't take a look at it - they've got more major clients right now.
