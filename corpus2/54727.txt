Documentation states that "TimeObject allows addition and subtraction of time quantities". I can see that subtraction is fine, (example from doc page) TimeObject[{16, 17, 21}] - TimeObject[{10, 12, 34}] . This evaluates to time Quantity but if I change minus to plus the expression remains unevaluated. However, both subtraction and addition works if TimeObject is used with time Quantity (e.g. 13 hours) instead of another TimeObject. Subtraction is specifically mentioned in the following line from the docs: "Subtracting two TimeObject constructs yields a time quantity". How about addition? Am I missing something or is it an obvious bug?
