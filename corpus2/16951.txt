I've been using _Mathematica_ for a long time, so I have a habit of using some of the older functions even when newer, better ones have been added to replace them. `StringForm` is one such function. I have the habit of using it with `Print` as the _Mathematica_ analog of C's `printf` when I need debugging output. Today, when I found myself typing `Print[StringForm[ ...` once again, the thought "why am I not using `Row`?" occurred to me. Indeed, why not? `Row` has been in _Mathematica_ since ver. 6. It looks to me it can do anything that `StringForm` can do and a lot more. However, WRI has not deprecated `StringForm`, so I wonder: should `Row` always be used in place of `StringForm`? Or is there still some use cases where `StringForm` is better?
