To my understanding, when you access a variable, that variable and the surrounding area of memory is put into the L1 cache. If I'm wrong here, please tell me. Now my question is, say I have an array of pointers, and I want to iterate through them all performing operation X. If I first have to access the pointer, to get the address of the actual data, does this mean that the memory near the pointer will be put into cache, then the memory near the data, then back to the pointer, then to the data etc? i.e. Cache thrashing? If this is the case, how might one go about keep cache coherency?
