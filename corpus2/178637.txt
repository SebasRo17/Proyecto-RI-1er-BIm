Pash is an open source reimplementation of Windows PowerShell. It was released in 2008, and has been idle since then. I would like to take up the mantle. It's not clear what the license is. There is no LICENSE file or license details in the code. The only reference to a license I can find is on this page: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pash/ where it says: > "License: BSD License, GNU General Public License (GPL)" But I'm not sure if I can take that as authoritative. I have tried to contact the author but he has not responded. I would hate to proceed with this project and later discover that I am violating a license, and have the project crippled as a result.
