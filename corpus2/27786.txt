I have a set of points on a circumference:               points = Map[Normalize, RandomReal[{-1, 1}, {3000, 2}]]      And I want to plot them and color the plot according to the density of points. You see, `ListPlot[points]` will just give me that, a simple plot, on which I can't see the distribution of the points on the circle. Maybe there is an option? I hope you guys can understand what I'm asking. **Edit/Follow-up** I used `SmoothDensityHistogram[points, ColorFunction -> "Rainbow"]` ![This is what it looks like](http://i.stack.imgur.com/hWd6a.png) Now, it's not really what I'm looking for. I kind of wanted it to look like the original plot, just the circumference.
