I'm thinking about creating my own pet programming language, and I have been wondering if similar language already exists. The basic idea is that the language itself would be dynamically typed with strong metaprogramming capabilities (think Ruby). But instead of running it directly, it would be interpreted/expanded into another language, that would be statically typed, with static data structure and minimal dynamic dispatch (think C). This would then be compiled to machine code. The expansion could happen before running the program or during it's deployment, and all necessary libraries would be part of it, instead of each library being expanded separately. Before I start working on it, I would like to know if anything like that already exists. So I can either inspire myself or drop it, because it would be useless work.
