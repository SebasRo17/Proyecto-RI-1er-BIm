I'm making a website in PHP where the user can search a big MySQL database. The user is shown the first result. I want the _next_ button to take the user to the next result, and so on. The trivial solution is for each result page to execute the user's search query _again_ and use OFFSET and LIMIT to get the _n_ -th result that is displayed. But this feels like a Schlemiel the Painter's algorithm: re- executing the same query over and over to get to the _n_ -th result is inefficient. Since others must have faced this situation before: how is this typically solved?
