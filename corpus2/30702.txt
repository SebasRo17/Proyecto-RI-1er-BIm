I have developed a new algorithm in _Mathematica_ v9.0 for the Edge Detection and want to compare it with the existing Roberts, Sobel, Prewitt etc, operators in the presence of Noise. I have evaluated Mean Square Error (MSE) and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) for all operators and compared with my new algorithm. But, one more metric parameter I have to evaluate is, for example, Pratt Figure of Merit (Pratt-FOM) in Mathematica. I find it difficult to know how to go about evaluating this Pratt-FOM in Mathematica. Could anybody help me how to apply the (analytical/mathematical) logic in Mathematica to evaluate Pratt-FOM? I have to complete it for my homework assignment. I am good in Mathematica, but my friends switch over to MATLAB for coding. But I am sticking to Mathematica for this purpose and trying hard to apply the logic for this.
