Please consider :                subIDs = {"AK6", "CF11", "CL4", "FC21", "MK5"};           subColors = {LightOrange, LightBlue, LightYellow, LightGreen, LightRed}           Graphics[{subColors[[Flatten@Position[subIDs, #, 3]]],Rectangle[]}]&/@subIDs      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/aOKVa.png) How could i avoid the output of position to be 1 for example instead of {1} which seems to be my problem.
