These two expressions are mathematically the same, but when substituting with the same rule, yield different results. What is happening?               Derivative[1][Derivative[1][x][t]][t] == 5 t + 3 x[t] /.        {x -> Function[{t}, 1/3 (-5 t + Derivative[1][Derivative[1][x][t]][t])]}          D[x[t], t, t] == 5 t + 3 x[t] /.        {x -> Function[{t}, 1/3 (-5 t + Derivative[1][Derivative[1][x][t]][t])]}
