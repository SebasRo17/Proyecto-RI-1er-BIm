I am busy designing a TCP Server class in C# that has events and allows the user of the class to define packets that the server can send a receive by registering a class that is derived from my "GenericPacket" class. My TCPListener uses Async methods such as .BeginReceive(..); My issue is that because I am using the .BeginReceive(); I need to specify a buffer size when I call the function. This means I cant read the whole packet if one of my defined packets is too big. I have thought of creating a fixed sized Header that gets read using .BeginRead(); and the read the rest using Stream.Read(); but this will lead to the whole server having to wait for this operation to complete. I would like to know if anyone has come across this before and I would appreciate any suggestions.
