Looking through the server vs local code on a humongous legacy project, I see this in Settings.settings:               <?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>          <SettingsFile xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/2004/01/settings" CurrentProfile="(Default)">       <Profiles>         <Profile Name="(Default)" />       </Profiles>       <Settings />     </SettingsFile>      Is there a problem with having this VS2010 project reference 2004 this way? Or does it not matter?
