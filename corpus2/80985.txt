What is the best way for a developer to track his/her hours at work, if no framework exists at that firm which would avoid any complications with internal classified information being stored on a server I own at home? In particular, I would like to hear of any methodologies or software that could be used in this situation with limited issue. I just graduated from college, and am moving into my first full-time job with an embedded systems firm, which doesn't seem to have any particular process set up for its employees to use. Since last summer, I've been working on improving my development process, trying to record my time usage, bugs found, and other simple metrics for my process. Until now, I have been using Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS) to do this from one of my personal servers, and have enjoyed working with it. The firm I am going to, however, doesn't seem to have anything similar, so I am stuck with needing to find a way to continue tracking these metrics. I feel I should not use my TFS server (or a similar tactic, such as Traq), since there would be the chance of exposing company secrets to the outside world through my server.
