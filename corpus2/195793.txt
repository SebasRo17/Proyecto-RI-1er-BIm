I am taking Martin Odersky's coursera course on functional programming with scala, and for now I have learned two things that together don't make sense:   1. Scala doesn't support multiple inheritance   2. `Nothing` is a subtype of every other type These two statements cannot live together, so how exactly is this done? and what exactly is the meaning of "subtype of every other type" **Edit 1** In the Scala API, `Nothing` is defined as `abstract final class Nothing extends Any`... so how can it extend other classes?
