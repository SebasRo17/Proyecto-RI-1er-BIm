So in the javascript app, we have a lot of repeated chunk of `menu items` with the specific `settings`: URL, Name, Title, etc etc (these settings sometimes can be optional). Here is the gist of the menuItem and we have tons of them. The client pushes new changes every month or twice per month on these items, either the menu item should be named differently or the url is outdated or whatever. Instead of going and changing each URL everytime, I thought about:   * Creating a web-service, with a complete CRUD on menuitems, whatever comes in there, goes dirrectly via JSON, to the app Well, I would like to hear if you have some thoughts on this idea of `configuring` the application rather than hardcoding the app each time when the CR comes. Here is the gist of the menuItem and we have tons of them. All help will be appreciated
