My background is as follows. I've been programming since I was young, worked in BASIC, then Asm for M68K, then C, C++, and now I've spent the past 5 years in .NET becoming a rather good .NET developer. Somewhere along the line, I realized I have no clue how the internet works, I don't know how TCP/IP works, I have no clue what HTML is capable of, or how PHP plays into the picture, or why Ruby on Rails should make me happy. I have no experience with LAMP or IIS, and I only have an inkling of a clue what Sharepoint is. In short: I'm internetstupid. I am intelligent and a capable developer, but I lack even rudimentary skills (routing, web hosting, hosting a custom DNS for intranet domain resolving, etc.) I have no clue where to start on web development learning. Here's the good news! I know what I'd like to learn to do (at least for now!) I want to be able to develop my own personal domain to host WSDL services, to power my applications, to showcase my work, to host my living resume, to market my brand so to speak. Stackoverflow, I beg you, help this disconnected but talented developer become part of the current era instead of being a relic stuck in the previous great golden age of software! Note: I'd prefer to stay wedded to MS for now for the most part as I'm already familiar with the .NET ecosystem. I'm okay branching out, but not ready to do so (I think?) If you can convince me otherwise that's fine.
