My team shares a "work" branch and a "stable" branch. Whenever a particular work branch is approved for further testing/release/etc, we merge it into stable. No code is ever checked directly into the stable branch. Because of this, merge conflicts simply won't happen, and it seems silly to pull down the work branch and the stable branch, merge them, and then push the changes back. Is there a git command to ask a remote git server to commit a merge of two branches that it already knows about?
