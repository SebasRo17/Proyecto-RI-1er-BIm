There are plenty of questions/answers about what an architect does, but what should someone in an Architect role NOT do? What are the boundaries/limits to maintain to be an effective Architect? I'm thinking here of Architect vs Developer and Architect vs Project Manager For example, I'm finding myself in a role where my title is Architect but I am also the coding/development lead and project manager on multiple small enterprise projects. I'm struggling with all the task switching and now I want to limit task switching. Trying to wear every hat just isn't working. What tasks should an Architect not do at all? What tasks should an Architect limit? I do think an Architect needs to keep coding, but how to define an appropriate limit for coding work?
