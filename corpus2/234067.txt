My company is migrating from SVN to GIT. We have several projects in an only repository. Since SVN basically understands only folders and files, we have folders representing areas of the company, that contains the projects of that area. But in GIT, it seems that projects are owned by users, so if I want to maintain an example project owned by an area-XX of my company, I would need to create an user called "area-XX" to do this? And again and again for each organisational area of my company? I want a structure like `my_git_server/area-XX/project-A` for a project, instead of `my_git_server/user/project-A`. How can I do this?
