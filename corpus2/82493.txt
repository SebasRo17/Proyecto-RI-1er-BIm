I'm considering writing a blog about my experiences while programming. Unfortunately, I doubt I'll be able to post regularly. What I'm wondering is if there are any good software development blogging sites that incorporate posts from multiple people, allowing each one to post at their own rate and, because there's a number of them, wind up with enough content that it's worth visiting them? Context: There are three types of posts that I'd likely create:   * Personal thoughts on various topics (I think language feature X is important because..., etc)   * Personal experience with a given language/framework/etc (I had problems with framework X because...)   * Personal experience trying to solve a specific problem (Here's what I needed, here's the problems I ran into, and here's how I solved it) Edit: Of course, I mistyped the title as "community glob sites" at first. That doesn't bode well for my blogging performance ;)
