Why not use a RTOS with microkernel architecture for web servers? The scheduler is deterministic and all requests will be handled quickly leading to faster response time? It's easy to extend an OS based on microkernel architecture, since everything is like a client-server communication via message passing. Also, the server will be very light weight and requires less resources. Say that you are developing the web service using C++. I am thinking about QNX for the OS. Is it a bad idea, or it does not matter?
