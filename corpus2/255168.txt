I came across this piece of code it didnt look that right to me. Is it the right way to implement SUPER in javascript. if not what is the right way?               function Person(name){      this.name = name;       }          function Student(name){     Person.call(this, name);     }          Student.prototype = new Person();      var a = new Student('test');     var b = new Student('test2');
