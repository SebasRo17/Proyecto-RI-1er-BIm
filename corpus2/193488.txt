I do not know if this would be the right stack exchange site to ask this question but I have been researching on RAD (Rapid Application Development) and Agile methodologies and was trying to find their diagrams but if I google images this, it comes up with many different diagrams. So based on the images I drew my own diagrams on this. The RAD diagram is similar to the one shown in wikipedia here but only difference is I change the bottom circle from cutover to implementation. For Agile method, as it is same as waterfall method but only difference is you can jump back to previous steps, I basically drew up a waterfall diagram but changed the arrows to indicate that you can go back. My question is the below diagrams suitable for the intended methodologies?
