I was playing around with gr√∂bner basis and s-polynomials and I fell upon the PolynomialReduce, and I was wondering why it gives different results when I move around the polynomials in its second parameter,               PolynomialReduce[x^2 (x^2 + y) - 1 (x^2 y + 1), {x^2 y + 1, y + x^2, x^4 - 1}, {x, y}]      gives               {{-1, x^2, 0}, 0}      while               PolynomialReduce[ x^2 (x^2 + y) - 1 (x^2 y + 1), {y + x^2, x^2 y + 1, x^4 - 1}, {x, y}]      gives               {{x^2 - y, 0, 0}, -1 + y^2}      which is obviously wrong** as it is very apparent that the coefficients is just x^2 and -1. Can anybody shed some light on this? It's very disturbing and confusing. [edit] **the result might not be wrong, but it does not give the minimal b as per instruced by the documentation http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/PolynomialReduce.html
