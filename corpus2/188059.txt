I'm in a team of two developers and currently we have no formal processes for software development and testing - I'd like to adopt one solo initially. Where I need some opinions is really on the matter of where to begin? Having read various books it isn't terribly clear what the best starting point would be. Recently I put in place a simple sharepoint/access database for recording issues and resolutions, and a changelog. Beyond that, testing is a manual process. In my control is the process by which I design and develop any of my own tools or content and would very much like to adopt a lightweight agile methology that works well for a single developer but is intended to be a "follow my example" for the company to pull all the software development into it. I do like picking out items from various projects I have on the go and refactoring them or adding functionality; one of the notions I was considering was the notion of user stories whereby I could cherry pick out various stories when I was in the general project to which it applies. Anyone else in a similar single developer position who has adopted agile/other 'ology?
