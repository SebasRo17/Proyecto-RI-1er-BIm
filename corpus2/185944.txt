Before I start this question I know the java 'goto' is a big no go. So I've been writing a program and I have some indented Loops and statements and I need to `BREAK` multiple on command. Rather than having a load of `boolean` variables and `if(!<booleanName>) BREAK;` statements throughout these loops and statements what is everyone's opinions on using labels to break them using the `BREAK <label>` statement? e.g.                for(...) {                indented_example_loops:     // Label name                for(...) {                     for(...) {                          if(match) break indented_example_loops;                          // ^ Break statement to break the 2 for loops at once                     }                }           }      Perfectly okay? Okay to do occasionally? Completely avoid? or should i go to a corner and call the Devil to take my soul?
