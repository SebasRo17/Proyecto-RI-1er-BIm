In Mathematica 9, I used to be able to do               rules = Dispatch[{'a' -> 1, 'b' -> 2}]     rules[[1]]      to extract the rules from `Dispatch`wrapped list of rules. In Mathematica 10 the following error is raised:               Part::partd: Part specification Dispatch[...][[1]] is longer than depth of object. >>      Is this a bug? I am using only the trial version currently. I got aware of it because it breaks the AutomaticUnits package.
