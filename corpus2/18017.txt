I'm using an ant script to install my application from the Workbench (as suggested in this answer). In past I've used two ways of specifying the destination for the build:   1. Hard-coded directory, like `/Users/me/Library/Mathematica/Applications`. This would be fine for a single computer, but I store the code in a versioning system, and access it from computers having different filesystems (e.g., MacOSX laptop, linux desktop). It is inconvenient to change the ant build file for each build.   2. Setting an environment variable on each computer (`$MMA_APP_DIR`, say) and using `<property environment="env"/>` within ant to get that variable using `${env.MMA_APP_DIR}`. Much better than option #1, since I don't have to change the code itself, but still an inconvenience. _Mathematica_ 's, `$BaseDirectory` and `$UserBaseDirectory` are the destinations I'm after. **How can I access the values of these variables from the ant script?** They are built into the Workbench framework, showing up as destination folders when using the Application View to export to an archive or to a folder. I've yet to discover how to access them.
