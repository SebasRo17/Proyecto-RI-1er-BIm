Similar question here (but not the same) because I am interested in which specific algorithms work particularly well in Lisp. Lisp tutorials always give the example of finding factorials, but wanting to find factorials is not a good enough motivation to use Lisp. I've heard that Quicksort has a particularly elegant implementation in Lisp. Can you give examples (and code samples too) of examples of algorithms that are best implemented in a language like Lisp?
