Consider the relation               x/Tan[Pi x] == y/Tan[Pi y]      `Solve` or `NSolve` can't give a solution for it. But if you choose a particular region say $1.3 \leq x \leq 1.9$ and $.1 \leq y \leq .7$, there can be an approximate solution of the form $y=f(x)$. One way to get that would be to use `ContourPlot`, extract the data and then use `Interpolate`.               c = ContourPlot[x/Tan[Pi x] == y/Tan[Pi y], {x, 1.3, 1.9}, {y, 0.1, 0.7}];     pts = First@Cases[Normal[c], Line[i__] -> i, Infinity];     f = Interpolation[pts];      Is there any other way to get an approximate solution ($y=f(x)$) in a given region for a given relation? Regarding this, I would be interested to know how `ContourPlot` works. Does it use any kind of root finding method to find all the points satisfy the relation and plot them? It that case will it be possible to use the same method to find an approximate solution as well?
