Using linear stability analysis, I would like to compute the range of stability of the fixed points and the 2-cycles of the following iterative map: $x_n = x_{n-1}^{2} - 3\mu$. Setting $x = x^{2} - 3\mu$, using hands and Mathematica I calculated the fixed points: $x_1 = \frac{\sqrt{1+12\mu}}{2}$ and $x_2 = \frac{\sqrt{1-12\mu}}{2}$.   And the two cycles are the fixed points and two other additional points: $x_3 = \frac{-1-\sqrt{3(-1+4\mu)}}{2}$ and $x_4 = \frac{-1+\sqrt{3(-1+4\mu)}}{2}$. Now I am struggling to find the range of stability of the fixed points and 2-cycles using hands and Mathematica.   What I know is we need to compute the slope of the map at the points. So if we differentiate $x^{2} - 3\mu$ and calculate the derivative at the fixed point $x_1 = \frac{\sqrt{1+12\mu}}{2}$, we get $2(x_1) = 1+\sqrt{1+12\mu}$. And similarly for $x_2$, $2(x_2) = 1-\sqrt{1+12\mu}$. Then we set the absolute values < 1\. So we get $|1+\sqrt{1+12\mu}| < 1$ and $|1-\sqrt{1+12\mu}| < 1$. Now here is the problem, I can only find the range of stability for $x_2$ but not for $x_1$. Here is my (hands) work:   $$|1-\sqrt{1+12\mu}| < 1$$ $$-1<1-\sqrt{1+12\mu} < 1$$ $$-2<-\sqrt{1+12\mu} < 0$$ $$-\frac{1}{3} < \mu < \frac{3}{13}$$ But now I try to find the range of stability of $x_1$:   $$|1+\sqrt{1+12\mu}| < 1$$ $$-1<1+\sqrt{1+12\mu} < 1$$ $$-2<\sqrt{1+12\mu} < 0$$ and there is no solution for this inequality. So what can we conclude for the range of stability? And how can I solve this problem using Mathematica? One way of doing it using Mathematica that I can think of is by drawing the cobweb diagram and checking for some values of $\mu$, but this method is exhaustive and time consuming. Is there any more efficient method? Any helps on methods and code are greatly appreciated. Many thanks in advance.
