I'm writing an app that will have an `Image` entity, and I'm already having trouble deciding whose responsibility each task should be. First I have the `Image` class. It has a path, width, and other attributes. Then I created an `ImageRepository` class, for retrieving images with a single and tested method, eg: `findAllImagesWithoutThumbnail()`. But now I also need to be able to `createThumbnail()`. Who should deal with that? I was thinking about having an `ImageManager` class, which would be an app-specific class (there would also be a third party image manipulation reusable component of choice, I'm not reinventing the wheel). Or maybe it would be 0K to let the `Image` resize itself? Or let the `ImageRepository` and `ImageManager` be the same class? What do you think?
