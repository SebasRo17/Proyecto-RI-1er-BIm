How is one supposed to work with physical constants in _Mathematica_ V9? When I first open _Mathematica_ , physical constants such as `SpeedOfLight` are not recognized. If I load the PhysicalConstants package using:               << PhysicalConstants`      I get the following error message: > General::obspkg: "!(\"PhysicalConstants`\") is now obsolete. The legacy > version being loaded may conflict with current Mathematica functionality. " However, at this point `SpeedOfLight` is properly defined!
