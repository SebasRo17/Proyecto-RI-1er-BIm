Many a times I need to log into a website that I used months ago and have forgotten my password. So clicking the reset password link and the site sends me an email with a single use link which allows me to enter a new password and logs me in. Happy days. This got me thinking; how about we skip the whole password thing and just send a single use link in an email that I click which logs me into a month long session. So, tell me. Why wouldn't this work?
