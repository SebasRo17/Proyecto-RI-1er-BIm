_This should probably be in a Dear Abby column, nevertheless..._ I am the only engineer in my entire family (including extended family). Occasionally I hear family members say that being a Software Engineer is not as hard as say a UPS Driver. While both may work the same hours, intrinsically the SW Engineer job is rated as less difficult than the other. The general consensus is that we just sit in front of computers all day with some occasional meetings. I feel that being a Software Engineer is not physically demanding but mentally draining. For those that have encountered this line of thinking before, what is the best way to convince your friends and family otherwise? Edit: My Wife told her Mother... I am tired after work and don't want to be running errands... her Mother said that I am in an office all day on a computer, how can I be tired. Side note: I am also an Army Reserve Officer, member of my city's planning commission, and a freelance blogger for my local newspaper. Plate is pretty full aside from being a SW Engineer - BUT, the notion still remains with the family that being a SW Engineer is nowhere as difficult as being an UPS Driver, which my brother-in-law is currently employed as.
