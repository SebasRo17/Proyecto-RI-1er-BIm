I need to define a symbolic operator with commutative, associative and distributive properties, in the same way as the sum and product operator for real numbers. I have started with:               op[a_, b_] = a⊕b;     op[a_, b_] = a⊗b;     op[1, 2];     op[1, 1⊕2];     Distribute[op[1, 1⊕2], CirclePlus]      when I use the `Distribute` command I don't get the parenthesis. How can I define an operator with all this properties in ones.
