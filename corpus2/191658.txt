I have a web host that supports cPanel and email addresses. I'm interested in creating a web app that checks for email messages, reads their contents and then does something with them, like interact with a database. For example, Bob with email bob@gmail.com links his email address to his account on my web app. He sends an email to storethis@webapp.com with subject "Shopping List" and message "Apples, bananas, kiwis, milk", along with an attachment. The web app receives this email, and then parses the email's contents and stores this data into a database. How can I implement this?
