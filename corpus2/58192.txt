I have a `Table` with data in form `{{date}, value}`:               data= {{{2012, 6, 1}, 16}, {{2012, 6, 8}, 14.24}, {{2012, 6, 15}, 13.7},             {{2012, 6, 22}, 12.31}, {{2012, 6, 29}, 11.5}, {{2012, 7, 6}, 10.08},             {{2012, 7, 13}, 9.18}, {{2012, 7, 20}, 8.65}, {{2012, 7, 27}, 7.8},             {{2012, 8, 3}, 7.51}, {{2012, 8, 10}, 7.31}, {{2012, 8, 17}, 6.92},             {{2012, 8, 24}, 6.57}, {{2012, 8, 31}, 6.1}, {{2012, 9, 7}, 5.67},             {{2012, 9, 14}, 5.54}, {{2012, 9, 21}, 5.17}, {{2012, 9, 28}, 4.83},             {{2012, 10, 5}, 4.62}, {{2012, 10, 9}, 4.53}}      How can I know the difference (in days) between each date and the starting date `{2012, 6, 1}` and associate this new value to each row of the `Table`?
