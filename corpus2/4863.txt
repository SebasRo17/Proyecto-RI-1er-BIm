I'm working on a program that finds special [called "interval"] edge-colorings for graphs. Output is as follows:               Coloring = {1 \[UndirectedEdge] 10 -> 1, 1 \[UndirectedEdge] 2 -> 2,                   9 \[UndirectedEdge] 10 -> 2, 1 \[UndirectedEdge] 9 -> 3,                   2 \[UndirectedEdge] 10 -> 3, 1 \[UndirectedEdge] 3 -> 4}      Now I want to visualize the coloring. I use `EdgeLabels->Coloring`, but it writes the labels in the middle, which is not comfortable, especially in case of symmetric graphs like Complete Graphs. I want to display 2 labels on both ends of each edge. Right now I can display it only on one end of each edge using the following code:               1 \[UndirectedEdge] 10 -> Placed[1, 1/6]      and I get the following result: ![CompleteGraph\[10\]](http://i.stack.imgur.com/yjsSz.png) Documentation suggests to use `Placed[{1,1},{"Start","End"}]` to display 2 labels on two ends. That particular example works, but when I change `"Start"` or `"End"` to `1/6` or `5/6`, no labels are displayed at all.
