I've been in my current position for a long time (10 years) and in that time, I feel like I've performed well as a designer, system architect, and programmer. However, all that work has been on internal projects that aren't accessible from the outside world. I see a lot of advice like this that suggests 'If you can literally point to something and say "I wrote this" it's very impressive'. What about if you can 'literally point to' nothing at all, because while you're a passionate programmer who (as the classic Joel-ism puts it) "is smart and gets things done", all those things are invisible? Do I need to start frantically committing to open-source projects? Start a "real world" (not corporate-internal) blog? Frankly, I spent most of my 10 years happy here, and only recently have considered leaving for greener pastures. Am I going to be sunk before I start looking because of my focus on work my current employer, at the expense of my "public presence"?
