Consider the following statement:               Max[0, Sqrt[1 - Cos[4 \[Theta]]]]      You'll find that Mathematica won't evaluate this, because it doesn't know the range of $\theta$. Okay, that makes sense, so change it to:               Simplify[Max[0, Sqrt[1 - Cos[4 \[Theta]]]], {0 <= \[Theta] <= 2 \[Pi]}]      This evaluates happily. As it should. But then consider this not-impactful adjustment:               Simplify[Max[0, Sqrt[1 - Cos[4 \[Theta]]]/       Sqrt[2]], {0 <= \[Theta] <= 2 \[Pi]}]      This doesn't evaluate. I don't know why; because it seems quite obvious that it should be exactly the same as the previous case, right? (The constant factor of `1/Sqrt[2]` can't change the fact that it is still $\geq 0$). Any thoughts on how to fix this? Of course, in my case I want to actually keep the `Max` ..., but I don't know the exact form of the other side, so I can't just arbitrarily remove constants ...
