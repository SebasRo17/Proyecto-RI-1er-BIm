I have a basic issue with the MVC architecture. I am aware that the View usually listens to the Model. But how are user requests propagated to the Model? Currently I do it like this, when the user clicks e.g. the update Button in the GUI. So the `ActionListener` calls a method of the View. The View calls a method of the Controller. And the Controller calls a method of the Model. But I have three concedrns about this.   * The View must be aware of the Controller.   * The long call chain seem to be not the right way   * With the number of user actions, the number of those call chains increase. What are the best practises here?
