Can anyone help me out with this? I am trying to get _Mathematica_ to evaluate curl of a vector field. The vector field is               (y + cos[z]) + (z + cos[x]) + (x + cos[y])      The path from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1) of the arc of the curve that I am trying to graph is `(t, t^2, t^3)`. Now I know there are curl commands in _Mathematica_ , but I am not very familar with them. Can anyone help me set this up so _Mathematica_ will evaluate it?
