My Menu key works in Windows Explorer, Internet Explorer, many apps, but does not work in _Mathematica's_ notebook. The function is like that of Right-Click with the mouse. _Function expected_ : Select some text in the cell, and tap the menu-key comes out the menu. In my keyboard, it's between the Right-ALT-Key and the Right-Ctrl-key. If this is not possible, how to make one key, or combination of some Control Keys to do the same thing, ie use the keyboard to substitute the right-click of mouse?
