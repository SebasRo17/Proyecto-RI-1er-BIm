I was reading this transcript of an interview with a GitHub developer and he was describing how they use Redis: > Q: You mentioned using Redis. How do you use that?   >  A: **We use Redis for exception handling** and for our queue. We tried a > lot of Ruby-based queuing mechanisms. Chris wrote an abstraction to the > queuing mechanism. We used to use BJ and DJ and in the super early days we > tried out Amazon SQS and a lot of queuing mechanisms and they all fell over > at one point or another with the amount of traffic that we were doing on > them and the types of queries that we were trying to get from them. > Eventually we moved to a Redis space that Chris also wrote, called Resque. Can anyone guess to what that means to use Redis for exception handling? Does it mean the logging of exceptions or something else? You can see the video of him saying it here.
