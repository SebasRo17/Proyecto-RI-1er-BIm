This is NOT about importing/exporting Excel data to/from Mathematica. This is purely a UI question. The Mathematica notebook interface is very "linear" â€” I type in an input cell and _Mathematica_ produces an output cell. Is it possible to implement something like an Excel interface for _Mathematica_? For example, if I have:   * cell `a1 = "x+y"`   * cell `b1 = "x-y"`   * cell `c1 = "= a1^2 + b1^2"` Then, _Mathematica_ puts "2(x^2+y^2)" into `c1`. If I modify `a1` to say `"3"`, _Mathematica_ puts `"(x-y)^2 + 9"` into `c1`.
