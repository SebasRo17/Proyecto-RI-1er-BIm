I think I am lost on some basic issue ... I created two CellTags, tagone and tagtwo If I create this palette inputting the following code by hand I get a beautifully working palette that makes me jump to these cells.                CreatePalette[{         Button["tagone", NotebookFind[InputNotebook[], "tagone", All, CellTags]],          Button["tagtwo", NotebookFind[InputNotebook[], "tagtwo", All, CellTags]]}]      If I do put this in a function like the following the palette gets created with right names shown in the buttons, but pressing the buttons nothing happens ... Apparently there is a problem in this code with the use of the counter variable in the `For`. In this examples it is called `celln` and in the error monitor I get > Part specification celln$53002 is neither a machine-sized integer nor a list > of machine-sized integers. I though the variables was fixed in the loop ... I am quite puzzled, any guess? Did I just made a rookie mistake? I think this functions was previously working when I originally developed it in December. Maybe my memory is failing.                Module[{nb, res, list, origlist, celln},        nb = InputNotebook[];        origlist = NotebookTools`NotebookCellTags[nb];        Print[origlist];        res = {};        For[celln = 1, celln <= Length[origlist], celln++,          Print[ToString[origlist[[celln]]]];          AppendTo[res,            Button[origlist[[celln]],             NotebookFind[nb, origlist[[celln]], All, CellTags, AutoScroll -> True]]];        ];        CreatePalette[res];      ]
