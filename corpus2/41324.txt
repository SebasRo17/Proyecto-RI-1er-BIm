I am writing a code that manipulates expressions that contains functions with an arbitrary number of arguments. An example expression is               expr = x f[a, b, c, d] - 4 f[b, a, d] + z f[] + f[a, b, d] - f[a]f[b,d]      What I would like to do is to make my code to be a little user-friendly by making it throw a message if the expression is invalid. Basically, the only symbols allowed to appear in `f` are `allowedList={a,b,d}`, and so I probably need to somehow use `Scan` to check through `expr`. (The above example should yield an 'error' since the first term has a `c` in it.) To make answering easier, please assume that the input `expr` will be such that all arguments will have `Head = Symbol`. But please allow for the possibility that multiple `f`s could be multiplied together.
