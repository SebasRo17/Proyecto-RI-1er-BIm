Whenever a new framework is released it is a given that someone somewhere will benchmark it against other available solutions. One interesting benchmark is the "Requests per second" benchmark. For example look it this benchmark: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ea42f.png) Now AFAIK Zend framework and Symfony are 2 of the biggest frameworks out there with major companies supporting them. Did the developers make a mistake when designing the framework that resulted in that (relatively) low threshold? If I'm planning to build a web site/app and expecting (relatively) high traffic, should I pay attention to this benchmark? Will my site/app surely go down at the presented figures? Simply I'm asking you as a software architect how you would strategically take into account this benchmark when planning a new project.
