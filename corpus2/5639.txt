One of the little utility packages I use needs to convert Mathematica expressions to `InputForm` text that is interpolated into a custom file format which is then parsed by another tool. That other tool, for various reasons, has to actually parse the `InputForm` expressions, but uses its own parser to do so, and that parser doesn't deal very will with commas in _Mathematica_ expressions. It will choke on something like this:               {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}}      but works fine with this:               {{1,2,3},{4,5,6}}      By default, `ToString`, with the `InputForm` format, will stick spaces in after the commas. Currently, I use `StringReplace` to work around the problem:               stringifyForExport[form_] :=          StringReplace[             ToString[form, InputString, PageWidth -> Infinity,                  CharacterEncoding -> "ASCII"],             " " -> ""];      I'm not very satisfied with this solution because it won't work if we have any strings in `form` that contain spaces. So far this hasn't caused serious problems, but I know it's just a matter of time. Is there a better way to get rid of those spaces?
