I found the **tutorial of client (android) and server (pc) bluetooth** tutorial from here. But my question is **about the UUID.** **Is that okay if we define it randomly without the proper format**? Because I heard UUID is generally for ID for each devices just like IP address used right? For example like this, instead of the following code:               UUID.fromString("00001101-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb");      I define my own UUID               UUID.fromString("myDeviceName009");      Is it okay? I mean is it if i tested on both android device using the above code, they could communicate each other?
