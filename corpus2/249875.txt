I want to include a GPL & Apache duel-licensed font in my LGPL project, but didn't really find a clue if that's possible. There are two problems here:   1. I didn't find any clue about Apache license's "LGPL Compatibilty". I know both the licenses involved here are compatible with GPL, but I still prefer to release the work under LGPL.   2. It's kind of tricky since it's a font. It was GPL & Apache duel-licensed, but the LGPL terms are asking about "Library", its "Public API", "Linking" or something. I am not really sure what the operation belongs to if I just edit a .ttf file manually, not even sure about if that's counted as "source". Any help would be really appreciated!
