Is it true that a person with fairly good fundamentals in programming can easily learn any programming language? Well, when I say programming languages, I refer to the agile and dynamic languages like PHP, Perl, Ruby, etc but not the former programming languages of the distant past. I've worked only on java, groovy and flex to some extent. So considering the fact that I am an amateur programmer but a fast learner, on a rough basis, how long would it take to get a foothold on any one of such languages?
