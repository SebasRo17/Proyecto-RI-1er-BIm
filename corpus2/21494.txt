I have `Combinatorica`` and `GraphUtilities`` loaded in version 9 of _Mathematica_. If I then set:               G = RandomGraph[20,0.5];     G1 = NeighborhoodGraph[G,1];      I get the error message that `NeighborhoodGraph` requires a graph object at position 1. How do I convert `G` into a graph object? I can get this process to work with named graphs in _Mathematica_ using `GraphData` but am clearly missing something with random graphs.
