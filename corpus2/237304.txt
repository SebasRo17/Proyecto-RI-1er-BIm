Is there some specific piece of advice around persist values that indicate type? Specifically I want to know if I should persist a flag/state indicating the type in persistence or not. I get the feeling I'm forgetting/not understanding some core concept of OO or data modelling. Something that's been on my mind for the last while is to consider when to use flags and when not to, and intermixing this idea of recreating objects of some certain type out of persistence. The reason for my concern over flags is that in the software I often create (in-house created corporate software developed with Java), these flags become pieces of information which are hard to maintain and which subsequent developers need to be aware of in order to maintain them (perhaps creating code bloat). So, when I persist my `foo`, should I persist with it some flag that indicates whether it is a `foobar` or a `foobo`? Is there specific advice about this, some gap in my OO-foo or data modelling that I'm forgetting?
