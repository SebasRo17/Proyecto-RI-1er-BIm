When I want to use the Apache 2.0 licence in my project, I should include this in the comments of my source code:               Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]          Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");     you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

See the License for the specific language governing permissions and     limitations under the License.      What name should I fill in for `[name of copyright owner]`? I am currently working alone on this project, but I'm going to release the source code so there might be other contributors in the near future.
