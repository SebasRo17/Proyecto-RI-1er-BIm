I've created a distribution of my open source application framework in a working virtual appliance. It includes everything to get started with the tutorial. The distribution is Fedora 14 running Tomcat 5.5 and Oracle 10g Express Edition, plus my framework. It is completely preconfigured and boots into a working running copy. Would this be something you might try? What assurances might you need to get you to try it? **Edit:** The VM is just over a 2Gb download. Alternatively it is also available via 23Mb download for the source and a PDF detailing how to configure the Tomcat and Oracle dependencies.
