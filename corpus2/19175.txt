I want to make an `InputField` with a horizontal cursor, like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HQfAi.png) Note that the blinking cursor should be horizontal and not the mouse pointer! Nevertheless, text input should still be horizontal and not vertical. The code below shows an `InputField` with the standard vertical cursor but I want a horizontal one.               x = Null;     Style[InputField[Dynamic[x], ImageSize -> {180, 60}, Alignment -> Center], Bold, 20]      Is this possible?
