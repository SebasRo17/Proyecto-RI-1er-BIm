(Note: The examples are simplified) I've seperated my solution into 3 projects   * WebSite   * Business Logic   * Data Access Logic The Website has access to BL and DAL   The BL has access to nothing   The DAL has access to the BL On the website I can do something like               BL.User user = DAL.GetUser(1)      I also have this type of logic in the website               user = [new user information]          If Not DAL.DoesEmailExists(user) Then         DAL.InsertNewUser(user)     End If      What would be my option to remove this if/insert from the website?   My ideal option would be to put this logic inside the BL.User but that's not possible. If the BL has access to the DAL it will make a circular reference.
