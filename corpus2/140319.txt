I noticed that every developer implements a somewhat different flowchart for solving programming problems. By flowchart I mean a defined system of techniques that the developer goes through in a certain sequence, trying to solve the problem at hand. Some examples for techniques:   * Google "how to..." or "... tutorial".   * Search the java/msdn/apple/etc API doc for the specific class or method.   * Search in stack overflow the exact problem with some tags like [iphone]/[java] etc.   * Take a nap and let the subconscious work.   * Debug.   * Draw the algorithm or system.   * Google the logged error message.   * Ask a colleague or manager.   * Ask a new question in stack overflow. From your experience, what is the best flowchart for solving a programming problem?
