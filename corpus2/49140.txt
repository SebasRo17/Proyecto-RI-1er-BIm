I have a function that plots properly in `PolarPlot`, but I'd like to plot it in `ParametricPlot` and then switch the y and x values, or ordinate and abscissa. It doesn't work for my function, but I'm not sure if it's just my function or some other subtle problem:               r[phi_] := (6*(Cos[phi]^5)/(2*Pi))^0.5;     PolarPlot[r[phi], {phi, 0, Pi}]     new[x_] := CoordinateTransform["Polar" -> "Cartesian", {Re[r[x]], x}];     ParametricPlot[{new[x], x}, {x, 0, Pi}]     ParametricPlot[{x, new[x]}, {x, 0, Pi}]      Generates: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SGbzu.jpg) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vuKPj.jpg) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tHFEJ.jpg) The final plot doesn't contain anything, and no errors or warnings are output.
