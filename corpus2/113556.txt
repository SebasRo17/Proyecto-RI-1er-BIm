I do a lot of work in Python and Java, and both those languages have fairly common (though not universal) conventions on how capitalization should be used in identifiers: both use `PascalCase` for class names and `ALL_CAPS` for "global" constants, but for other identifiers a lot of Java code uses `mixedCase` whereas a lot of Python code uses `underscore_delimiters`. I know that no language or library _enforces_ any particular capitalization, but I've found that when I stick to the standard conventions for the language I'm using, my code seems much more readable. Now I'm starting a project in C++, and I'd like to apply the same idea. Is there any most common convention for capitalization that I should know about?
