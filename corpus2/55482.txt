I write a code that creates a compiled function, and then call that function over and over to generate a list. I run this code on a remote server via a batch job, and will run several instances of it. Sometimes when I make changes to the code, I make a mistake, and inside the compiled function is an undefined variable, such that when the function is called I get the following error messages (repeated several times)                CompiledFunction::cfse: Compiled expression w should be a machine-size complex number.           CompiledFunction::cfex: Could not complete external evaluation at instruction 18; proceeding with uncompiled evaluation.      This causes massive memory usage (which puts me on the system administrator's bad side), and the results are garbage if since there was a mistake in the code. Is there any way to force the code to abort and quit the program rather than proceed with uncompiled evaluation?
