I want to solve a system of simple differential equations. At some point I need to solve non-linear system of algebraic equations with Newton method. I would like to efficiently create a right hand side vector using Table[] or similar command. The problem is that the system consists of two equations, so what I need is:               F=Table[     (*do something*)     ,{i,1,k}]      but in fact $F$ should have $2k$ entries. For example for $k=5$ `Length[F]` should return $10$. How to achieve that efficiently? I know I can create different values for odd indexes and even, but then I need additional `If[]` or to break the whole code into two `Table[]` executions what I would like to avoid. I could possibly also create two element lists {a,b}, and flatten it at the end... But It still seems quite expensive.
