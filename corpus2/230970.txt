I'm developing a real time chat app. After searching around for a while, I found Ejabberd and Erlang is a good option. The question is the Ejabberd is not providing all the functions I need. I need some custom features such as location based matching and anonymous login. So how to development custom functions on top of Ejabberd? write modules for it? or develop another standalone server app (web or other kind of server app) to interact with it? Thanks!
