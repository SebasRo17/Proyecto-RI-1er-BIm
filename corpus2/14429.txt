I gather that it should be possible to preserve changes to a stylesheet by simply saving it, but this is not the behavior I'm getting with a stylesheet I've "installed" using the "Install Stylesheet..." button. In order to get any changes I've made to my stylesheet to persist, I need to install the stylesheet again. My saves (I have `Saveable` enabled for the stylesheet) seem to have no effect (the change indicator, doesn't even go away when I "save" it). Do "installed" stylesheets behave differently? Is my opened version of the stylesheet being saved somewhere else, perhaps?
