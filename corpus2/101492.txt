I am completely new to Android development and have been reading many articles on **the Android site** and elsewhere. There are a lot of articles that give very specific examples, but I haven’t bumped into the articles explaining the following: **Logging-In:**   I haven’t noticed market applications forcing me to create login credentials (per se), only verification of access to types of permissions. However, they surely must need some kind of login credential. This means Android is providing this access (somehow). How? What process? **Database Location:**   Some articles I’ve read “imply” a copy of the applications database is located on the phone (itself), others imply a database located elsewhere (cloud etc.). Lastly, others imply they use both a local database for quick updates and a remote database for synching and error-analysis. Is there a common database available for everyone to use?   * I wouldn’t “think” so Do you generate the local copy automatically every time?   * Seems wasteful as you just have to re-create the whole thing and re-synch EVERY entity...but I’ve seen articles promote it. Which databases are you using? What best-practices do you use for synching? **Lastly:**   If this forum isn't the right one I will be happy to move this question. I looked at the **Android Enthusiast** forum and it didn't look like the correct one either.
