My boss found out I'm not as smart as he thought. An example from my experience: I'm a junior programmer, and I work in a team of two, my boss (senior programmer) and myself. I was tasked with developing an internal web-application for the company we work at. I wrote the back-end to the front-end (the database design was in already place and the server technology had been chosen). He would periodically check on my progress by observing the web-application in action and was happy with out it was coming along. When I finished the web-app he was pleased with how well the end-product turned out. A few days ago he became interested in the code so I told him what technologies I used (for the front-end), and this is where it went south. For the front-end of the web-app I used a Javascript framework (Backbone.js). When asked why I would do such a thing. My response was because that I felt that the framework fit into this app quite well, and would help me structure the code better than if I wrote it from scratch...."Well, that's dis-heartening" was his response. So given this example my question is: If your a senior programmer and have lost confidence in the ability of your junior programmer, what would you like to see from your junior to gain the confidence back? **EDIT** : Thank you everyone for the great answers and supportive feedback!
