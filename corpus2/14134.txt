Is there a possibility to factorize a parametric polynomial expression - meaning that the coefficients are defined as parameters, and not as specific numbers? My example - a polynomial in `s`, with `R1, ..., R5` and `C1, ..., C2` being parameters:               LP2nTfDen = R1 R4 + R4 R5 + C2 R1 R2 R4 s + C1 R1 R3 R5 s + C2 R2 R4 R5 s -                 C1 C2 R1 R2 R4 R5 s^2      I'd like _Mathematica_ to transform the expression in the form `(A + s) (B + s)` ..., `A`, `B`, etc. being expressions of `R1, ..., R5`, `C1`, `C2`. Is this possible?
