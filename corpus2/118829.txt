Call me paranoid, but I really like to keep my stuff secret, but readily available on the cloud. So, asking this question.   1. How safe and reliable is encryption software (e.g., truecrypt)? The reason I ask is that, what is I encrypt my data today with this software and after a couple of years, the software is gone ! What happens to my encrypted data?   2. Is it equally safe to AES encrypt using 7-zip? Will it provide the same level or equivalent level of encryption as truecrypt or other encryption software? (I agree truecrypt will be better because of the container encryption it gives.) And what happens if 7-zip shuts down after 5 years? I am sorry if I am sounding paranoid, but I am coming back to my original question... Is there any application/software independent encryption? Meaning, can I encrypt with one software and decrypt with another so that I will not be dependent on just one vendor? I want my encryption to depend ONLY on the password and NOT on the encryption program/software? The next question, can I write my own program that does AES/stronger encryption when I give it a passphrase, so that I don't need to depend on third party software for encryption? If yes, which language supports the same? Can someone give me a heads up as to where to look for in case of writing my own encryption program?
