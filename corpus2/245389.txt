Here is a little background of my problem: I implemented a singleton logger class which is being called from several projects. I want to log the name of the class as well as the name of the method asked for logging. So far, I thought about two ways to get the name of the method and the class - either by reflection or by manually writing them. The advantage of using reflection is that whenever the name of the class or the method will be renamed, which is not that often, it will be updated automatically. The disadvantage of reflection is that it is performance consuming and it is suggested not to use it whenever you can avoid it, as can be seen in the documentation of reflection (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/index.html) or in various threads online. What would be the best way and why?
