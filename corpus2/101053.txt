On code reviews at work I have been seeing code & patterns that I consider "clever" though not necessarily adding to the overall quality or maintainability of the code base. I point this out on my feedback and am unconvinced by the counterarguments. I am a bit concerned when this code makes into into the repo and later to production. I want to maintain a cohesive team, so I dont want to create tension by being too vocal about my reservations. I also want to create a great product for our customers without being too leninent. Traditionally, who has 'veto' power on what gets checked in and how? How can code that works, but its too involved/clever be removed without stepping on toes?
