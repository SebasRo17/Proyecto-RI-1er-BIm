I have been working on building a sample application to add to my portfolio (for freelancing). I am working on building a Shopping website using ASP.Net MVC. My question is - what are the good features of a portfolio? Is it to showcase your coding skills (by developing everything from scratch?) or using open-source shopping cart such as nopcommerce to quickly build soemthing that works and is fool-proof?) I am confused as to which direction to proceed. Kindly guide me. Also, what are the good features to add in my site? As I mentioned earlier, this is an ASP.Net MVC application. Thanks in advance.
