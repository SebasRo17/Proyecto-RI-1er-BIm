I'm graduating in a couple of weeks, and my resume (as expected) lists the languages that I've had experience with. Previously I've put **"C/C++"** , however back then I didn't have _that_ much experience with these two languages as I do now. Now that I've formally learned these two languages, it has become evident to me (and anyone who really knows these languages) that they are similar, and completely disimilar at the same time. Sure, most C code is compilable C++ code, but syntax and incorporation of library functions is pretty much where these similarities end. In most non-trivial problems, chances are that the desirable C++ solution will be different from the desirable C solution.   ### My question:    Will recruiters take note or care about whether you put **"C/C++"** as opposed to **"C, C++"**? Will they assume a lack of knowledge of the workings of either because of the inclusion of the first form, or perhaps see the inclusion of the second form as a potential "resume beefer" (listing them as 2 languages, instead of "one")? Furthermore, for jobs that you've applied to that were particularly interested in these two langauges, did the interview process include questions about the differences between C programming and C++ programming (so, about actual programming techniques, not only the extra paradigms in the latter)?
