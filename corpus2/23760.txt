I have a `"GeoTIFF"` format map, and I have imported it into Mathematica, then I used the `Graphics` to plot a point on the map. But I don't know how to plot the X_axle and Y_axle?               tif = Import["E:\\Yan.tif", "Graphics"];     Graphics[{First@tif, PointSize[0.05],        Point[{400, 250}, VertexColors -> Red]}]      And I tried the command               Import["E:\\Yan.tif", {"GeoTIFF", "SpatialRange"}]
