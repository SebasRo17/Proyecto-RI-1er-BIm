I'm currently doing R&D for a web application which we plan to host ourselves initially and then allow customers to self host. My task has been evaluating web frameworks to see which would give us the biggest productivity initially and ease of maintence while also allowing us to easily support deployment to customer controlled environments. Our team has experience with ASP.NET (MVC and Webforms) and Ruby on Rails. Our experience with Rails is that Windows deployment is a very taboo subject and any questions on IRC or StackOverflow are met with knee jerk "why not Linux" responses. However in this case our target market may be running windows or Linux servers.   * Is this also the case in Django land?   * Is it possible with rubbish performance?   * Is it possible with lost of pain?   * Is it seen as reasonable and not treated as a completely stupid idea for not wanting to run Linux?
