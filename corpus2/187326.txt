I'm trying to implement a modified version of the Lamport Mutual Exclusion algorithm. The original algorithm assumes FIFO message ordering between connected systems, but I would like to use ~~UDP~~ a protocol which does not guarantee FIFO. Is it possible to modify this algorithm to work without FIFO? EDIT: Forget UDP. Just assume it is some protocol where the only problem is that FIFO is not guaranteed. That is the only problem I'm concerned with right now.
