I've run into some code (C# if it matters) that has classes which have the same name, but differ in their namespaces. They all tend to represent the same logical thing, but often are different "views" of the same object. The different namespaces are at times part of the same solution, and even the same dll. I have my thoughts, but couldn't find anything definitive about this practice to be considered a clever use of the tools available or a pattern to avoid. This question on smurf naming touches on this, but from the other direction. Disambiguating the names would likely require an arbitrary and pervasive prefix, which that question wanted to eliminate. What are the guidelines around this practice?
