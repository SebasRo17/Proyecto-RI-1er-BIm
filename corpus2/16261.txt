I have a simulation, and I would like to export the parameters and results to a same spreadsheet without overwriting the previous values. if I have:               parameter1 = {0.1};     parameter2 = {0.2};     result1 = {10};     result2 = {20};      And if I export it I get that. But then if I change the parameters and run the simulation again, I would like these new values to go right after the ones I had previously exported.               parameter1 = {0.1,0.3};     parameter2 = {0.2,0.2};     result1 = {10,25};     result2 = {20,30};      As a spreadsheet or a list with headings would be best. I saw an answer to a similar question recommended creating a spreadsheet beforehand and then defining the cells where the values should be exported to, but this would still rewrite the cells. I guess I could always manually change the location after each simulation. Maybe mathematica has some built-in function to do something like this? I am still very new, I apologize if this question is elementary or doesn't make sense. Any help is much appreciated!
