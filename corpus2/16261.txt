I've been working on a 15" machine for years, but recently I was tempted by the 13" MacBook Pro. Because I'm often on the road, I was looking mostly for a lightweight machine, considering I've external screens almost in every place where I work. Is there anybody who's working on a 13" MacBook Pro that would give me a tip? Is it your best friend or you're gonna throw it out the window? Outside my world made of code and IDEs, I really don't care about apple rumors: should I wait because a new version of the MacBook Pro is gonna be released? Your help is appreciated, thanks.
