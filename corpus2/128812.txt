I was building an application in .Net for almost a year (almost alone), I took the decision to build it with a 3-layer design. Recently when finished the project, I analyzed if the effort of creating this application with layer design in mind really compensate for the "benefits" obtained implementing such design. Out of port the desktop application to web without any major code rewrite and to be almost database-agnostic; I don't see any further benefits of this. Any experiences, and thoughts?
