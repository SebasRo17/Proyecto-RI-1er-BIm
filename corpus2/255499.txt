I have a hard time trying to find a moderne (updated), complete knowledge source (book or tutorial) that would tackle from scratch the server side of iOS App Development. My goal is to create an app in which users can talk to each others, see each others' profiles, share images... I am fairly new to backend implementation, I only know the basics of PHP (but I am good in other iOS development topics). I have been searching for a lot of books/tutorials, but I am frustrated for the following reasons : \-- code is too old and needs to be updated \-- a third-party library needs to be used Has anyone ever found something that would take the newbie from scratch, explaining and giving examples of backend side implementation in a modern way? I know this is a broad question, but if someone has already stumbled upon a great resource, I'd be happy to read it ! Thanks, BM
