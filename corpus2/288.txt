On all of the servers that I regularly interact with, I have ssh-keys setup for passwordless access via ssh. Yet, every time I attempt to start a remote- kernel over ssh, I get asked for a password despite having a ssh-keyagent up and running. What do I need to add to the kernel configuration, such as the launch command, to have it use my ssh-key? I'm using version 8.0.4 on MacOS 10.6.8, if it makes a difference.
