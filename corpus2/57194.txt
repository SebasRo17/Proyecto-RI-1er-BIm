I have a network that I've loaded into Mathematica, and I've used `FindGraphCommunitites[network,Method->"Hierarchical"]` to identify the communities in the network. I know that I can use `CommunityGraphPlot[network]` to visually plot the graph, however, **I would like to export to CSV a list of each vertex in the graph and the community they belong to.**               ## Import .gml data     network=Import["file.gml"]          ## Run community detection     FindGraphCommunitites[network,Method->"Hierarchial"]          ## Number of communities     Length[FindGraphCommunitites[network,Method->"Hierarchial"]]          ## Number of vertices in each community     Length/@FindGraphCommunitites[network,Method->"Hierarchial"]          ## Plot network with community structure     CommunityGraphPlot[network,Method->"Hierarchial"]
