What would you do if you were in a situation where the project you are working on is obviously built poorly and will have failures in the future and be a nightmare to maintain...but it is considered a "success" by management because the clients are happy? Should I just not care? Is it ok that the clients don't even realize they could have a better application than this? At what point do I stop caring about building it right and just go with the flow?
