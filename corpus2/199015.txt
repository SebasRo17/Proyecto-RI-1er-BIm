Looking at some camera metadata on Windows `File Properties` there are (along with a few more) two `Properties` named _Focal length_ and _35mm focal length_. I'm developing software that will make use of these two `Properties`. So far I have created a `Property` named `FocalLength` for the first, but I cannot seem to find a proper name for the other one. I have thought of `_35MmFocalLength` or `ThirtyFiveMmFocalLength`, but I think there might be a better suggestion. Any ideas?
