I'd like to find a model $f(t)=a\,b^t$ which matches the following data               data = {{0.0, 100.0}, {0.02, 81.87}, {0.04, 67.03}, {0.06, 54.88},             {0.08, 44.93}, {0.10, 36.76}};      I tried this:               FindFit[data, a*b^t, {a, b}, t]      But that results in an error:               FindFit::nrlnum: The function value {-4.38571+0. I,<<4>>,136.386+<<1>>} is not          a list of real numbers with dimensions {6} at {a,b} = {95.6143,-626.386}. >>      The answer to the problem is $a \approx 100.01244$ and $b \approx 0.000045146$. Is there a way to use `FindFit[]` to get the correct answer? Should I be using some other function? This is from problem 3.4.85 in Calculus/Stewart 6E stated as follows: > The flash unit on a camera operates by storing charge on a capacitor and > releasing it suddenly when the flash is set of f. The following data > describe the charge remaining on the capacitor (measured in microcoulombs, > ÂµC) at time (measured in seconds): > > ... > > Use a graphing calculator or computer to find an exponential model for the > charge.
