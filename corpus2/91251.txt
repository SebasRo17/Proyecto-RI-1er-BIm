C is an awesome simple language perfect for close-to-hardware programming, but the preprocessor sucks in comparison to modern languages. Is there an alternative/add-on to the c preprocessor that adds modern features to C pre-processing (eg import vs includes)? In particular, I'm looking for namespaces (or something close to that), a readable macro language, and a more powerful macro language (with reflection). Or do I need to look in to viable alternatives to C for doing embedded programming (my own projects, not contract work where I take on or pass off project) I am aware of D, but haven't really looked into using it for embedded. *edit I can't believe nobody pointed me to this! eLua
