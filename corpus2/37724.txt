I have an expression like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/eFiad.jpg)               Assuming[m [\Element] Integers && n [\Element] Integers, 1/2 I J n (4-m n+n^2) KroneckerDelta[m,-n]]//FullSimplify      Now, since `KroneckerDelta` has attribute `Orderless`, that means it will sort things into canonical order, and since my expression has $n^2$ in it, I assume that's why it's evaluating the Kronecker for m->-n (I tried putting KroneckerDelta[n,-m] but got the same result). Now, technically this is correct. But I'd like that my expression was given in terms of `m`, not `n`. If I manually replace `n` by `-m` I get the desired output $$-iJm(2+m^2)$$ but I'd like to get that automatically within Mathematica. Is that possible without explicitly doing the replacement `/.n->-m`?
