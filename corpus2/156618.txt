My goal is to check commit data that don't meet certain requirements and then reject either the commit being created or pushed to the remote repository. The problem of doing a pre-commit hook is that it's hard to deploy to many people who have to manually update their pre-commit hook file. As well, Git does not allow you to have submodules in the .git folder which would've been very easy for deployment yet alas. The other option I see is doing the checking in I believe the update hook on the remote side, which will check each commit being pushed by a dev and reject the push if any of the commits fail the tests. Does anyone have any insight on this problem? And if so, could you provide or point me towards an example update hook script? I'm a little confused as to how it works.
