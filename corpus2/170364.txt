Well, with no prior job experience I am completely ignorant of how things happen at software companies. I want to know what programmers are made to do when there is nothing to do? Lets consider Facebook or Twitter. Now it is quite improbable that Facebook people have something or other feature in mind to be implemented. So software developers are quite expected to have some time when there is nothing to do. Are they free to do anything in this?
