I have to admit, until recently I did not know there was such a thing as a "System DBA" and "Application DBA." Currently, I am an Application/System Admin for a large CMS. I would like to pursue a track/training that would eventually lead to this role of "Application DBA", the ultimate goal being understanding how to best use Apps and DBs together. Our Apps run on Oracle 10g. I do OK with basic SQL (selects, inserts, updates and can figure out a join or two, etc), but right now most of our DB support (e.g., generating and interpreting AWR reports, etc) is from the System DBA. I came across several posts that talked about becoming a DBA, but I would appreciate any advice and pointers towards an "Application DBA" role.
