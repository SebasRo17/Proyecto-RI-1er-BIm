I'm running Coldfusion 8 and SQL server 2008. I've been building serveral forms that insert data into the database from external users, we have a custom built security module built by the guy who I've taken his job. 1) How can we test our HTML forms to ensure that we're protected from SQL injection attacks? 2) How do I secure CFqueries in CFC's? 3) What are some best practices in terms of SQL & Coldfusion for security? \-- A lot I know!
