I am new to `Mathematica` and want to change the `FillingStyle` Dynamically in this `Plot`. I want that when I pick a color from the "Color" then, it should dynamically change in the Sin plot.                a = RGBColor[1, 2, 0]      Row[{Button["<<Color>>", a = SystemDialogInput["Color"]],      Evaluate[Plot[Sin[m], {m, -Pi, Pi}, Filling -> Bottom,      FillingStyle -> Dynamic[a]]]}]      I am able to pick a color but the plot is not changing dynamically. But, it changes when I am executing it again.
