I got into the game of programming, exactly a year ago. Now i am posing as an HTML, CSS and Javascript Guru. html5 and css3 are the new things out there but in my opinion they are still experimental, (some new websites remind me of the blink tag). I know HTML 4.x and xhtml were out there for a very long time and eventually became standards. But i wasn't around to see that transition from experimental to strict standards. So my question is how long will it take for us to get there with these new versions of html, css and javascript. Most of the code I see around is accommodating older browsers, and i can fairly say that it is easier to write javascript code that work in ie5-8 than to write one that works with i9 and ie5 (let's take localStorage for this example). So when are we going to get to this level where if you want to make sure code works almost universally you have to make sure it's at least HTML5 and CSS3 compliant.
