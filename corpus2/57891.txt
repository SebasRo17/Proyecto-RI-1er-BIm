I am baffled by this. I was trying to run same example I had working in version 9.01 and found now I get empty plots. The example is here . Here is a simplified version of the above. The same exact example produces a plot in version 9.01. But in Version 10, it is empty. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/t6ajQ.png)               w = 1; z = 0.07;     sys = TransferFunctionModel[w^2/(s^2 + 2 z*w*s + w^2), s];     fun = First@OutputResponse[sys, DiracDelta[t], {t, 0, 20}];     Plot[Evaluate[%], {t, 0, 20}]      I tried to find what is going on, so I asked for analytical solution, in version 10 it says:               w = 1; z = 0.07;     sys = TransferFunctionModel[w^2/(s^2 + 2 z*w*s + w^2), s];     fun = First@OutputResponse[sys, DiracDelta[t], t] // ComplexExpand // Simplify // Chop      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/E8C68.png) In version 9.01:               w = 1; z = 0.07;     sys = TransferFunctionModel[w^2/(s^2 + 2 z*w*s + w^2), s];     fun = First@OutputResponse[sys, DiracDelta[t], t] // ComplexExpand // Simplify // Chop      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jF5Vi.png) So in version 10 the solution seems to be reversed. going back in time !                Plot[Evaluate[fun], {t, -20, 0}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xD0uO.png) Any idea what is going on? What changes could have caused this?
