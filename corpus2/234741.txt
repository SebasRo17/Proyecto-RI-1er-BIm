Do location based services on mobile devices know what business you are in exactly or does it just have a general approximation of where you are and you have to manually check in to be specific? Trying to see if it's possible for a application on a mobile phone to use location services to determine how many given people are in a particular business without having to manually check in. Is this possible,and if so, would this be accurate information or a loose approximation? Thanks in advance ^_^
