I've been using xmgrace for quite a long time as my favorite solution for scientific data manipulation and plotting. These data often come from home- made fortran programs, in the form of, e.g., a formatted file with `x y z f` columns. I discovered that Mathematica (v9 here) is quite remarkable for this purpose. In xmgrace, the data you are plotting is stored (made persistent) in the xmgrace file itself (file.agr), which is very convenient because sharing the xmgrace file both shares the plot and the data being plotted. Is it possible to make the data stored inside the Mathematica (.nb) file? Note: the answer should be compatible with any quantity of data. For illustration purpose, my xmgrace file can exceed 500 MB.
