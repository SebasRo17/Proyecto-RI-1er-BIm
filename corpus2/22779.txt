When we look at the usage messages of built-in functions nowadays (not in the good old times, when they were a simple descriptions) we see that although they look pretty in the front end, it is really hard to get a simple, one- dimensional string representation. Just try this and see yourself               ToString[Integrate::usage]      This is completely useless when one seeks for a simple string form. When you look at the _Wolfram Workbench_ you may have noted, that they _do_ provide simple string usage messages even for built-in functions. **Question:** Is it possible to create/extract/steal simple, non-formatted usage messages for **all** (or almost all) built-in functions **automatically**? With _automatically_ I mean having one function which works for almost all usage messages. To give an example, the `Integrate` help message of the _Workbench_ looks like this: > Integrate[f,x] gives the indefinite integral Integral f dx. > Integrate[f,{x,xmin,xmax}] gives the definite integral Integral _xmin ^xmax > f dx. Integrate[f,{x,xmin,xmax},{y,ymin,ymax},...] gives the multiple > integral Integral _xmin ^xmaxdxIntegral _ymin ^ymaxd y ... f. > > Attributes: {Protected,ReadProtected} Options: > {Assumptions,GenerateConditions,PrincipalValue}
