In a list with factors of which most are prime, some are integer powers of some common prime as base. All the powers from `1` to `imax` of that base are present in the list. The value of `imax`, however, is unknown. I have to delete from the list all powers of that base except the highest. Equivalently we can e.g.:   * change all the values of the powers of the known base into the base value and multiply them,   * delete all the lower powers of the known common base from the list. An example with `base = 5` and `imax = 3`:               list1 = {2, 5, 13, 25, 125, 3001, 230686501}      should become {2, 13, 125, 3001, 230686501}      or one with `base = 13` and `imax = 2`:               list2 = {13, 169, 233, 741469, 159607993}     should become {169, 233, 741469, 159607993}      I did find `Gather` and `GatherBy`, is it possible to `GatherBy` common powers of the same (beforehand unknown common) base?               In[1]:= li3 = {2, 5, 11, 5, 7, 5};          In[2]:= Times @@@ Gather[li3]      > >     Out[2]= {2, 125, 11, 7}   >   Any help is appreciated. Thanks.
