I have the need to trim each of a large number of potentially very long lists (10^6+ elements) to the length where the last occurrence of any distinct element happens, or said another way, where the next element is the first duplication of any prior element of that list. Lists are simple integer elements, but will often be beyond machine precision. For example, given a list `{3, 24, 50, 41, 46, 21, 20, 3, 2, 5, 29, 28, 38, 22, 2}` it should return `7`. I'm using: `-Tr[Unitize[# - #2[[ ;; Length[#]]]] - 1] &[DeleteDuplicates[#], #] &[yourListHere]` which is reasonably swift. Wondering if there's a better solution.
