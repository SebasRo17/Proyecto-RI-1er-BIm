I have a sphere of radius 5 and a cone (i.e. z=âˆš(x^2+y^2)) inside of it. I can show them separately, but I'd like to show them together. I've tried a few tricks with opacity, implicit specifications, show, and range changes, but nothing is giving me a satisfying result. Really I'd like to show the "ice cream cone" shape by itself, but I'd settle for a cone under a hemisphere right now. Anyone know how I can get this done? Thanks in advance
