I need this algorithm for one of my projects. I will paraphrase the problem. There are 'n' ropes that have different colored rings on them. (The colors might repeat on the same rope or across different ropes). My job is to pick a few of these ropes and join them such that all the colors in the n ropes are included in that joined rope. I should get the smallest rope size possible. I am allowed to cut each rope once and discard the end part if needed. There is one pre-defined end for each rope which should be used as the starting point incase that rope is included in the solution. It will be nice to have exact solution for this.(This gives us something like a goal that our project is aiming to achieve). Can someone tell me how I might approach this? The n is about 10^5 for my work. The total number of colors is also of the order of 10^5. The number of distinct colored rings on each rope ranges from 0 to about 10^3 at most.
