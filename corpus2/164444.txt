I switched to C++ a few months ago, learning its syntax, the main features of the STL and what you can usually find in a "learn C++" manual. Now I would like to go further. What would be your recommendations? I would like to know what to learn next (not only about the language, but also debugging, frameworks etc. etc.) I know probably the answer depends on the specific needs of each user, so here is a list of mine:   * Cross Platform development   * Developing GUI for my programs   * Develop extendible software, allowing the use of plugins   * Use of scientific libraries   * Interact with databases (mainly MySQL)   * Having server/client functionalities (I'd like users of my programs to interact through internet.. as you might have guessed I am not a programmer by training so I might have used the wrong terms.. if so I apologize for that). Of course I know it takes time, but I would like to have a good list of references and resources to start (both books and websites are ok). Thanks a lot for your help!
