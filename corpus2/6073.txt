Is there a way of obtaining the current number of a counterbox? Say for instance that in a new notebook you create 3 section cells. Then by evaluating the command:               CellPrint[Cell[TextData[CounterBox["Section"]]]]      You can see now many cells with the style `"Section"` you have created up to the point at which you evaluated the command. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZvTFy.png) Is there a way of obtaining the the number of "Sections" created without having to print a cell displaying a CounterBox? I would like to do something like:               GetCounterNumber["Section"]      and it should return the total number of Sections created. It should behave similarly for subsections and other cells that have counters.
