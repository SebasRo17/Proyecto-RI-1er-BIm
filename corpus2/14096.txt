I'm trying to do an example of trig modelling. Very simple, but hoping to use real data. I can get weather data for where I live here, and it makes a pretty reasonable sinusoid                   DateListPlot[      WeatherData["Edmonton",        "MeanTemperature", {{2005, 1, 1}, {2011, 12, 31}, "Month"}],       Joined -> True]      ![weather data](http://i.stack.imgur.com/sFBTh.png) I am looking for a VERY SIMPLE overlay of an actual sine graph, period would be 1 year, I'm guessing the midline would be about 5 degrees, amplitude is about 15 degrees, and phase shift is 0. This is just as much a math question as a Mathematica question. Like I said, I don't need a trig regression, at least not for this example. Just want to illustrate the process to my students, approximate a, b, c and d in the general equation y = a + b sin c(x-d) to show them a transformation of a function to reasonably match this data. If I find a plot that is reasonable, how do I overlay the two graphs? Also, I figured sunrise or sunset times would have been a better source of data, but didn't see anyway to access that from MMA, though I could get it from Alpha. Yes, this is non-math major, non-Mathematica expert , lame question! But help is appreciated. Okay, with help from @b.gatessucks I have made some progress, though I still value any feedback or help. So I get the weather data               data = WeatherData["Edmonton",         "MeanTemperature", {{2005, 1, 1}, {2011, 12, 31}, "Month"}];      changed the list to a numerical form, where the first entry is the number of seconds since Jan. 1 , 1900               newdata1 = {AbsoluteTime[#[[1]]], #[[2]]} & /@ data      I wanted this graph to have more reasonable numbers to use as an example with high school students, so I got the number of seconds up to Jan. 1, 2005 (where my data starts)               t1 = AbsoluteTime[{2005, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0}]       and subtract this from every entry so our time scale now has 0 at Jan. 1, 2005               newdata2 = {#[[1]] - t1, #[[2]]} & /@ newdata1      Now take that and divide by the number of seconds in year since I'd like each 1 on the time axis to represent 1 year               year = 3.154 10^7     newdata3 = {#[[1]]/year, #[[2]]} & /@ newdata2      This gives this plot ![list plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/724KU.png) Which now lets me write a sin function using "reasonable" numbers. Note, I know this isn't a "fit" , it was intended to be more of a visual exercise in transformations of sine function. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TogK1.png)               Show[ListPlot[newdata3, Joined -> True],       Plot[2 + 15 Sin[2 \[Pi] (x - 0.25)], {x, 0, 7}, PlotStyle -> Dashed],       PlotRange -> {{-1, 7}, {-15, 20}}, ImageSize -> 300]
