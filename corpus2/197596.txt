I am interested to know what other peoples' experiences are with managing development infrastructure are. I am talking about things like the build server, the central git repo etc etc. Any infrastructure which end users would probably not even know existed, but which are essential for the development team.   1. Do your dev/devops/ops teams consider them to be as important as 'true' production systems?   2. What happens when one goes down (both in terms of ramifications and recovery processes)?   3. Who should be responsible for managing them? Note: to complicate things (especially (3) above, our "teams" are small, about five or six devs and only the one sys admin. Hence, there is a lot of crossover of us devs in to ops, especially with the advent of the "devops" movement and technologies. Disclaimer - I am the author of this blog post about the subject.
