In a interview I was asked, _Suppose we are going to create a software that runs on both desktop machines and smartphones. Name a software design pattern that could be used to enable the application to create different classes for display at runtime depending on the platform._ I know there are simple solutions to implement this feature in the actual code. For example, in Java I can check the display size and create the suitable class (`MobileDisplay` or `DesktopDisplay` class) for that display. But I don't how this is related to the software design. IMO creating suitable class based on runtime platform is an implementation concern than a software design issue.
