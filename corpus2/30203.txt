I'm trying to add popupwindows to tooltips for points on an ErrorListPLot but all the popupwindows appear on screen immediately when I run the command below that plots the graph. After closing all the popupwindows the tooltips and popupwindows work as intended, so when I hover over the points in the plot I get the right tooltip, and when I click on the points I get the popupwindow. I thought I was missing a semicolon somewhere but I think it is more basic then that. The tooltips are unique for each point so they are indexed in a loop, but this simplified example illustrates the problem with the popupwindows appearing prior to clicking on the points. I'm sure there must be an amazingly concise and elegant fix using # & and @ characters amongst others but I am a complete novice in need of enlightenment! Thanks for taking the time to read this.               xyPoints= {{{-152., 1.428}, {-83.9858, 1.88051}, {-84.,         2.066}, {-133.466, 1.76653}}, {{-152., 1.428}, {-83.9858,         1.88051}}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}}          errorBars= {{ErrorBar[{-86.0233, 86.0233}, {-0.07, 0.07}],        ErrorBar[{-70.3562, 70.3562}, {-0.0494975, 0.0494975}],        ErrorBar[{-111.803, 111.803}, {-0.1, 0.1}],        ErrorBar[{-81.7902, 81.7902}, {-0.0647275,          0.0647275}]}, {ErrorBar[{-86.0233, 86.0233}, {-0.07, 0.07}],        ErrorBar[{-70.3562, 70.3562}, {-0.0494975,          0.0494975}]}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}}          test = Table[        Table[{PopupWindow[           Tooltip[Transpose[{xyPoints[[i]], errorBars[[i]]}][[j]],            Grid[{{"Tooltip hello"}}, Alignment -> Left, Frame -> All],            TooltipStyle -> Medium],           Pane[Grid["Popup hello"], Scrollbars -> True,             ImageSize -> {650, 400}], WindowSize -> {700, 450}]          }, {j, Range[Length[errorBars[[i]]]]}],        {i, Range[maxSeries]}];          ErrorListPlot[test[[1]]]
