I am trying to follow the documentation on `NonlinearStateSpaceModel` here, and the first basic example throws me for a loop. It says it's defining the nonlinear system $x_1'(t)=u(t)+x_1(t)x_2(t)$ $x_2'(t)=u(t)x_2(t)$ with output $y(t)=x_1(t)$ The example call is written               nsys = NonlinearStateSpaceModel[{{u-x1 x2, u x2+1}, {x1}}, {x1, x2}, u]      This appears to be the arity-3 overload for `NonlinearStateSpaceModel`, which, if right, must fit the template $\textrm{NonlinearStateSpaceModel}[\{f,g\},x,u]$ representing the model $x'(t)=f(x(t), u(t)), y(t)=g(x(t),u(t))$ That means that $x$ is `{x1, x2}` $f$ is `{u - x1*x2, u*x2 + 1}` $g$ is `{x1}` which I can only read as $x_1'(t)=u(t)-x_1(t)x_2(t)$ $x_2'(t)=1+u(t)x_2(t)$ with output $y(t)=x_1(t)$ which doesn't look anything like the system they say they're defining. I've blinked my eyes several times and stared at it for too long. It's either a horrendous cluster of typos or I just don't know how to read these models.
