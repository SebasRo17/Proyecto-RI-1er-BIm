I am trying to learn Lisp and looking at all the Lisps out there and their differences. I see that in some implementations of Scheme, you can use square brackets interchangeably with round brackets for readability, so because they are treated the same, I assume they are still just S-expressions like everything else. However, in Clojure I see that square brackets and curly braces are used to represent different data types like vectors and so on. Are these also still valid S-expressions, or must they be considered atoms? Doesn't this "break" the whole concept of S-expressions, thereby making Clojure an "impure" Lisp?
