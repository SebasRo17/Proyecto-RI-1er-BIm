Last year, my department developed web based gaming, and needed Flash. It was difficult to manage. The Flash guys didn't fit in regardless of skill or popularity in the office. Maybe it's prejudice from the AS 2.0 days, or C programmers do things differently in my department. I don't get it! **EXAMPLE**   They hired a BAD Flash Guy used Tweener and Keyframes (they hated him). Then they hired a GOOD Flash Guy that was expert at AS 3.0 and followed best OOP standards (they liked him). The result was the same, the C programmers overwrote all of they're code, even the GOOD Flash Guy's code. **QUESTION**   **Is it better to have C developers learn Flash, than hire Flash guys?** No offense to Flash guy's, I'm trying to understand this on a project management level.   Thanks,
