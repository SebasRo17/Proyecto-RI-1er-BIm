Some programming languages (e.g. Java and C++) have language features called "packages" or "namespaces". How useful is it really to have namespaces? It is possible to mark functions and classes as belonging to some particular library without using such a language feature, like the SDL does (e.g. `SDL_BlitSurface()`). Are namespaces not helpful enough to be worth having? Are they useful in libraries but not in applications? Are they useful everywhere except for in small projects? Thoughts?
