This is what I am stuck on               f[a_][x_] := x^2 + a;     w[a_] := Take[NestList[f[-1.8], 0, 1000], 100]      Now I want to evaluate this for different values of the constant $a$ from -1.8, to 0.3, store the results in a table, suppress the results because they will be very long, and then make a plot of $a$ versus $x$ using `ListPlot`. How can I evaluate for different values of $a$ and then plot? I have tried the `Do` function but can't get it to work.
