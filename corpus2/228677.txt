I have some JSON data in this format (5,000 instances for now):               {"id":"123456","icon":"icon.png","caseName":"name of case"}      I am allowing the user to search for the name of the case and then return the id and icon to them, and in some situations, **use** the case id to run other functions, based on the search. How should I read this data? I'm currently leaning towards a switch because I want the switch to allow me to define multiple cases giving me the same result:               name of case and name-of-case should return me the id 123456      I can easily use a switch based on the string, listing out different cases, to do this. Probably going to be extremely tedious, but it's an option. So, my options I can think of are as follows:   1. Run a massive switch based on the query string (probably in a separate PHP file)   2. Store this result in a MySQL database, then based on the query string, retrieve the data, and I probably need to do indexing (which I understand, but have no idea how to implement). Also, I would like to prepare for the scenario that this 5,000 instances increases to 10,000 instances at some point in time. What's the best way of going about this? Thanks.
