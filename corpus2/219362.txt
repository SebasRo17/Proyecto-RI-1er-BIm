I have a DAO method that utilizes Spring for JDBC access. It calculates a seller's success rate of selling an item. Here is the code:               public BigDecimal getSellingSuccessRate(long seller_id) {         String sql = "SELECT SUM(IF(sold_price IS NOT NULL, 1, 0))/SUM(1)                        FROM transaction WHERE seller_id = ?";         Object[] args = {seller_id};         return getJdbcTemplate().queryForObject(sql, args, BigDecimal.class);     }      How should I go about testing this method or any DAO method with JUnit? What are some best practices to test the data access logic? I am thinking of testing it against an embeddable database loaded with some data, but shouldn't we do integration tests similar to a production environment in terms of RDBMS and the schema?
