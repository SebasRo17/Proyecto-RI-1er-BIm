I've recently written a piece of software (without any other contributors) for a company which I part own. I was wondering if I could distribute it with the following permission notice, which is a modified version of the MIT License. Are there any obvious risks if I do distribute with this licence and does it give me the right to reuse the code in other projects? > Permission is hereby granted, to any person within **CompanyName** (the > "Company") obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation > files, excluding any third party libraries (the "Software"), to deal with > the Software, with limitations restricted to use, copy, modify and merge, > the Software may not be published, distributed, sublicensed and/or sold > without the explicit permission from **AuthorName** (the "Author").
