I am trying to upload my CDF files to Blogspot. I tried the follow script:               <script src="http://www.wolfram.com/cdf-player/plugin/v2.1/cdfplugin.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script type="text/javascript"> var cdf = new cdfplugin(); cdf.embed('https://www.dropbox.com/s/erpdi1rqwk5d3vm/Spe%20Para%20Dat.cdf', 500, 500); </script>      But when I try to acess it, I receive the message "File could not be loaded". I thought that maybe it was because I am using an `Import[]`, but even if I try to use a CDF Example I have the same problem. For me it seems that the problem is with the link of the file I updated. Do you know how to solve this? Thanks in advance.
