I developed an intranet (local network) `ASP.NET` web project for my co- workers. In the development process I used `Chrome` and `Firefox` and didn't test much with `Internet Explorer`. The website works well with `Firefox` and `Chrome` and with `IE` it had major bugs. **Is it legitimate to ask the users to use`Chrome` or `Firefox`?** They are all co-workers (around 15 users). I don't want to spend time fixing the bugs for `IE`, some might be related to stuff I can't fix myself (`jQuery` things), if I wanted to be compatible with all browsers, I would have to make a major re-design,
