I encountered this when I was trying to answer this question. I just can't understand why the following code will only give a line at $y=0$:               Plot[PDF[PolyaAeppliDistribution[7, 1/4], x], {x, 0, 35}, Axes -> {False, True}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xwEJL.jpg) While with `Evaluate` I'll get the desired result:               Plot[Evaluate@PDF[PolyaAeppliDistribution[7, 1/4], x], {x, 0, 35}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/a2r2N.jpg) `DiscretePlot`, which is a function with `Attributes` similar to `Plot`, doesn't suffer this:               DiscretePlot[PDF[PolyaAeppliDistribution[7, 1/4], x], {x, 0, 35}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/C7Wvn.jpg) nor do many other distributions, for example `NormalDistribution`:               Plot[PDF[NormalDistribution[7, 2], x], {x, 0, 35}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/65f1Q.jpg) I haven't do a complete test so I'm not sure if there's other distribution behaved like `PolyaAeppliDistribution`. Has it got any deep reasons? Or it's just a bug? I'm using _Mathematica 8_ , _Windows Vista Home Basic 32-bit_.
