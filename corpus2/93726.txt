I have recently started working in a team where there is no version control. Most of the team members are not used to any kind of version control. I've been using mercurial privately to track my work. I would like to encourage others to adopt it, and at the very least start to version their code as they develop changes. Can anyone give me advice on how I can encourage adoption of a distributed version control such as mercurial. Any advice on how to win people including managers to DVCS would be much appreciated.
