In the example below the letters shall be replaced by numbers. The numbers are from `1` to `9`, and each letter has the same number (e.g. `E = 4` all the time. Different letters must have different numbers, so `E = W = 4` is not allowed): ![Problem](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5uJAf.png) If one choose e.g. `E = 4` (and some other numbers for the other letters), it can be easily seen that ![Wrong solution](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uSGGK.png) is not a correct solution because E is in the first two rows 4 but not in the third row! After some attempts I found that ![One possible solution](http://i.stack.imgur.com/A69t4.png) is a solution. I know that there are also some other solutions which solve this problem correctly. So, my question is: How can I find with _Mathematica (9.0.1)_ ALL possible solutions? My approach is the following: I create an array with all possible combinations:               values =      Table[{(z*1000 + w*100 + e*10 + i), (v*1000 + i*100 + e*10 + r),      (z*1000 + w*100 + e*10 + i) + (v*1000 + i*100 + e*10 + r)},      {z, 1, 9}, {w, 1, 9}, {e, 1, 9}, {i, 1, 9}, {v, 1, 9}, {r,1, 9}];      And then I want to search in the array `values` for the correct combinations. But I have some problems to write a nice searching-program for this. Could anybody help? I also have doubts if it is a good idea to create such a big `values`-array because I create numbers like `1111` which are forbidden. Is there a way that I can create a leaner array? Or does anybody have another nice idea how I could find all correct solutions for this problem? I would be very happy about any help!
