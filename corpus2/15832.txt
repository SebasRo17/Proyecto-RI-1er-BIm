I'm just trying to solve the Schrodinger equation for hydrogen. We went through the solution by hand in class but Mathematica doesn't do anything when I try to solve it (it just re-displays what I typed in):               DSolve[-h^2/(2*mu)*(1/r^2*D[r^2*D[y[r,theta,phi],r],r] +          1/(r^2*Sin[theta])*D[Sin[theta]*D[y[r,theta,phi],theta],theta] +          1/(r^2*Sin[theta]^2)*D[D[y[r,theta,phi],phi],phi]) -          k*q^2/r*y[r,theta,phi] == energy*y[r,theta,phi],y,{r,theta,phi}]
