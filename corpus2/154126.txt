I like the fact that the C language lets you use binary arithmetic in an explicit way in your code, sometimes the use of the binary arithmetic can also give you a little edge in terms of performance; but since I started studying C++ i can't really tell how much i have seen the explicit use of something like that in a C++ code, something like a pointer to pointer structure or an instruction for jumping to a specific index value through the binary arithmetic. Is the binary arithmetic still important and relevant in the C++ world? How i can optimize my arithmetic and/or an access to a specific index? What about the C++ and the way in which the bits are arranged according to the standard? ... or i have taken a look at the wrong coding conventions ... ?
