I have been interviewing candidates lately for a developer position requiring 10+ years experience and have come across a couple of CVs that I am not sure how to understand: I have interviewed a few of these people and so far have had no luck. What are people's experience with developers with about 10 years experience, but who from day one have been working as mostly project-based freelancers? Are there potential benefits or drawbacks to a software development firm in having that type of experience?
