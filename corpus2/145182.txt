**What is better to do in this type of scenario: populate fields or return an object?** The situation is like this: I'm doing calculations to find the prices (inc tax, ex tax, discounted etc) of a product. Is there any advice or are there any guidelines on how to handle a return value? Populate fields:               public class ProductPrice     {         public int BasePrice;         public int IncTax;         public int ExTax;         // ...              public void GetPricesForProduct(int ProductID)         { /* Populate fields based on results */ }     }      Return object:               public class PriceCalculator     {         public ProductPrice GetPricesForProduct(int ProductID)         { /* Populate object fields and return object */ }     }     public class ProductPrice     {         public int BasePrice;         public int IncTax;         public int ExTax;     }      I'm not sure I really like the first method, because the `void` return type doesn't make it clear what happens when the method executes. However, returning an object results in a class which has no functionality.
