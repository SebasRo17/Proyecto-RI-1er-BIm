I am working on a robot that has some AI built in. However, the mandated robot controller does not have the power to do the work onboard. This means that I need to use a co-processor. I am writing all of my AI in C++. This will also be a TCP server. I have an idea for the protocol. The C++ server receives commands and only sends back values when absolutely required. The String for a basic command would be:               REQUEST DATA PUT data storename ENDREQ       The C++ server would parse the request and store data under the reference of storename. To read data from the server:   The Java request would be:               REQUEST DATA GET storename ENDREQ      The server will reply with:               data      I will be using TCP for the transmission of data because it seems much more robust and easy to implement using the libraries that I am using. I am not too knowledgeable when it comes to Java, especially with J2ME. How to implement the Java side? CHANGE: It is quite easy for me to implement a web server on the C++ side, so please feel free to use HTTP for the protocol!
