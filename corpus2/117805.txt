If one views the CLR/.NET runtime and associated libraries as the future of windows, then the F# programming language could be seen in that light as the most native functional language. Meaning that it has support from the OS creator, presumably integrates best with their libraries, etc. Is there a similar logical choice of language on the Mac OS X platform? While the most-native language itself is obviously Objective-C, is there a first- among-equals or most obvious functional paradigm language that stands out?
