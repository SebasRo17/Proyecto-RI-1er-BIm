I may have just bombed a C++ technical phone interview. The interviewer asked mostly about data structures and I was able to go into detail about each of the data structures he asked about. Score one for me I'm thinking. Wrong. Then he asks to join me on a collaboration website where he can see what I am typing. This was the same process as interview #1 which went well, not perfect, but well. So the question was: How do you reverse a linked list? he gave a function prototype similar to               Node *reverse(Node *head)      I struggled with this for about 10-15 minutes until the hour was up. I was able to get the general idea across but was not able to reverse the link list. My question is that after remembering the answer post interview do I mention this in the thank you letter, if I even should write one?
