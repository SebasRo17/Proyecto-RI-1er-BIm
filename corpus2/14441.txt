When my Manager told to team that " ** _now onwards successful user stories will be considered for appraisal!_** " We sat there for while shocked and that was one of the several jaw dropping moments he gave us :-) We felt that was stupid idea, since this will ruin all concept and goal of agile development methodology. Let me know what you people think? and how can we convince him?
