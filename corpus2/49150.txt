I have been using _Mathematica_ for a short time now and never had a reason to learn about exporting vector graphics. However, I need to include some graphics in some work I'm doing in Word 2010. I save the plots as WMF and EMF and then import to word and then I save the Word document as a PDF. The problem is while 2D plots are scalable during zooming, 3D plots look awful. I have no idea why except that its 3D. I also have very little knowledge in vector graphics. Also I noticed that the file size with just one 3D plot is over 1MB. I have several PDF files with over 100 pages containing lots of 3D plots, non of which exceed 2MB. Please tell me how can I include 3D graphs in my document that are scalable when saved as PDF, just the way most professional looking publications look.
