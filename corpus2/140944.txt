Do you think knowing Unix tools like sed, awk, LaTeX, Perl give you a great edge in the business world? (e.g. being a manager) From my short reflection, the only profession that needs those sort of (plain text) tools is programming. Because even when I do creative writing, I rarely ever need it. I mean, do CEOs and executives of large corporations ever learn this kind of stuff if they were not CS major to begin with?
