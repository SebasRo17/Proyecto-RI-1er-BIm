Note: this is fixed in version 9. * * * I want to put expressions into multiple files simultaneously, with the following code:               tex1 = OpenWrite["test1.txt"];     tex2 = OpenWrite["test2.txt"];          Write[{tex1, tex2}, "anything"]          Close[tex1];     Close[tex2];      Why is `test2.txt` empty? Why does it work correctly with `WriteString` instead of `Write`? Now of course I can always `Map` the `Write` statements over streams, or just go with `WriteString`, but since it would be convenient to use a list as `Write`'s first argument I did post this issue. Is it a bug?
