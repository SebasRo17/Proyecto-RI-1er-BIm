I would like to learn how to write a software product definition. Therefore I am looking for online materials or books which would help me to learn more about this topic. I would like to learn, for starters:   * what must be included in such a document   * what must not to be included in such a document   * how to make a product definition to sell internally the product    * finding balance between use case descriptions (the _why_ ), and feature descriptions (the _how_ ).  I am aware that it is not something that can learn in 15 minutes but I think such a discussion could help me to have a good start.
