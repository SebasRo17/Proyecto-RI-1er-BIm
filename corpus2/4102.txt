I've moved this question over from StackExchange to get better visibility (and deleted the old question). I have a user-defined relationship I'd like to plot:               a = (b + c)/d;      and I try to plot it as follows:               plotFunction[b_, c_] := Plot[a, {d, 0, 10}];     plotFunction[2, 3]      This results in an empty plot; only the axes are drawn. Of course the following works fine:               plotFunction[b_, c_]:= Plot[(b + c)/d, {d, 0, 10}];     plotFunction[2, 3]      I don't understand why MMA refuses to draw the function in the first method? I've tried using Show[] as well; no luck. I even tried passing the relationship within the function as follow - no luck:               plotFunction[a_, b_, c_]:= Plot[a, {d, 0, 10}];     plotFunction[a, 2, 3]      I suppose it could have something to do with local vs global variable definitions inside and outside the function definitions?
