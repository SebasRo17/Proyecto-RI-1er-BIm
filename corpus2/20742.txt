I have a function that creates a 2D line with filling to the axis. When I copy this graphic into word it is very fuzzy, so much so that the numbers and text are almost unreadable, not to mention the aesthetic problem. When I take away the filling, the graphic can be copy and pasted into word as normal. the code used is:               Show[       Plot[d[x], {x, 0, 5}, PlotRange -> {-0.003, 0.003}],        ListLinePlot[residualsdata, PlotStyle -> Black, Filling -> Axis,          FillingStyle -> Directive[Opacity[0.5], Green]]]      The graphic without the filling is gotten by:               Show[       Plot[d[x], {x, 0, 5}, PlotRange -> {-0.003, 0.003}],        ListLinePlot[residualsdata, PlotStyle -> Black]]      Does anybody know the cause of this problem and/or how to fix it?
