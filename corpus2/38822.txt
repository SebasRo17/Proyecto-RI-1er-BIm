I use Eclipse, and the two most noticeable slowdowns caused by my computer are waiting for compiling and waiting for intellisense. I already have a fast SSD drive and 3GB of ram. I'm guessing that upgrading my processor would be the next best thing to do. Would that make a significant impact? Any recommendations for what kind of processor to get? My current processor is an AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core 1.91 GHz.
