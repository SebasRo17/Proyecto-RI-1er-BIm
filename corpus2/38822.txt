In the WL example below, `WeatherData[]` returns an undated list of values when I add the annotation "NonMetricValue."               WeatherData["New York City", "MeanTemperature", {{2013,12,1},{2013,12,12},"Day"}]      > {{{2013,12,1},5.5},{{2013,12,2},6.06},{{2013,12,3},4.94},{{2013,12,4},6.5}, > {{2013,12,5},9.17},{{2013,12,6},11.56},{{2013,12,7},3.22},{{2013,12,8},0.11}, > {{2013,12,9},0.22},{{2013,12,10},2.22},{{2013,12,11},-0.72}, > {{2013,12,12},-1.22}}               WeatherData["New York City", "MeanTemperature",           {{2013,12,1},{2013,12,12},"Day"}, "NonMetricValue"]      > {41.9,42.91,40.89,43.7,48.51,52.81,37.8,32.2,32.4,36.,30.7,29.8} This seems like a bug, since a proper effect would change only the values. Aside from that, is this a syntax problem (am I doing it wrong)? I would like to be able to get a date list of temperature in Fahrenheit directly from `WeatherData[]`.
