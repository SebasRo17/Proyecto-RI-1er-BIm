Our team is considering using Mule in a large scale medium volume internal facing transactional banking application. At first Mule would just be used as an application server although it is possible some of its esb/orchestration features would be used in the future. I have no experience with mule, being new on the team. But my gut says Mule would not be as performant as Weblogic or Glassfish as a deployment container. Does anyone have any comparison stories to share that might shed light?
