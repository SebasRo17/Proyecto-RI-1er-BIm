I am developing a web site and a web service for a small on-line game. Technically, I'll be using Express (node.js) and MongoDB+Redis for the databases. This the structure I came up with:   * One Express server that will server as the Web Service. This will connect to the databases.    * One Express server that will provide the web site. It will connect to the Web Service to retrieve and push the information.   * iOS and Android application will be able to interact with the WebService. Taking into account:   * It is a small game. The information transferred is not critical.   * There will NOT be third party applications. At least for the moment. My concern is about which level of security I should use in each of the scenarios:   * Security of the user playing through web browser   * Security of the applications and the Web Server connecting to the WS. I have take a look at the different options and:   * OAuth and/or Https is too much for this scenario, isn't it?   * Will be a good option to hash the user and password with MD5(or similar) and some salt? I would like to get some directions and investigate by my own rather than getting a response like "you should you use this node.js module..." Thanks in advance,
