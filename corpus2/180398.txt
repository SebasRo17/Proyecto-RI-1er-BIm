In SICP 2nd Edition section 2.2.3, the authors have the following code:               (define (even-fibs n)       (accumulate cons                   nil                   (filter even?                           (map fib                                (enumerate-interval 0 n)))))      My question is why did they use _accumulate_ in this case? Couldn't they have got the same answer from _filter_ without using _accumulate_?
