Hi Programmers Community. I came across the following predicament during the past month when an employee at my company resigned. It is the company policy that when you resign, all training that you have undergone during the year prior to your resignation, you have to pay back. This is all good, as this is practice in a lot of companies. What happened was, a few months ago, a certain course was presented by an external company. We offered a room in our office as venue for free, and then we were allowed to send some employees on the training for free. He was one of them. Should he pay back the training costs (which was quite expensive)? Has anyone come across a similar situation? Or does someone have policy regarding this? Thanks! * * * **UPDATE** Just to clarify a few things. The training was _kind of_ optional (the senior developer chose who to send, but I'm sure he could have said no). It **was** however very much work related. It was training regarding a technology that we use every day. Also, it was not internal training, it was done by an external company. It was however done on our premises. That was the deal, they use our venue for free, and we send people on the training for free.
