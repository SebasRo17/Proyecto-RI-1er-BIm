A simple example of my problem is that               Assuming[k âˆˆ Reals, Integrate[Exp[l]/((1 + Exp[l])*Exp[k*l]), l]] /. {k -> 2}      gives `ComplexInfinity` while               Integrate[Exp[l]/((1 + Exp[l])*Exp[2*l]), l]      gives the correct answer. I would like to get the correct answer in the first case as well. Any suggestions? I'm using _Mathematica_ 6 on a Windows XP PC. ## Failed attempts to bypass the problem   1. Defining Riemann integration as a separate function using `Sum` and `Limit`   2. Using `Assumptions` in preamble, putting `Assuming[]` around `Integrate`, using `Integrate[f,x,Assumptions->{x,params}\in Reals]`   3. Using `FunctionInterpolation` on the function to be integrated before applying the (definite) integral   4. Expanding the function to be integrated with `Series` before integrating Have to hand it to Mathematica, at least it is consistent.
