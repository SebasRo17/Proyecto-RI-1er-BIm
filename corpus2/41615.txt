Let's consider a region like this: ![Region](http://i.stack.imgur.com/m0zNG.png) The aim is to find the "Chebyshev center" of the region. By using the polygons, one can approximate the perimeter of region by an $n$-gon ($n$ is large enough). Then by saving the coordinates of the perimeter in two vectors, say $x$ and $y$, and using Linear programming, compute the minimal-radius ball enclosing the region. But I want to try another way, an optimization! I have two data sets, produced by MATLAB, (get them from here) and I want to find the Chebyshev center by **optimization** (not linear programming). From here I learnt how to find the **nearest distance** of an interior point from it's boundary:               X = "KP" /. imp // Flatten;     Y = "KI" /. imp // Flatten;     pts = Transpose[{X, Y}];     Nearest[pts, {3, 1.5}]      (* {3,1.5} is a sample interior point *)      If I denote the nearest distance by $d$, the aim is to maximize $d$ (or minimize $-d$) over box inside region. (Like $x \in [1.5 \; 4.5] , y \in [0.5 \; 2]$.) The Chebyshev center will be obtained by maximizing $d$. But I can't define to Mathematica how treat with `FindMinimum` and `Nearest`.
