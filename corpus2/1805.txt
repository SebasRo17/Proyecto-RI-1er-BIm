I'm simply looking for the `{}+{}` function for sublist elements of a list: (Parallel sums of elements)               c = {{1, 2, 3, 4}, {8, 7, 6, 5}};     Plus[c]     Mean[c]       desired={9, 9, 9, 9}      Where `Mean` does directly what it's supposed to, unfortunately `Plus` doesn't. I tried `Take` and `Part` but they both do not seem to work here . Additionally, my `c` consists of a varying number of elements. I tried to work with `Length[c]` and `Range` .. (`{}+{}` is no solution as list element number varies) thank you for help!!
