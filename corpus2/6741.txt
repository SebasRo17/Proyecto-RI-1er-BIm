I would like to have a plot that is filled to the axis with `Green` if the `y` value is greater than 10, and `Blue` if it is less than 10. I attempted to do the following: `Plot[x, {x, 0, 20}, Filling -> Axis, ColorFunction -> Function[{x, y}, Piecewise[{{Green, y > 10}, {Blue, y < 10}}]]]` The produces an all blue filling. The frustrating thing is that it seems that conditionals are allowed in `ColorFunction`s, but the test is evaluated only once, and the result is evaluation for each point plotted. How can I have the test evaluated repeatedly to get a discrete color filling? **Note:** I am simply trying to fill the space under a curve by determining where a point would fall in a given set of intervals.
