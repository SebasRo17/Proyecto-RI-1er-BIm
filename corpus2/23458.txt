I'm teaching some simple ideas in probability to students in grade 7. The "spinner" below works, but I'm wondering how I could make it just a bit more realistic by having it actually "spin" around a few times, slow down, and then end up where ever it has to be? I.E. randomly do a few complete circles and then slow down and stop..... Any suggestions are appreciated.                Manipulate[      Column[{             Show[         PieChart[{1, 1, 1, 1, 1}, ChartStyle -> "DarkRainbow",           ChartLabels ->            Placed[{2, 4, 6, 8, 10}, "RadialCenter", Style[#, 24] &],           LabelingFunction -> None],               Graphics[{                {PointSize[0.05], Point[{0, 0}]},                {Thick, Arrow[{{0, 0}, 0.7 { Cos[angle], Sin[angle]}}]}           }], ImageSize -> 600],        Button["Spin!", angle = RandomReal[{0, 6.28}]]        }       ]           , {{angle, 0, "Spin"}, 0, 2 \[Pi]}]
