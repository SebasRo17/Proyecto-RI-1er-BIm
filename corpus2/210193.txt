I have a mobile app from which I'd like to allow voting on Things. I don't want to force all the users to have to sign up using email/Facebook/etc. just so that I can properly limit voting. Is it really a bad idea to leave voting to be an "open" process where anyone can vote? I know theoretically that this allows improper voting techniques, etc. but on the other hand getting more votes really don't offer any kind of financial motivation. \--Edit-- Perhaps there are some ways to limit vote-faking? I know theoretically nothing is unbreakable, but maybe I can limit the amount of votes something can get in a minute/hour/day? \--Edit 2 -- Think of it as "views" on a video. It is a simple measure of popularity that requires no login. What are ways to limit view tampering, and when is it necessary?
