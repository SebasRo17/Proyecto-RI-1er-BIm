I have a fairly complicated set of coupled non-linear integro-differential equations that I am trying to solve using NDSolve. The equations are: $\dot{x}=\big|y(t)-x(t)\big|^{1/n}\left[\text{Sign}[y(t)-x(t)]-x(t)\right]$ $\big|y(t)-x(t)\big|^{1/n}\text{Sign}\left(\big|y(t)-x(t)\big|\right)=\cos(t+\pi\alpha/2)-\int\limits_0^t (t-\xi)^{\alpha-1}\ \dot{y}(\xi)\ d\xi$ with initial conditions $x(0)=0, y(0)=0$. Some of you may notice that the last integral is nothing but the definition of the fractional order integral with order $0<\alpha<1$. I implement this system of equations in Mathematica as follows               \[Alpha] = .5;     n = .5;     tmax = 10;     Intermediate[t_Real, y_Real] :=      Evaluate[Integrate[(t - \[Xi])^(\[Alpha] - 1) y, {\[Xi], 0, t},      PrincipalValue -> True]]     SolutionOfSimultaneousEquations :=       NDSolveValue[{x'[t] == (Abs[y[t] - x[t]])^(1/n)*(Sign[y[t] - x[t]] - x[t]),       (Abs[y[t] - x[t]])^(1/n) Sign[y[t] - x[t]] == Cos[t + Pi/2 \[Alpha]] - Intermediate[t, y'[t]],         x[0] == 0,y[0] == 0}, {x, y}, {t, 0, tmax}]      and then use the following bit of code to plot my results:               SolutionForx = SolutionOfSimultaneousEquations[[1]];     SolutionForxFn[t_] := SolutionForx[t];     SolutionFory = SolutionOfSimultaneousEquations[[2]];     SolutionForyFn[t_] := SolutionFory[t];     Plot[{SolutionForxFn'[t], SolutionForxFn[t]}, {t, .001, tmax},          PlotStyle -> Automatic, PlotRange -> Full]      Essentially I have defined a function called `Intermediate[t_Real,y_Real]` and this function is called by NDSolve everytime the value of the integral is required. However the solution I get from this code does not make physical sense. My main concern is with the way I have implemented the integral. Notice that the integral required the value of $y(t)$ for all times between $0$ and $t$. However, currently my code only passes a single value for $y(t)$ and the integral is completely different. Is this correct? What do I do to ensure that this integral is performed for all times $t$? I understand that only using something like an Euler forward scheme starting from $t=0$ will ensure that the integral can be performed (so that I have the value of $y$ for all prior times). Is there a better way to solve integro- differential equations?
