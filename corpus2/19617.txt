Basically, I want to write a function to compute the following sum $f(m,L):=\sum_{0\leq k_1,\cdots, k_n\leq m} \binom{m}{k_1,k_2,\cdots k_n}$ and $\mathrm{supp}(k)=L \subseteq \left \\{ 1,...,n \right \\}$ I wrote the following function but it doesn't work:               L = {1, 2, 4, 5};     f[m, L] := Return[For[i = 1, i <= m, i++, Total[Multinomial@@Take[L, i]]]];     f[3, L]     (*f[3, {1, 2, 4, 5}]*)      What am I missing? Thank you EDIT: I added a condition to the indices $k$, which I forgot to mention earlier. $\mathrm{supp}(k)=L$ means that $L$ is the set of indices such that the components of the vector $k=(k_1,...,k_n)$ are nonzero.
