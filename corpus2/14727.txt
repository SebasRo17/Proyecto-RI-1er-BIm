When your programming you often have to go and look at other pieces of code for reference, search for something etc. I'm looking for some numbers on the ratio of time spend actually typing the code(coding) and the time spend going back and forth between other parts of the system, not even counting browsing the internet, reading documentation. Ofcourse this depends on a large number of factors, probably also on your IDE, programming language etc. I just need some rough estimates, or researches on the subject. Background: I want to investigate how much network latency is tolerable for a programmer to work on virtual machines (if any).
