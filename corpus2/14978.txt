I want to make a vertical `RadioButtonBar` in `Manipulate`. So far I only have a workaround that looks like this:               Manipulate[       Which[       sel == 0,       Text["one"],            sel == 1,       Text["two"],            sel == 2,       Text["three"]       ],       Control[{{sel, 0, ""}, {0 -> "one"}, ControlType -> RadioButton}],       Control[{{sel, 1, ""}, {1 -> "two"}, ControlType -> RadioButton}],       Control[{{sel, 2, ""}, {2 -> "three"},        ControlType -> RadioButton}],            ControlPlacement -> Left       ]      Is there any way not to have a line for each of the radiobuttons? Thanks!
