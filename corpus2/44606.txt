It seems to be a fairly common convention to write certain 'meta' functions in postfix form like               f[x] // Simplify      to keep the the mathematical content at the front separate from the various directives. However converting expressions to `StandardForm` or `InputForm` converts everything to prefix. Is there a way to get `StandardForm` to use this convention or alternatively is there a form like `StandardForm`, but that uses this convention. I find myself often switching between`StandardForm` and `InputForm` while editing since I prefer to just edit textually using `InputForm` and then convert to `StandardForm` for display, but this makes it impossible to use the above convention. Reading the documentation I came across `Format` which seems one possible way to do this, but the following does not work:               Format[Simplify[x_], StandardForm] := Postfix[Simplify[x_]]      Apparently `Simplify` gets evaluated out before this rule is set up. I tried using `Hold` and `Unevaluated` to fix this without luck. This approach would also have the downside of having to define this rule for every function separately and I also do not yet know how I would set up such rules as a default for all my notebooks. So maybe there is a better way.
