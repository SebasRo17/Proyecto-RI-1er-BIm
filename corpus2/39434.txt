Mathematica implements `ArcCot` function as an inverse to `Cot` on range `[-Pi/2, Pi/2]`. I personally prefer the other definition (as it's used in courses I attend). Is it possible to redefine the function? Current implementation: ![range -Pi/2 to Pi/2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Jr8Jc.gif) My prefered implementation: ![range 0 to Pi](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Z5vfv.gif) (images taken from http://intmstat.com/blog/2011/04/cotx_2.gif)
