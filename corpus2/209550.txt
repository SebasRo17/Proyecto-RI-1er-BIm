A recent flurry of comments on a JSHint issue alerted me to the fact that the JSON data-interchange format has a license. The content of this license can be debated elsewhere. What I'm unclear on is what it means for JSON (or any other data-interchance format) to have a license. If an a library simply consumes and parses JSON, does it have to include this license? I understand that using a library that contains this license would require a user to include it. I'm talking about writing a library from scratch. What if I have to use JSON because a third party service only communicates via JSON. If I'm serializing and deserializing data according to the RFC, do I still need to refer to the license?
