I'm reading a book on Objective C, and I was wondering how important the subject Working with files for learning to develop iOS in particular? On you tube the tutorials are very short, maybe 10 min of video that teaches you how to do stuff with files and URL's. But in the book its a very long chapter with lot's of detail. The basics of working with files and URL's if very clear and simple, so I was wondering when I be really need this and this information become handy, and if I need to dig that deep in this topic right now? The main question is, if I know the basics, can I move on and come back when I need it? or it's a really crucial to dig in right now?
