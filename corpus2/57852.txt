**Description** : I have accomplished my undergraduate paper as a _Mathematica_ notebook. In this condition, I find it convenient to typeset formula and words in a notebook environment. However, I feel that the front-end is lacking a `page break` tool, so I cannot make good page-breaking that I need. Namely, the front-end of _Mathematica_ always breaks the page automatically when been printed. **Question** :   1. How can I break a page manually when saving the notebook as a PDF file?   2. Is it possible to add a `page break` in the `notebook environment`, for example like in _Microsoft Word_ , where the words jump to the next page when there is no space left in the current page ? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/VD0cU.jpg)
