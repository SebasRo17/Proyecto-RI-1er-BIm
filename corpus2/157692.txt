I've been making small improvements to a public ASP.NET site that I have and have ran it through Google's online Page Speed several times. I have a specific problem, but something that really threw me off was that even if I didn't make any changes and just kept running it time after time (5 minutes intervals) I'd keep getting different scores by +-1 or 2 points. That is just weird in itself. Anyways, The only medium priority item that I have left is that PageSpeed says that some of the images do not have an expiration date (or have the expiration date in a very near feature), which I cannot see how it's possible, since they are static resources (images), and I setup the expires to 60 days after the initial request. It's not even a week from now, and they are in the exact same location that the rest of my images are (and about 95% of them are not being marked as not having an expiration date) So, how could it be that for Page SPeed, some of my images have an expiration date and others dont? I also ran HttpWatch against my site, and I analyze the specific request of one of those images, and it does have the max-age=5184000 header. any ideas are greatly appreciated. Thanks.
