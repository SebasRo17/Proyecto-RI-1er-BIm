This is the scenario: I'm on this project for which I wrote 4 Node.js scripts that act as "servers" for some service (they have to be separated). I also use Redis, that is another service to keep an eye on. The system is not yet in production (the reliability of it will raise another set of problems, but not now). While developing, those services spits a lot of interesting console.log() messages that I care of. I'm actually using a big terminal window split in 4 with GNU screen, but every time I have to start screen, ctrl+a+c, ctrl+a+c, ctrl+a+c and so on then manually start the services. How would you comfortably automate this operation? Or are there some tools to better enhance MY user experience as the shepherd of those little monsters? :) I'm on my way using ANOTHER service that will publish those logs via HTTP. The logs (mostly debug messages) will be published by the other 4 guys in a Redis channel that the log2http server will subscribe to...
