I want to have a series expansion of $e^{x^a}$ or $e^{c_1x^a+c_2x^b}$ at $x=0$, but `Series` cannot give any useful result even if the assumption $a>0$ is specified.               Series[Exp[x^a], {x, 0, 2}]     Series[Exp[x^a], {x, 0, 2}, Assumptions -> {x > 0, a > 0}]     (* -> E^x^a *)      However, if $a$ is a number, we can get a result.               Series[Exp[x^(2/3)], {x, 0, 2}]     (* -> 1+x^(2/3)+x^(4/3)/2+x^2/6+O[x]^(8/3) *)
