I am importing 2 columns of numeric data from a data file in the way defined in this answer:               data = Import["C:\\Users\\md\\Desktop\\myfile.txt", {"Data",  {All}, {1, 3}}];      These are my `x` and `y` values for a graph I'm plotting with `ListPlot`. But I also need to apply some simple manipulations to the `y` values (the second column), like multiplying by 2 or taking the absolute value. From the documentation I know it's possible by defining a function which takes a pair of values as arguments and then applying that function to `data` with `Map`, but that seems awfully troublesome when all I want is to multiply the `y` column by 2. Is there a quick and simple way to do that? _This could either be done while importing, after importing, or while plotting, either way is fine._   _I also don't care about which format I'm importing to, as long as it supports several thousand points._
