I used `ContourPlot` to plot the graph of `x Sin[Pi y] - y Cos[Pi x] == 1` with the following input:               eqn[x_, y_] := (x Sin[Pi y] - y Cos[Pi x] )== 1     ContourPlot[Evaluate[eqn[x, y]], {x, 0, Pi}, {y, 0, Pi}]      To find $dy/dx$ I used the following code:               yprimeEq = D[eqn[x, y[x]], x];     sol = Solve[yprimeEq, y'[x]] // Simplify;     dydx = y'[x] /. First[sol] /. y[x] -> y;      I am stuck on finding the slope of the tangent line to the graph at $(2/3,2)$. I know I have to just plug in $2/3$ for $x$ and $2$ for $y$ but I don't know how to write it in Mathematica.
