I wanted to change the global option "WindowsSize" to the "large" value using the Option Inspector. It works well for the current session. But then I realize the "Apply" button was greyed and not functional, so I could not save this change for another session. So my question is: why is the "Apply" button not available in the Option Inspector window? Did I inadvertently mess up something? My version of _Mathematica_ is 9.0.1.and I was trying to change the notebook options of the Documentation Center (making the "WindowsSize" option "Large" by default, because I was obliged to resize it each time I opened it) I am using OSX
