I am working on a retail application where currently I'm using raw SQL like               insert into some_table values (Textbox1.Text, Textbox2.Text, ...)      and               update some_table set some_column = value      for save and update, but the problem is I need to write this everywhere that a save or update is needed. Is there a better solution for handling CRUD operations, like a separate class to contain data access logic which would use methods in the data access layer to perform CRUD operations?
