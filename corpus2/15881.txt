I am trying to graphically represent the error in a Riemann sum. My current code looks like:                   Show[DiscretePlot[Log[t], {t, 1, 10, 1}, ExtentSize -> Left, PlotMarkers -> "Point"],                Plot[Log[t], {t, 1, 10}]]      ![The output of the above code](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gZCcT.png) I would know like to plot JUST the curve-linear triangles above the plot of ln(x) that represents the error in the Riemann Sum.
