ASP.NET WebForms seemed really great until that moment of realization the abstraction you'd welcomed was producing HTML that was worlds away from what you needed. Wrestling with that framework to generate HTML that matched a designers or used external libraries became a big nightmare for me and one I'd rather not have again. When approaching a simple Bootstrap form in ASP.NET MVC I copied over the basic HTML and then started the process of adding @Html.BeginForm(), @Html.EditorFor() until it hit me that I was going down the same path. Sure, you add an attribute here, define an alternate helper there, but how long until you are fighting the framework to get back to what you could have just pasted in from any Bootstrap example on the web? Is anyone else feeling that, or is it possible that the Helpers introduce enough "sugar" to make using them worth the effort?
