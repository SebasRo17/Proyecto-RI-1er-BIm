I have developed a few quantitative libraries in C# where it is important to understand not only the classic information that goes with the XMLDoc comments (which contains basic information with the method signature) but also the mathematical formulas being use within the methods. Hence I would like to be able to include extended documentation with the code, which could contain, for example Latex formulas, graphs, and so on. Do you think such information should be included in the API documentation? Or should it be included in a dev blog for examples? Are there common tools that are usually used for this kind of purposes?
