I am new to mathematica ,so this question may seem a little naive. I know how to use the option as an argument to a function, we can define an option by using `Options[]`and `SetOptions[]`, but the following usage confused me by passing a function as an option to a function .Here are two examples: Example1:               GraphPlot3D[{2 -> 3, 2 -> 4, 2 -> 5, 3 -> 4, 3 -> 5, 4 -> 5},       VertexRenderingFunction -> (Sphere[#, 0.1] &)]      Example2:               Graph[{1 \[UndirectedEdge] 2, 2 \[UndirectedEdge] 3,        3 \[UndirectedEdge] 1}, VertexShapeFunction -> "Square",       VertexSize -> 0.2]      My question is:   1. What is the difference between `VertexRenderingFunction -> (Sphere[#, 0.1] &)`,`VertexShapeFunction -> "Diamond"` and `VertexSize -> 0.2` as examples display.   2. The function as an option seems to be useful, so what is the right time to use it? How to apply it to the functions defined by myself?
