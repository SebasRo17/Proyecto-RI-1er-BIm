If you were going to set up a Email Alerts for the customers of your website to subscribe to, what rules of etiquette ought to be followed? I can think of a few off the top of my head:   * Users can Opt-Out   * Text Only (Or tasteful Remote Images)   * Not sent out more than once a week   * Clients have fine-grained control over what they receive emails about (Only receive what they are interested in) What other points should I consider? From a programming standpoint, what is the best method for setting up and running email notifications?   * Should I use an ASP.NET Service? A Windows Service? What are the pitfalls to either?   * How should I log emails that are sent? I don't care if they're received, but I do need to be able to prove that I did or did not send an email.
