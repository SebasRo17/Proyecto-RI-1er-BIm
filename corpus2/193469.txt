first of all I am new here and I hope that this is the right place for my question. I have a question about the recommended architecture of a project. IDEA: Automate some calculations concerning to aerodynamics. I have some input data and I need to process this data in several sub-calculations. You can see such a calculation somehow like a black box: INPUT => CALCULATION => RESULTS Some of these calculations are already available as open source programs and some of them I need to program on my own. This shouldn't be a problem at all. But I want to connect these calculations in a flexible way. For example: INPUT => CALCULATION 1 => CALCULATION 2 => CALCULATION 3 => RESULTS Number and order of calculations should be changeable. Should I see each calculation as standalone program and connect them in a kind of framework where I can specify order and arguments of program calls? Or are there other techniques to solve problems like this? Thanks a lot for each advice and every recommendation. Sebastian
