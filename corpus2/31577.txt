I am trying to produce a plot showing the variation in a sample of functions. It should look like this plot or that plot. I tried to use `SmoothDensityHistogram`. Even for the following simple example this does not look right. Do you have other suggestions? My approach so far was:               dx = 0.01;     functionSample =      Table[noise = Random[NormalDistribution[0, 0.5]];      Table[ {x, x (1 - x) + noise}, {x, 0, 1, dx}], {i, 1, 60}];     var = Flatten[diff, 1];     ListPlot[functionSample[[All, All]], Joined -> True]     SmoothDensityHistogram[var,      ColorFunction -> (Blend[{White, Black}, #] &)]      Producing ![ListPlot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wgDiy.jpg)![SmoothDensityHistogram](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ishQV.jpg) Maybe things can be improved by choosing a small bandwidth of the kernel in x direction and a larger in y direction of the underlying kernel smoother.
