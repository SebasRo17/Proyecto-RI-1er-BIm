I'm wondering if its possible push output from a .NET console application to an existing Notebook that is open in Mathematica. The reason I'd like this is that I want to use Mathematica as a "debugging console" for intermediate calculations that I am performing in .NET, by pushing out text, graphics, etc. p.s. I'm fairly familiar with C# and Mathematica, so all I want to know is if this is possible, or not.
