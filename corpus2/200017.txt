New with Mongodb, and I'm not sure what implications or benefits there are between the use of an array vs an object. So..   1. As above what are the implications and benefits between the use of arrays and objects?   2. For example my case. The idea is to store a document with a "capture" time, and a 2000 slots of "packet" counters. I used object to store to packets see this , but apparently it seems better off to use arrays. What kind of considerations should one make to determine whether an array or object is more suitable (with example)?
