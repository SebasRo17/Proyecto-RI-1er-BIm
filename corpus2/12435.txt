> NEW YORK - With a blast that made skyscrapers tremble, an 83-year-old steam > pipe sent a powerful message that the miles of tubes, wires and iron beneath > New York and other U.S. cities are getting older and could become > dangerously unstable. July 2007 Story About a Burst Steam Pipe in Manhattan * * * We've heard about software rot and technical debt. And we've heard from the likes of:   * "Uncle Bob" Martin - Who warned us about "the consequences of making a mess".   * Michael C. Feathers - Who gave us guidance for 'Working Effectively With Legacy Code'. So certainly the software engineering community is aware of these issues. * * * But I feel like our aggregate society does not appreciate how these issues can plague working systems and applications. As Steve McConnell notes: > ...Unlike financial debt, technical debt is much less visible, and so people > have an easier time ignoring it. If this is true, and I believe that it is, then I fear that governments and businesses may defer regular maintenance and fortification against hackers until it is too late. [Much like NYC and the steam pipes.] * * * My Question:   * Is there a way that we can avoid the software equivalent of NYC and the steam pipes?
