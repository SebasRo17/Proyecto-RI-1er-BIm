C++ is a great language in many ways, but some things in particular are cumbersome to write without an IDE. As a VIM user, it would be very interesting if I had access to a higher level language which enabled me to write C++ with S-Expressions and possibly with Lisp-like macros, allowing for the generation of clean code while avoiding rewriting the same patters over and over again. I've asked on freenode and tested several ideas, such as compiling Lisp->C with compilers such as ECL and Bigloo, but none of those generated particularly clean C code. Are there any works on this issue?
