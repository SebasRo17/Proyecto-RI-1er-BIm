When using planning poker for estimates, we've ended up with effectively a non-linear points scale. By that I mean that point value is inconsistent for one-pointers and, say, eight-pointers. Couple examples each:   * 1 point: add tooltip text to a couple of icons; format date&time strings   * 3 points: create new user role and specify their permissions; automatically create a new case in CRM whenever certain actions are performed   * 5 points: watchlist functionality; filtering functionality on several facets   * 8 points: integrate with a third party provider *and* introduce a persistence layer to cache their responses My concern is two-fold: we lose estimating fidelity by restricting ourselves to the low-end of the scale and any reporting (or calculating average velocity) will be erroneous. How can I entice the scrum master, product owner and the team to use a more consistent, linear scale? **Edit:** just to clarify, we are using one of the traditional decks that goes all the way up to 100... except we've somehow anchored ourselves to not go over 5, ending up with effectively a logarithmic scale.
