A bit of context: I'm in 3rd year of college. students are divided into teams of 4. Almost everyone will be working under windows (except a few like me who are on linux). As part of the school curriculum, we will soon start working on a project for a real client, but me and another team are wondering which way would be best for sharing our code with each other. I've been working part-time for 3 years and have had plenty of experience using both git and mercurial on different projects, so I don't have any problems using one system or the other. However, none of my teammates have ever used a version control system before. There's also another team who've tried using SVN but have had major problems and would prefer trying out something else, so they've asked for my opinion. My thoughts : I've heard that mercurial + TortoiseHg has a better integration under windows, but I'm wondering if the concept of anonymous heads might confuse them even If I explain them. On the other hand, I find that git branches are easier for a beginner to understand (clear seperation of work for each programmer) but doesn't work as well under windows.
