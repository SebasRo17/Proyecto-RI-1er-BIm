When it is necessary to integrate with a web application, and an API is unavailable, is it a viable solution to simulate a web browser interacting with the web application as a real user would interact with it? UPDATE Some context. Web App belongs to a vendor/partner. Their timeline for building a proper API will not meet our needs. Scraping for data is the least used part. Full CRUD for interacting with the app is required. As a developer, I can see that it will work, but I want to be able to address concerns that others may raise about this approach. Would you base a mission critical business application on this approach? Why or why not?
