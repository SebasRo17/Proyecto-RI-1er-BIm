I am reading this and I came across: > The Golden Rule of Platforms, "Eat Your Own Dogfood", can be rephrased as > "Start with a Platform, and Then Use it for Everything." You can't just bolt > it on later. Certainly not easily at any rate -- ask anyone who worked on > platformizing MS Office. Or anyone who worked on platformizing Amazon. If > you delay it, it'll be ten times as much work as just doing it correctly up > front. You can't cheat. You can't have secret back doors for internal apps > to get special priority access, not for ANY reason. You need to solve the > hard problems up front. What does that exactly mean? Can someone please explain?
