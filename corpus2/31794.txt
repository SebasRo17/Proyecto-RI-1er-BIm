Consider a system of $N$ circles($N>40$) Each of radius $5$ and the center of these circles along a circle at origin of radius $3$ [as given in code]. Code for above description :-               Graphics[Table[{Hue[t/40],         Circle[{3 Sin[2 Pi (t - 1)/40], 3 Cos[2 Pi (t - 1)/40]}, 5]}, {t,         40}]]      I want to find the perimeter of the resultant figure formed by regions covered by the union of the "intersection of any two arbitrary circles". Then, the perimeter of the resultant figure formed by regions covered by the union of the"intersection of any three arbitrary circles". And so on till we intersect of all the circles.
