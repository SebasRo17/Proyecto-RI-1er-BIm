I am wondering why the following fails to cover the surface at points near k = 0.               c[z_] := (z + 1) (z - 1) (z + 1 + I);          ContourPlot3D[Abs[c[x + I y]] == k^3, {x, -2.5, 2}, {y, -2, 2},      {k, 0, 1.75}, Background -> White, AxesLabel -> {"x", "y", "k"}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/AFiPd.png) Furthermore, when the left hand side is complex expanded and the equation is rearranged with 2xy + k^3 on the right, the curve looks significantly different, with one large and one small foot, both touching at zero. Why is that?
