Is there a simple way in Mathematica to prevent rule reordering? Let me give an example:               a -> b //. {b -> c, (x_ -> y_) -> (x -> Expand[y])}     (* a -> b *)      though               a -> b /. {b -> c}     (* a -> c *)      works fine, of course. (I think that) _Mathematica_ has determined that the second rule in expression 1 is more specific than the first rule and so has ordered it first. But, in the `ReplaceRepeated`, _Mathematica_ now never checks the first rule. I realize that there are ways to rewrite this so that it works fine but is there a simple way to tell _Mathematica_ not to reorder the rules? It seems like there should be.
