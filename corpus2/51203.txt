I would like to find all the subgraphs of a given graph g that are isomorphic to the graph h. My current code doesn't work how it should. Many solutions are missed and I think something is fundamentally wrong with my approach.   * I generate g and h.    * Extract the subsets from g with the same length as h.    * Select the subsets that are isomorphic to h    * Generate subgraphs and highlight them in g .               {g, h} = {Graph[RandomInteger[#] \[UndirectedEdge] # + 1 & /@ Range[1, 4]],      Graph[{{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}}]}     s = Subsets[Range[VertexCount[g]], {VertexCount[h]}];     Select[Subgraph[g, #] & /@ s, IsomorphicGraphQ[#, h] &];     HighlightGraph[g, #] & /@ %
