I have a graph, and I want my `EdgeRenderingFunction` to colour the edges based on the vertex they originate from. In this toy example, I'm trying to get the edge originating from vertex 1 to be red:               GraphPlot[{1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 4, 5 -> 1, 5 -> 2, 5 -> 3, 5 -> 4,        1 -> 4, 3 -> 5, 3 -> 3},       EdgeRenderingFunction -> (If[First[#1] === 1, {Red, Line[#1]},           Line[#1]] &), VertexLabeling -> True]      ![bad](http://i.stack.imgur.com/04rky.jpg) What am I doing wrong? I was following the (slightly more complicated) model given in the _Mathematica_ documentation:               GraphPlot[{1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 4, 5 -> 1, 5 -> 2, 5 -> 3, 5 -> 4,        1 -> 4, 3 -> 5, 3 -> 3},       EdgeRenderingFunction -> (If[          Length[#1] > 2, {Red, Line[#1],            Text[If[First[#1] === Last[#1], "loop", "multiedge"],             LineScaledCoordinate[#1, .7], Background -> White]},           Line[#1]] &), VertexLabeling -> True]      ![good](http://i.stack.imgur.com/caVav.jpg)
