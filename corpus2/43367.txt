I have an expression like this:               expr = F[0, 1] + 2 F[0, 0] - 17*F[2, 0]      and I want to transform it to a list consisting of all function calls with its arguments:               MyList = {F[0, 1], F[0, 0], F[2, 0]}      Does anyone know a clever way to do this in _Mathematica_? My currently best solution is using ToString and do string-manipulations, but it is defintivly very slow and ugly.
