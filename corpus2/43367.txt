Assuming you are working for a company or in a team of developers, is the code bound to the person who did it? When someone develops a particular functionality or an area of the application, is this person the only one who can, is allowed or is just able to make changes to it? I personally think that a well-done piece of code or program should be easily modified by any programmers, but what about what you see in your environment? At my work, I'd say that the majority of the code can be modified by anyone (that's what coding standards are for right?). There are some things though that are 'property' of some coworkers like the module that handles the pay or some important functionality of the production module (we are developing an ERP system). What about your work place? Am I the only one living this?
