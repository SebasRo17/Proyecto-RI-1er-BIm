I'm kind of new to programming and i have a question that's been bothering me for awhile. Why is the JavaScript-language different in different programs/sites. I've used Codecademy to practice and i've noticed it's different from Eclipse and Unity. For example, in codecademy, you use: var blabla = "something" to declare a variable. In eclipse though, you use: int x = 2, String x = "hey". Why is it like this? Thanks in advance.
