OK, so my class file is getting rather large, and that's a code smell. But until I can refactor it out, I need to get a handle on it. Primary options:   1. Code Regions.   2. Splitting into partial classes. I have never really liked code regions. They take time to write, and it seems I am always folding/unfolding the regions to find something. I like the partial class idea. Say for example, all public and private properties go into a partial class when they become too many. Does this make sense? The bottom line is that I just need to be able to find methods and properties rapidly, ie navigate code. So, really what I am asking is what is the best way to navigate code?
