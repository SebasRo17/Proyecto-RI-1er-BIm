I have been using _Mathematica_ for some time now but I have a feeling that I am not using it as efficiently as it could be. I have the following problem which I am unable to figure out and it would be great if someone could point me in the right direction: I have a function which is of the following form:               f[x_]:= Total[A1/(A2+x),Infinity];       where `A1` and `A2` are very large arrays (2500x2500 real numbers) (Sorry for the way I wrote the function but I haven't figured out how to insert code into the question (not very good at this type of typesetting)) The problem is when I want to create another list (large list) of values of `f[x]`. It seems that Total is what slows things down here and I was wondering if there is a way to replace Total with something faster. Any clues?
