I drew the little ASCII-art electronics schema below in vim.   When i try to paste it into a Mathematica notebook, with:   A) A code cell   B) A monospaced font (Courier New)   Mathematica insists on destroying the vertical aligment. Here is what it looks like in vim: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3nMB5.png) And here's what it looks like in Mathematica: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vquS9.png) Even worse, when I try to re-align things by hand in the notebook, the end result looks very bad (note the misaligned vertical bars on the right hand side) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/By0fh.png) For something so simple to be so hard ... I must be missing something glaringly obvious.   Help would be very much appreciated.
