I'm having the replace rule:               rule = {-g_ x_^4 - 2 g_ x_^2 y_^2 - g_ y_^4 -> -g (x^2 + y^2)^2};      Now,               (2 Re[Hy Conjugate[Hx]] kx^4 vx vy)/(k^2 (kx^2 + ky^2)) + (      4 Re[Hy Conjugate[Hx]] kx^2 ky^2 vx vy)/(k^2 (kx^2 + ky^2)) + (      2 Re[Hy Conjugate[Hx]] ky^4 vx vy)/(k^2 (kx^2 + ky^2)) //. rule      Just spits the same expression back out. The expected output would be               (2 Re[Hy Conjugate[Hx]] (kx^2 + ky^2) vx vy)/k^2      Sure, I could remove the minus signs in the rule, but is it possible to match both `+` and `-`? Furthermore this also fails of one of the coefficients is a complex number, how can I tell Mathematica that this should also work with complex numbers? If there is another way to do this, e.g., using `Solve`, I'd like to hear that.
