The problem is Find two linearly independent solutions of $2x^2y'' -xy' + (-4 x + 1)y = 0, \, x>0$ of the form $y_1 = x^{r_1}(1 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + \cdots)$ and $y_2 = x^{r_2}(1 + b_1 x + b_2 x^2 + b_3 x^3 + \cdots)$. What I have done is below:               2 x^2*D[y, {x, 2}] - x D[y, x] + (-4 x + 1) y == 0 /. y -> x^r*(Sum[C[n]*x^n, {n, 0, 5}])      The result mathematica gave is               (1 - 4 x) x^r (C[0] + x C[1] + x^2 C[2] + x^3 C[3] + x^4 C[4] + x^5 C[5]) == 0      from which I conclude that `D[y,x]`is excuted before the replacement. How can I make `D[y,x]` excute after the replacement?
