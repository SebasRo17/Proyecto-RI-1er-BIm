I just started a new job, I have to create a web app for them and host it on their intranet on an Windows 2003 R2 server with SQL server 2008. As said in the question, I'll work on a MCV3 with Razor syntax application. I know that it won't work easily or even not work at all. On a recent server you have to install something more (I don't remember the name) for the Razor to be understood. What about on this old server? Will I get it to work or should I tell them to buy a more up to date server?
