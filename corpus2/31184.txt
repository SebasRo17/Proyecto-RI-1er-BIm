I have some problems. First of all, I declare matrices like below               $Assumptions = {       Element[X, Matrices[{m, n}]],        Element[T, Matrices[{n, k}]],        Element[Y, Matrices[{m, k}]]};      and I want to apply               transpose(X T - Y).(X T - Y) =        transpose[T].transpose[X].X.T - transpose[T].transpose[X].Y -        transpose[Y].X.T + transpose[Y].Y      so I tried   1. `Inner[Times, {X \[Transpose]}, {T \[Transpose]}, Plus] - \[Transpose][Y]`   2. `Inner[NonCommutativeMultiply, {X}, {T}] - {Y} = {-Y + X ** T} ...` But I can not multiply the two above expressions.               Inner[NonCommutativeMultiply,        Inner[Times, {X\[Transpose]}, {T\[Transpose]}, Plus] - Transpose[Y],        Inner[NonCommutativeMultiply, {X}, {T}] - {Y}]      because I get errors. Could you help me?
