In `WolframAlpha` we can easily visualize Riemann surfaces of arbitrary functions, ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/N1UD4.png) can we plot the Riemann surface of an arbitrary function using _Mathematica_ and with a better color scheme like these plots so that I can see the connection of the branches? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ytb0N.png) _Edit_ Here are more Riemann surfaces by Matthias Nieser et.
