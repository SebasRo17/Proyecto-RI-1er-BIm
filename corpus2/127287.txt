I'm currently working mostly alone on a project (in Java). I'm mostly alone as I have an advisor that gives me high level instructions on what to do, and will seldom make any code contribution. She will code in a couple of acceptance tests from time to time, though. I've never used an issue tracker before, and was thinking about starting to use one now, as I'd like to have a place where I can log possible bugs I find and keep track of them in a centralized manner. Would it be possible to integrate the issue tracker with Eclipse, better yet. So here are the constraints:   1. It's NOT a open-source project. Our code is not to be shared with anyone!   2. we are and will be using Subversion;   3. we have our own Subversion server and we will keep using this same Subversion server;   4. it must be free;   5. it must allow at least 2 users. What is your advice on what to pick? I'm looking for the simplest solution available.
