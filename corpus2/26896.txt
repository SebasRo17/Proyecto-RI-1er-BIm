This sounds like a fairly trivial question, but I can't think of any way to solve it. I am doing an extensive parameter sampling where a set of ODEs is used together with `NDSolve` to find values of the dependent variables at certain time points. Yet, I am getting several different errors (e.g. convergence errors) when using **certain** parameters. Thus, I would like to ask your help in getting a way to **find which parameters yield the errors** , not how to fix the errors themselves. The algorithm uses the system of ODEs (with defined initial conditions) and defines the function to compute the concentrations at various time points. It is then used to do the parameter sampling               SysODEs={X'[t]==ba+k1 A - b1 X[t], Y'[t]==k2 X[t]-v1 Y[t]-k1,etc};          DFunction[{a1_,b1_,v1_,k1_},ba_]:=         Block[{sol1,c1,c2},         sol1=NDSolve[SysODEs/.k2->2,{X,Y},{t,0,300}];         c1=X[100]/.sol1;         c2=Y[300]/.sol1;         {c1,c2}         ]          SampleP=Flatten[         Table[{h, j, k, l}, {h, 0, 5, 1}, {j, 0.1, 0.9, 0.1}, {k, 1,10, 1}, {l, 5, 10, 1}],3];          ParallelMap[DFunction[#, 0.1] &, SampleP]      **Problem:** I want to know which values of `SampleP` yield errors. Because my original functions `SampleP`, `DFunction` etc. are much more complex, I didn't include them in here (`SampleP` has size ~200 000 in my problem). Is there any way of doing it? I was thinking about some kind of `Trace`, but this will give me too much unneeded information. **Edit:** I was searching and found this link with information about the functions `MLCreateMark()` and `MLSeekMark()` that are used in `MathLink`. Maybe this helps in finding something similar in Mathematica?
