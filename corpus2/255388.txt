I'm an IT student and we have to make a project about random access file without using a database, using only text files. So I was wondering if anybody here that could help me with it. I want to have an example so I can study it. A simple random access file program will do. An example of it is a phonebook in which you can save a name and a phonenumber. And you can edit it and delete. And also search names or phonenumbers and also can browse all the files randomly. If you know how it's done or if you have any samples that I can study, please answer. Your help is really appreciated. And I'll give you credits if I make my program. I'll thank you in advance....
