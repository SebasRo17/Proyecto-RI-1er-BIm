I know that there are methods to structurally manipulate held expressions (discussed e.g. here), but I failed to apply those for this particular problem:               (Hold[{3, 4, 5 | 6}] /. (Verbatim@Alternatives)[x__] :> RandomChoice@List@x)      > >     Hold[{3, 4, RandomChoice[{5, 6}]}] >   The code should replace any `Alternatives` in the held expression with an appropriate choice from the alternatives, in this case either 5 or 6, i.e. it _should_ evaluate the replacement.
