I'm getting into ReactJS and am intrigued but also confused about persistent data structures. I love the idea, but I'm not sure how to take my MV*, Mutable, Observable Bindings experience in designing view components and apply it in a sane way. For example, suppose I have a deeply nested structure:               Foo       Bar          Baz           someValue       Qux       Quxx      In my UI, I have a component that is an editor for `someValue`. In a mutate- observe paradigm I would do something like:               Baz.setSomeValue(newValue)  // trigger observers, etc...      As near as I can tell, though, the equivalent with persistent data structures is something like:               Foo = extend(Foo, { Bar:{ Baz:{ someValue: newValue } } });     // recompute with new value of Foo      What is the normal pattern for encapsulating a component that deals with `Baz` so that it doesn't have to know the entire structure?
