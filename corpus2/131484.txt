How early do tech companies expect job applicants to apply, and whats the shortest amount of time it will take from applying to a company to beginning to work there? For example, if I'm graduating in May and wants to start working in July or August, when should I apply for jobs at tech companies? I assume small companies only look at applicants a few weeks before they are ready to work, but what about large companies, like Google or Facebook?
