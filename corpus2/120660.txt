I was thinking about a live editing environment where code / a source file is synchronized so that changes made by one user would be carried across to all others editing the file. Something like Google Wave, but for code. Could this kind of an environment be better for the code, as changes are shared instantly? (with revision-control, of course) Has anyone tried (or has had a need for) using a shared environment for code? I'd love to hear from someone who has used such an editor.
