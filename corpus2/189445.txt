When I write code like this, where obj is a local variable:               if (obj is IMyInterface)     {        var result = (IMyInterface)obj;        // ....     }      Resharper offers to change it into code like this:               var result = obj as IMyInterface;     if (result != null)     {        // ...     }      I prefer the former, as it offers no opportunity for accidental null reference exceptions. What reasons are there for preferring the other form? Why does Resharper recommend this?
