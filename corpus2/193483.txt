I have recently been reading about flow and, since I have experienced this state a few times, I wondered how often an average programmer is able to work in this very focused and balanced way. Do you know if there are any **empirical studies** on how often average programmers reach flow in their daily activity, and on how this can influence productivity? I am not asking for a mere list of references to the literature (although these would be interesting) but also for a short description of such studies, if any exist.
