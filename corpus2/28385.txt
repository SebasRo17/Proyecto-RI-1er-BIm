I've been playing around for while trying to determine how to get all graphic objects to use StandardForm fonts. That is, I want all axes labelling, titling, legends, inserted text, etc., for 2D/3D graphics to use StandardForm. Forever and always unless explicitly overridden. I'm getting somewhat overwhelmed with all of the options in the Option Inspector and if anyone has a suggestion I would appreciate it.
