I am trying to learn lua and am experimenting on my linux machine. I am not a programmer, so I am looking for your help to give me some suggestions. What I want to accomplish is making my compile-rewrite-recompile cycle as efficient as possible. Here is what I do. I am using vim in one window to program. I have a shell open in another window. When I want to check my progress, I save the code in vim, switch to my shell, then execute the code. However, this is still kind of tedious, I was there was a faster, more elegant way. Any ideas? How do you go about this problem?
