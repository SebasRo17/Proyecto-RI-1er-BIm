I admire Japanese technology and their innovation. They always seem to be one step ahead of everyone else. But why isn't their software industry just as developed? Why aren't there any Japanese operating systems, high-end game engines, 3D digital content creation applications? I would like to see their take on these and I think it could bring alot of innovation. Btw I mentioned 3D software because the animation industry is strong there as well, but they are using North American software for this.
