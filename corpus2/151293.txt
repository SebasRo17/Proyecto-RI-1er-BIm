UTF8?   UTF16? Do strings in PHP also keep track of the encoding used? Let's look at this script for example. Say I run:               $original = "शक्नोम्यत्तुम्";      What actually happens? Obviously I think `$original` will not contain just 7 characters. Those glyphs must each be represented by several bytes there. Then I do:               $converted = mb_convert_encoding ($original , "UTF-8");      What will happen to `$converted`? How will `$converted` be different from `$original`? Will it be just the exact same byte sequence as `$original` but with a different encoding?
