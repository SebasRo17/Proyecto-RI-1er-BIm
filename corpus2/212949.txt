I have never seen the use of "are" for boolean methods, but the use of "is" is very common. When I want to use "are" is usually because I am passing multiple variables, or a list of objects. I suppose I could rationalize my list of objects or multiple variables as one thing, such as "isSetupParametersValid", but that would still be plural. Is the lack of use of "are" in boolean methods, simply an arbitrary convention or a side-effect of using best practices. If it's a side-effect of best- practices, which ones? Note: for non-native English speakers "is" refers to a singular object, "are" refers to plural/multiple objects
