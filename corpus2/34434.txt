_(Apologies for not having gotten around to responding to and accepting answers on my other recent questions --as a meticulous and thorough type, I'd like to take my time to fully comprehend and play with all answers before responding. I'll definitely follow up.)_ I'm trying to reproduce a variant of this view, where hovering the mouse over a point highlights its "corresponding" point on all plots: ![Google Finance page for AAPL, with a volume chart and the "Slow Stochastic Oscillator"](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UEnRA.png) In my case, the additional complexion is that the x-axes are not the same ( _i.e._ they're not all time), though they do all increase monotonically. I'm in the process of reading, experimenting, and further exploring based on comments on these threads:   * Display function value on hover?   * Display position information out of ListPlots inside a Manipulate   * Extracting the coordinate of a particular point of interest from a ListPlot   * Items known by CurrentValue   * How to manipulate 2D plots?   * Dynamically updating interactive objects in Mathematica   * Adding custom GridLines to the "automatic" ones However, I've yet to understand (though perhaps the answer may be in one of those threads) how one would affect a plot based on an event triggered on another plot. Any pointers would be greatly appreciated. I'll post my solution when I figure it out, though I'm sure it won't be the best one could do, as I'm still new to Mathematica. * * * After @ssch's answer was posted, I realized I left out some critical details/clarifications. First, I'm working with discreet data, _i.e._ two `ListPlot`s. That doesn't seem to matter, though. @ssch's example worked for me, using `ListPlot`. Second, and more importantly, the two x-axes are _not_ linear images-- _i.e._they do _not_ increase uniformly. For example: ![Non-uniform example](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ucuz4.png) The above plots graph the same y-axes, but based on different x-axes. (The dotted gray lines correspond, so one can see how certain areas are "stretched" or "compressed" in the second graph.) Is there a way to get a corresponding cursor in such a case?
