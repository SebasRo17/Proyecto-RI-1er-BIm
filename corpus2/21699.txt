I downloaded several USGS Digital Elevation Maps (DEM files) corresponding to 12 adjacent areas. Each file Imports[] into _Mathematica_ and I can render the individual `ReliefPlot`s easily. The intent was, however, to create a mosaic by joining the individual images. Unfortunately, each DEM is warped and when I render using `ImageAssemble` there are triangular gaps between each `ReliefPlot`. Does anyone know if there is a simple way of using _Mathematica_ to orthogonalise the tiles so they can be assembled without gaps? It seems like `Import` pads the gaps using a number corresponding to a corner thereby creating an array that can be processed by `ReliefPlot`. I gather the issue stems from fact each tile is a quadrangle defined using UMT coordinates so I'm hoping the Geodesy package will help effect the transformation. However, having looked at the Geodesy functions I can't see the wood for the trees! Is there a simple fix. And is there a tutorial or book for the package?
