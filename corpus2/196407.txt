I'm a bit confused if saving the information to session code below, belongs in the controller action as shown below or should it be part of my Model? I would add that I have other controller methods that will read this session value later.                 public ActionResult AddFriend(FriendsContext viewModel)       {             if (!ModelState.IsValid)             {                                 return View(viewModel);             }                  // Start - Confused if the code block below belongs in Controller?                  Friend friend = new Friend();             friend.FirstName = viewModel.FirstName;             friend.LastName = viewModel.LastName;             friend.Email = viewModel.UserEmail;                              httpContext.Session["latest-friend"] = friend;                  // End Confusion                  return RedirectToAction("Home");         }      I thought about adding a static utility class in my Model which does something like below, but it just seems stupid to add 2 lines of code in another file.               public static void SaveLatestFriend(Friend friend, HttpContextBase httpContext)     {         httpContext.Session["latest-friend"] = friend;     }               public static Friend GetLatestFriend(HttpContextBase httpContext)     {         return httpContext.Session["latest-friend"] as Friend;     }
