UPDATE: I've gotten a lot of feedback, but no info on what percent of time people spend on docs. To keep it simple, say the docs are for developers and peer reviewed; meaning the peer understands how to do it, and the comments are more for the what is being done, not how to do it from scratch; which in my case is the request, just don't think the request is common. Been working a project for 2 months, and it's done. When the project started, documentation was not a requirement; focus was "get it done." So, all the sudden there's an interest in creating documentation for the project... that's 100% turn-key, meaning that someone with no understanding of anything, would be able to do everything required to duplicate the work done. In case it matters, the project was a data profiling, extraction, transformation, and loading themed. Meaning I was given sets of data, a final state of the data -- and figured out all the issues/solutions to make that happen. Just wondering if anyone has seen stats on the average percentage of time take to write docs. (Have questions/feedback, just comment -- thanks.)
