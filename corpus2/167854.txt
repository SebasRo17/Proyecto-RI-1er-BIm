I have to import data from Excel to an SQL database. The Excel data contains various parameters and their values, like P1, P1, P4, P5, etc. I have to apply business rules. Like _if (P1 > 100 and P1 < 200) then insert the record in database_. Similarly, in some cases, string values are also validated. Can I have any open source rule engine that contains UI to change, add, and delete the rules? I am using C# to read the Excel data and and inserting the records. One more thing, which of the following is the best approach?   * Read Excel data first and store every record as an object in a collection, iterate through the collection, apply business rules on every object and insert record in the database. Or   * Read one record from Excel, apply business rules and insert the record in the database. Repeat the process for the whole Excel spreadsheet.
