Is there something beyond OOP? In today's world, almost any problem can be solved with OOP as the basis. But how many of them are really effective? For example, Java is purely Object Oriented. It generates the byte code and interprets it. Now, obviously the execution time is greater in Java when compared with C and C++. Problems are of various nature. Some are really computationally intensive, some others are GUI Programming, some want to reduce the response time. So, globally can OOP solve all these or is there a life beyond it?
