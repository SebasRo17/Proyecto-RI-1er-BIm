I have a list which consists of elements each of which has a date in `DateList` format, a number and a flag (Y/N). e.g.               {{{2010, 11, 29, 16, 6,  0.}, 17.7, "N"},       {{2010, 12, 2,  14, 38, 0.}, 11.9, "N"},       {{2010, 12, 2,  20, 1,  0.},  8.2, "N"}}      I want to extract those elements which are dated within the last 90 days and also the same date range but one year previous (into two separate lists). I presume the way to do this would be to define an `Interval` between the `AbsoluteTimes` of the ends of the ranges. But how do I filter the list on this basis: i.e. apply a filter (`IntervalMemberQ`) on the basis of the `AbsoluteTime` of the first element in each element in the list? I presume that it's something to do with pure functions but I can't get the syntax right.
