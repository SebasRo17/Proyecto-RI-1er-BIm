I used Jens' legendmaker to `Overlay` graphics to get a nice legend on my `ListPlot`. My question is if is there any way to make the output from `Overlay` behave like output from `ListPlot` in terms of the ability to zoom in to investigate, get co-ordinates, drawing tools, ability to right click on the graphic itself and save high resolution graphic as a host of things etc? I was able to right click the cell and save selection as a very low resolution jpeg. Thanks, **EDIT:**               boundaryplot = ListPlot[{H0SPlot, H0DPlot},PlotRange -> Full]     opts = Sequence[Background -> LightOrange, RoundingRadius -> 10];     labels = {"H0S", "H0D"}     Overlay[{boundaryplot, legendMaker[labels, opts]}, All, 1,Alignment -> {0.5, 0.5}]      While the `Overlay` options enable me to zoom in etc, when I right click on the image to `save graphic as` , I tried jpeg and pdf, it only saves the `ListPlot` and not the `Legend`. When I right click on the cell itself and use `save selection as` then I am able to save as jpeg something lower-res that also includes the legend.
