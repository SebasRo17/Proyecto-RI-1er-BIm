I'm trying to create animation of some discrete process using Manipilate: `Manipulate[**Some graphics based on very slow computations, each step is calculated slowly then the previous**], {Step, 1, 1000, 1}]` It works fine if I move Step slider with the mouse. But if I click the 'Play' button, animation starts but a lot of steps are missing. For example, I see the picture corresponding the 1st step, then the 13th, then 51st... And sometimes I even get '$Aborted'. Manipulate options like `ContinuousAction -> False` don't make any change. How can I make Manupulate display all the steps, one by one, with "Play' button?
