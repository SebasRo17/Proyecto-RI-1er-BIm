Consider the example1:               p0 = Plot[Tan[x Pi/2], {x, -1, 1}]      In this case, the vertical range specified would be $(-\infty, \infty)$, which is clearly impossible to plot, but Mathematica silently chooses a vertical plot range of $[-6.60184, 6.50751]$ (as reported by `AbsoluteOptions[p0, PlotRange]`). In fact, even in cases where the function to be plotted remains finite throughout the interval specified (including its endpoints), Mathematica will sometimes choose a vertical range smaller than the actual range of the function in the specified interval. For example, if one plots               epsilon = 1*^-6;     Plot[Tan[x Pi/2], {x, -1 + epsilon, 1 - epsilon}]      the vertical plot range used by Mathematica is $[-6.60183, 6.50749]$, almost the same as the one used in the previous example. How does `Plot` decide the vertical range of a 2D plot, when the user does not specify (a bounded) one? (Needless to say, I don't expect to get a full description of Mathematica's algorithm for doing this, since it's proprietary information. What I'm hoping to get is just the general idea, in broad strokes.) * * * One thing I can say is that the horizontal range does not seem to enter into the computation of the vertical range, since the vertical range for the plot               Plot[Tan[x Pi/200], {x, -100, 100}]      is exactly the same as for the first example above. 1 Sorry for not posting pictures...
