How do I get people to want to collaborate on a project idea I have/actually contribute? I am a bit sensitive about my idea for a couple reasons:   1. I don't want people to take my idea.   2. I have gotten a couple people who wanted to help but then work/family/school stops them from having time and makes me less enthusiastic in the process. For now it's actually ok because it has forced me to become familiar with PHP and servers and I have just been working on it on my own because I want to learn and its fun, but at some point I will need others to help in order to make it robust and ready to distribute. How do I get collaborators when I will need them? I feel like I should start figuring that out now. I have just been learning how to write software using mainly Stack Overflow, idiot guides and YouTube. Great to learn, but development is slow.
