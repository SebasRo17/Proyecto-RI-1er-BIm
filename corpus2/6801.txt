While answering Trouble getting FindInstance to return multiple results for certain constraints it became clear that for this problem `FindInstance` would be better starting with small numbers, but it does not. The function has the `Method` option:               Options[FindInstance, Method]   (*  Out: {Method -> Automatic}  *)      Yet, I cannot find documentation for the methods (and methods sub-options) that it accepts.   * What `Method` values does `FindInstance` accept?   * Will any of them scan an `Integer` search space small-values first?
