Is there a simple, built-in way to retrieve the text of a message, given it's identifier (such as `Power::infy`)? The documentation describes how `Message` does this: it looks for different language versions (`Power::infy::langname`), then it looks under the symbol name (`Power::infy`), then it looks under `General` (`General::infy`), then it uses `$NewMessage` ... it's pretty complicated. Is there any built-in, hidden/undocumented way that will let me retrieve the text of a message in a simple way, without issuing the message? I see two possibilities:   1. Reimplement the whole lookup procedure. This is a lot of work.   2. Implement a special stream and do something like `Block[{$Messages = ...}, Message[symb::name]]`. Also a lot of work (implementing the stream methods), and I'm not even sure it would work. Or maybe there is an undocumented way. `?*`*Message*` gives plenty of symbols, but it's not clear which may be interesting and what they do.
