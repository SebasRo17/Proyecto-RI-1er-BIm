I defined a security bound for a random walk (cube with 15 lengh) and i have this code to obtain a sample of the random times at which the random walk crosses the boundary for the first time:               w = Do[i = 0; NestWhile[(i++; # + RandomReal[{-1, 1}, 3]) &, {0, 0, 0},Norm[#] < 15 &];    Sow[i], {1000}] // Reap       (take the code from here Sample of the random times at which the random walk crosses the boundary) And i constructed a histogram with w: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qXvx6.jpg) And now i want to know the distribution of this data, i tought that is was a gamma because of the histogram but i run some tests in excel and i concluded that it isnt but i would like to confirm that with mathematica, is that possible? And when i do this               \[ScriptCapitalH] = DistributionFitTest[w[[2, 1]], Automatic, "HypothesisTestData"];          \[ScriptCapitalH]["FittedDistribution"]      I have for output: NormalDistribution[233.588, 150.231], but sweekness[w]=1.83 (if it was a normal it should be aproxematly zero). Would like some help please :)
