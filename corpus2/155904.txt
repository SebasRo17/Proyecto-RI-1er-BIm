I am planning on building a web app with many different public-facing HTTP servers; each of which will have Google Analytics (GA) installed on them. I'd like to create a "dashboard" app that consolidates the GA data into one screen. I've been perusing the documentation for this so-called GA API, but I can't tell what the end result of the GA API is:   * Does the GA API allow me to do exactly what I am looking for it to do? Or...   * Does the GA API do something entirely different (like allow me to share my data with Google+ or something else weird) Since an API can be used to CRUD any kind of data, I guess I'm asking which way the GA API goes: is it for querying (reading) data from 1+ server instances, or is it for modifying data on those servers or somewhere else? Thanks in advance!
