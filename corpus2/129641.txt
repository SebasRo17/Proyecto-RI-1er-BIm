I am looking for a good ebook (or two) for learning the C programming language, specifically programming in a GNU/Linux environment. I'm not a beginner programmer, but I have almost no experience in this particular area. I need to learn both the fundamentals of C and the GNU toolchain (gcc, gdb, and make). For the C language side, I know K&R comes highly recommended, but it doesn't seem particularly practical for me given that it won't describe modern best practices, current libraries, or any particulars about GNU/Linux programming. Is there a book out there that's the de-facto standard for describing best practices, design methodologies, and other helpful information on C Programming in GNU/Linux and covering the GNU toolchain? What about that book makes it special?
