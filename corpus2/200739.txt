I've taken a course in computer science that covered basics about java and programming from conditionals and loops to inheritance and interfaces. I also got Head First Java from a friend who didn't write in it. After I finish that book, what should I do before I head into developing games? Also, I've been just making command line games and math programs for now. Is that good practice? I'm just worried that I will only be repeating things that I already know, and that I won't be learning anything new.
