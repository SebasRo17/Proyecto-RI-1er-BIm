We are planning to use Google Analytics in our organization and I am in charge for setting it up. I was wondering how to deal with multiple environments. We sure do not want to collect data during development and QA (or maybe collect data to a different analytics account), but we want to when the site goes to production (obviously).   * How do you deal with multiple environments and Google Analytics ?   * Do you setup multiple accounts for Google Analytics and use either one depending on the environement ? We're using ASP.NET 2.0, if that matters.
