More than a single question, I have some doubts about the output of certain functions when defined through the result of other calculations. I am an active user of Mathematica, but maybe I haven't read deeply enough about Attributes or related things. Here is the following minimal example:               {tini, tfin} = {-Log[100], 0};     firstFuncK=NDSolve[{D[f[t,k],t]+f[t,k]^2+(1-t)*f[t,k]==3/2*     (1+k^2),f[tini,k]==1},f,{t,tini,tfin},{k,0.001,10}]          secondFuncK[t_?NumberQ, k_] :=      Exp[NIntegrate[f[et, k] /. firstFuncK, {et, tini, t}]]          thirdFuncK[t_,k_]:=Log[N[secondFuncK[t,k]/secondFuncK[-Log[100],k]]][[1]]      Here comes the first question, why exactly do I need the `[[1]]` or `First` and the `N`. Without them I get:               thirdFuncK[-1,0.01]     {Log[4.11782/secondFuncK[-Log[100],0.01]]}      It is weird that Mathematica doesn't output a number, since secondFuncK is already numerical. And I don't understand why I get a List in this case:               thirdFuncLin[et_]=thirdFuncK[et,0.01];      Output:               thirdFuncLin[-1]     {1.41532}          Plot[thirdFuncLin[tt],{tt,-4,0}]      ![thirdFuncK](http://i.stack.imgur.com/poJ4F.png) But the real problem is when I use this function to interpolate:               thirdInterp=Interpolation[Table[{et,thirdFuncLin[et][[1]]},{et,-Log[100],0,0.01}]]      I get a completely different result:               Plot[thirdInterp[tt], {tt, -4, 0}]      ![thirdInterp](http://i.stack.imgur.com/39TyC.png) I know there are related questions of simple mistakes people do, but I haven't found anything that helps me really to understand the core of this problem. Thanks for any suggestions also on style or optimization.
