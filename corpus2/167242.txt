Suppose I have a controller that loads a file and hands it over to the processing.   * Should I handle the exception in the file loader and return `Null` if something is wrong, or should I throw the exception and handle it in the controller?    * Without the file the rest of the program canÂ´t work. Where should I handle a exception that shuts down the program properly? I want to shut down an Android application properly.
