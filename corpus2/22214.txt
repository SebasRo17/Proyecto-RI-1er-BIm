I'm teaching some lessons on negative exponents and one application listed was half life since the rate of decay can be written as 2^-1 every ___ _ years. I found this nice animation on the net. http://www.absorblearning.com/media/attachment.action?quick=185&att=3167 I certainly don't need anything near that fancy, but wondered how I could model a similar kind of graphic using mathematica, where I could use a slider to represent years, and show a grid that responded by randomly choosing dots to "turn" off as time moved along. Any starting hints or answers are welcomed. Tom
