My requirement:   1. Comments should appear within a notebook in blue and font size 12 and in Courier by default.    2. This should work on not just my machine (by tweaking the preference of MY _Mathematica_ )    3. I could use this code but the problem is when I open the notebook, the comments are still in gray.              SetOptions[EvaluationNotebook[], AutoStyleOptions -> {"CommentStyle" -> {FontColor -> Blue,        FontFamily -> "Courier", FontSize -> 12, FontWeight -> Bold}}];       Once I evaluate this cell, it turns blue. I would like to have it in this format even before I evaluate anything. I am looking for something where just by opening this notebook, it will by default evaluate this cell or something like that, but machine independent?   4. I could simply use cell style as "Text" and have it formatted. However, the problem is, I cannot divide cells within a function and if I need to put in comments within a function is not possible to use the cell style as "Text".
