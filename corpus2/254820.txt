I am building RESTful API that manages persons and lists. There can be many `List` and many `Person` each with its own set of properties. `Person` can be in zero or more lists, `List` can contain zero or more Persons. I have implemented these operations for Persons and Lists:   * `GET api/Persons/` to get all persons   * `POST api/Persons/ {..}` to create new person   * `PUT api/Persons/123 {..}` to update person by id   * `DELETE api/Persons/123` to delete person by id To retrieve Lists person is in I would use `GET /api/Persons/123/Lists`, to retrieve all persons in List I would use `GET /api/Lists/234/Persons`. How do I design API to add Person to Lists, remove them from Lists? I thought about flattening `Person` to include `Lists` but then there will be other associations from `Person` and it seems unnecessary to transfer that mush information. I am using asp.net Web API 2 but I am asking in general what are the design principles in this case.
