So I just got a copy of ArgoUML. I originally thought I'd be able to just play around with it to learn it, but it's turning out to be extremely difficult. I searched online for tutorials and videos but came up with nothing useful. The help file for ArgoUML is very incomplete as well. Does anybody know of any online resources to help me learn ArgoUML (and UML in general, I guess)? Thanks!
