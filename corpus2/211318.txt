I know how for loops work and what a nested loop is but I get very frustrated while printing those number or asterisk triangles in java. It makes me wanna quit learning programming :( Please someone tell me an easy way to master loops.               for(int i=1;i<7;i++){             for(int j=1;j<i;j++){                 System.out.print(j);             }             System.out.println();         }      i want to add a mirror image of this triangle before itself.
