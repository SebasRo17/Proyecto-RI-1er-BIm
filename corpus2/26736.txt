I am still a newbie to _Mathematica_ , so I am still getting used to the syntax and logic of the program - but I've been trying to do the following 3D plot:               g[x_, t_] := y /. FindRoot[y == Tanh[(2*y + x)/t], {y, x, t}];     p1 = ContourPlot3D[{z ==           Sech[(2 g[x, t] + x)/t]^2/(t - 2 Sech[(2 g[x, t] + x)/t]^2)}, {t,          0.001, 3}, {x, -1.5, 1.5}, {z, 0, 2.5}, Mesh -> None,         ContourStyle -> Opacity[0.25],         ColorFunction -> ColorData["ThermometerColors"]];          Rasterize[      Show[p1, PlotRange -> {{0.001, 3}, {-1.5, 1.5}, {0, 2.5}},        ViewPoint -> {0.9*Pi, -0.45*Pi, 1.05*Pi}], ImageResolution -> 1200]      The `ContourPlot3D` of the transcendental equation `y == Tanh[(2*y + x)/t]` itself comes out perfect - but after some 10-15 mins of evaluating z, I seem to be getting the right 3D surface from the 2D solutions I've done (cuts through the 3D surface I am trying to plot), but the plot is filled with artifacts. I am the tinkering type, so I tend to need to see things work right a few times, before things like the syntax and logic of _Mathematica_ start to stick in my memory - and I can't figure out this one. What am I doing wrong?
