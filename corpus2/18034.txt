The problem in general involves the unreliable behaviour of `AbsoluteOptions` when option values are implicitly specified (e.g. `Automatic`, `All`, `Full`, etc.), for example the graphics below clearly has a different plot range than the one reported by `AbsoluteOptions`:               {g = Graphics[{}, Frame -> True], AbsoluteOptions[g, PlotRange]}      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Jbjwy.gif) * * * ## Original example For demonstrating the problem, have a look at the following example, and try adjusting the rotation angle `a` and/or the `Locator` position, comparing the real `PlotRange` of `pic` indicated by the frame-ticks with the one under the graph obtained by `AbsoluteOptions[pic, PlotRange]`:               Manipulate[      DynamicModule[{pic},       Column[{         pic = Graphics[{FaceForm[], EdgeForm[Black],            GeometricTransformation[Rectangle[], RotationTransform[a]],            Red, Point[p]},           Frame -> True],         p,         AbsoluteOptions[pic, PlotRange]         }]       ],      {{a, 0}, 0, 2 Pi},      {{p, {.1, .2}}, {-2, -2}, {2, 2}, Locator}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/k7ysd.png) As shown in the screen capture above, in my **Mathematica 9.0** on **Windows 7 64-bit** system, the `PlotRange` from `AbsoluteOptions` is not consistent with the real range. And the angle `a` seems to do nothing with it. Additional tests in my system suggest this problem is not restricted on the attendance of `RotationTransform`, but comes with the `GeometricTransformation`. And it happens not only on `Graphics` but also on `Graphics3D`. So my questions are:   * What is going on here?   * How can I obtain the real `PlotRange` of the `Graphics`/`Graphics3D` when there are `GeometricTransformation`s in it?
