As the original JavaMe team will leave to do other items. The JavaMe project will be taken over by some guys knowing nothing about JavaMe. Transition period: One month About this JavaMe project:   1. about 35000 lines of code (more than 180 java file, SourceCode is 8.5KB in total)    2. using the Polish, Proguard    3. document: The JavaMe project itself have no document. No UML map.  Difficulties I guess:   1. familiar with the JavaMe, this should be okay    2. In order to do the further development. We need to Read the sourceCode ---- It's not easy to read 35,000 lines of code having not enough comment   3. Adaptation work for more than 100 phone These are the questions, thank you!   1. In the case of our guys have no experience in JavaMe, Is one month too hasty?    2. In order to take the job in time . What we should ask the original JavaMe team to do .   3. Considering we hava no experience in JavaMe. The complication we taking the Adaptation work without the original JavaMe team?   4. Any other suggestions?
