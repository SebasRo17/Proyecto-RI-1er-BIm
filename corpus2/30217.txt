I am trying to solve a linear equation in x, where the equation is given by Det[M]==0. The M is a symmetric matrix (dimensions 47x47) with an element equal to x and all other elements are equal to numbers ranging from 1 to 10^4. So, Det[M] is a linear equation in x. I could get a solution for a 11x11 matrix using 'Solve', but when the dimensions goes to 47 the program does not return anything for the time I let it run (about a day). I suspect it is the large size that causes the problem, any suggestion to solve it quickly (~ mins) using Mathematica? Thanks. Jayajit
