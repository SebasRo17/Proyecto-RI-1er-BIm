I presume this question is acceptable here-- because it's a part of software development but not specific to programming. If it's better suited for another area, could someone kindly help move me? I know ads can be profitable for some incredibly popular applications, but how do average applications fare? I am about to release an application and I think it will be pretty popular, but it's not the next Angry Birds. I guess there will be a few thousand users. Would a few thousand users that use the application about 15~20 minutes once or twice a day net any actual profits? What are you experiences with ads like? What kinds of numbers do we need to net anything worthwhile? Thanks~
