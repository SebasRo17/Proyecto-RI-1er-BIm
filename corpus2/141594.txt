Before someone ban-hammers this question as they do with all other pronunciation questions, let me explain its relevance. Verbal communication among co-workers and partners is important; today I was on a conference call with people discussing what I thought was something to do with "Chrome", as in Google Chrome. I pronounce the "cron" in "cron job" with a short O, much like "tron", "gone," or "pawn", but this individual pronouced it with a long O, as in "hone", "bone", or "stone" (notice the e at the end of all those!). Is there a _standard_ pronunciation? Or is this a matter of opinion. For example, there's nothing ambiguous about the pronunciation of "Firefox", but debate is raging over "potato" and "tomato".
