Companies acquire other companies that use different version control systems. Is there a common wisdom on how to integrate such systems together, for example using a Subverson-GIT bridge or even deciding on using just one tool over another - and how to migrate between systems? Do people use a set of criteria for such decision making, for example an equivalent to the "Joel" test on software development?
