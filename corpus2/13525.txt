The default avatar/identicon is based on an MD5 hash of your e-mail address. With some e-mail providers (e.g., GMail) the address `gmailuser+foo@gmail.com` is still delivered to `gmailuser@gmail.com`, so this trick can be used to change the hash of your e-mail and thus get a different identicon, but there is no guarantee that it looks better than the original. How can we semi-automate the search for your preferred identicon using Mathematica?
