So I am writing an `ImportExport` converter for a common chemistry file format, and I've run up against a problem that seems to be about shared streams and whatnot. I followed the directions on this page. To work the example, create a random text file whose contents do not matter.               Export["testfile.txt", "hello"];      The definition for the `Import` converter is as follows               ImportExport`RegisterImport["TestFormat", TestFormat`TestFormatImport];     TestFormat`TestFormatImport[filename_String, options___] :=       Module[{temp},       (*Do some stuff, all works just fine*)       temp = ElementData["C", "AtomicNumber"];       {"Test" -> temp}];      All this does is call for the atomic number associated with the symbol C. If you test it out it seems to work just fine:               In[3]:= Import["testfile.txt",{"TestFormat","Test"}]     Out[3]= 6      But any subsequent call to `ElementData` gives a stream error:               In[4]:= ElementData["F","AtomicNumber"]     During evaluation of In[4]:= General::openx: InputStream[C:\Users\myusername\AppData\Roaming\Mathematica\Paclets\Repository\ElementData-7.0.28\Data\ElementData.wdx,122] is not open. >>     During evaluation of In[4]:= BinaryRead::openx: InputStream[C:\Users\myusername\AppData\Roaming\Mathematica\Paclets\Repository\ElementData-7.0.28\Data\ElementData.wdx,122] is not open. >>     Out[4]= $Failed      But, if I make a call to `ElementData` _before_ I make the `Import` command, then the errors go away.               In[1]:= ImportExport`RegisterImport["TestFormat",                  TestFormat`TestFormatImport];             TestFormat`TestFormatImport[filename_String, options___] :=                  Module[{temp},                (*Do some stuff, all works just fine*)                temp = ElementData["C", "AtomicNumber"];                {"Test" -> temp}];             ElementData["H", "AtomicNumber"]             Import["testfile.txt", {"TestFormat", "Test"}]             ElementData["F", "AtomicNumber"]          Out[3]= 1          Out[4]= 6          Out[5]= 9      This is all well and good, but I don't want to have to randomly make a call to `ElementData` before I do an `Import` command every time. What is going on here and how can I fix it? Thanks
