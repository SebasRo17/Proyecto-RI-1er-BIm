I want to be able to plot several numerical solutions of an ODE plus its analytical solution in one plot in order to see how the numerical solutions converge towards the analytical one w.r.t. the number of steps. The methods I'm using is Euler's method for the equation $ y'(t) = 1-t +4y(t), y(0)=1$ The code I have so far is:               y[0]=1;     Do[y[n+1]=y[n]+0.01(1-0.01n+4y[n]), {n,0,99}]     y[100]      Is this doable? Thanks in advance for any help :)
