Often I use the `Automatic` option to specify plot styles, plot ranges, image sizes, etc. I'd like to be able to apply some modifications to these automatically defined values. For example, if a plot with the `PlotRange -> Automatic` would draw the function on the interval $[0,1]$, I'd like to be able to use something like `PlotRange -> #*2 & /@ Automatic` to extend the plot range to $[0,2]$. Is this possible in general, or maybe every case would need a specific solution? _I'm not sure what tags are most appropriate for this topic, please add them if you think they're more suitable than the one I've chosen._
