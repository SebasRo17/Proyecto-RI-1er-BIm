Similar to this question, but for a very different situation. I've been working-up some example code to accompany a proposed programming challenge and asking questions about the difficult bits. In my latest question, the answer I've received suggests that I use an Octree instead of a BSP-Tree. But Wikipedia says it's patented. And a public programming challenge -- much more than a private program or even free (beer) software -- really is encouraging people to reuse the idea without regard to ownership. So I can't ( _legally_ or _in good conscience_ ) use it here, can I?
