in my repository I've got a sw and a cfg(config) folder under trunk, I'm thinking that when I release I'll branch both of these to the releases folder e.g. v1 of my app, with London config data. If I want to release v1 of my app to NewYork too then I'm thinking I'll branch my config data off of main and adjust it in the release folder. Does this sound ok? have I missed something? I want to be able to tell 12 months from now which city has which version of the app, and be able to support their config data too. Cheers               Trunk       sw         qweqwe.cs, asdasd.cs etc.       cfg         setupData.inixmlwhatever          Releases       London         sw@v1         cfg - London config data            NewYork... app at v1, NewYork cfg       Milan... app at v2, cfg data the same as London's but called milan.cfg       Tokyo... app at v2 but with a Tokyo specific patch, with cfg data the same as Milan      of should I go:               Trunk         sw         cfg          Releases         swV1         swV2         cfgTokyo         cfgLondon         cfgMilan      With this latter one, I don't know what version of the app's installed in London etc? I could use tags to get round this, but then someone might shift the tag. With the former, I've got loads of appV1's kicking about (which I'm ok with, branches are cheap etc. but it looks less organised). Cheers
