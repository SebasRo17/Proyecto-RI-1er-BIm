I'm new to _Mathematica_ and I don't understand why in the solution of the following ODE, the `#1` in the pure function is not immediately replaced by the corresponding `[t/4 + C[1]]`. It seems as if the program wanted to compute the "InverseFunction" operator before inserting the bracket into the solution. I don't see why it should matter mathematically to replace the `#1` by the bracket only after computing the inverse function. Further, why is the `InverseFunction` not computed? I was expecting to get one branch together with the message that there might be other branches.               sol = DSolve[{a'[t] ==      1/2 (-(3/2) + Sqrt[(-(3/2) - a[t])^2 - 2 a[t]] - a[t])}, a[t], t]          {{a[t] -> InverseFunction[      1/8 (-ArcSinh[(1 + 2 #1)/(2 Sqrt[2])] - 6 Log[#1] +           3 Log[9 + 2 #1 + 3 Sqrt[9 + 4 #1 + 4 #1^2]] - 2 #1 - Sqrt[          9 + 4 #1 + 4 #1^2]) &][t/4 + C[1]]}}
