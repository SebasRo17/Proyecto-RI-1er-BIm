I'm trying to implement an application which uses random geometric graphs in Mathematica, but it seems Mathematica lacks the functionality. I need the following functionalities:   1. Generate a set of uniformly distributed vertices on $[0,1]^2$ with certain properties (this really helps)   2. Add an edge in between the vertices that are closer than a given radius $d$   3. Display the graph (this is not like a regular graph display since the location of each vertex is important)   4. Generate some random source-destination pairs and find the shortest path between them   5. Highlight the path on the displayed graph. Note that, Mathematica has all of the required functionality for non-geometric graphs. However, when it comes to the geo-graphs, the functionality is quite useless. Here is the code I already have:               Module[      {nOld, kOld, v, edges},      nOld = -1;      kOld = -1;      Manipulate[       If[        n != nOld,        v = RandomReal[{0, 1}, {n, 2}];        nOld = n        ];            edges =         Select[Flatten[Table[{a, b}, {a, v}, {b, v}],           1], (#[[1, 1]] > #[[2, 1]] &&             EuclideanDistance[#[[1]], #[[2]]] < d) &];            Graphics[        {Red, Point[v],         Blue, Thin, Line /@ edges         }        ]       ,       {n, 10, 100, 10},       {d, 0, 1}       ]      ]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Fw8Rz.png) It generates and shows the random graph. But generating and highlighting the shortest paths are not so simple since I don't have any data-structure to keep the graph. What is the best way to implement a geo-graph in Mathematica? `Sparse matrices` or `System`Graph` or `Combinatorica`Graph`? Can I use some of the built-in graph functions of Mathematica to implement geo-graphs?
