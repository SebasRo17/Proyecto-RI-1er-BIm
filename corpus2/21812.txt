_This thread considers mathematical methodshere to make the 3D object smooth but this question consider how to achieve the goal of smoothing a 3D object in Mathematica._ I want to get smoother geometrical objects, some messing up here. Suppose for example a tetrahedron where I would like to make the corners rounded with either convolution or interpolation. I would have to select two control points on different faces and then select one adjusting point -- I could use a NURBS aka spline approximation with a polynomial then aka Mathematica's BezierCurve[...] command. Now I am trying to do a ready command that would do this for me without me traversing different vertices and making sure of selecting right faces for control/adjusting points. Example data about the coordinates with the tetrahedron's faces here. **Does Mathematica have some ready function to do Interpolation or Convolution for geometric objects?** * * * I think the by-far-easiest solution is to use Convex hull but it hides some information if you have a lot of details. This is an answer in progress. **Different methods**   1. Convex hull of a 3D object?
