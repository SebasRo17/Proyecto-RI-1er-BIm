I've generated a bunch of graphics using `ContourPlot` wich, given the nature of my problem, take a long time to create, and I was wondering if there is a way to save the _object_ (not the image) to a file so I can retrive it later to manipulate, i.e. use `Show`, change colors, add text, etc. For example, suppose I define something like               conic = ContourPlot[x^2/9 + y^2/16, {x, -10, 10}, {y, -10, 10},          ContourStyle -> Red, ContourShading -> None, Contours -> 15,          Axes -> True, AxesLabel -> {x, y}]      then by doing               Definition[conic]      I can see the objetc: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2L2JK.png) Now, what I'd like to do is save the object in such way that I'll be able to change the color from red to blue, the labels, the aspect ratio, etc. by just importing it and modifying the proper options _without_ having to calculate it again. I guess a rudimentary solution would be to export the object to a txt file, and later import it, manipulate it and then use `ToExpression`, but I was wonderign if there is a more "within" approach. I hope this isn't a duplicate. I've tried to search for the answer but the keywords save and graphics made it impossible.
