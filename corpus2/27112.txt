I am plotting a pattern as illustrated in link shown below. I want to create an image of fixed size. The whole image should be filled by repeating unit blocks which consist of black and green regions. The width of a unit block and its black region change from `0` to `100` (or even larger values), and from `1` to `0`, respectively. The ratio between a black region and a unit block is given as `1.055^(-lambda0)`. More preferably, the width of a unit block changes randomly from `Lambda0(1 - errorfactor)` to `lambda0(1 + errofactor)`, so that the average value of the unit blocks are still `lambda0` but each individual block may vary slightly. ![diagram](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jZJvh.jpg)
