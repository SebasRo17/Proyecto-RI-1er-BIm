I am frustrated by the following:               {1, 2, 3.0} /. a_Integer -> a + 1      The `a` on the left side of the arrow is localized and appears in green whereas its sibling on the right side is blue. Consequently, I have to write:               Block[{a}, {1, 2, 3.0} /. a_Integer -> a + 1]      to avoid naming conflicts. It doesn't make sense to me that, within one inbuilt function, a variable is treated differently. I already got some hard to find errors because I forgot to block. What did I overlook here?
