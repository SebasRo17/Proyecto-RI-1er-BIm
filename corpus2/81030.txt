I am very new to smalltalk. And I am currently trying to wrap my head around GNU smalltalk (pharo environment). Upon browsing through the introductory session of pharo by example, I came to know that there is a lot of code base in the squeaksource repository submitted by the programmers. The pharo site very well says that anyone can refer this huge code base available. I would like to know how I can actually browse, load and peek into the source code of the projects within my IDE so that I can get a basic understanding about smalltalk syntax and how to code in pharo? Please help me with this.
