when I input pp = {{2.0, 10}, {4, 19}, {6, 31}, {8, 40}, {10, 51}, {12, 59}, {14, 70}} and press enter I get a matrix output. I want it as an ordered pair to find the best fit line, using Fit[pp,{1,x}x], which it does but when I plot the line and the try to plot the points mathematica interprets my data as a matrix and does not plot it. Why? Before I did this same method and was able to plot both the points and the line on the same graph. Please help anyone.
