I'm planning to build a eCommerce web application(similar to http://zovi.com/) using JSF 1.2 and node.js. All front end components will be jsf components binding to backing bean. I want to achieve real time functionality ( such as displaying **Today's hot sellers** , **Customers who viewed this item also viewed** such patterns) using node.js. And all data retrievals from database(MySQL)should be accomplished using node and display in JSF components. I'm confused in how to bind data that i get from node to corresponding managed bean property(since i bound it to corresponding JSF component). **For example** on load I've to retrieve data using node.js and populate datatable component and also i should update backing bean. Is it possible with out using any web services like REST Hope you understand this context. Please suggest some solutions. And I heard performance of Node.js is efficient only for small web applications not for Enterprise level. Is my approach correct??
