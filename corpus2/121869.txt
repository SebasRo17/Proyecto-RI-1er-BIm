This is one of the bonus questions in my assignment. The specific questions is to see the input list as a set and output all subsets of it in a list. We can **only use cons, first, rest, empty?, empty, lambda, and cond**. And we can only define **exactly once**. But after a night's thinking I don't see it possible to go through the arbitrarily long list without map or foldr. Is there a way to perform recursion or alternative of recursion with only these functions?
