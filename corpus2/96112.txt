I'd appreciate help in fleshing out a set of criteria or "outline" for determining the most appropriate programmers for my situation as well as avenues to find these programmers. I've put together a fully functional web application, which is build using jvm based languages, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My background is in Finance and CS, and as a result I'm very comfortable with development/IT. In the initial stage, I need to: sure up security, refactor the current code base, and implement two relatively simple features. As I'm finishing my project/business plan I'm struggling with what criteria to use in order to identify the programmers I need. At a high level, I know I need 2-3 (backend) programmers:   * 1 "Senior" or "Expert" programmer   * 1 to 2 "Mid-level" or "Competent/Proficient" programmer(s) I know I should (and I will) find programmers that have worked on similar-type projects, but beyond that I'm unsure what criteria to look at. For example, should the senior/expert programmer have 10 years, 15 years or more of experience?
