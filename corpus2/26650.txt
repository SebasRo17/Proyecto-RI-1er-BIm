So far I've written web sites in PHP, except for a pet project of mine written in Python. I'd like to start learning C# for use on the web, but I have no idea where to start. I know nothing of .Net. Are there any good tutorials or online books etc. which give a brief intro to the .Net environment (specifically C#, and specifically for the web)? I'm not even sure what I need to install. Visual Studio I guess, but what else? Anything special, or will VS do the trick?
