If I enter `x/x`, I get `1`. Such behavior leads to this:               Simplify[D[Sqrt[x^2], x, x]]      > 0 The same would be even if I use `Together` instead of `Simplify`. One could then think that $\sqrt{x^2}$ is doubly differentiable at least $\forall x\in\mathbb R$, but if we remove `Simplify` call, we would reveal that it's not:               D[Sqrt[x^2], x, x]      > -(x^2/(x^2)^(3/2)) + 1/Sqrt[x^2] Even more ridiculous is this (which I guess is because `x/x` is simplified before feeding to `Assuming`):               Assuming[x == 0, x/x]      > 1 Why does Mathematica assume $x\ne0$? Is there a way to make it not cancel out such terms?
