My web application will use AJAX calls often and so I have set up some JavaScript to handle "messages" or "responses". These responses are returned (from my ASP.NET application) as JSON objects that act as feedback once a function is complete. Suppose my responses have three basic elements.   * Type (error, warning, info, success)   * Title   * Message For example `Save unsuccessful` `Your data was not saved because of XYZ.` Sometimes, however, I want my function to generate and return some HTML. That's easy enough, but what if I still want to return a message to the user (or some other JSON)?   * Should I return the HTML as part of the JSON?   * Should I only return one or the other?   * Should I return HTML, then make another AJAX call for the response?   * Should I return HTML and store the response in data- tags? Can someone point me in the right direction?
