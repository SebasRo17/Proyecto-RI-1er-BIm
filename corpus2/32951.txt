I've been working on a my first real project using PyQt lately. I've done just a little bit of work in Qt for C++ but nothing more than just messing around. I've found that the Qt python bindings are essentially just a straight port of C++ classes into python, which makes sense. The issue is that this creates a lot of messy, unpythonic code. For example if you look at QAbstractItemModel, there's a lot of hoops you have to go through that forces you to hide the actual python. I was just wondering if there's any intention of writing a python implementation of Qt that isn't necessarily just a wrapper? Either by Nokia or anyone else? I really like Qt but I would love to be able to write more pythonic code. I hope this is OK to ask here. I'm not trying to start a GUI war or anything.
