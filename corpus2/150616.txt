I have, for example, this table               +-----------------+     | fruit  | weight |     +-----------------+     | apple  |   4    |     | orange |   2    |     | lemon  |   1    |     +-----------------+      I need to return random fruit. But apple should be picked 4 times frequently then lemon and 2 times frequently then orange. In more general case it should be `f(weight)` times frequently. What is general algorithm to implement this behavior? _Or maybe there is some ready gems on Ruby? :)_ **PS** I've implemented current algorithm in Ruby https://github.com/fl00r/pickup
