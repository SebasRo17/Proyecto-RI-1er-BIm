I'm creating a News Reader app for Tablets and PCs. My app is fetching data from news sources by **RSS feed** of websites (in the server-side). But some of these sites are showing some advertising banners at the end of each article. Should I remove those banners from the feed? Am I legally/ethically allowed to do this? And what about If I want to put some other ads in my application? (Right at the end of each article) I mean, If I want to have my own advertising service... _Update:_ And what if I **use feed for content titles and summaries** , but use **other thing** , like Readability API **to show full article** , and then put my own ads below content? (Readability gets the HTML page, and gives you a clean page without any ads and such.)
