Let's say I want to find a sample space of such experiment: There are three exits from the box: Left (L), right (R) and front (F). Three mice have been put in that box. Find the sample space of an event which mouse has chosen which exit. Function Permutations[] gives all different outputs.               L={L,R,F}     Permutations[L]      How can I find also outcomes like {F,F,L}, {R,R,R}... ?
