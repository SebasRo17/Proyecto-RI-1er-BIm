Here is my problem : I have a table composed of 3 "under"-Lists and I'd like to plot it with legends, but I can't find a way to do it.               DistSpat20084D = {        {7, 7, 44, 79, 121, 148, 152, 158, 153, 165, 182, 160, 163, 164, 169, 177, 198, 190, 177,         173, 159, 155, 147, 126, 142, 127, 129, 117, 13},         {7, 2, 10, 36, 53, 93, 108, 116, 134, 117, 115, 123, 84, 123, 127, 126, 153, 119, 147, 50,         43, 27, 23, 26, 21, 22, 28, 16, 18, 12,, 4, 5, 4, 3, 4, 1, 3, 0, 2, 4, 3, 4, 2, 5, 4,  0},         {7, 1, 6, 12, 3, 3, 2, 5, 4, 1, 3, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0}};       My command to plot and add legends :               ListLinePlot[Table[{km/10, DistSpat20084D[[j, km]]}, {j, 3},        {km, Length[DistSpat20084D[[j]]]}],PlotLegend ->        {{"Speed1", "Speed2", "Speed3"}}, AxesOrigin -> {0, 0}]
