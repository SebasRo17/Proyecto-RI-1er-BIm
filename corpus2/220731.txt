A Scrum team has been forced together and is feeling very uncomfortable. They are constantly saying that it is not working for them and that they are fed up with hearing the words _Agile_ and _Scrum_. They are feeling that the business if simply forcing a new buzz word on them. They don't have any Agile experiance before this, including the Scrum master. Also, the team consists of a very disconnected skill set.   * 1 manual tester   * 1 .NET developer   * 2 Cobol developers   * A BA turned PO   * The scrum master The .NET dev doesn't want to learn Cobol and the Cobol devs don't want to learn .NET. I've been asked to help out with making them more Agile, however, one of the main tennets of Agile is that the power for change must lie with those with the domain knowledge. Kanban could help, but it wouldn't tackle the broken skill set. _Any advise on where to start?_ Currently my plan is to start with the PO and see how stories are being written, but I am not sure where to go from there.
