Recently I have been solving some Project Euler problems. I find there are always several ways to do the same thing. For example, one could join two lists like this:               a = {2, 1};     b = {2, 3};     Union[a, b]     Join[a, b]      Which gives > {1, 2, 3}   >  {2, 1, 2, 3} So the `Union` function sorts the element and deletes duplicates. I guess the `Join` function will be faster, but how much faster? In a loop, would it be more efficient to use `Join` and `DeleteDuplicates` at each 100th step? Is there documentation of the comparative performance of _Mathematica_ functions? Because heuristics as above could be totally wrong, and I don't know how much experimenting it would take to form a good understanding of the complexity of functions.
