Please note this is an edit to the same question posed a few weeks back: I'm using Mathematica to derive the transfer functions for a three phase AC/DC inverter. Given below is the code for the derivation of the transfer function for a third order filter (LCL) connected system:               Clear[Asys, Bsys, Csys, Dsys]          numericalvalues = {     R1 -> 0.,     R2 -> 0.,     Rd -> 0.,     Lff ->  2.3*10^-3,     Lgf -> 0.93*10^-3,     Cf -> 10*10^-6,     Vbatt ->  400,     Vdc -> 800,     d -> 1};          Asys = {{(Rd - R1)/Lff, -(Rd/Lff), 1/Lff}, {-(Rd/Lgf), (R2 + Rd)/Lgf,      1/Lgf}, {1/Cf, -(1/Cf), 0}};          Bsys = {{d/Lff}, {0}, {0}};     Csys = {{0, 1, 0}};          systf4 = TransferFunctionModel[Csys .Inverse[(( {         {s, 0, 0},         {0, s, 0},         {0, 0, s}        } ) - Asys)].Bsys, s]          Convertertf4 = Simplify[systf4 /. numericalvalues // N]      This results in the following transfer function:               (4.67508*10^10/(s^3+6.40486*10^7 s))      The transfer function calculated by this code differs from the same system solved in Matlab given below:                4.675*10^10/ (s^3 + 1.527*10^-12 s^2 + 6.405*10^7 s + 9.78*10^-5)      Does Mathematica have a tolerance limit that it is assuming the small numbers are insignificant and can be ignored? Has anyone had any experience with this before?
