I have a rather simple app in .net which uploads images in fixed intervals in an ftp server. The file name is specific. I need to have a web page that refreshes **but** i want this to happen only when the upload finishes. How i find a way to determine that the upload has finished? And if the solution has to do with renaming and deleting temp files, should i do this from the windows app or server side? Thanks update: What if i could find a way to check if a filename is a **valid** jpg? I mean if the transfer is not over this check should return false..ideas?
