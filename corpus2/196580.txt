So I have been building this ORM style library for AngularJS (JavaScript) and since I come from a C++/PHP/C# background, I always try to make sure that private things stay private. While this can be accomplished in JavaScript, I keep running into issues that I have to work around probably because JavaScript really does not have the transitional class system that I am used to. Should I just take the python approach and allow people to access private methods/data if they think they know what they are doing? Is this type of approach common in the JavaScript world?
