For creating a large Django project with many apps, my first initial thought was to used Class Based Views (as the Django tutorials seem to emphasize). However, I noticed that due to a lot of the customizations to each app (multiple forms on each page etc), it became very tedious and was much easier to just implement Function Based Views where I just added decorators such as `@require_GET` and `@login_required` for easy authentication and method not supported messages, and am thoroughly convinced I will never go back to CBVs. From a long term support perspective, has anyone had issues with choosing FBVs over CBVs? Am I doing something in the short term that will hurt long term, and could perhaps be solved by custom Class Based Views?
