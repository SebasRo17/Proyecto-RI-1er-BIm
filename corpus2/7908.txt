This seems like a basic feature that is somehow missing. Ideally we'd get something like a tooltip which shows the x,y position where I click (or of where the mouse is currently hovering) and the evaluated vector (or scalar in the case of a scalar field) at that position. I think this would be a great way to "get a feel for" the values because by default the arrows are scaled automatically so they fit so I don't know anything about the relative magnitude of a particular arrow. I have found that this is a good way to get a tooltip which displays the current mouse coordinates really well, but it obviously won't evaluate my vector field for me.
