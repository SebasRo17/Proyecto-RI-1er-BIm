I am trying to find the characteristic function of a sum of "named" distributions, though I am interested in how to use Mathematica to find the characteristic function of $$f(X_1,\ldots, X_n),$$ where $X_i$ are some given random variables. A toy problem is finding the characteristic function of $X+Y$, where $X$ and $Y$ are iid $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$. The following code:               \[ScriptCapitalD] =  TransformedDistribution[x + y, {x, y} \[Distributed] NormalDistribution[]]     CharacteristicFunction[\[ScriptCapitalD], \[Lambda]]      Produces the output               CharacteristicFunction[TransformedDistribution[\[FormalX]1 + \[FormalX]2, {\[FormalX]1, \[FormalX]2} \[Distributed] NormalDistribution[0, 1]], \[Lambda]]      which is obviously not what's desired. It seems that CharacteristicFunction only works with named distributions that ship with Mathematica. Is this correct? If not, how can I make it work with a transformed distribution? (I know that there are other ways to find the characteristic function of $X+Y$ above; it was only used for illustration purposes.)
