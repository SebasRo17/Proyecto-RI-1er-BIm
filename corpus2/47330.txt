I defined a function `f[x_] = x^3 2 x`. Then I had to construct a table showing vertically, the values of `f` corresponding to x on the interval [-3,3] in increment of 0.5. So, I did this:               f[x_] = x^3 - 2 x;     a := PaddedForm[x, {2, 1}];     b := PaddedForm[f[x], {5, 3}];     p = Table[{a, b}, {x, -3, 3, .5}];     TableForm[p,        TableHeadings -> {None,{"x", "f(x)=x^3-2x"}},        TableAlignments -> Center]      I had my answers and so far it was ok. But next, I had to plot the set of values with heavy dots. So I did this:               ListPlot[p];      But now there's an error saying: > Co-ordinate -3.0 in {-3.0,-21.000} is not a floating-point number .... How do I fix this?
