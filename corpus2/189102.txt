I'm a Ruby on Rails developer. I'd like to create a web application. I will let users get a payed subscription to use the product. So I will need a recurring billing system (e.g. via paypal). But there is the fear to fail and make some bad mistakes, because I will handle money from other people.... regardless following the instructions of e.g. Ryan Bates on Railscasts how to implement such a recurring payment system. What is your advice to overcome this fear of building such a product? What are the risks I need to calculate when designing such a system?
