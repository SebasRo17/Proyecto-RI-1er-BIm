I'm looking to cause the front end to display individual characters in a specific color, just in general, as a default sort of thing. For instance, the character "1" would always display as a red 1, except of course when an output color is manually specified. I'm basically looking for something like the image. I have no idea how to go about doing this. I looked at stylesheets enough to know I hate them. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4V4Ki.png)
