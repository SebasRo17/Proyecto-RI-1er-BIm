Since that every things is a file on the UNIX system. If I have a hardware, for example, a mouse, move from left corner to right corner, it should produce some kinds of file to communicate with the system. So, if my assumption is correct, is this possible to do following things:   1. Capture the raw data, which is about moving mouse cursor from left corner to right corner?   2. Reduplicate the raw data, using a program, same producing speed, and data, in order to "redo" moving mouse cursor from left corner to right corner
