I have a list of lists, and I'd like to build a new list, in which lists are in the same list if they have the same first and last element. Here's an example. Suppose I have               {{1, 2, 4}, {1, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 4, 5}, {1, 3, 4, 5}, {2, 4, 5}, {3, 4, 5}}      After some magic has happened, I would like to have               { {{1, 2, 4}, {1, 3, 4}}, {{1, 2, 4, 5}, {1, 3, 4, 5}}, {{2, 4, 5}}, {{3, 4, 5}} }      I was looking at `Select` and the others, but I can only come with ugly explicit loops that achieve this. I'm sure there's a nicer way of doing this. What could that be?
