I have Mathematica setup normally and connections work. However, when I want to use it to connect through my SSH tunnel program (Tunnelier), it throws the error > PacletSiteUpdate::err: An error occurred attempting to update paclet > information from site http://pacletserver.wolfram.com. Server returned > nothing (no headers, no data) meanwhile I get the following error message in Tunnelier: > (unrecognized proxy protocol) connection from 127.0.0.1 failed: Unsupported > client protocol; the client may be expecting a regular HTTP proxy I have left the HTTP, HTTPS and FTP proxy fields blank, and only filled in the SOCKS IP (127.0.0.1) and the port (9494). Firefox and IE can successfully connect via the same SSH tunnel. I have also tried it with a similarly working Putty tunnel, with it throwing the exact same error, just with no output from the Putty client.
