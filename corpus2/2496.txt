I am currently having problems with some floating points. I have a function, which gives as an intermediate result (for example)               -(10000. - 10000. a) E^(-16.4157 kp^2 x^0.277)/((-1. + a) a x^0.252525 xj^4.47047)      It gets passed through into another function, which will fill in the value `a = 1`. Then Mathematica reacts with a `1/Sqrt[0]` error. However, as you can see, the factor `(10000. - 10000. a)` should cancel with the factor `(-1.+ a)` in the denominator to give 10000, the result is thus well-defined. Do you have any idea how to let Mathematica cancel these factors out? I have tried `Simplify` and `FullSimplify` with `Assumptions -> a!=1` but it doesn't work. I cannot change much to the function itself, as it is an intermediate result (and it is just an example for this post; other intermediate results also occur, sometimes with the same problem, sometimes they work fine).
