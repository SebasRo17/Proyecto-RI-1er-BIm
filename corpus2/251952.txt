I am currently developing a web-application that is to present data stored in a database. For the presentation there is a request for both presenting this in table format and graph format. The table format is straight-forward, simply output the data and voila! However, for the graph format it has proved a little more difficult. I have been reviewing a number of different libraries for visualizing data and it seems that there are quite a few that share licensing agreements; free for non-profit projects or non-commercial use. Now, if I was to create something for a company that later was to sell this, I can clearly distinguish that this is considered to be commercial use. But if I am working for an organization (not a non-profit) on a project that is to be used solely for internal purposes, it won't get anywhere near a customer, is this considered to be a non-profit project? **EDIT:** An example of such a license is Creative Commons Attribution- NonCommercial 3.0.
