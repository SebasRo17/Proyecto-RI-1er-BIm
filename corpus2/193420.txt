Say we have some thread that wants to check when another thread is finished its task. I have read that we should call a wait() type function that will make this thread wait until it receives a notification that the other thread is finished. And that this is good because it means we aren't performing expensive polling. But isn't polling happening internally at a lower level anyway? I.e. if we make the thread wait() isn't the kernal performing polling anyway to check when the other thread is finished so that it can then notify the first thread? I presume I a missing out on something here, can someone enlighten me?
