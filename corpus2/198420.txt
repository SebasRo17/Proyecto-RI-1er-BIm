I need help with coding something. I'm trying to design a system that will allow users to setup rules for the system to process (similar to email processing rules, in a way). When I receive a chunk of data (in this case, it is a object that has properties with values related to the client system's hostname, OS version, etc.) I want the user to be able to create a criteria like "when the hostname equals 'somehost' or the OS version is greater than 6, etc. The table I have so far has a record ID, a column for holding the name of the value I'm checking (like the property name, e.g. object.Hostname stores as "Hostname"), a two character code for the operator (EQ, NE, GT, etc), the value to compare against and a foreign key value. I don't have a warm fuzzy about it, though. Am I going down the right path? I wanted the matching to be flexible. I'm visualizing putting the class properties in a dropdown so that the user can select the property, type in a search value and select the criteria. Thoughts? Thanks!
