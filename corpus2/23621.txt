I'm trying to create a chart that has both a line and a bar chart representation of an expression. Because I'm using the same expression twice, I expect the line and the bar chart to match, but they are slightly off.               c = Plot[1000 (1 + 0.12/4)^(4 x), {x, 0, 12},        PlotRange -> {{0, 12}, {0, 7000}}]     d = BarChart[Table[1000 (1 + 0.12/4)^(4 x), {x, 0, 12, 1}]]     Show[c, d]      I can't figure out why this would be. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
