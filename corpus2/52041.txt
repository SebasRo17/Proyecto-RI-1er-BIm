I am using Mathematica 9 on a university computer. I am trying to use the basic commands for parallel evaluation. ProcessorCount evaluates to 4, but commands such as ParallelMap simply evaluate sequentially. MaxLicenseProcesses evaluates to infinity. MaxLicenseSubprocesses evaluates to 1. Under Evaluation>>"Parallel Kernel Configuration", there is a checkbox "Limit by license availability (1)". Checking or unchecking appears to change the number of configured kernels between 0 and 4. What does this mean? Does the university license make parallel computations impossible? Why is this even a checkbox if it's a license restriction?
