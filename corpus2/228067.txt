I am new to MVVM pattern I have a window which has 3 text boxes namely Name,Address,Description ,a save button and a listview which displays the above fields Name,Address,Description respectively .When the save button is clicked I want to save the fields into database as well as show the record in the listview as well. Where do I put INotifyPropertyChanged interface Model or in ViewModel or in both place?
