For my blog script I have a usergroup and permission system set up. Each user is assigned to a usergroup and I have a long list of permission settings. Both are stored in a MySQL database. At the moment I perform around 10 permission queries for each page, for various content management functions. Coupled with another 20 or so queries for general blog use, the number of queries is building up. Would it be more efficient to instead perform one query at the start of the script to retrieve all permission settings into an array, and then have all functions compare values in the array instead of checking the database?
