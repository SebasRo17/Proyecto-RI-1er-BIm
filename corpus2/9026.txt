I'm a newbie in Mathematica. I'm trying to solve for two functions (best- response functions in a simple game), and then to plot the functions on the same graph. One function is p1 = resp1(p2) and the other is p2 = resp2(p1). I'd like to plot them both such that p1 is the x-axis and p2 is on the y-axis. The goal is that I'd like to be able to alter the form of q1 and q2 and easily see how the shape of the best-responses functions change and how many equilibria exist (the intersections of the best responses).               q1 = A - a*p1 + c*CDF[GammaDistribution[\[Alpha], \[Beta]], p2];     q2 = B - b*p2 + c*CDF[GammaDistribution[\[Alpha], \[Beta]], p1];     r1 = (p1 - mc)*q1;     r2 = (p2 - mc)*q2;     BR1t = FullSimplify[Solve[ D[r1, p1] == 0, p1, Reals],Assumptions -> {p2 > 0, p1 > 0}];     BR2t = FullSimplify[Solve[ D[r2, p2] == 0, p2, Reals],Assumptions -> {p1 > 0, p2 > 0}];     A = 100; B = 100; a = 1;  b = 1; c = 30; mc = 1;     \[Alpha]= 4; \[Beta] = 2;      resp1 = p1 /. First[BR1t]     resp2 = p2 /. First[BR2t]          g1 = Plot[resp1, {p2, 1, 100}]     g2 = Plot[resp2, {p1, 1, 100}]      I'm not sure what comes next in terms of creating the single plot.... any help would be appreciated. Thank you.
