Both languages have the same syntax. Why does C have the weird `*` character that denotes pointers (which is some kind of memory address of the variable contents?), when PHP doesn't have it and you can do pretty much the same things in PHP that you can do in C, without pointers? I guess the PHP compiler handles this internally, why doesn't C do the same? Doesn't this add unneeded complexity in C? For example I don't understand them :)
