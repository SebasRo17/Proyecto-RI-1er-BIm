Here's a simplified form of a function I would like to compile, but it produces errors               DataType = Compile[{{Inputdata, _Real, 1}}, Module[{CIEL, CIEa, CIEb},         dim = Dimensions@Inputdata;         If[dim[[1]] > 3,          {CIEL, CIEa, CIEb} = Inputdata             ]         ],        CompilationTarget -> "C"        ];      The error _Mathematica_ produces is: > Compile::extscalar: `dim=Dimensions[Inputdata]` cannot be compiled and will > be evaluated externally. The result is assumed to be of type Void. >> Is there a workaround to allow these types of functions to compile for conditionals that depend on the dimensions of a list?
