Please consider the following list `data`. I was trying to accumulate `data` until the result turns positive the first time and finally found an approach. Maybe it's useful to others and maybe there are other (more efficient) approaches:               data={-1050, 50, 1001, 1950, 1950, 1950, 525, 0};      The same what `Accumulate` does can be done by `FoldList`:               Rest@FoldList[Plus, 0, data] == Rest@FoldList[#1 + #2 &, 0, data] == Accumulate@data     (*True*)      Now, one can add constraints to `FoldList`. For my problem I had to write:               Rest[FoldList[If[#1 + #2 < #2, #1 + #2, #2] &, 0, #]]&@data     (*{-1050, -1000, 1, 1950, 1950, 1950, 525, 0}*)      **Question** How can this be improved, either in terms of speed or elegance?
