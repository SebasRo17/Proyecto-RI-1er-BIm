Look at following pic ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cEceo.gif) There are five points, I can generate the following point pairs               In:= tt=Subsets[{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {2}]          Out:= {{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {1, 5}, {2, 3}, {2, 4}, {2, 5}, {3,        4}, {3, 5}, {4, 5}}      But if I define mirror symmetry equivalence between point pairs. For example {1,2} equals {4,5}   {1,3} equals {3,5}   {1,4} equals {2,5}   {2,3} equals {3,4}   .....etc Then how to select half of the symmetric point pair from tt and keep only half of the original set. And in this case, I want keep left part, That is keep {{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {1, 5}, {2, 3}, {2, 4}}
