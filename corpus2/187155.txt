I would like to develop a bit of functionality for a web site that involves a bit of 3D - the user can move around objects, rotate them and texture them. So far I've looked into:   * WebGL (in particular three.js) and it looks great, but it's not supported in IE nor IOS.   * IOS supports the `<canvas>` tag, but only 2d. It looks like three.js has an unsupported hack to make a 3d thing use the 2d canvas instead without textures, but this looks like a hack.   * I also considered resorting to Flash which works on most browsers, but that won't work on IOS.  What's my best option for doing 3d web graphics on the vast array of browsers and interfaces? At the moment I'm thinking WebGL for web (and ask people to use chrome or firefox, and take the hit on IE) and then maybe write a native app for IOS, but I am not sure if there are better alternatives available that I don't know of.
