I'm interested in developing GUI-based Windows applications in C++, but I'm not sure how it's done in professional or large-scale settings. It seems it would take a lot of development time to describe all the elements (e.g., dimensions and such) within code. Presumably it's not all done visually, right? How is it normally done? What methods are used to prevent a lot of time wasted on defining each and every property a UI control might have?
