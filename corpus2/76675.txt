As a Java programmer, I'm looking to learn either C or C++ by writing a database manager. Obviously, Java shares many idioms with C and C++, but yet both bring vastly different program design challenges. I'm looking to for a way to make this exercise as educational as possible. **What aspects of taking on this project in C or C++ can help me make a decision about which approach will teach me the most, as a Java programmer?** One particular target of this exercise would be at least a subset of the spatial extensions in PostgreSQL. Obvious issues to consider would be goodness of fit of C vs. C++ for:   * modeling concepts of databases in general.   * modeling spatial modeling in particular Another major point would be the degree of expected difference from Java. Would a good, idiomatic design in C++ be enough different from a design in Java to teach new, different concepts, or would it mostly be the same concepts with slightly different syntax? Would a good design in C contain more concepts that were new or different than one in C++?
