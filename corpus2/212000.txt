This may be a question more suited some Programming Meta Discussions. I was trying to delve deeper into the inner plugin management feature for QT Creator 2.x IDE provided by Digia Inc. So I effectively downloaded the source code for QT Creator and built it to debug how this functionality is implemented. Hence I used an IDE to debug the same IDE. So my question is are there any pit-falls while doing so? Is it recommended that in such a scenario it's better to use two different IDEs (e.g. using Visual Studio to build QT Creator).
