This is pretty much a "software process" question: When your organization is split into two teams: software team and database engineering team (the organization is in ETL/BI/Data mining delivering terabyte sized reports and database dumps for research organization), What are the most common issues in coordination between such two teams? and how do you work around them? Precisely how much authority does a DBA have in dictating design versus a Software Engineer?
