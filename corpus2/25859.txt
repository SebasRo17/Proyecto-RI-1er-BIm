I'm running _Mathematica_ 9.0.1 under Mac OSX. Not sure if this is a bug or whether I'm not supposed to apply a `GeometricTransformation` to a list containing graphic primitives and directives:               verts = {{0, 0}, {1, 0}, {Cos[60 Degree], Sin[60 Degree]}};     tri = {{PointSize[0.2], Point[verts]}, {Line[verts~Append~First@verts]}};      Translating purely in the vertical direction works how I expect it to:               Graphics[GeometricTransformation[tri, TranslationTransform[{0, #}] & /@ Range[0, 2]]]      ![vertical translation](http://i.stack.imgur.com/og8cq.png)               Graphics[GeometricTransformation[tri, TranslationTransform[{#, 0}] & /@ Range[0, 2]]]      However, if the translation has a horizontal component, then the point size gets messed up, in the sense that it's not compensating the size of the points with respect to the size of the graphic in the notebook: ![horizontal translation](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zWoAw.png) Is this a bug?
