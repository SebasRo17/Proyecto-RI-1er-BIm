I am trying to represent the position of an object under freefall, but am completely lost. Here is my attempt so far:               time = 0;     increment = 10;     distance := 0 - time*(time*increment);           {Dynamic[Refresh[{time++ 1, ClockGauge[DateList[]]}, UpdateInterval -> 1]],      Dynamic @ distance,       Dynamic @ Framed[Graphics[Disk[{0, distance}, 10],                                 PlotRange -> {{-2, 2}, {1, -1000}}]]}      Which results in: > ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2cA7R.png) The bar on the left should represent the position of the object under freefall, and the number to the right of the bar should represent its _y_ coordinate. **However this clearly accelerates way too fast way too soon**. Basically the main problem here is that I don't know how to translate the '10m per second per second' into a language that _Mathematica_ can understand. Could someone help me with what formula to use?
