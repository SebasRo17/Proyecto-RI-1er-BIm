I am looking at this question primarily from a career point of view, so I hope you answer it accordingly. I am fairly proficient with Python, can write C++ and I am a final year student of computer science engineering I am looking to learn Haskell because I have heard a lot about it. My question is: apart from learning it because of all the good I have heard about it, is it any good for my career? Is it used in the industry? I am curious to learn it but unless it helps me somehow in my career, I am not willing to make that change at this stage. Looking for some personal experiences here. Thanks!
