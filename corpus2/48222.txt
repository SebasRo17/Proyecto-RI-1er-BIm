I was very pleased to discover that _Mathematica_ could do this summation and produce a symbolic result.               s1 =        1/nn Sum[Cos[2 π a (n - 1)] E^(-I (n - 1) (s - 1)/nn), {n, nn}] // Simplify      The answer is long but very useful for me. I also discovered that Mathematica could do some variants of this sum. However, _Mathematica_ cannot do this summation.               s2 =        1/nn Sum[              Cos[2 π ((a - ϵ) (n - 1) + ϵ/(nn - 1) (n - 1)^2)] E^(-I (n - 1) (s - 1)/nn),               {n, nn}]      This leads to the big question what summations can Mathematica do? Help suggest that "Sum can do essentially all sums that are given in standard books of tables". Is my sum s2 in some way pathological that it cannot be done? My second question is thus can my second sum be coerced into a solution? These sums come from Fourier analysis, where it is useful to have a symbolic expression for results that are often calculated numerically using the discrete Fourier transform (`Fourier` in _Mathematica_ ). In order to investigate my sum, I looked at the continuous Fourier transform in which time is equal to n -1 and frequency is (s - 1)/nn. The continuous Fourier transform is given by the integral               1/t2 Integrate[Cos[2 π ( (a - ϵ) t + ϵ/t2 t^2)] E^(-I 2 π f t), {t, 0, t2}]      _Mathematica_ can do this integral which comes out in terms of error functions. However, I can't see how to use this to help get the symbolic solution to the sum s2. In summary what summations can _Mathematica_ do? Is there any hope for getting an closed-form solution for my second sum?
