I am building a model for which the user can enter parameter values. I would like to create a "graphical layout" of the model in which I display several InputField-s to enter the numerical parameters, arranged to be shown at the appropriate x-y-locations in my "graphical layout". However, InputFields appear to become non-editable when part of a Graphics object. For example, the following works (of course):               InputField[Dynamic[x]]      However, the next command creates an InputField that cannot be accessed, although the dynamic value still correctly updates when you change the InputField created by the previous command:               Graphics[Inset[InputField[Dynamic[x]]]]      How can I place InputFields at specific coordinates in (or on top of) a Graphics?
