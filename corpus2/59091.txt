A cleaner copy can be obtained from a blurry original by using the `level adjustment` in _Photoshop_ before going for a better OCR. The picture below shows an example. My code below failed to do so. What is the appropriate way to get the same job done in Mathematica? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dAwXm.jpg)                im = Import ["http://i.stack.imgur.com/BO30x.jpg"];      Manipulate[      adjIm = Dilation[Erosion[Sharpen[im, a], b], c],      Grid[{        {         Control[{{a, 0, "Sharpen"}, 0, 10, Appearance -> "Labeled"} ],         Control[{{b, -1, "Erosion"}, -2, 2, Appearance -> "Labeled"}  ],         },        {         Control[{{c, -1, "Dilation"}, -2, 2, Appearance -> "Labeled"} ],         Button["OCR", Print[TextRecognize@adjIm]]         }        }]      ]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/JE6o9.jpg)
