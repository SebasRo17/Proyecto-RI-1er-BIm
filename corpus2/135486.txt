After having worked with a Microsoft stack - VB.Net, ASP.Net, SQL Server - for the past 10 years, we are now faced with having to develop an application for both Windows and Mac environments. It has been suggested that MySQL, for the database, is available on both platforms. I've been under the impression that MySQL is an open source project, but has recently been bought? / taken over? by Oracle. The MySQL web site seems to indicate that unless it is being used in another open source project, there are licencing fees to be paid, and the fees are in the order of other database costs - eg. SQL Server, Filemaker. Somebody has suggested that MySQL is free to use in a LAMP environment (but what about for a Windows Server?). Can somebody with deployed MySQL experience confirm or explain this, along with any other gotchas that might be pertinent?
