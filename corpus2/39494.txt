Here is my code:               vslA = RegionPlot[x > 0, {x, 0, 8}, {y, 0, 1},       AspectRatio -> Automatic, PlotStyle -> RGBColor[1, 1, .4]]     fslA = RegionPlot[x > 0, {x, 8, 14}, {y, 0, 1},       AspectRatio -> Automatic, PlotStyle -> RGBColor[0.2, 0.8, .4]]     Show[fslA, vslA, AxesOrigin -> {0, 0}]      But unfortunately, instead of a long rectangle with about 57% area of one color and 43% area of a different color, I am getting this graphic: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2NxG0.jpg) Why is this happening and how can I fix this? I plan to create a big graphic by specifying coordinates of every little piece and I have worked out the coordinates just so the shapes and positions come out exactly where I want them but already just the first piece has me stumped.
