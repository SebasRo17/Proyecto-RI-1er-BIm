How would you store text information - in a relational database or maybe using NoSQL? The problem is that the text should be divided into various parts, each of which satisfies to some requirement, e.g. the same text should be contained in several "places". Is there another way to organize this? I have several books (each of them about 600 pages), which should be stored in a database, but there will be a mechanism which should sort the content of the books by some criteria. The criteria are complex, so I wonder if it is becoming a big problem. Would it help to store the same text in various "tables", each of which would satisfy a concrete "condition" Do I need to save the same text in various "tables", each of which satisfies a specific set of criteria?
