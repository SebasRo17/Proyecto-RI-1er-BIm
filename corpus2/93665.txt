I was given a small project to complete over the weekend for an interview. Not a very difficult project at all. Fortunately, I was able to spend all my time designing, developing, and testing the application rather than having to research something I wasn't familiar with. After working out a couple of critical bugs, I am left wondering if I should add anything more to the assignment. Assume, at this point:   * everything is commented   * no bugs found   * any known exceptions are handled   * 8 hours remain in allotted time **So, is it better to go ahead and submit a bug-free, working assignment earlier than the deadline?** ...or ... **Take the fully allotted time to add a feature (obviously something simple like logging)?** ...or ... **Provide a list of TODOs that could improve flexibility, scalability, or general usability?** These would be improvements that simply could not be done within a day or could introduce too many issues to resolve in the time allotted. FWIW: the project consisted of creating a multi-threaded sort controller implementing 3 different sorting algorithms; results to be displayed on WinForms UI.
