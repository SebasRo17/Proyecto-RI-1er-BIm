I want to do some large data analysis, and i want to be able to import files in a fast way. I tried Import, but it is quite slow; ReadList takes half the time. This is the code I was using:               files = FileNames["Path\\*.dat"];     a = Table[Delete[Import[file, "Table", "HeaderLines" -> 38], {{-1}, {-2}}], {file,files}];      They are files with 38 header lines and 2 foot lines which i dont want. My question is how to import the same files using ReadList and ignoring those unwanted lines, or another approach to improve import performance.
