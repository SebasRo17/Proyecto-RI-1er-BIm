Consider a table in which a column represents a monetary value in some cases and a link to the value of another record in other cases so that we have the following:               TABLE 1     Id Product Composite     1  Apple   False     2  Orange  False     3  Pear    True          TABLE 2     Product  Date        Price      1        2010-01-01  0.45     2        2010-01-01  0.50     3        2010-01-01  1.00     1        2010-01-02  0.46     2        2010-01-02  0.49     3        2010-01-02  2.00      The tables above represent the fact that the price for an Apple and Orange are given on each date by the corresponding Price column in Table 2 so that the price of an Apple on 2010-01-01 is 0.45 and the price of an Orange is 0.50 on that same date, however, the price for a Pear on 2010-01-01 is 0.45 and the price for a pear is 0.49 the following day by allowing the Pear's price to be determined by the price of an Apple on the first day and the price of an Orange on the second day. Please indicate the pros and cons of this approach?
