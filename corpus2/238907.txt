I am working on a project where there will be plenty of static options being stored in the database. I looked at using Enums for this, but do not see how they could be useful. They do not create any kind of look-up table, just reference a number in the table which can be used in code as an enum option. The number is meaningless to anyone creating SSRS reports and if you need to add an extra option, you need to recompile. Is there a situation where these have a genuine purpose and are a better fit than an entity. Or are they generally a bad practice for the above reasons?
