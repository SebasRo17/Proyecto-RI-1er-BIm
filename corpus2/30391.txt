I'm using Mathematica to make a few 3d plots. ~~For the sake of generality, let's say they are unrelated to each other (so I can't imagine making a table out of them)~~. However, the machine I'm using has 4 cores and plotting (evaluating the function at different points can be done pretty much independently, so I should be able to parallelize my plots (or even a single plot for that matter). How can I do this? Ps: If the question is not clearly posed or more information is needed, let me know. Edit: @halirutan's answer corrects my mistake, which I've now struck off.
