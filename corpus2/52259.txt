I am trying to visualize 3D points with Plot3D using the option Epilog. If you check the options of Plot3D ( `Options[Plot3D]` ), it can be seen that Epilog is one of the options of Plot3D. But when implementing this option not result as expected. for example:                 data = Flatten[       Table[{i, j, i^2 + j^2}, {i, -2, 2, .5}, {j, -2, 2, .5}], 1];         Plot3D[Exp[-x^2 - y^2], {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2},           Epilog -> {PointSize[Large], Point[data]}, PlotRange -> All]      Of course there is another ways (like using `Show`), but the question is why Plot3D does not accept its own option?
