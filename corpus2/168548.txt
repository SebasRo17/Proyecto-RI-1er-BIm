I have written many codes using OOPS and I am still to understand when is a code good enough to be accepted by experts. The thought procedure of every man is different and so is the design. My question is should I do something in particular to design my programs in such a way that they are good enough to be accepted by people.   Other thing I have also read Head First Object Oriented Design but at last I feel that the way they design the problems is much different I would have designed them.
