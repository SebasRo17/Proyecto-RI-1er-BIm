I'm coming from the iOS side. I'm particularly interested in knowing if there are similar hurdles on the Android side on these points:   * developer fee -- do you have to pay $99 a year to build for android?   * provisioning devices - do you have to go through a complex provisioning/digital certificate/device-id routine to get the app you're developing on a device for testing?   * marketplace distribution - do you have to go through an approval process to get your app to users?   * payment - is it easy to get paid for your app? What is Amazon's cut? Thanks. I know I could probably find these answers scattered on the web, but it would sure save me time to just hear from an experienced Android dev.
