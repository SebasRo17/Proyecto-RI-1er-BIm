I plan to write an network application whose use steps is the following :   1. Connect to the server and choose a name (and enter your email "id")   2. The list of others "free" (not playing a game) players is shown to you : so you have to select one.   3. The server use the two players ip adress in order to connect them But I think I will be facing a great issue :   * how to handle dynamic ip adress carefully : can a dynamic ip adress change while the established connection is not yet finished ?   * if yes, how must I handle that, let's with Java 7 for example ?
