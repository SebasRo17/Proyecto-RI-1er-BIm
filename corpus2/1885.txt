As programmers I think we are the most inclined to use new technologies and things that are not so mainstream. I absolutely love OpenId's ability to log in with credentials you already have, but I always use a provider that I already use and that is the fastest to log in, like google. God knows I'd never used it if i had to type in the whole "https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id" I like to click on the google button and then just say yes (the first time, then its just clicking the button). Does any of you ever uses the Generic "Enter your own provider" OpenId? Do you think its worth to even offer it to more casual end users?
