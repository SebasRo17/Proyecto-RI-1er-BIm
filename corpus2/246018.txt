I'm making an iOS game. All developers need to determine whether their app uses cryptography or not. My game saves files in the Documents folder. They are .plist files representing dictionaries. They are encoded in base 64. From what I gather, encoding is not encrypting. So we're fine there. However, the _values_ inside the dictionary (after decoding) are a bit tricky. Suppose that your score is `250`. In the dictionary the value is a string like:               @2@5@0@      So for the game to read your score, it removes the `@` characters (and when saving the game, it puts them back). That's just an example. Does _that_ count as cryptography? **NOTE** : I'm not asking about Apple's policies. I mentioned it for context.
