I've been having trouble to make mathematica evaluate an integral without specifying the values of the limits of integration. I mean, if I write               Integrate[x,{x,x1,x2}]      Mathematica returns the correct answer: $\frac{(x2)^2-(x1)^2}{2}$. But If I write something like               Integrate[x^2/(1-x),{x,x1,x2}]      Mathematica just keeps the evaluation forever... Is there something that I can do to avoid this behaviour?
