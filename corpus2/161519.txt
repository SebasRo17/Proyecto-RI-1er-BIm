_My problem_ is the following; I need to get to know a totally new system, for example Wordpress, Drupal, or a framework like Symfony, or maybe a big forum system like PhpBB.   Let's suppose it has no documentation at all, but the code is good. _What I end up doing is_ that I start at `index.php` and click the first include, so this takes me to the next file. But then it requests another file and that file request another, so at the end I even forget where I started and have no clue which was the previous request. So _my question_ is, is there a good way to do this ? Like drawing a chart of the application flow or something. When I want to get to know a new system, at first I would like to get the " **big picture** " about what comes after what, and what files do what part of the system, what function get called when, things like these. Basically all I want to do is able to write an Application flow like this when I start with a new system. Is there a nice way tot do this without taking too much time and confusion?   Are there any software or debugging tools for this?   Are there any chart types for this situation which I can apply here?   Can you suggest small tricks or tips how you get to know big systems and what are you looking first without digging into the code too deeply wasting too much time on not-really-important-parts?
