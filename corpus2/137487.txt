I have a few project ideas that I'd like to deploy on GAE. I'm interested in developing a logging application for amateur radio contacts, shortwave, and utility monitoring. More complex projects include satellite tracking, audio streaming from multiple radios, and radio remote control including transmitting and receiving. I'm taking Java and Python languages through my local junior college, so I don't know which language is suitable for these projects. What are the strengths and weaknesses of each language for developing on GAE specifically, especially audio and number crunching for the tracking app? I'm not asking for a general comparison between the two languages, only as they are used on GAE. The end result is to tie them into my website which is hosted on Google, with some of the apps publicly available, some privately available to friends. If it helps, I have the most experience with Perl, bash, followed by C.
