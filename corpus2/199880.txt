_**Assumption:_**   Post that I am applying for: _Software developer_   Experience in years: _5_ _**Background:_** > I have been working with a robotics company and I am not a robotics person. > I haven't handled a "project" by myself yet. So, the kind of work that I > have handled so far are "small" C++ programming related stuffs in the > projects. > > _Tiny examples:_   >  1\. Someone has already made classes and written socket programming for > this software X with UDP. My job was to add the TCP code using Qt API.   >  2\. I had to add a "callback" functionality (using C++ templates) somewhere > in the project for some reason. > > _Another somewhat bigger example:_   >  I had to set up a functionality of message exchanging between two > components (according to a standard protocol) in C++. Both these example tasks are related to the proprietary software of this company. _**What kind of questions (in which depth) should I expect the interviewer to ask regarding these example tasks?_**
