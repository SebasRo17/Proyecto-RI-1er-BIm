Let's say we have an abstract class and let this class has only abstract methods. Is this abstract class different from an interface that has same methods only? What I am looking to know is if there are any differences both philosophically, objectively and in the underlying programming language implementation between an Abstract Class with only abstract members and an equivalent Interface?
