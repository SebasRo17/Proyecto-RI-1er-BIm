Given an expression, such as `int x = y + 5`, we'd call `int x` the `left-hand side` (or `LHS`), and `y + 5` the `right-hand side` (or `RHS`). The whole expression is called, of course, an `expression` (or `equation`), but is there a generic term for a "side" of an expression? `LHS` and `RHS` don't quite cut it when it comes to an expression such as `int x = y = 5` (gloss over the fact here that such assignments are generally bad practice!). I'm toying with the term `component` to describe any "side", but was interested to see if there was a formal standard term already in use. Wikipedia only has "Sides of an equation", any better suggestions?
