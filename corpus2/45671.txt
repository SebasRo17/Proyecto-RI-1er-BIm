In a week I will start a new job at a manufacturing company managing the development of a new eCommerce site. The company scores about a 3 on the "Joel" test. I will inherit 3 programmers who developed the company web site and do general IT programming. I have the grey hair and credentials to have their initial respect but I'm an engineer, not a manager. I'm looking for practical advise - particularly for the first 90 days - on how to establish myself, keep the team together, and move forward.
