I am using a tree view in c# and i am creating custom icons for the nodes. Let say this is my hierarchy with a node that satisfies a certain condition:               Root1     |_Ax      |_Bx1      |_Bx2       |_Cx1       |_Cx2(condition true)      |_Bx3      |_Bx4     |_Ay      |_By1      |_By2       |_Cy1      when the tree it's collapsed I don't know if some inner child satisfies that particular condition so I want to display an icon on the topmost un-expanded parent. For example let say that the tree it's completely collapsed I would like this behaviour : 1) the first root will be like this :               Root1(!)      2) I expand Root1 and i see there is something the children of Ax :               Root1     |_Ax(!)     |_Ay      3) I expand Ax :               Root1     |_Ax      |_Bx1      |_Bx2(!)      |_Bx3      |_Bx4     |_Ay      4) Last I expand Bx2 to find the target node Cx2:               Root1     |_Ax      |_Bx1      |_Bx2       |_Cx1       |_Cx2(condition true)      |_Bx3      |_Bx4     |_Ay      The symbol **(!)** appears only on the topmost un-expanded parent and disappears once the node is expanded indicating a path to locate the target node Cx2. But I would like some idea on how to add the node indicator (!) in an efficient fashion. I need to do this in 2 steps \- tree creation \- node expanded In the first case as soon as I create the node Cx2 and I notice it satisfies that particular condition I need to put the indicator on the topmost unexpanded parent node. In the second case I need to change the indicator location dynamically when the node it`s expanded. What is the most efficient way to do that ?
