Let's say I have five four dimensional vectors $p_i^\mu=(p_i^1,p_i^2,p_i^3,p_i^4)$ with $i=1,2,3,4,5$. Now, I want to fill the entries of these vectors ($4\cdot5=20$ in total) with some numbers, but such that the resulting vectors satisfy the following $9$ constraints: $$(p_i^1)^2-(p_i^2)^2-(p_i^3)^2-(p_i^4)^2=0~~~\text{for each }i\in\{1,2,3,4,5\}$$ $$p_1^\mu+p_2^\mu+p_3^\mu+p_4^\mu+p_5^\mu=0~~~\text{for each }\mu\in\{1,2,3,4\}$$ What is a convenient way to create such constrained vectors in _Mathematica_? Maybe there is a built in function that does just that?
