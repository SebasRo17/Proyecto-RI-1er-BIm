Consider the following code:               m = 4;     n = 3;     TraditionalForm[Sum[(-1)^(i + 1) * Binomial[n, i] * x^(m * i), {i, 0, n}]] ==      TraditionalForm[Collect[Sum[(-1)^(j + 1) * Binomial[n, j] * x^j, {j, 0, n}] *      Sum[Subscript[a, i] * x^i, {i, 0, n * (m - 1)}], x]]      ![output](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DyBad.jpg) From this I would like to match the coefficients in each term in the two polynomials and thereby get n*m+1 equations and solve them for the n*(m-1)+1 `a_i`'s. **Update** After using bill s's answer, I get the following:               Solve[CoefficientList[        FullSimplify[         Sum[(-1)^(i + 1)*Binomial[n, i]*x^(m*i), {i, 0, n}] -           Sum[(-1)^(j + 1)*Binomial[n, j]*x^j, {j, 0, n}]*           Sum[a[i]*x^i, {i, 0, n*(m - 1)}]], x] == 0,       Table[a[i], {i, 0, n*(m - 1)}]]      ![output2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xUAq9.jpg) Now, I would like to write out the equation but the following attempt fails:               Sum[a[i - n]*x^i, {i, n, n*m}]      ![output3](http://i.stack.imgur.com/a3rGk.jpg) Only the `a[i]`s are printed, not the values of the, which have been computed with the previous chunk of code.
