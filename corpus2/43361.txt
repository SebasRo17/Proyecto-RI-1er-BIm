Almost as a follow on from this old question, I am having similar problems again, with slight difference, that if the values are small enough, a completely blank plot is produced.               ξ[z_] := ((z - 1) Gamma[z/2 + 1] Zeta[z])/Sqrt[π^z]          ContourPlot[{Im[ξ[σ + b I]], Re[ξ[σ + b I]]}, {σ, -2, 3}, {b, 100, 120},                 PlotPoints -> 500]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Bnsno.gif) Even with `PlotPoints->500` there are still breaks in the plot. I know I am dealing with very small numbers here, but is there anything I can do to create a clean plot? The plot above is not too bad, but I would really like to look at plots for values of `{b,7000,7010}` - but it just produces a blank plot above `1000`. Is there anything I can to to avoid this? # Update Have tried `Exclusions->None` but creates a plot that is just wrong! ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QPcuL.gif)
