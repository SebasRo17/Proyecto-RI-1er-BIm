When numerically calculating a double integral using `NIntegrate` over an infinite domain (with all options at their default), _Mathematica_ 7 calculates my integral with some comments about slow convergence, but _Mathematica_ 9 aborts calculating with a long message which starts with > SystemException["MemoryAllocationFailure" ... What do I have to do to make the calculation in _Mathematica_ 9 (Linux)?
