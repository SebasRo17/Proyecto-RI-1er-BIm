My team is looking to automate installation/deployment of all of our development tools. The main driver for this is to ensure that everyone in the team has a consistent development environment setup and to also allow a new recruit to get up and running easily. By development environment I mean tools like SCM, toolchains, IDEs etc. and by consistent I mean everyone using the same version of compiler to build code (this is very important!). Here are a few of our requirements â€“   * Allow unattended (silent) install of our entire dev setup by running a single script   * Ability to be versioned   * Ability to deploy selective updates (new versions) for specific tools   * Ability to report which tools are installed and their specific version numbers   * Must work on Windows (Linux would be a bonus)   * Must be easy to maintain What are some of the tools that you've used to automate such a task?
