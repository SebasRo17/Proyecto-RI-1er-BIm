I'm trying to follow the MVVM pattern in a reporting / statistics application that I'm making in C# / WPF. I have made many model classes to hold properties as a starting point. Some of these models are made to encapsulate different statistics so that I can present data that can be cross refrenced. I'm thinking the next step is to create a data access layer with classes and methods to connect to a database and grab the values to populate these models. I was thinking of creating a connection and query passing class. Then other classes for each specific set of data that I will need for the models. (constructing queries to pass) From what I understand I will be calling these data access layer methods from the view model to populate instances of my models. Which I will present with the view. Is my approach in theory the correct standard way to approach this problem? Any suggestions? Or Reference Material?
