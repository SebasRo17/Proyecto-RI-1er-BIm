I have two lists `A` and `B`, each with 99 real numbers. I want to form a list, `C`, whose elements are functions (`F[]`) of `A` and `B`, and also previous elements of `C` itself.               C ={F[A1/B1], F[A2/(B2-A1/C1)], F[A3/(B3-A1/C1-A2/C2)], ..., F[A99/(B99-A1/C1...-A98/C98.)]}      where the integers after `A`, `B`, and `C`, are element indices. I appreciate any tips on how to code this in _Mathematica_.
