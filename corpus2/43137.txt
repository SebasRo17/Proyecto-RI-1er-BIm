I do not understand this behavior:               method[args_] :=         (* forget the context path *)         Block[{$ContextPath},                 (* should given nothing, right? *)              Print["cpath=", $ContextPath];                 ...      but when evaluated it gives the full context path (i.e. it does not forgets it). Why is that? This is against everything I (seem to) know about the `Block` function.
