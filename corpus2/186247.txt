I have filled that standard form where you list your previous inventions before starting your new job so the employer is legally aware you have the copyright over them. But if I want to use this invention (software code / framework) in my new job, would they have any copyright claims on it if for example I change / improve something on my code while working for them? I have heard something like a shared ownership. Something like: you would own what was done before and employer would own any improvements you did on it while employed. That kind of sucks and take away any incentive you would have to do improvements on your product since _once improved, the improvement is gone_. :( Has anyone gone through this situation before and could share some ideas so I can protect my code?
