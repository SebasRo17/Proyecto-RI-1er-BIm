What's the best approach to creating documentation (displaying the function prototype if you will) for functions that take a variety of different forms in terms of parameters. Let's say there are 10 different choices:               param(name);     param(name, type);     param(name, options);     param(name, type, options);     param(name, fn);     param(name, type, fn);     param(name, options, fn);     param(name, type, options, fn);     param(options);     param(options, fn);      How would one write a function prototype (documentation) for these types of methods (even ones that don't come to this extreme)? Some projects use function "overloading" in the documentation:               .on(event, fn, [capture])     .on(event, selector, fn, [capture])      But would the length be outweighed by the clarity or flexibility?
