I have to continue feature development, issue fixing of a halfway completed code base. There is a no documentation, all developers had left the company. The technology stack is somewhat familiar to me (Spring, Hibernate, Web Services (Rest, SOAP), MySQL). Also there are non descriptive JIRA items that the team had worked over 3 years. Seems code has implemented in consistent way like layering, ant file per project, DAO classes. I would like to get feedback from all our experts. What should be the approach to get familiar with the project? Do you recommend to use profilers, bug track tools like Sonar to get some hints? Any other approach I can try out?
