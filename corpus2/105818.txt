IntelliJ does some odd formatting with Javascript code and I am trying to figure out how to get it to stop formatting this way. Whenever I chain jQuery functions together, it over indents the auto created code such as this:               $('#something').focus(function() {         /* Do some stuff */     }).blur(function() {             /* this is where the cursor and closing braces end up */             })      I want it to look like this:               $('#something').focus(function() {         /* Do some stuff */     }).blur(function() {         /* cursor and closing braces indented normally */     });      How do I change this?
