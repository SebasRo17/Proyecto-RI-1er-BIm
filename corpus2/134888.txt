I have no previous experience on creating a project for a seller which will use barcode reader. I am trying to put together a small project but I cannot figure out how the pieces should glue together. I will create a sample with Motorola Scanner SDK to read barcodes and from that point, I have couple of questions:   * How UPC barcodes work in general? AFAIK, a barcode stores the manufacturer and product info but no price data.   * Should I store price information inside a database which corresponds to barcode data? I would really appreciate if you can guide me here.
