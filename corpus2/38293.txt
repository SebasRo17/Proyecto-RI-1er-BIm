So, I am trying to understand the effect of sawtooth waveform on a mechanical system model. For example, a system of a plate and a box on it. And then we try to oscillate the plate. In order to do that, I need to calculate the inertial force caused by the sawtooth waveform. And to find the inertial force, I need to calculate second derivative of sawtooth waveform. But because, you know, sawtooth waveform is not differentiable everywhere, I think make an approximation by using a smooth sawtooth waveform is enough. 'Smooth' here, I mean substitute upper tip and bottom tip of the sawtooth waveform into a circular curve of a certain radius. So in short, my question is: How to make sawtooth wavefrom with a dull tip with Mathematica? Here, although I said sawtooth, it would be better if applicable to any triangle waveform. **EDIT:** What if my triangle waveform is made from a completely arbitrary piecewise function such as below               f = Piecewise[{{10 Mod[x, 1], 0 <= Mod[x, 1] < 0.1},       {-(10/9) Mod[x, 1] + (10/9), 0.1 <= Mod[x, 1] < 1}}];     Plot[Evaluate[f], {x, -3, 3}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FbFAt.jpg) Is it still possible?
