When downloading various software packages, and executables for Windows, I always see two different types of executables to download. One just says `...32-bit` and the other always says `...amd64`. I know this has nothing to do with AMD, but it is referring to 64-bit operating systems, so why is this still a norm? Even large companies like Google and Ubuntu have packages set up like this. Thanks for any insight! ~Carpetfizz
