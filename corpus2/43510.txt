I'm trying to work with complexes and I want _Mathematica_ to know that all variables are real unless I explicitly assigned the variable with an `I` so I wrote:               $Assumptions = Except[I,_] âˆˆ Reals      It worked fine for simple expressions               f = Exp[-I*a] * a + Exp[-I*b]     Simplify[Conjugate[f]]      > Exp[I*a] * a + Exp[I*b] but for a more complex expression:               g = Exp[-I*a] * a + Exp[-I*b] * b     Simplify[Conjugate[g]]      > Exp[-I*a] * a + Exp[-I*b] * b which is wrong. What can I do about it?
