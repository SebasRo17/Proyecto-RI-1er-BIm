Red Hat's Ceylon language has some interesting improvements over Java:   * The overall vision: learn from Java's mistakes, keep the good, ditch the bad   * The focus on readability and ease of learning/use   * Static Typing (find errors at compile time, not run time)   * No “special” types, everything is an object   * Named and Optional parameters (C# 4.0)   * Nullable types (C# 2.0)   * No need for explicit getter/setters until you are ready for them (C# 3.0)   * Type inference via the "local" keyword (C# 3.0 "var")   * Sequences (arrays) and their accompanying syntactic sugariness (C# 3.0)   * Straight-forward implementation of higher-order functions I don't know Scala but have heard it offers some similar advantages over Java. How would Scala compare to Ceylon in this respect?
