I wish to project a collection from one type (`Something`) to another type (`SomethingElse`). Yes, this is a very open-eneded question, but which of the two options below do you prefer? **Creating a new instance using`new`:**               var result = query.Select(something => new SomethingElse(something));      **Using a factory:**               var result = query.Select(something => SomethingElse.FromSomething(something));      When I think of a projection, I generally think of it as a _conversion_. Using `new` gives me this idea that I'm creating new objects during a conversion, which doesn't feel right. Semantically, `SomethingElse.FromSomething()` most definitely fits better. Although, the second option does require addition code to setup a factory, which could become unnecessarily compulsive.
