I'm in a Scrum environment, and we get feedback from the PO that all stories should be closed that are currently in progress before bringing in more stories. The goal is reducing WIP and getting stories accepted, which is a good goal. But would it really be wise to have, for instance, a DBA run a manual test script in order to close a particular story, when the part timer who does various "grunt" tasks will be available tomorrow? It seems this is the direction our PO wants to head in, but seems inefficient to me. What happens is that tomorrow the part timer is available, but there are no tasks for them, the only outstanding ones being "above their pay grade". So it seems like a tension between reducing WIP and yet having people work on things that "make sense". Do you find its better for the team to have anyone work on any task? Or do you keep work open longer in order to have certain people do what they do best?
