I have created a package following the tutorial in _Mathematica_ 8 virtual book. However this tutorial is quite, let's call it, "short". I have a `TestPackage.m` file:               BeginPackage["TestPackage`"];     TestPackage::usage = "Test package"          Begin["`Private`"]     TestPackage[1] := {1}       (*private functions and stuff*)     Mesg := Print["Private function of TestPackage"]     End[]          TestPackage` f[x_] := Module[{a = 3, b = 3}, Mesg; a x^b]          EndPackage[]      and a file `UseTestPackage.nb` that uses the package:               ClearAll["Global`*"]     dir = "C:/...and so on"     Get["TestPackage`", Path -> dir]          f[2] (*this should give an output defined in TestPackage.m, but it doesn't*)          $ContextPath          (* {"PacletManager`", "WebServices`", "System`", "Global`"}*)     (*seems it didn't read the m file*)      but nothing happens. No symbols of functions are exported, despite the fact that `Get[]` doesn't throw an error. How do I make it work?
