I forgot to write `return 'a';` in function and `return 0;` in main function but its works fine in Code::Blocks.               #include <iostream>          using namespace std;          char show()     {          cout<<"this is show function"<<endl;     }          int main()     {         show();     }      i am using Code::Blocks 10.05 in Ubuntu 12.04. Why this happen and why does the same thing cause an error in TURBO C++?
