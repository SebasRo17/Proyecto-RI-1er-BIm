For an arbitrary function $f(x,y)$ I am defining functions `LogMT1` and `LogMT2` as follows,                Nn = 5;            LogMT1 = Sum [ f[x^n, y^n]/(n*(1 - x^(2*n))), {n, 1 , Nn}];             LogMT2 =Sum[Log[(1 + x^n)/((1 - x^(n/2)*y^(n/2))*(1 - x^(n/2)*y^(-n/2)))], {n, 1 , Nn}];      Now I want to know the power series expansion of both these functions LogMT1 and LogMT2 as a power series in x - and I expect them to come as $\sqrt{x}$, $x$, $x\sqrt{x}$, $x^2$ and so on and each of them should be multiplied by a function of $y$ as a coefficient.   * I want to know how this can be done?  (..of course my eventual goal is to be able to determine $f(x,y)$ such that `LogMT1 = LogMT2` for arbitrarily large values of $Nn$ and it would be great if someone can suggest a Mathematica way of being able to do that...) * * * Here is a function $f$ which seems to solve the above equation for arbitrarily large values of $Nn$ to arbitrarily large values of powers of $x$ as far as one can see this way, (..the point is that I don't know how this function $f$ can be derived..)                  $Assumptions = y > 0;             f[x_, y_] =  Sqrt[x] (Sqrt[y] + 1/Sqrt[y]) + x (1 + y + 1/y) + x^(3/2) (y^(3/2) + 1/y^(3/2)) + x^2 (y^2 + 1/y^2) + ((x y)^(5/2) (1 - 1/y^2))/(     1 - Sqrt[x y]) + (x/y)^(5/2)/(1 - Sqrt[x/y]) (1 - y^2) // Simplify;           Nn = 30;(*you can increase this but it takes longer time*)          LogMT1 = Sum[f[x^n, y^n]/(n (1 - x^(2 n))), {n, 1, Nn}];          LogMT2 = Sum[ Log[(1 + x^n)/((1 - x^(n/2) y^(n/2)) (1 - x^(n/2) y^(-(n/2))))], {n, 1, Nn}];          Series[LogMT1 - LogMT2, {x, 0, Nn/2}] // Simplify      O(x^{31}) is the output showing that the equation is satisfied to that order.
