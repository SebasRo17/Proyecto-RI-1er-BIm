A friend and I have started a project using code from another project, that is covered licensed under GPL. We have distributed it freely on our website, and under its download button, we've added a direct download link to the modified source code also for free. At the about section of the application, we have credited the guys who built the original code. Does the fact that we have a different project name violate the terms of the GPL? And also, if we include the original GPLv2 notice from the original app does that help us comply with it? If not, please state exactly what we have to do to comply with the GPL. The code we're using is an older version, released under GPLv2, and that project has been discontinued, and moved to a different one, where they're still developing. We haven't used any of their current coding, which is released under GPLv3.
