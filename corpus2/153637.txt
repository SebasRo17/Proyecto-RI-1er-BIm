All the languages I know of would execute something like:               i = 0     while i < 100000000         i += 1      ..and you can see it take a noticeable amount of time to execute. Why though, do languages do this? The only effect this code will have is taking time. edit: I mean inside a function which is called               function main(){         useless()     }     function useless(){         i = 0         while i < 100000000             i += 1     }
