Is there any way to track how _Mathematica_ actually performs `Simplify`, so that we can see what those "Automatic" transformation functions it applies are and how it works with assumptions? For example,               ClearSystemCache[];     Simplify[Sin[x]^2 + Cos[x]^2, ComplexityFunction -> ((Print[#]; LeafCount[#]) &)]      will output               Cos[x]^2+Sin[x]^2         Cos[x]^2+Sin[x]^2         Cos[x]^2+Sin[x]^2         Cos[x]^2+Sin[x]^2         Cos[x]^2+Sin[x]^2         1         1         1      Is there a way to see what _Mathematica_ does between these steps?
