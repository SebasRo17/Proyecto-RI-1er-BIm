For any company that has made it onto a "Best Companies to Work For" list* in 2010 that hires programmers, what restrictions on web usage do they have in place? Does that company view unrestricted internet access as a benefit to their employees even if they might use it for non-work related reasons? If you can provide a link to back up this information, even better. (* I don't want to promote any specific publication, but they are easy enough to find.) My hypothesis is that a company that aspires to be one of the best needs to provide fairly unrestricted internet access and I'm trying to test it.
