I have a general repository for small utilities (which were deemed too small at the time to warrant their own repository. 'Nother problem of itself maybe), some of which are deprecated and likely to never serve again. But one rule where I work is to never throw anything away. Deleting from SVN means it's not really deleted, it's just in the history somewhere, but that can still be hazardous in case you need to find that old thing again. What would be the best strategy for keeping deprecated items, but also keeping them out of the way?
