What is the verb for "to make something into a plugin"? Example use: "Developer can you make Module Foo into a plugin?". "Yes sir, I can `some verb` Module Foo". Terms I have considered: pluginify, pluginize, make pluggable Criteria for Acceptance: A single verb which means "to make something into a plugin" or "to create something as a plugin". _I am looking for a term which is already in use_ as opposed to a new one.
