I'm using Bitbucket for a few projects, but as of April 28, 2014 they will replace their End User Agreement with a new Customer Agreement. The new agreement mentions in 7.7.2: " _You will not submit to the Hosted Services ... any personally identifiable information_ " One of my projects clearly contains such information, and I'm now trying to figure out what to do. These are the three possible options I could come up with:   1. I may keep all existing projects and continue to work with them, as long as no new patch involves sensitive data. This is under the assumption that what I have done so far has been in accordance with the current agreement, and that the new agreement only concerns information submitted after April 28.   2. I have to remove that particular project, but may keep the others. This seems likely if 7.4 in the new agreement means that any data that have been submitted to the "Hosted Services" will be treated equally, regardless of under which agreement it was submitted: _" **Your Data** " means any data, content, code, video, images or other materials of any type that you upload, submit or otherwise transmit to or through Hosted Services._   3. I have to terminate the agreement, and thus remove my account and all of my projects. This is a possible interpretation if the continuation of 7.4, about the company's right to _"collect, use, copy, store, transmit, modify and create derivative works of Your Data"_ , means that they can still do whatever they want, even with data that were submitted under the terms of an older agreement and have since then been removed.
