I have a `Manipulate` to which I am adding and removing `Locator` points (one of which is different from the others, though that is only context for this question):               lastP = {}; states = {};     setState[p_] := RandomReal[Abs[p[[1]]]];     Manipulate[With[{q = locs[[1]], p = Drop[locs, 1]},       If[Length[lastP] < Length[p], states = Append[states, setState[p[[-1]]]]];       If[Length[lastP] > Length[p], states = states[[Flatten[Position[lastP, #] & /@ p]]]];       lastP = p;       Graphics[{         Text[TableForm[MapThread[List, {p, states}]], {0, 0}],          Red, Table[Circle[q, i/30], {i, 3}],          Blue, Point[#] & /@ p}, PlotRange -> 2]],      Row[{        Button["Clear", {locs = {locs[[1]]}}, ImageSize -> 100,          Alignment -> {Center, Baseline}],        Button["Recalc", states = setState[#] & /@ Drop[locs, 1],          ImageSize -> 100, Alignment -> {Center, Baseline}]        }], {{locs, {{1, 1}}}, Locator, Appearance -> None,        LocatorAutoCreate -> 1}]      I need to associate with each of the `Locator` points in `p` a random value (according to some specified PDF that is a function of the point's coordinates, here using `setState` as an example) that is calculated and associated with the point _only when it is added or moved_ , but not when other points are added or moved. I would also like to have access to the association between this value and the point, so that I can adjust the display of each point according to that associated value (e.g. making those with values less than some threshold one color and those greater another). How can I (ideally without giving up on `Manipulate`) achieve this "stable" association of calculated values with `Locator` points? I've played with various approaches for hours, and, with help, I've gotten as far as getting what I want for adding and removing; but I expect there's some simpler approach that I'm missing, and I haven't managed to get _moving_ (i.e., updates to the calculated value associated with a point) working.
