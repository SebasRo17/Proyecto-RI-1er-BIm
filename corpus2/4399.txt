How much should programmers help testers in designing tests? I don't think they should help at all. My worry is that if they help testers in designing tests for their own code, they'll 'infect' the testers with their own prejudices and blind spots about that code. I feel that the requirements should be sufficient for giving the information needed for testers to create their tests. If there is some part of the implementation that the programmers find worrisome, then I think it's their duty to implement unit tests to test that part or even run their own informal system tests to test that part. Not everyone I know agrees with this though (and I understand some of their points to a certain extent). What do others think about this? Is this discussed in the literature anywhere?
