I work as a Ruby developer/dev lead at a small startup company. I end up splitting my time between writing code, helping the team use more agile methodology and working with the product manager to get stories ready for the dev team. I enjoy my work and generally rate my enjoyment of work on these criteria:   * Good boss (no pointed haired managers)   * time is allowed to maintain the codebase (refactor code/write unit tests/etc.)   * get paid competitive salary   * no stupid deadlines   * work normal hours I am in no hurry to change jobs, but at least in the Ruby community it seems that everybody and their brother has their own blog, open source projects, or some other form of personal branding. I can just not get into these things. I really enjoy my work but when I go home I am ready to do something else and not spend hours writing blogs or writing more software. Is a requirement to write, blog, or engage in other forms of personal branding to keep myself marketable?
