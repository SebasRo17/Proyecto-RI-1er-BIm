Runnig this code after building the `ODBC` connection for my access application named `WPC` :               Needs["DatabaseLink`"];     OpenSQLConnection[JDBC["odbc", "WPC"]];      I get this message : > JDBC::error: [Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] The specified DSN contains an > architecture mismatch between the Driver and Application >> I am using _Microsoft Access 2010 (32 bit)_ and _Windows 7 (64 bit)_ so I have built the `ODBC` with _odbcad32_. Some one has an idea what is the problem/solution ?
