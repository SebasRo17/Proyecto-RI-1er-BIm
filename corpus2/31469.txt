Suppose we have 3 lists each with 18 numbers like this:               list1 = {7.49, 7.56, 7.98, 8.09, 8.16, 8.21,              8.73, 8.64, 8.68, 8.46, 8.57, 8.29, 9.38, 9.43, 8.95, 9.04, 8.9, 9.07};     list2 = {21.08, 21.18, 21.35, 21.79, 21.92, 22.15, 22.38, 22.48, 22.48, 22.51, 22.64, 22.68, 22.75, 22.8, 23.01, 23.28, 23.5, 23.54};     list3 = {36.33, 37.1, 37.19, 37.31, 37.34, 37.61, 37.88, 38.32, 38.42, 38.9, 39.06, 39.12, 39.14, 39.31, 39.39, 39.41, 39.41, 39.43};      I need to partition it into six subsets:   1. Each one with 3 numbers   2. The mean of each one is as close as possible to the others. For an example:               list = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};      Partition into 3 subsets: 1\. Each one with equal size, it sould be `Length[list]/3=2` 2\. The mean of each subset is as close as possible to the others,it should be `{{1,6},{2,5},{3,4}}` where each subset's mean is `3.5`. My objective is: `Minimize` the `MeanVariance` of all the subsets.
