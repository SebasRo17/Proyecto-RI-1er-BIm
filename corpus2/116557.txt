I've received a job offer from a company for a technical support developer. I originally had an interview lined up with them for a C# Developer role but this was filled internally before my interview. I am feeling under a lot of pressure to take this role because of the economy and since it'll be my first role since graduating. The reason for this post though... will I be hurting my chances of becoming a fully fledged software developer in the near future? The job will involve mostly bug fixing and testing with skills required such as C#, ASP.net, MVC, Javascript. As far as I'm aware, there'll be no pure development. There will be chance to progress to new roles in the business but I'm unsure of the time frame. I would be grateful to hear from anyone who has been in similar positions.
