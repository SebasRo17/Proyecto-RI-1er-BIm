I was reading some Cthulhu Mythos stuff and started to think about those various signs and symbols that are used in the texts. Of course those are made by humans but point is that they look natural to human eyes. So, what kind of algorithm would be needed to create natural looking symbols and signs? How this problem could be approached? I guess Golden ratio and Fibonacci numbers are in key role.
