I've seen multiple configurations for persisting information to the database. Generally, three types of designs seem common in my corner of the world:   * Controller manages the persistence    * Model manages the persistence   * Third party library manages the persistence, usually requiring some sort of annotations on the model. I'm wondering which configuration (if any) is, conceptually, the easiest to use/most compatible with an MVC architecture? (If it's not one I listed, please give a quick outline/overview as part of the answer)
