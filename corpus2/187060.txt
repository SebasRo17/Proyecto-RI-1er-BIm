I'm a student and I work as an undergrad in an IT department. They are very effective programmers, but as far as documenting what they do and tracking what time is spent on specific tasks - not so much. I was put in charge of setting up project management software. So far, I've created a satisfactory solution with Trac. But still, programmers use it because "the boss says so" and do so grudgingly. No one likes having to go to a separate webpage, logging what they did, checking boxes, and what not - so my question is this: As a programmer, what incentives or features in project management software would encourage you (or least make it more bearable) to use it?
