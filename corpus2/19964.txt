I am trying to make a polar plot using the following code               PolarPlot[1, {Î¸, 0, Pi/3}, PolarAxes -> True,       PolarTicks -> {"Degrees", Automatic}, PolarGridLines -> True,       PlotRange -> 1.5]      ![](http://i.imgur.com/nqG2HGm.png) What I would like to do is to set the angle range of the polar axis, from 0 to 60 degrees. I've tried using `PlotRange` but this changes the radial component of the function... How is it possible to define an anglular range of a polar plot?
