I built a cubic, then use `MousePosition` together with `GUIScreenShot` to take a floating region with fixed size (200*200) on the screen, and use it as dynamic texture on the cubic. My code is               Needs["GUIKit`"];     $HistoryLength = 1;          DynamicModule[{mpp},      Dynamic@{       Refresh[        ClearSystemCache[];        g = GUIScreenShot[With[{mp = MousePosition[]}, mpp = {mp - 100, mp + 100}]];        Graphics3D[{Texture[g], Polygon[coords, VertexTextureCoordinates -> Table[vtc, {6}]]}, Lighting -> "Neutral"],        UpdateInterval -> .5],       mpp, g},      Initialization :> (       vtc = {{0, 0}, {0, 1}, {1, 1}, {1, 0}};       coords = {{{0, 0, 0}, {0, 1, 0}, {1, 1, 0}, {1, 0, 0}}, {{0, 0, 0}, {1, 0, 0}, {1, 0, 1}, {0, 0, 1}}, {{1, 0, 0}, {1, 1, 0}, {1, 1, 1}, {1, 0, 1}}, {{1, 1, 0}, {0, 1, 0}, {0, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 1}}, {{0, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 1}, {0, 1, 1}}, {{0, 0, 1}, {1, 0, 1}, {1, 1, 1}, {0, 1, 1}}};)]      You can see the result by executing the code then moving your mouse around. Like this, ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4rNof.png) But there are two strange problems, 1) the size of the floating area taken should be always 200*200, however it will actually change. 2) the memory usage will constantly grow as we move our mouse, but I have already used `$HistoryLength=1` and `ClearSystemCache[]`. Any suggestion?
