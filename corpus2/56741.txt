I want to build a table of `InverseFunction`s, f.e.:               Table[InverseFunction[Head[foo][#] &][x], {foo, {Sin[x], Log[x], Sqrt[x]}}]      > {ArcSin[x], E^x, Power(-1)[x]} I' m frustrated by the fact that `Sqrt[x]` evaluates to `Power ...` instead of `x^2`. As a temporary fix I have written:               Table[InverseFunction[(Head[foo] /. Power -> Sqrt)[#] &][x], {foo, {Sin[x], Log[x], Sqrt[x]}}]       which gives the desired result: > {ArcSin[x], E^x, x^2} I would like to find a more general and reliable way to prevent this kind of "Head-Substitution". I tried many things with `HoldForm` etc., but to no avail. Thanks for your ideas
