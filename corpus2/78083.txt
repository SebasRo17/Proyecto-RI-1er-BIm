> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  how to really master a programming language Let say about Java(just a sample, you can talk about C#, PHP, C++ ... it's just similar) and 10 (ten) levels, 1 is newbie and 10 is master. How can you identify someone at which level based on his knowledge? I do not tend to compare languages, I do tend to know what indicate a master or a newbie in a language _and its (language's) based technology_. Yeah, I know there aren't on earth a language stand alone, it always come with a technology with it. Let say in Java, you can memorize all of its keyword and syntax in just few days, but to _know_ it (I mean do something with it effectively), you must read the Oracle (Sun) javadoc many many times (I'm not mention the 3rd party product yet).
