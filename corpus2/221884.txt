I have been tasked with writing a print driver. I have no experience with this and have been researching it for a few days. The goal of this is to essentially write the data coming to the driver to a file and then do some additional processing of it. If I understand it correctly, I can start other processes to do most of the work, but I'll need the driver itself to generate the initial file/data. I am confused about what state the data is in when it comes to the driver from an application. Is this something that is determined by the application, or is there a standard of some kind?
