It is common for software vendors to offer automatic updates. The research and installation of these updates can be done   * at application startup   * through a service or process in the background (which often can be seen in the icon tray)   * Sometimes at the opening of a session or boot The problem I encounter today is that Google, Sun Java, Adobe and others... updates system seem to squander resources of my computer to watch for updates continuously. One uses a service, the other a running process... Why do those suppliers not use the scheduling tools offered by the operating system, like the **Task Scheduler**?
