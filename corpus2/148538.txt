I am planning on purchasing this book to learn more about C++ programming with regards to fast code. However, the book was published in 1999 and I am worried most of it may be irrelevant now due to optimizations that compilers perform. Could anyone please advise? http://www.amazon.com/Efficient-C-Performance-Programming- Techniques/dp/0201379503/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top edit: Found this book too, albeit also rather old: http://www.amazon.com/Optimizing-C-Steve-Heller/dp/0139774300
