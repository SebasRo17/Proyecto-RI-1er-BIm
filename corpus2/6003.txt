I am trying to solve the following equation with respect to `x`.               eqn = x^z + y == a;      But when I do               Reduce[eqn,x]      mathematica doesn't solve at all. I guess this is because of symbolic expression in powers. If I replace `z` into some numeric values, mathematica works immediately. I was wondering what I am missing with this.
