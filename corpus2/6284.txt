Background: I have a geometric transformation composed of a `RotationTransform`, `ScalingTransform` and `ShearingTransform`, I can use dynamic constructs with rotations and scalings but this does not (seem to) work with the `ShearingTransform`. Consider the following snippet:                 DynamicModule[{shr, deg = 30},        shr0 = ShearingTransform[deg Degree, {1, 0}, {0, 1}];        shr1 = Dynamic[ShearingTransform[deg Degree, {1, 0}, {0, 1}]];        shr2 = ShearingTransform[Dynamic[deg Degree], {1, 0}, {0, 1}];       Column[{          Slider[Dynamic[deg], {0, 90, 1}],          GeometricTransformation[{Blue,            Rectangle[{0, 0}, {3, 1}]},           shr0] // Graphics}        ]]      Note that the snippet does not work (as expected) : moving the slider does not change the angle of the shear. See `shr1` and `shr2` for alternatives I have already tried. **Question: How can I make the angle in a`ShearingTransform` dynamic, such that it works in the context of the snippet above?**
