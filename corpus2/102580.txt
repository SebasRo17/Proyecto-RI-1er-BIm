I'm a self-taught programmer and I'm working for a company that doesn't deal directly with building software (a glass manufacturer with a small IT team). I'm the only .NET developer there, although there are 3 SAP programmers with a bit of Visual Basic 6 background. Now I'm only a medium-level developer myself and I want to improve my skills, but it's rather hard when you are the "one-eyed king" in the proverbial land of blinds. Without leaving the employer, what can I do to improve my skills in such a sub-par learning environment?
