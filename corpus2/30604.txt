Select the following Mathematica code and paste it into a notebook. In Windows 7(Mathematica 8) the line breaks are not interpreted in the expression. In fact any data copipasted from stackexchange loses it's formatting. How do I paste content from stackexchange into Mathematica while keeping the formatting?               Print[       "text"     ]      **EDIT:** Now ideally Mathematica would support this natively. Solutions to integrate this into Mathematica would be great. I have 3 possible ideas.   1. modify Ctrl+V so this automatically occurs   2. assign a different modifier    3. create a button or palette I'm going to do the 3rd for now, but any other solutions are appreciated.
