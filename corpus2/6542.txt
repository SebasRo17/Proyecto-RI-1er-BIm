_with emphasis on outside of cs science students & staff_ In the "good ol' days" LaTeX was **it** ; mainly because of two reasons, first - it gave such a better quality document that nothing else came close, and second - there was pretty much nothing else as a valid alternative. _I'm talking 1985-1995 here._ And because of that, a major part of technical (or medicine, biochems., ... which have a logical way of thinking in them) users (people in general, in those professions) used it for their documents. It wasn't too hard to learn, and gave excellent results. Nowadays, however, _things are a changin_ , as old Dylan would put it. MS Word** for example as the most common one, is giving _quite a nice_ result, with a much higher gain/pain ratio. For most people, it is _good enough_. If one wants to create a document for which there is no LaTeX template, pros start to weight even more on Word's side. So, the question is this - do you think /and why - argument it/ LaTeX & co. has a future outside of cs sciences world (which users are inclined towards programming, and therefore usually take in LaTeX structure naturally, or at least with much less effort) given the recent trends? ** insert your favourite word processor; MS Word was taken just as an example p.s. This was inspired by one other question that came about recently, but also with the trend I noticed recently, but which has been going for a while now (past few years) that even technical magazines, which used to demand articles in TeX, now ask for them in .doc format (or ...).
