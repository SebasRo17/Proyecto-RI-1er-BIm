> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  How do you dive into large code bases? I'm about to take on maintenance and enhancements of a fairly large and complex Java EE project with a Javascript front end. I'm trawling through the code trying to work out how it all hangs together but I wondered if any of you people have come up with a methodology for doing this that works best for you? do you start with the UI and work backwards to the database? Or take discrete 'slices' through the system for particular bits of functionality? Do you take notes? How do _you_ get up to speed with a new project?
