I'd like to create a web wizard or a wizard on/within a website. I know there are several java frameworks for wizards but there is none for the web in particular. If I search for a framework, I always get wizards to create a website, applet, servlet and what not. But never how to create such a wizard itself. So the question(s) is: What framework should I use to create a web wizard? And what frameworks are there? The wizard will be the visualisation for a BPEL Process deployment on a apache ode. I thought a webapp would be an easy way because the apache is running anyway. I'm not bound to that, perhaps someone has a better idea.
