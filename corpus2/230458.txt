For brevity's sake, consider the following scenario: Part of my application is a wizard for bringing on new clients and it's a dynamic page. One step contains billing information, another step is setup information, etc. Because it's one page, in my mind I have one controller for the entire wizard, but that also means I have models and functions for each step in one **controllername.js** file in addition to using a bunch of ng-show directives to "show" steps. This doesn't feel quite right..have I overlooked something in the docs? Edit: To exapnd a bit, I feel like I'm violating the SRP and I feel dirty.
