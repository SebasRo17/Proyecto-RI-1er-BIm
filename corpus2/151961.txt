We're considering converting our WinForms application to a WPF application. Part of the reason is that WPF/XAML seem to be the future. We are also using third party controls that we would like to be able to phase out. Making this conversion seems like a pretty big and time consuming undertaking, though. Would it make sense to develop XAML controls that could be used in our WinForms application as a first step in the process? My thinking is that the same controls would then be used in the WPF application and all of the look, feel, and functionality would be built into the controls in either environment.
