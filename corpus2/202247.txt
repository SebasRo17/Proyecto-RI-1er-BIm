I was going through an article here In the section named Aggregate Method ,the author says > Then summing over the entire sequence, all the 1's sum to O(n), and all the > di also sum to O(n). That is, and then gives this               Σ1≤i≤n ci   ≤   n + Σ0≤j≤m 2j−1      I can understand how summing 1's to get n , But I am not very clear how the second term becomes `Σ0≤j≤m 2j−1` and thereby O(n) Sorry about the formatting..I am not sure how the math notations are to be printed here.. Will you please see the original article ?
