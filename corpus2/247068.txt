Recently I've discovered such a thing as a Apache Mesos. It all looks amazingly in all that demos and examples. I could easily imagine how one would run for stateless jobs - that fits to the whole idea naturally. Bot how to deal with long running jobs that are stateful? Say, I have a cluster that consists of N machines (and that is scheduled via Marathon). And I want to run a postgresql server there. That's it - at first I don't even want it to be highly available, but just simply a single job (actually Dockerized) that hosts a postgresql server. How would one organize it? Constraint a server to a particular cluster node? Use some distributed FS?
