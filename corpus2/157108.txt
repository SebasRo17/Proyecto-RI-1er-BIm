I'm having performance issues on a Rails `3.1.0` application, now I've done dome changes on my queries with AR and so but views still takes too many time to render, I've divided the views, loops and so, on many partials that are rendered dynamically inside views and inside other partials. So it's a bad practice to have a large number of partials? Should I reduce the number of partials to improve the views rendering time? Thanks
