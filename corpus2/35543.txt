This expression (explained here by Leonid) evaluates fine unless Evaluation->Debugger is enabled:               h[x : (_Integer) : 1] := x      > Syntax::sntxf: "x:" cannot be followed by "(_Integer):1".   >  Syntax::tsntxi: "(_Integer):1" is incomplete; more input is needed.   >  Syntax::sntxi: Incomplete expression; more input is needed . Strangely it works if the parentheses are removed:               h[x : _Integer : 1] := x      But both of these fail when debugging:               h[x : (_Integer | None) : None] := x     h[x : Alternatives[_Integer, None] : None] := x          (* Workaround: *)     ptn = _Integer | None;     h[x : ptn : None] := x      All this was with Mathematica 8.0.4 Linux What is the debugger up to?
