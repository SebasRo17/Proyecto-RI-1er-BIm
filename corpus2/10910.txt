Please consider the following:               data={123.,56.,45.};     Head/@data     (*result: {Real,Real,Real}*)      How do I change the numbers in `data` into integers, so:               dataConv=MyFunction/@data;     Head/@dataConv     (*result: {Integer,Integer,Integer}*)      **EDIT** Also interesting could be to change "real" reals like `{12.3,10.555}` into integers by returning only the numbers before the decimal separator `(*result: {12,10}*)`.
