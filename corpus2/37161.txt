The following code block is in Trott's Guidebook for Programming. The associated notebook says that this and a few other routines ran in a matter of seconds. I killed it after half an hour.   I am curious to know what might be the issue. My guess is that `$MaxMachineNumber` is much bigger on my new laptop.               Module[{cp, cls, L = 0.02},       (* an initial contour plot *)       cp = ContourPlot[Im[Exp[1/(x + I y)]], {x, -L, L}, {y, -L, L},                         PlotPoints -> 400, DisplayFunction -> Identity] /.       (* replace large high-precision numbers by biiig machine numbers *)          z_?(Abs[#] > $MaxMachineNumber&) :> Sign[z] $MaxMachineNumber/2;       (* homogeneously distributed contour lines *)                        cls = #[[100]]& /@ Partition[Sort[Flatten[cp[[1]]]], 800];          (* the final contour plot *)            ListContourPlot[cp[[1]], MeshRange -> {{-L, L}, {-L, L}},                       Contours -> cls, ContourLines -> False,                       ColorFunction -> (Hue[Random[]]&),                        AspectRatio -> Automatic, FrameTicks -> None]]
