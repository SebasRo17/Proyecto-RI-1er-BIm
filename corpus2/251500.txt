We all know what a fizzbuzz is and I've seen many varients of programs to be implemented. However, it takes time to watch someone write the code out, it seems time inefficent to sit there watching code be written after someone has already 'figured it out'. It's also harder to give a programing fizzbuzz over the phone. I was wondering if other simple questions can be used as a fizzbuzz? Questions like "when is it best to use the following structures: hashmap, a linked list, or a sorted tree" or "in Java what other method should you always override if you override the equals method"? Would questions like these work as well as a standard programing fizzbuzz? If you were in person, where a person could write on paper, would you ever consider a non-programing fizzbuzz over a programing one? Would a non-programing fizzbuzz be less likely to seem insulting then a programing one?
