I have plotted a figure of MoS2 crytal structure. But the actual output looks like the spheres are not in the correct position due to the perspective effect. I obtained the correct position figure by setting the `ViewPoint` to `Infinity`. But when I rotate the figure, the infinity effect fails and the perspective effect takes place again. ![before and after rotation](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PI6Hk.png) I was wondering if there is a way to get rid of the perspective effect when you draw a graphic? Thank you. Here is my code               a0 = 1; ceng = 1; znn =3*ceng; ynn = 5; xnn = 5; a1 = 2; cznn = 3; hh = 2;     p1[θ_] := RotationTransform[θ, {0, 0, 1}];     posx1 = (nx1 - 1) a0 + ((ny1 - 1) a0)/2 + (Mod[nz1 - 1, 3] a0)/2;     posy1 = Sqrt[3]/2 (ny1 - 1) a0 + (Sqrt[3] Mod[nz1 - 1, 3] a0)/6;     posz1 = Sqrt[3]/2 (nz1 - 1) a0 + Floor[(nz1 - 1)/3] a0;     sinpq2 = Transpose[Table[{posx1, posy1, posz1}, {ny1, ynn}, {nz1, znn}, {nx1, -xnn, 0}]];     rr = 0.3 a0;     tom2 =        Table[         Graphics3D[{If[Mod[cc, 3] == 2, Pink, Yellow], Sphere[sinpq2[[cc, bb, aa]], rr]}],          {aa, xnn}, {bb, ynn}, {cc,znn}];     Show[tom2,        Axes -> False,        BoxStyle -> Directive[Orange, Opacity[0]],         BoxRatios -> Automatic,        PlotRange -> All,        Background -> Black,         ViewPoint -> {0, 0, ∞}]
