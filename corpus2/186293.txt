Where does the word "argument" (in the programming sense) come from?   i.e. Why are actual parameters called "arguments"? The meanings don't seem related, and I haven't found any explanation of it anywhere. * * * **Note** on the terminology:   * "Formal" parameters (also known simply as "parameters") are the "placeholder" names (say, `x`) -- the _declared_ parameters of a function.    * "Actual" parameters (also known as "arguments") are the _actual values_ which are _passed_ to a function (say, `5`), hence I used this term above to prevent any confusion.
