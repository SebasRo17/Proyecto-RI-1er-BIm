From a legal standpoint (licensing issues), can I legally, in agreement with the license, publish Fortran 90 wrappers (bindings) to the CUFFT library from Nvidia CUDA Toolkit, under some open source license (either CC0, that is, public domain, or some kind of permissive license like BSD)? Nvidia provides only C bindings with their CUDA SDK. Header files contain the following text.               /*      * Copyright 1993-2011 NVIDIA Corporation.
