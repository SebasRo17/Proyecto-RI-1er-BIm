I have encountered some problems when using `Simplify` with expressions containing a square root and isolated a following test case               Simplify[x - #[y], x == #[y]] & /@ {Sin, Sqrt, #^s &, #^(3/2) &}      with a result               {0, x - Sqrt[y], 0, x - y^(3/2)}        1. Why is `x-Sqrt[y]` not simplified to `0` as in the case of `x-Sin[y]`?   2. What is the logic behind simplifying `x-y^s` to `0`, but keeping x-y^(3/2)?   3. Why do all the above differences vanish when we replace `-` with `==`? In such case              Simplify[x == #[y], x == #[y]] & /@ {Sin, Sqrt, #^s &, #^(3/2) &}      results in              {True, True, True, True}
