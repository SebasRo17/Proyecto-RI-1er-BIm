I am a Linux server administrator first and foremost... Having said that, I have been asked by a former high school teacher of mine to teach students a bit about programming. Like any Linux administrator, I know my fair share of Python and Bash. The problem is that I know NOTHING about the lower level stuff like "machine code" and compilation. The main purpose of this series is to teach programming, not computer science, so I don't need a graduate degree's level of knowledge for this, they will be learning Python first and foremost. However, I would like to learn enough to at least broach the subject with them, any ideas where I can learn that kind of stuff relatively quickly?
