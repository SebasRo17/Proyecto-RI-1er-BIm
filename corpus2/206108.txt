In a language like Python or JavaScript (NodeJS), is there anything wrong with defining "the configuration file" as a file which essentially hard-codes the configuration settings? For example: options.py:               OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = 'out'     LOGLEVEL = 'debug'      options.js:               outputDirectory = 'out';     logLevel = 'debug';      Does this count as "hard-coding" options? When would it be inappropriate to expect a user to configure software this way? Is there any benefit to using a traditional configuration format (eg, ini file) which is parsed at run-time?
