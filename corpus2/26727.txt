I noticed the following issue when using `ConstantArray`:               a = ConstantArray[0., {10000, 100}];     ByteCount[a]     (* 8000152 *)      Then I set:               a[[1,1]] = 1;     ByteCount[a]     (* 25040080 *)      So to be sure my array will not expand in memory without reason I must multiply each element I want to change by 1.0 Is there another way (more efficient) to ensure I won't change the type of data by accident? `Real` to `Integer` shouldn't be a problem...
