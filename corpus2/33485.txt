I'm trying to export figures into pdf, and the results looks good in Preview, but very bad in Adobe pdf reader. I'm using Mathematica version 8 on Mac 10.8.5. The Preview version is 6.0.1 (765.6) and the Adobe PDF Reader version is 11.0.04.63. For a simple three point polygon, it looks good in both pdf viewer               Graphics3D[{Red, Opacity[0.15], EdgeForm[Lighter[Black, 0.8]],        Polygon[{{1, 0, 0}, {1, 1, 1}, {0, 0, 1}}]}, Boxed -> False]     Export["~/Downloads/12345.pdf", %, ImageResolution -> 100]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cfopC.png) but for polygon with more points, it looks very bad in Adobe reader               Graphics3D[{Red, Opacity[0.15], EdgeForm[Lighter[Black, 0.8]],        Polygon@Join[{{-1, 0, 0}},          Table[{-1, t, Cos[t]^2}, {t, 0, \[Pi]/2, 0.01}]]},       BoxRatios -> {1, 1, 0.5}, Boxed -> False, ViewPoint -> Right]     Export["~/Downloads/1234.pdf", %, ImageResolution -> 100]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/EqX3C.png) Why they looks different in the two pdf viewer and is there a way to fix it so that pdf figure works in both pdf viewers?
