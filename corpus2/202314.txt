I am getting some data from Gov tracker (http://www.govtrack.us/developers/api) and creating a Windows 8 Store application.. I started out trying to use the HttpClient to get the JSON and then use Json2Charp.com to convert it to classes... But then I had no idea what to do with this giant class and the line                 var contacts = JsonArray.Parse(data);      would not work.. So now I requested it as XML and I am using XML to LINQ to slowly get what I need ..for example..                   var things = from x in xdoc.Descendants("person")                          select new Person                          {                              firstname = x.Element("firstname").Value                          };      But in this case and in general what is the easiest way? Is it using XML for this windows 8 application and using JSON to javascript applications? (since I always hear about how JSON fits so well with javascript) At the moment since I could not get the JSON deserialization to work I guess XML is easier in this case?
