I have a function that is a bit too slow for `Manipulate[]`. Right now I plan to cache outputs outside the manipulation and just have the manipulator select among cached outputs, but I am wondering if some better version of that trick exists. Basically, I am creating a CDF presentation in which I intend to show the effect of different values for a correlation parameter $\rho$ in Monte Carlo simulations to the audience using `Manipulate[]` to show the resulting sample histograms. The simulation process is too slow to make for a good user experience as a live function, so one way or another I will have to cache some things. It seems that if I am clever about writing a `Module` as an argument to `Manipulate` I should be able to make it cache, say, 199 different output sets corresponding to the various % correlations between -0.99 and +0.99.
