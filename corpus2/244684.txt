One of the methods that I commonly use in our codebase is misspelled (and it predated me). This really irritates me not simply because it is mispelled but more importantly it makes me ALWAYS get the name wrong the first time I type it (and then I have to remember "Oh, right, it should be mispelled to this...") I'm making a few changes around the original method. Should I take the opportunity to just rename the freaking method?
