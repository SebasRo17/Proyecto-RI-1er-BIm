I've accumulated a lot of side projects over the years, which I slowly improve on over time. Whenever I return to one, I take some time reading over text files that include design, recent bugs, next features, etc... that I should be working on - it's not pretty. I'm looking to switch to something more formal. Ideally, this would be a full featured, online, bug tracking system, which allows for free or nearly free bug tracking for my own projects. Also, ideally this would be doable in a private manner - I don't really want everyone to see my side projects and what a mess I've made of some of them.
