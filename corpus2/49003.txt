I smoothed some data with a BSpline $B[t] = (x[t],y[t])$. I would like to extract certain points from this spline by their x-Values, $x_0$. The easiest way I came up with was to minimize $B[t][[1]]-x_0$ for $t \in [0,1]$. So for finding the parameter t at which the x value is 13.46 if have the following code:               data = {{9.93114`, 379022.8`}, {11.71875`, 321705.7`}, {13.46983`,      280830.8`}, {15.625`, 243949.8`}, {18.60119`, 206915}, {21.70139`,      179663.2`}, {24.93351`, 158942.4`}, {29.29688`,      138396.2`}, {33.48214`, 123873.8`}};          spline = BSplineFunction[data, SplineDegree -> 3];     tstfc[t_] := spline[t][[1]]          FindMinimum[Abs[tstfc[x] - 13.46] , {x, 0}]      It seems like the Spline is not getting evaluated. How can I solve this? And is there a standard way to extract points from a spline? Thanks!
