I'm using iPage as my cloud based server provider. I haven't had any problems with them yet. They hold the scripts for my RESTful services for the mobile app I'm developing. My problem however is that tonight the service went down. I got a "This is a 500" error. I'm wondering how do I build redundancy into my RESTful services to prevent this stuff from happening. They say it'll be 2 hours at least until they can solve this problem. If my app is live I can't wait 2 hours. My users will get annoyed. I know this happens anyway but how can I build redundancies to prevent it.
