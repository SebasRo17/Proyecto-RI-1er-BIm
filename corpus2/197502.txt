I am working on project that deals in customer support. This website actually sells products ( so it is commerical ), and provides customer support. So in this project/website I was about to use select2 . Select2 License: > This software is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "Apache > License") or the GNU General Public License version 2 (the "GPL License"). > You may choose either license to govern your use of this software only upon > the condition that you accept all of the terms of either the Apache License > or the GPL License. Can I use this in the website?   Ask me if any other info is also required.
