I am having a problem in understanding how to apply camelCase syntax to some of my variable names. For example, how should I correctly write a word like "phonenumber" in camel case? Is it `phoneNumber` or `phonenumber`? Similarly with "username", is it `username` or `userName`? I think it doesn't look right with camel case like `motorCycle`, `passWord`, `sunDay`, `setUp` or `waveLength` since these are just one word each. I think that could be why it's called `hashMap` but also `hashtable` in camel case without the capital in the last case because hashtable is one word while hash map is two words. But if the motorcycle has a color then would it be `motorcycleColor` since a word is concatenated? Is that correct or should it be `phoneNUmber`, `waveLength`, `sunBlock` and even `sunDay` for the Sunday of the week? Why for instance is the method called `getISOCountries` while it says `HttpHeaders` e.g. it's not clear what becomes lowercase if we have a method like `String camelCaseString = dog.toCamelCase()` or `interface CamelCase`.
