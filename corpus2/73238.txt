I'm currently in the process of redesigning parts of a large and complex application server to allow it to be distributed across multiple machines. I've been asked to provide a prototype of the redesign in a relatively short time period. I don't think it's possible to create a prototype of this; the changes are in existing code, and the changes are at such a low level that the system can only be in one of two states: working or not working. There's no middle ground. The changes have to be implemented all at once, because they all rely on each other. There's no way to partially implement all of the changes, the system won't work unless they're all fully implemented. At this point, I'm unsure of what to do. I know that it's hard for others to tell without knowing every detail, but on a generic level, am I right in that something like this can't be prototyped? Is there some way to prototype things like this that I don't know about?
