I'm going to develop a fairly basic re-usable blog component, with simple CRUD operations using ASP.Net. Which method of storing blog posts would be best suited to the situation in terms of performance/maintainability?   * Create an XML file and store data in filesystem, filesize will not likely be any more than 50kb in size   * Store blog post data in DB, retrieve as needed Am I right in assuming that the asp.net runtime will cache the .xml files and only clear them/request a fresh copy when their contents are changed? Or do you have to explicitly add the file to the cache? If this is the case would this offer the best performance over storing the data in the database?
