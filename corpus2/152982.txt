I have a large (at least for me - approximately 10k lines) project that is written in C#. I have a treeview object on the left of my form and i have many nodes on my treeview. When i click a node, i bring up a panel on the right side of form. Since i only do GUI item operations (filling textboxes, clicking buttons, showing images on pictureboxes etc.), i write all of my code into MainForm class. This seems not very good but on the other side, i think i have to write into MainForm class because all of my job is to evaluate form items on panels. What should i do to write a more portable or understandable code? Do i have to write into MainForm class or do i have some options or methods to implement?
