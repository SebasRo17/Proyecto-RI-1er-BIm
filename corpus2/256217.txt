I'm working on a large angular application and I'm currently using a factory class that builds HTML templates from strings. We don't have to worry about mobile support for the application and I'm wondering from an architectural standpoint, which method would you rather implement and why: static HTML files that are fetched on request, or a class that builds the templates as strings?
