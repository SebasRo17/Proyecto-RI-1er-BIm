In every class, and every book I have seen regarding programming, classes are held off. They are thought to be confusing and strange. I certainly had issues with them. But in object orient programing, classes are so important, looking back at my education, it's almost illogical that I was allowed to go so long without knowing objects. I am helping to develop a course to teach python to people who have never coded before. Is it possible to teach programming by starting first and foremost with classes? Is it not possible to say, "This is a class. We will fill it with nouns and verbs so that it can serve our particular/specified needs"?
