As the title says: What's the purpose of `Unique`?   * I understand that it generates some unique symbol, but when and for what is it to be used? Are there applications in practical solutions, or is it for the backend of programs (I noticed that `Block` etc use variable names similar to what `Unique` creates)?   * How do I use a variable generated by `Unique`? Do I store its name in another variable and then use that as a pointer of some sort by converting its content (e.g. `$123`) to an expression somehow?
