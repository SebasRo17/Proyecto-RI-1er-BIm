Suppose I have an equation plotted as shown:               Plot[(HarmonicNumber[K] - HarmonicNumber[K - r]) (HarmonicNumber[K] -       HarmonicNumber[-1 + r]) /. K -> 10, {r, 0, 11}, Filling -> 0.4]      ![image](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Eq2Cq.png) But what I really want is to have the two (triangular?) filling FLIPPED inside at $x \approx2$ and $x \approx9$. The direction of filling of the upper (semi- circular) part is not important. Preferably it can be Top/outside. Can anybody help with this flipping? Thanks
