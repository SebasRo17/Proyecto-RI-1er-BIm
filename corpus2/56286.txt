I have a data file containing the position of about $10^5$ stars of a spiral galaxy. Here is the plot ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/L6Flj.jpg) and this is the corresponding code               Clear["Global`*"]     SetDirectory[" ... "];          data = Import["data_SGC.out", "Table"];     L0 = ListPlot[data, PlotStyle -> {Blue, PointSize[0.001]}, Axes -> False,                    Frame -> True, FrameLabel -> {"x", "y"},                    RotateLabel -> False, LabelStyle -> Directive[FontFamily -> "Helvetica", 20],                    AspectRatio -> 1, PlotRange -> 100, ImageSize -> 550];      As we can see, there are two arms starting at about $(x,y) = (-14.6,0)$ and $(x,y) = (14.6,0)$. Now I would like to customize `ListPLot`, so as the arm starting at the left part $(x,y) = (-14.6,0)$, be in green color, while the other one in red. All the other points between the two yellow banana-type areas should be in gray. Any suggestions? The complete data file can be found here: data. Obviously, I could not generate simple random data in order to replicate this complicated spiral structure.
