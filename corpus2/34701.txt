I would like to create a plot whereby both the slider and the locator 'draw' the plot. In the following code, the locator & the slider act independently:               f[x_] := Sin[x];     Manipulate[With[{x0 = Clip[p[[1]], {0, 20}]}, Plot[f[x], {x, 0, t},      ImagePadding -> 20, PlotRange -> {{0, 20}, {-2, 2}}, LabelStyle -> (FontFamily ->      "Ariel"), Epilog -> {PointSize[Large], Red, Tooltip[Point[#], #] &@{x0, f[x0]}}]],      {t, 0.001, 20}, {{p, {0, 0}}, Locator, Appearance -> None}, AppearanceElements -> None]      I would like to get both to work together, so the slider 'draws' the plot, as does the locator when it is dragged. Here is an illustration of what I am trying to achieve: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/eRRQn.gif)
