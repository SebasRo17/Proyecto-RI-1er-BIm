When working in a Mathematica notebook, I often want to reorder cells. Most of the time, I am adding cells at the bottom of the notebook, until I realize it may be better to insert this calculation at an earlier point, between existing cells. > Is there a convenient way to reorder cells in a Mathematica notebook without > having to cut and paste? Ideally, I would like to be able to drag cells by their bracket, possibly holding a modifier key. I've searched through the internet in general and this StackExchange in particular and come up with nothing.
