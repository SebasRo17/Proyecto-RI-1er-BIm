I have an old notebook with an output from Graphics3D, however, I've lost the data behind the output and recomputing it would take days. I simply want to remove the bounding box Mathematica usually displays unless you specify that "Boxed -> False". Is it possible for me to still do this without having to recompute the graphic? E.g. I want to transform an output generated from running this example command:               Graphics3D[{Sphere[{0, 0, 0}, 1], Sphere[{2, 3, 5}, 1]}]      To an example output generated from running this example command (but without having to regenerate the image since I no longer have access to the sphere coordinates):               Graphics3D[{Sphere[{0, 0, 0}, 1], Sphere[{2, 3, 5}, 1]}, Boxed -> False]
