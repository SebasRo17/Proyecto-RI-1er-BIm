Next month a friend of mine is starting a job as a technical recruiter for a temp firm. He will be recruiting lower level temps for a Google/MS/Apple level company. As a largely non technical guy, what advice do you think would be most helpful for him to have? I have seen a number of horror stories about recruiters, so want to help him not to cause any of those in the future.
