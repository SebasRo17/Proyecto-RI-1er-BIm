My question consists of three parts: When to be sure that your database design is perfect? * * * Is returning to the data base design to change some issues (like adding new column, delete a column or change data type or add new table or ....) considered as a bad practice or is it normal? * * * I want any web sites or books just for training on ERD and `normalization`. I want a lot of samples, practices, and case studies with recommended answers, to strengthen my skill in database design and avoid the poor database designs I've made. Note: I don't need books to explain the concepts, what I need is practices, examples, and case studies with recommended answers.
