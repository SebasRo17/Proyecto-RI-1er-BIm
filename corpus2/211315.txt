We have employees with competencies:               Pete      Welder               Carpenter     Melissa   Carpenter            Assume they both work 40 hours/week, and have not yet been assigned work.   We need to report the availability of these competencies, expressed in hours.   As far as I can see now, we can report this in two ways: Method A. When someone has multiple competencies, count them both.               Welder    40 hours     Carpenter 80 hours      Method B. When someone has multiple competencies, count an equal division of hours for each               Welder    20 hours     Carpenter 60 hours      Method A has our preference:   \- A good planner will know to plan the least available competency first. If 30 hours of welding is planned, we will be left with 10 _welder_ , 50 _carpenter_.   \- Method B has the disadvantage that the planner thinks he cannot plan the job when 30 hours of welding is required. However, if we report this **we would like to give an estimate of the reliability of the numbers for each competency** , i.e. how much are these over-reported? In my example A, would I say that _carpenter_ is 100% over-reported, or 50%, or maybe another number?   How would I calculate this for large numbers of competencies?   I'm sure we are not the first ones dealing with this, is there a 'usual' way of doing this in planning? Additionally:   \- Would there be an even better method than A or B?   \- Optionally, we also have an _preference order_ of competencies (like: use him/her in this order), Pete could be 1. _welder_ 2\. _carpenter_. Does this introduce new options?
