Right now I'm preparing my CV. I think it's relevant to mention that I'm not native English speaker and my question is half-linguistic, half-programming related. I've been professionally hired as _software developer_ for nearly 5 years, some of the projects required designing small-scale applications architecture, I'm a MS in computer science. I have trouble figuring out how to call myself in professional light:   * a programmer   * a software developer   * a software engineer? Being translated all those notions have the same meaning in my mother's tongue, but I doubt, if they have a more specific usage. Can you help me figure out what's the difference between all three? Which one would you prefer the put in CV and why?
