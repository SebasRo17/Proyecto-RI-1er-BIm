In the question of How to make a curve selectable from a scaned image and convert it to a list of coordinates, thanks to the excellent answer of Alexei Boulbitch, I knew how to select a series of points from a curve in a scaned image. However, to get a wanted point, sometimes we should control the horizontal or vertical position of the cursor during the selection. For example, ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/C7XL3.png) to compare the y-values of each curve at the same x-position 0.05, I have to control the position of my cursor during the selection of the points on each curve. To do this, I can use the function MousePosition to control my selection. like this : ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xRi7y.png) I showed the dynamic mouse position below the image. Here, the MousePosition is referenced by the screen display, this is useful but not quite convenient for I want to know whether the actual x-position of my cursor is 0.5. How can I convert such a MousePosition to its coordinates over the image (scales X and Y have already been set memorized in the answer of question How to make a curve selectable from a scaned image and convert it to a list of coordinates) ?
