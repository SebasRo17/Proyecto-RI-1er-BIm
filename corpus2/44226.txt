I have a function which calls other functions and I would like to compile it to C code. For example:               foo[p_] := 0.7 Exp[-p^2]     f[a_, n_] :=       Module[{s, p, i}, s = 0; p = a;        For[i = 0, i < n, i++, s += foo[p]; p *= a;]; s]      Now if I do               cf = Compile[{{a, _Real}, {n, _Integer}}, f[a, n]]      and print the C code with               Needs["CompiledFunctionTools`"]     CompilePrint[cf]      the output is               R1 = MainEvaluate[ Hold[f][ R0, I0]]      which is obviously not desired. When I try `Compile[{{a, _Real}, {n, _Integer}}, Evaluate@f[a, n]]`, it just gives a function which returns 0...
