I know many programming languages ,skills and concepts in very basic, such as PHP, Java, Object-oriented technology. Using PHP, I can build a simple website with CRUD, login function. Using Java, I can make an basic swing csv/plain text editor in which user can switch between 2 different views. In term of object-oriented Technology, I clearly understand what encapsulation, inheritance and Polymorphism are I want to know more about programming. Sometimes I "google" some of the topics I am interested at , the more I see on the internet, the more I feel I am a small potato in the world ( indeed I am ). The codings/concepts are difficult to understand. I lacks confidence right now so I am asking this question :( What is the best way to learn programming to advanced level? Just buy a book and read it page to page? Thanks for any helps
