I've built already a bug report system. It looks like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Hl6ZE.png) It is accessed using a secret key combination detected by the JavaScript code. Not hard. It has everything - sends the standard emails to management and testers, logs the Javascript variables and current DOM HTML. We are also improving the backend of the system to act as a full bug report system. Previously, it was only via email. The problem is, unfortunately, the bug reporters _still_ preferred email. Even when I refused to answer their queries until they sent a bug report, they would not consistently send them. I don't understand it, because, for them it should be easy, but they act like it was a big deal. (The appearance was slightly more complex before, but still, all they had to do, minimally, was type a subject and press SUBMIT). I can't ask them, because they really have no idea. The second issue, more difficult, is to create a way to manage these issues that will be suitable to us developers. I actually have been satisfied managing new issues and bugs via Gmail inbox but my co-worker would like to use a system. He gets more mail than I do and has other reasons. I am completely at a loss for what to do. My problem is solved as much as I need it to be. When I look at other bug report systems, they both look terrible and are often expensive. Moreover, if even one person reports a bug via email, it will be a disaster! We can't refuse every bug via email and then will have two bug reporting systems. Sorry to put out all these complaints here, but maybe someone has some insightful advice that hasn't already been said.
