I am trying to generate a two variable recursive sequence For instance on Mathematica, I did               z[1] := {1, 1}     B := {{t, 1}, {-1, t}}     z[n_, t_] := B.z[n - 1, t]      When I tried to see `z[2]`, I get a bunch of gibberish. $n$ is the variable that is iterating, $t$ is just a parameter that I can throw in whenever I want. My goal is to generate a table of terms based on various iterations of $n$. From that, my sequence would be defined in terms of only $t$, then I would like test out various values of $t$ to generate a numerical sequence. There are two problems I am having: how to define the functions properly, and how to implement the recursion. I use Mathematica 8.0.4
