A friend of mine while working on a PHP application asked me to write one part of the application in Java. The part that involved transactions. He said it will be better to write this portion in Java. He talked about how secure it will be! Though I was too busy to help him then, I want to know the essence of this idea. Why he was trying to use Java when he wrote the most part in PHP? Will it really boost up the security? And writing transactions in Java is only concerned with security? The thing seems very interesting but I really have no idea, what it is! Please provide some insight into the topic. Note: When I say transaction, it involves everything. From accessing account to transferring money.
