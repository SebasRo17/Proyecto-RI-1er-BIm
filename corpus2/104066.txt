I have recently acquired a habit which I know many of you may frown upon, but which, in the end, helps me keeping an eye on global code structure rather than on the structure of a single, (sometimes) repetitive method: grouping a number of statements in a single line, like this:               textBox1.Text = "Something!"; textBox2.Text = "Another thing!"; textBox3.Text = "Yet another thing!";      as opposed to               textBox1.Text = "Something!";     textBox2.Text = "Another thing!";     textBox3.Text = "Yet another thing!";      I use to do that for repetitive tasks to maintain overall code "beauty" and to help me tracking program structure easily, but I admit it may not be a good practice. I actually use it a lot, so I would like to know what are your thoughts on this. Also, do you think that anyone which would ever have to maintain my code have problems with this approach?
