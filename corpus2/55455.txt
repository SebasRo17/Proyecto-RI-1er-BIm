In order to view system performance, I have been asked by management to give page response times for a few key pages. I want to make sure I am giving a good picture of the overall health of the system, and not just narrowing in on a single measurement. So my question is: **When developing software, what metrics would you provide to your stakeholders to indicate a system that is healthy and running well?** (if it is not running well, that should also be evident! Not trying to hide/obscure any problems.)
