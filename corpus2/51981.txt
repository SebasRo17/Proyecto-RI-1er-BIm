Is there a way to make Mathematica do a series of the form:                Series[ E^{\beta}$ , {x, 0, 1}]      I have noticed that                Series[E^x^(1/2), {x, 0, 1}]      work but                Series[E^x^(.5), {x, 0, 1}]      does not. Thanks for the help. EDIT: I have tried things like                 Assuming[{\bet>0},Series[ E^{\beta}$ , {x, 0, 1}]]      which hasn't helped.
