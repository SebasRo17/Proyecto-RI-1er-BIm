_(Note: I used 'error' instead of 'problem' in the title for obvious reasons.. ;) )._ I did some basic reading on Traits in Scala. They're similar to Interfaces in Java or C#, but they do allow for default implementation of a method. I was wondering: can't this cause a case of the "diamond problem", which is why many languages avoid multiple inheritance in the first place? If so, how does Scala handle this?
