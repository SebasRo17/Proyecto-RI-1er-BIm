I'm about to write a simple script to test a dataset for certain conditions. I was designing it as a set of functions each one describing the condition to be tested and pass them to the test engine:               # The tester engine:     all(f(dataset) for f in conditions)      I realized that my approach was similar to unit testing. So, to avoid repeating myself, I am thinking of using my favorite unit testing framework instead.   1. What do you think about that idea?   2. Have any of you used an unit test framework for any other purpose than test code?
