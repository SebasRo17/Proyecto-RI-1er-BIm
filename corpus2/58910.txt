So I have a list like so               list={{a},{b,c},{d,e,f},{g,h}}      and the basic logic I want is to be able to manipulate each of the nested lists individually. So If I wanted to take the average of each list I would do something like               avglist=Table[(1/3) Sum[list[[n,j]],{j,3}],{n,4}]      But the problem with this is when the program would call `list[[1,2]]` So the gist is I am trying to write a program that could average/in general manipulate each of the nested lists of uneven lengths without having to know how many entries are in the list with the most entries. I can't just add zeroes into the nested lists with fewer entries because if I want to manipulate them first then average it would affect the average. Thanks
