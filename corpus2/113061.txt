We are in the process of auditing a company with a view to buying them out. One of the key parts of this decision is the software they've developed over a long period of time. We always have the option of building our own, but we are all aware that it could take us longer to get operational if we build from scratch. My question is rather specific: I come from a development / PM background, and have been asked to do a full audit of this company's software, which is a web application. We want to know as much as possible about it before we make the decision of whether to buy them out, and after a basic demo, their system seems to do what we want, but we know that we'll need to modify it to a certain extent. I am looking for a template or framework to work through in order to produce my final report. Its been really tough finding anything through Google; most of what I've found is just basic checklists at best. I would need a template or framework that deals with infrastructure, design, architecture, hosting, etc. Has anyone had experience with this? I would be very grateful if someone is willing to share their template/framework with me.
