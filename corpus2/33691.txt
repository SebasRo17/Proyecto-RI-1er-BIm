Today I found a Sum which Mathematica will simplify for a general parameter value $\nu$, but which will not simplify fully for special cases $\nu = 1, 3, ...$ despite the fact that the general answer is correct for these special cases, as far as I can tell. I was investigating an explicit form for $$ \frac{d}{d \nu} I_\nu(z) $$ Wolfram gives a series representation. Plugging this into Mathematica I find:               In[23]:= FullSimplify[(Sum[(-((2^-\[Nu] z^\[Nu] Log[2])/       Gamma[1 + k + \[Nu]]) + (2^-\[Nu] z^\[Nu] Log[z])/       Gamma[1 + k + \[Nu]] - (       2^-\[Nu] z^\[Nu] PolyGamma[0, 1 + k + \[Nu]])/       Gamma[1 + k + \[Nu]]) (1/k! (z/2)^(2 k)), {k, 0, \[Infinity]}])]          Out[23]= BesselI[\[Nu],       z] (EulerGamma - HarmonicNumber[\[Nu]] + Log[z/2]) -       2^-\[Nu] z^\[Nu] Gamma[1 + \[Nu]]       \!\(\*SuperscriptBox[\(HypergeometricPFQRegularized\),       TagBox[      RowBox[{"(",       RowBox[{      RowBox[{"{", "1", "}"}], ",",       RowBox[{"{",       RowBox[{"0", ",", "0"}], "}"}], ",", "0"}], ")"}],      Derivative],      MultilineFunction->None]\)[{1 + \[Nu]}, {1 + \[Nu], 1 + \[Nu]}, z^2/4]      But if I try the same thing for the special case $\nu =1$               FullSimplify[     Sum[(-((z Log[2])/(2 Gamma[2 + k])) + (z Log[z])/(2 Gamma[2 + k]) - (z PolyGamma[0, 2 + k])/(2 Gamma[2 + k])) (1/k! (z/2)^(2 k)), {k, 0, \[Infinity]}]]      It just returns the original sum. I have compared the original derivative of a Bessel function to the general expression for $\nu =1$ numerically and they seem to match. Why is it that Mathematica will not simplify these special cases?
