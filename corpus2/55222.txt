BarChart formatting algorithm make me loose some time today in V10. Now, `LabelingFunction` do not work beyond some number of Labels. See example:               RandomSeed[1]     barchart[n_]:=         BarChart[RandomInteger[10,{n,3}]                 ,LabelingFunction->(Placed[#1,Center]&)                 ,AspectRatio->0.2,ImageSize->700                 ,ChartLayout->"Percentile"         ]          barchart[33]     barchart[34]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/kjN9m.png) After 33, labels disappear! Witch magic parameter can I change to get my labels back? The problem is the same in V10.0.0 for Mac and Win. I wrote to support. If I get some clue I'll post here.
