I have left university on July 2010 where I studied web design (as we all know you learn more by your self but that’s not the issue at the moment). Since then I have not managed to find a job (apart from a one month work experience), from the way things are going, and by taking into account the fact that all my university friends are in the same situation, I don’t think that I am going to find a job soon (within the industry) Now as we all do, even though I don’t have a job, I am still working on personal projects and try to keep up to date (I don’t need a job or uni to do this) – but I am thinking, because there is not work available, would it be worth going back to uni for a master degree? I know I don’t need it and I know that is unlikely that I will learn anything important, as I believe in self learning, and in most cases it is a lot more effective (but I have to say I don’t mind going back to school) The only reason I am thinking of doing the master is, (and this is where I need your help): If it takes me a year to get a job, then on the interview, would the employer think “what the hell did this guy do since he left university” – now if I go to university that would solve this problem. Or I’m I making up a problem that does not exist Plus, I know that employers need examples of sites that I have been working on, at the moment I only have 3 (as when working on personal projects, where their is not time limit I tend drag things in order to get them perfect, and they never get perfect) – so by going back to uni, then this problem maybe solved I said all this as I have read a lot about the fact that you don’t need to have a masters degree to work on web design market (and I totally agree) but considering my concern, the question is should I do a masters course to avoid just spending hours in my room working and learning in my own (but that it would be hard to convince employers that I was really learning in my room) Maybe because I’m still young age 22 not that old anyway :), but I don’t have the “dream” of being rich, so if I were to tell the truth I don’t really care of the fact that I don’t have a job (at the moment), because regardless, I am working on what I love every day, but I know that in the future when I will need the job I may find it harder to get one, if I neglect doing so now Every time I ask a question that I’m not sure about, I keep going on and on, but I really hope you get what I am trying to get across. By the way the course that I am looking at for a masters says that it would teach me how to do these: e-commerce e-government e-science e-learning I don’t know any of them, a part from e-commerce Thanks
