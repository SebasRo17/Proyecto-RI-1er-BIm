**Is ParallelMap and Parallelize@Map expected to work with Sow and Reap construct.** _This is a rather brief toy code to find all Primes just to force the use of Sow/Reap inside Map_               Reap[Map[        If[PrimeQ@#, Sow@#] &,        Range[10]        ]][[2]]      and the output is, as expected               {{2, 3, 5, 7}}      But when I do               Reap[Parallelize@Map[         If[PrimeQ@#, Sow@#] &,         Range[1000]         ]][[2]]      I got the output               {}      And the same was the output when I ran               Reap[       ParallelMap[        If[PrimeQ@#, Sow@#] &,        Range[10]        ]       ][[2]]      **2 questions :** 1) How is this explainable ? 2) If this is the case, how do I efficiently I spawn parallel jobs which accumulate something ?
