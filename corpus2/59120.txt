This seems to me to be a common task, and the more surprised I was to not have found much on this. Suppose I have an expression `f` in spherical coordinates `r,theta,phi`, and want to compute partial derivatives of `f` with respect to Cartesian coordinates `x,y,z`, but with the result expressed in `r,theta,phi` again. I have solved it by defining the following function (in Mathematica 10):               myD[f_,n_Integer/;n>=1&&n<=3]:=       With[{jac=Transpose@CoordinateTransformData["Spherical"->"Cartesian","InverseMappingJacobian",{r,theta,phi}]},         jac[[n]].(D[f,#]&/@{r,theta,phi})     ]      With this I can compute $\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}$ by writing `myD[f,3]`. Take for example `f=r`, you should get: $$ \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}=myD[f,3]=\frac{\partial r}{\partial z}=\frac{z}{r}=\frac{r\cos\theta}{r}=\cos\theta $$ I was wondering if this is really the way to go for such a mundane task? I suspect that there is a nicer functionality built into Mathematica which I am not aware of. Does anyone have an idea?
