I am hiring a PHP developer to build me a website. Their rate is 70$ an hour. He seems to have a good portfolio and experience. How do I know that I get a good website that is scalable and easy to maintain? Do I ask them to give me code samples so I can review it (I am a programmer but I did not do much PHP)? What are good credentials for a PHP developer? experience with Drupal? LAMP?
