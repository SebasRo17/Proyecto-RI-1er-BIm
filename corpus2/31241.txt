I have a polygon:               Polygon[{{0, 200 }, {200, 100}, {500, 300}, {100, 700}}]      How can I figure out its area? The docs page does not have any example. So far I've reached this point with no success:               Needs["Polytopes`"]     Area[Polygon[{{0, 200 }, {200, 100}, {500, 300}, {100, 700}}]];      Concerning `Area`, the documentation states: > Area[polygon]   >  $\ \ \ \ \ $ gives the area of polygon polygon, when the edges of polygon > have unit length. So it is possible that my question really should be **how to set unit length on edges of polygon?**
