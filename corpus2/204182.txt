I have seen on a number of resumes the term "virtualization." While every resume is unique, what does the broader term or skill of "virtualization" mean or imply? I feel that the ability to install virtual machines is not the only thing that this means. I have installed VMs and in my experience it was mostly following instructions. Is there something else to it that I'm missing, like actually _programming_ virtual machines? Is there an implied IT expertise on the issue, or relevant programming knowledge?
