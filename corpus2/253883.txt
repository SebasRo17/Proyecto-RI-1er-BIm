I am developing an angularjs app. The app has to run in current FF, IE, Chrome and on iOS/Android via Phonegap. I am looking for a solution to store data in the client. Phonegap offers a web sql api, that is also supported by Chrome. FF however does not support it, since it is abbandoned by w3c. Cookies and localStorage do not work reliable in iOS. How can i store data in all those browsers?
