I'm a .NET developer who's eying up new jobs for a change of pace. My career so far has led me to become quite proficient with C#, WPF, WinForms, MSSQL, and all kinds of goodies in the .NET framework including Entities, Parallel Tasks, etc. However one thing that I'm obviously lacking is ASP skills. Nearly every job in my area (Minneapolis/St.Paul) requires strong, 3+ years experience with ASP.NET. I feel confident in my ability to pick up new technologies, especially in the .NET world, however with ASP I'm not sure where to start. As with most things in .NET, there's probably the hard, old way to do things, and the new, elegant way to things. Just firing up the templates in VS2008, there are several ASP templates that implement various technologies such as Entities. I have no idea where to start. So, alluding to the title of this post, I'm looking for a crash course in ASP. Given that it's a web technology, I'm having trouble thinking of a side project as an excuse to learn it as I would with otherwise. Can anyone give me a landmark as to what I should focus on learning? Is there a good amount of ASP stuff I can ignore? Related, is there a more recent starting point that I could begin with that would give me an edge over the tired ASP guys stuck doing things the old ways? :P Just looking for a little guidance. Thank you much!
