I'm in the process of building a .NET MVC website where a requirement is that admin users should be able to lock accounts to not only prevent future log-ins but to also immediately revoke access to the site for a given authenticated user. Locking the account is easy, but is there an established method of preventing access immediately in this type of scenario. Is it a case of checking on each request whether the requester's account is locked in the db and then clearing the authentication cookie if required? I'd appreciate any pointers anyone has.
