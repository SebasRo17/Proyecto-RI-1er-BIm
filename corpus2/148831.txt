Is it considered bad practice (and how bad) to run different JavaScript for IE? Currently im writing some JavaScript and the simplist way to work arround IE quirks seems to be to check for browser version and run different code               var browserName = navigator.appName;          if (browserName == "Microsoft Internet Explorer") {       //Do some stuff     }     else     {     //Do other stuff     }      It's quick and works well but does lead to duplication of code and feels "hacky".
