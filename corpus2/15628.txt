How can I maintain proficiency (if not expertise) in multiple languages? In any large organization it seems necessary to know more than one language. For example, this week I've looked at if not written code in the following languages.   * VBA   * C   * C#   * Java Thankfully they're all imperative languages, or I would have lost my mind. I struggled for a day or so with the C as it's been a while (read: years) since I've used it seriously. What tips, habits, and training is there for keeping up your knowledge in so many languages?
