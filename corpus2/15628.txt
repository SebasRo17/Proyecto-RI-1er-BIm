(I'm using _Mathematica_ 8.) I have a Taylor series:               poly = Normal[Series[E^x, {x, 0, 10}]]      I want to produce a log-linear plot of the error. This is easy enough with the following code:               LogPlot[Abs[E^x - poly], {x, -1, 1}]      This produces ![a log-linear plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/T4sqC.png) Now, I want to plot even smaller values of the error (in particular I want the plot to be sensible near zero), so I tell `LogPlot` to use high precision as follows:               LogPlot[Abs[E^x - poly], {x, -1, 1}, WorkingPrecision -> 30]      However this destroys the labeling on the y-axis: ![bad behavior of LogPlot\[\]](http://i.stack.imgur.com/THXrl.png) Does anyone know what has gone wrong here? How do I fix it?
