I have a system of equations and I want to solve it to get x, y $$\begin{cases} u= C_{1}+(x-C_{1})(1+k_{1}((x-C_{1})(x-C_{1})+(y-C_{2})(y-C_{2}))) \\\ \\\ v= C_{2}+(y-C_{2})(1+k_{2}((x-C_{1})(x-C_{1})+(y-C_{2})(y-C_{2}))) \end{cases}$$ If it possible I want to know how can it can be done in C++ too. Update: `Solve[]` gives me very large output, so the problem is that I want to place solution in my C++ aplication and $C_1$, $C_2$, $k_1$, $k_2$ are variables. `CForm[]` doesn't help, I need more simple and suitable form for C++ to use.
