I recently asked about leaving a position and got a lot of great answers. One of the common threads was that being around to train the new person would be expected and could go a long way. Now considering that (I think) most people don't stay at a company for a long time after they've given notice, and it will take time for the company to interview/hire one - that leaves for a short amount of time to get someone up to speed. I've also never trained anyone before. I did a bunch of tutoring in University and College, but teaching a language/technology is far different from training someone to replace you on your job. So the question is: how do you go about training someone to replace you in a, potentially, short amount of time?
