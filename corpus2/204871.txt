I've decided to customize my VS12 to perfectly mirror my wishes. However, due to the lack of time, I'd like to start by just simply adding some code snippets first. Addins and such will have to wait until fall. :( So, basically, I'd like to type _hazaa_ and get some (preferably, but not necessarily, tab-jumpable) text saying _yo, dude_. Something like _prop_ spits out a stub for a property (with tab-jumpable parts of it being optional). I've found this tutorial and I wonder if that's the quickest way to start creating ones own code snippets. If so, I can as well do it right from the ground but it'd be nice to have something Q&D to start with. Also, I can't really evaluate how well that article adapts to the modern capabilities of VS12 (and the upcoming VS13). It'd be a blast if somebody with experience of that shed some light on the matter.   1. Is the article the quickest way to automatic code generation?   2. Is the article a reliable and updated way to customizing VS12/13?   3. Is there a better resource for my plans and, in such case, where?
