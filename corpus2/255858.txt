I trying to find some historic evidence about protocols or formats that had different implementations where the interoperability led to problems we might still see today or bugs in implementations that became features. What I am trying to do, is to convince people to invest in a reference implementation of a format to avoid problems of interoperability. Best would be to provide examples from the past that didn't go so well, and caused many problems. For example STMP EHLO vs. HELO. As I remember EHLO is Microsoft only. thanks for your ideas.
