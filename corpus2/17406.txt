I have a data file that is the solution of the laplace equation on a rectangular area, which has three columns: x, y and z with their numerical values. How do I plot this data into a vector field with vectors in z direction with magnitude from the third column? When I import that data as "Table", is gives me a list of lists, i.e. {{x1,y1,z1},{},...,{}}, which makes it unsuitable to use with `ListVectorPlot3D[]`... Cheers //edit I would like to use the imported data to interpret it as a vector field and calculate its rotation.
