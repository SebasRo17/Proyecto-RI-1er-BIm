I am working on one of my first projects in C (microcontroller code) which is split up into multiple C files. I noticed some inconsistency in my coding where I had some variables declared as extern global variables and would just access them directly (ISR and some other places), and others declared static global variables, and would then accesses them from different files using function calls. What is the best way to do this? Should I always keep the scope as small as possible even if it means adding extra functions just to set or read the values? Or should I just make them global across all files and just access them directly.
