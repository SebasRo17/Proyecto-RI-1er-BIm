Where is there a good description of the use of the word 'scope' in computer science? In this post of a question about the Java final reserved word one responder implies that scope is textual so each iteration of a `for` loop causes a scope to be resumed as current. Another responder implies scope is time dependent so each iteration is a new scope. In those contexts, it was possible to understand what scope meant even though different people use the word differently but sometimes when I am reading a programming book I am not sure what scope means. What are good qualifiers for the word 'scope'? I suggest 'textual' is one. Can you think of others? Should a qualifier almost always be used or is there a general understanding about contexts that help one perfectly infer the the intended meaning? How is the word 'scope' used when speaking of objects (and object oriented programming) and what qualifiers might be necessary?
