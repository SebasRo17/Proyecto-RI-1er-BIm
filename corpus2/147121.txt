I'm currently a second year undergraduate Computer Science student. I'm having a hard time deciding to either apply for an internship or spend the summer back home, working on some fields I feel I haven't yet got a good grasp of (OOP, algorithms) + working on one or two open source projects I found really attractive. I don't really care about getting paid from doing the internship, I'm only looking for experience. I'll still do an internship next year since it's mandatory (University rules) and most probably the year after. What weighs more for an employer and what would benefit me most in the long run?
