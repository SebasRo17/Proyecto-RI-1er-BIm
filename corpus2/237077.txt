What strategies can be used to read every row in a large **Oracle** table, **only once** , but as fast as possible with JDBC & Java ? Consider that each row has non-trivial amounts of data (30 columns, including large text in some columns). Some strategies I can think of are:   * Single thread and read table. (Too slow, but listed for clarity)   * Read the id's into ConcurrentLinkedQueue, use threads to consume queue and query by id in batches.   * Read id's into a JMS queue, use workers to consume queue and query by id in batches. What other strategies could be used ? _For the purpose of this question assume processing of rows to be free._
