There's a lot of questions about hiring interviews, but the same cannot be said about exit interviews. As I'm going to embark on a new challenge in the near future, I'm going to go through an exit interview. My question is - **what should you say in an exit interview and what should you avoid?** For privacy reasons, and because this question doesn't only apply to me, I'm not going to give specifics. I'll get started - I think it's OK to complain about:   * infrastructure (i.e. hardware used)   * overtime (if it's regular)   * unreasonable deadlines But not about:   * management :)   * remuneration These are just off-the-top-of-my-head examples. My opinion is that you shouldn't burn any bridges when you leave, especially if the company you're leaving is really OK, but also remaining silent over existing issues defeats the purpose of the feedback - maybe some of the suggestions or complaints will be considered and fixed. I hope this is the right place to ask this :)
