1. What is the necessity to use lambda functions and expressions in C++?   2. Can you explain or show through examples how to use lambda functions and expressions?   3. I already gone through the related Wikipedia page, but I got only few ideas regarding this. Are there more resources I can read? May I know which compilers will fully support this lambda feature? Some answers I found are VS10 and GCC5 compilers. Is there any online compilers which are supporting this feature?
