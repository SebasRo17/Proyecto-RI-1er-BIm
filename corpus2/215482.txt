In _JavaScript: The Good Parts_ by Douglas Crockford, he mentions in his inheritance chapter, > The other benefit of classical inheritance is that it includes the > specification of a system of types. This mostly frees the programmer from > having to write explicit casting operations, which is a very good thing > because when casting, the safety benefits of a type system are lost. So first of all, what actually is safety? protection against data corruption, or hackers, or system malfunctions, etc.? What are the safety benefits of a type system? What makes a type system different that allows it to provide these safety benefits?
