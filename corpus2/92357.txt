What has key/value stores got to do with making database sharding easier? Because if I do not use a key/value store, I can easily shard my database too right? (Like say, I can easily say users with names that start with this character will have their data stored in this server, and those tables themselves aren't key/value stores. so what exactly had key/value stores got to do with database sharding?)
