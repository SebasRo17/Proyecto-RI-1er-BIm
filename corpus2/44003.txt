I'm having a great deal of trouble getting started on a weekly homework assignment in _Mathematica_. The assignment requires we use the epsilon tensor which is apparently built into _Mathematica_ as `Signature`. My _Mathematica_ skills are woefully inadequate, and I'm an external student so I can't consult with my peers. The first question is meant to ease us into the assignment, but after looking through _Mathematica_ documentation center, StackExchange answers and other tutorials from other universities I'm no closer to being able to complete it. If anyone could tell me how to do this first question I should be able to work through the rest of the assignment, but at the moment I just can't get started. The question (which should be simple, it's weighted very small) is: > ![http://imgur.com/fKwhPan](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HVtat.png)
