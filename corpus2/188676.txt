I used to work on a document workflow system, and it basically implemented a half-baked version control system for documents; using a database for versioning information and a filestore for the files. It was a lot of code, and hard to maintain. There were all sorts of bugs with locking and similar things, you name it. If I had to rewrite it from scratch, I would seriously consider using git as my data store. It occurred to me that I haven't read much about git (and most version control systems) being used in application implementations, as versioned data stores. What applications use git, or another VCS, behind the scenes for storing and versioning data?
