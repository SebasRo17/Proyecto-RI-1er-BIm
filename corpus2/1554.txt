I thought of a possible answer to Monitor doesn't work with ParallelTable but it doesn't work as I hoped it would. This accumulates print cells instead of deleting them as intended. Can it be fixed?               ParallelTable[       NotebookDelete[x]; x = PrintTemporary[i];       Pause[1]; i,       {i, 1, 15}     ]      I thought that `x` would be local to each kernel, and this would print four cells (for four cores) that would be deleted and replaced with each iteration. I then thought that the value of `x` was lost between iterations, but this also fails to delete the print cells:               ParallelTable[       x = PrintTemporary[i]; NotebookDelete[x];       Pause[1]; i,       {i, 1, 15}     ]
