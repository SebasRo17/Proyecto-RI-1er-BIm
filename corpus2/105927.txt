I worked for a small company as a long term contractor making websites and other such things. A client comes along, pays what he said was "A lot of money" for me to spend a week doing his website. He paid it to the company. I didn't see any of his money, I've since left that job because they owe me months of back pay and it looks like I'm not going to end up getting much of it. (Bad situation) I want to consider the possibility now of exploring who owns any work I did that was unpaid, because if I need to, I can use it as leverage to help get my owed money. The company is still using some work in-house that's unpaid which I'm a lot clearer about contesting rights to. What's I'm struggling with is working out what to do about the clients website. From his POV he paid for it, it's his. From my POV I did it and didn't get paid for it so it's mine. Who owns it? If I do, I wouldn't want to strip it away from him, it seems really unfair, but I would like to use it as leverage if it comes to that.
