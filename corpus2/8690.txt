The basic problem I have been running into is making readable code, where in other languages I am more familiar with I might have been using class or struct like objects. For example, you can imagine I might want to create a circle object, which would, at the very least, store the radius and position of the circle. In an object-oriented language, I might access the $x$-coordinate of the center of the circle using something like `circ.pos.x`. In Mathematica, however, I find myself using nothing more than nested lists, and as a result, wind up with code looking something like `circ[[2]][[1]]` (`circ[[1]]` is the radius and `circ[[2]]` is the position vector, say). You can imagine how code like this could become very unreadable very fast. Presumably, this is because I'm not 'doing it right'. So, then, what is the 'right' way to implement something like this? Does Mathematica support built- in object-oriented features I'm not aware of?
