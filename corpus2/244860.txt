Is it possible to use somehow WebGL to fasten up 1d range searching? I need to find overlapping date intervals, and I thought that 3d games usually have a very similar problem by rendering frames... _I read ofinterval trees as an alternative if this idea does not work, but I am open for suggestions...   Btw. if stackoverflow would be a better place for this question, pls let me know!_
