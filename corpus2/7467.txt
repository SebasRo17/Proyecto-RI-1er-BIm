I would like a function which returns replacement rules as some internal mathematica functions are doing and use the results in other functions. I could not find any information on that and I'm wondering if it is a good idea after all. I'm not sure how this is done in a good way. Here is an example:               Clear[f, f2, H, imax, res]     f[imax_] :=       Block[{H}, H = Table[Random[], {i, 1, imax}];        Return[{H -> H, imax -> imax}]]     f[5]      with the result               {{0.855859, 0.656278, 0.793888, 0.275233, 0.751709} -> {0.855859,       0.656278, 0.793888, 0.275233, 0.751709}, 5 -> 5}      Yes this is obvious but I would like to use the name H internally and also in the returned replacement rule. So I do this instead:               f2[imax_] :=       Block[{H}, H = Table[Random[], {i, 1, imax}];        Return[{"H" -> H, "imax" -> imax}]]     res = Table[f2[imax], {imax, 5, 7}]     (*now i want to invesgate the result with imax=6*)     p = First @Flatten[Position[res, "imax" -> 6]]     res[[p]]     Head["H"] /. res[[p]]      with the result:               {{"H" -> {0.486493, 0.60306, 0.666644, 0.148913, 0.598069},      "imax" ->       5}, {"H" -> {0.873354, 0.98408, 0.0392209, 0.428918, 0.485521,      0.710918},      "imax" ->      6}, {"H" -> {0.198376, 0.385448, 0.438549, 0.818111, 0.314781,      0.533971, 0.955322}, "imax" -> 7}}          2          {"H" -> {0.873354, 0.98408, 0.0392209, 0.428918, 0.485521, 0.710918},       "imax" -> 6}          String      So the Problem is that Head["H"] /. res[[p]] results in a string and ListPlot["H"] /. res[[p]] would complain but plot the result. A good thing tough is that it is possible to search in the results and it is more flexible and readable than returning a List. So what is the best way to do this? So that I can use H and imax internally in the function and in the Return?
