Interviewers often ask questions about testing a random feature in Excel, Word, Notepad etc.. I am someone who will be interviewing for a SDET position and has a SDE background not specifically SDET background. I am extremely interested in testing though so applied for a SDET position. So how should one go about testing a random feature in a software, especially word/excel/notepad kind of software? Exploratory testing? What about a feature like File-> open dialog in word/Excel/ How to tackle such interview questions? What is an interviewer specifically looking for in an experienced candidate when he/she asks such questions?
