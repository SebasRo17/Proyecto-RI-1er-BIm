I'm currently going to write something to **automatically create invoices** with cronjobs by using PHP and timestamps. I have a, for me, **well-considered idea** of how to solve it, but I want to ask the community **if someone may see errors in reasoning** and **possible problems with my solution**. I'm trying to describe my idea as detailed as possible so everyone can follow my way of thinking: In General there are **4 types of invoices** :   1. Paid yearly   2. Paid semiyearly   3. Paid quarterly   4. Paid monthly **Purchased products are saved in a SQL database** with the billing cycle:   * ID of User   * Product ID   * Billing Cycle   * Last Due Date Now there is a cronjob that runs once a day to check if it should create a new invoice for each purchased product. In the row `Last Due Date` I save the timestamp of the first date to pay when it's created. A code I already wrote calculates the **time that has gone by** since the `Last Due Date` timestamp and outputs something like this:   * Timestamp is in past or in future   * Month gone by   * Days gone by Now my **rules for creating a new invoice** are:   1. **Paid yearly** if ( Timestamp is in past = true AND Month gone by = **11** AND Days gone by >= 20 ) then ( create a new invoice and set "Last Due Date" to time() )   2. **Paid semiyearly** if ( Timestamp is in past = true AND Month gone by = **5** AND Days gone by >= 20 ) then ( create a new invoice and set "Last Due Date" to time() )   3. **Paid quarterly** if ( Timestamp is in past = true AND Month gone by = **3** AND Days gone by >= 20 ) then ( create a new invoice and set "Last Due Date" to time() )   4. **Paid monthly** if ( Timestamp is in past = true AND Month gone by = **0** AND Days gone by >= 20 ) then ( create a new invoice and set "Last Due Date" to time() ) As you can see a new **invoice would be created ~10 days before date of payment** and the timestamp in `Last Due Date` is set to the current time, so when the cronjob checks back the next day no invoice will be created for this purchased product. My question is **if this is an appropriate way of solving** this and if you can **see any errors in reasoning or problems that may occur**?
