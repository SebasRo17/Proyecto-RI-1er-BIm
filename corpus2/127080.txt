I am a contractor to a big company. Currently, there are three developers on the project, myself included. The problem is the other 2 developers don't really get it. By "it" i mean the following:   * They don't understand the best practices for the technology we are using. After 6 months of me and others giving them examples there are terrible anti-patterns being used.   * They are "copy and paste" programmers that produce primarily spaghetti code.   * They _constantly_ break things, implementing changes but not doing a basic smoke test to see if all is good   * They refuse/rarely to ask for code-reviews.    * They refuse/rarely even do basic things like formatting code.   * No documentation on any classes (jsdocs)    * Afraid to delete code that doesn't do anything   * Leave commented code blocks everywhere even though we have version control. I find myself getting more and more frustrated as I format others code, fix bugs, discover functionality that is broken, and create abstractions to remove the spaghetti. I really don't know what to do. I try not to get to frustrated, but it's just a mess. I like these people as people, but I feel like the coding situation is so bad that I could move faster if they simply browsed the web all day. Would it be out of line to ask our manager to review the others svn commit access; commits can only be done after a review by someone who is knowledgeable in what we are doing? As a contractor, I'm not sure if that's the best move. Is there a subtle/not so subtle way of making it clear how many things I am fixing?
