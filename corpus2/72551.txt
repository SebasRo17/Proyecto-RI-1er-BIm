I built a VS Installer project in Visual Studio 2008. I see in VS 2010 they have InstallShield LE available as an alternative. I used InstallShield long ago as part of Borland Delphi, but haven't really looked at the latest version. I am time constrained and don't want to spend a lot of time digging into it if it's not worth it. Can anyone provide the pros and cons of using it vs. the VS Installer tool? I don't want want to have re-make my installer unless there's a really compelling reason to do so. Thanks, Michael
