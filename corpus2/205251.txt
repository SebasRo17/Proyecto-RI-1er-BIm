Are there any languages where something like the following might be possible?               people = [ ... a list of people ...]     Person jake = Person("Jake", 165, ...)     jake is Tall     people.add(jake)     for Person person in people where Tall:         // ... do something terrible to them     jake is not Tall // ... Jake no longer wishes to be tall      I hope that makes sense - basically, dynamic adjectives that affect something about an object's properties or methods.
