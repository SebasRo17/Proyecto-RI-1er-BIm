In many projects these days most of the novel code consists of glue code that helps combine dozens of different libraries, plugins and helpers that are licensed under a variety of open source licenses. In many cases the licenses are fairly obvious as they carry the name of the license in the license file or comment. In others this is a bit harder and requires memorizing certain wordings to tell the more common licenses apart. I am wondering: Is there an easy way to recognize particularly the very similar licenses (say, MIT/BSD-2/BSD-3) without having to memorize complete license texts or check out the OSI copies as reference?
