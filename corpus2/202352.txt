This is referring to a discussion in an answer and the comments of this question: What's with the aversion to documentation in the industry?. The answer claimed that "code can't lie" and thus should be the go-to location instead of documentation. Several comments pointed out that "code can lie". There is truth on both sides, at least partly because of how poorly and inappropriately documentation is handled. Should we be on the lookout for lying code, comparing it against any existing documentation? Or is it usually the best source for what it needs to be doing? If it is agile code, is it less likely to lie, or can that code not lie at all?
