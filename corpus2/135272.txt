I was wondering whether it is possible to give any advice as the the maximum number of lines of code at which one should consider switching from say MATLAB to a more low level language? Is it even the case that at a certain point it makes more sense to manage a certain degree of complexity of a given program in a proper object oriented language rather then MATLAB? I should say I am a newbie in both MATLAB and Java, so I have no hidden agenda in this question even though I m aware of the heated discussions that people sometimes engage in over whether MATLAB is a proper programming language. I'm not experienced enough to even think about participating in such an exchange and I'm just looking for advice whether there is a cut off point where one really needs to go to a different language? Also I should add I understand the code may become longer when you move to lower level, however I was under the impression that object oriented programming makes it easier to manage the complexity of bigger programs. (Maybe lines of code was a bad choice as a proxy for complexity?) Is the choice of low vs. high level just one of performance? (which in the end you have to pay for with a bigger programming task at your hands for the low level language?)
