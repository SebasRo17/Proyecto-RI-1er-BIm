I want to sort (or sortby) the list. List contains uninitialized variable m and I can assume that `m` is a Natural number that is much larger then any constant. Example input:               a = {-116*m, 0, 3 - 11*m, 1 - m, -20*m - 7, -m}      Example output:               {-116*m, -20*m - 7, 3 - 11*m, -m, 1 - m, 0}      My effort:               MAGICNUMBER = 1000000;     Sort[a, (#1 /. m -> MAGICNUMBER) < (#2 /. m -> MAGICNUMBER) &]
