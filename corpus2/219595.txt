I have been investigating the implementation of XML-RPC in Java. The major open-source libraries (e.g. Apache XML-RPC) use raw types to represent certain XML-RPC types in Java, e.g. structs are represented as raw Maps. Raw types in new code are discouraged in Java. From the JLS, > The use of raw types is allowed only as a concession to compatibility of > legacy code. The use of raw types in code written after the introduction of > genericity into the Java programming language is strongly discouraged. It is > possible that future versions of the Java programming language will disallow > the use of raw types. But, because of the nature of the XML-RPC protocol, are raw types unavoidable in this case?
