I want to start a bit of freelancing in web development using ASP.NET MVC3 and PHP and I already have some people who are interested in hiring me, but I still can't figure out how much to charge for projects since I have never done it. For example how much would this site cost? Would it cost more if the author built it from scratch instead of using WordPress as the CMS? Or what about a simpler site like this? How much time spent is considered good/normal for building sites like these? And maybe some freelancers with experience can tell me what the usual requests are that they get from clients. What sites are the most in demand? I'm asking because I'm a student and I really can't work every day in a full- time job but I need the money so I guess a little freelancing would help me out.
