There are two ways to use a CopyOnWriteArraySet:               // A     Set<Object> set = new CopyOnWriteArraySet<>();      and               // B     CopyOnWriteArraySet<Object> set = new CopyOnWriteArraySet<>();      With 'normal' sets like HashSet and TreeSet, case A is preferred, because it allows easy switching of the Set implementation. However, in this case a conscious choice is made for a specific thread-safe Set implementation. Should I use case B to signify this intent?
