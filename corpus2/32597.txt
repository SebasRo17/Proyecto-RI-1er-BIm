If I have a bunch of numbers in a list `{1.435243523432,2434.2321321412,5.8239897,...}`, without multiplying everything by some power of ten and then dividing by that power later, is there an argument I can supply to `Round` that will round each number at the $k$th decimal place (or do nothing if the number isn't defined to that precision)? For example, if we set $k = 3$ we'd like something like:               DecimalRound[{1.435243523432,2434.2321321412,5.8239897,...},3] = {1.435,2434.232,5.824,...}
