For example, in functional languages, **variables** are single assignment and their values are immutable once assigned. So they have two states **unbound** and **bound** , once bound they can't be changed. Is there some mathematical term or other computer science term that is most appropriate for such as thing? Something that **semantically** doesn't imply variance or mutability. If not there doesn't exist such as term and if you were designing a language that had such constructs, what other than the word **variable** would you use to for these? I am **not** really looking to **poll** for ideas, I am trying to figure out if there is already an accepted industry ( any industry ) term for such a thing.
