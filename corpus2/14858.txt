I've evaluated this code:               plot = Plot[x, {x, 0, 10}];     g = Rasterize[plot, ImageResolution -> 300];      Everything looks good except the ticks (on the axes); they are invisible! It seems that _Mathematica_ draws ticks in a default size on the scaled image, and after the image is scaled down, they are made too small to be distinguished at all. The more `ImageResoltion` I specify, the smaller the ticks are and the less pleasing the image is. How can I get the axes ticks to look right?
