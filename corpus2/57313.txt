When using Graphics, I can change the color of the object with the use of Mouseover.                   Graphics[{Opacity[0.9], {Mouseover[{Red, #}, {Green, #}]}} & /@ {Disk[{0, 0}],          Text["Moi", {1.5, 0}], Disk[{3, 0}]}]         (*Objects change color *)      When trying the same approach with Geographics               countries = {"Spain", "Belgium", "Romania"};     GeoGraphics[{GeoStyling[Opacity[0.5]],        Mouseover[{Red,        Tooltip[Polygon[{Entity["Country", #]}], #]}, {Green,        Tooltip[Polygon[{Entity["Country", #]}], #]}]} & /@ countries]      Graphics are displayed but when mouse hovers on top of a country polygon, then an error message will toggle on the screen stating that "Coordinate Entity["Country","Spain"] should be a pair of numbers..... What is the correct approach to make the polygon representing the country change colors when selected?
