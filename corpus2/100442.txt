We used a contractor to create the initial version of our site; they used their own MVC-pattern code-generator to create the (ASP.NET / C#) site and customized from there. That was turned over to us two years ago, and we've been working on it since. That's the environment I'm coming into, with little practical MVC experience. Thus I need to grok MVC in general but it seems that every article/tutorial/book I find is either extremely general in nature or very specific to MS ASP.NET MVC. Can someone here help with examples, a tutorial or walk-through of setting up a basic site using the MVC Pattern _without using Microsoft ASP.NET MVC_ so that I can better understand the concepts and see how they can be applied in real life?
