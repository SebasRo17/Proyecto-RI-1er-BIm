I am new to _Mathematica_ , and I'm looking for a way to create patterns on the surface of 3D objects. One thing I have not been able to do is create a hexagonal mesh on a torus. What I would like to have is a hexagonal mesh that has a certain thickness (so it would be 3D printable). So far, I have been able to create the torus itself. I am not sure of how to create the hexagonal pattern on the surface and the process of mapping it onto the torus.               ParametricPlot3D[{Cos[t] (3 + Cos[u]), Sin[t] (3 + Cos[u]), Sin[u]},       {t, 0, 2 Pi}, {u, 0, 2 Pi}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cD6Fm.png)
