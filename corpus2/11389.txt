Consider a polynomial sequence $\{p_n\}$ generated by some (simple) rule: $$ \begin{array}{l} p_1(x)=x \\ p_2(x)=2 x-x^2 \\ p_3(x)= x^3-3 x^2+3 x \\ p_4(x)=-x^4+4 x^3-6 x^2+4 x \\ p_5(x)= x^5-5 x^4+10 x^3-10 x^2+5 x \\ p_6(x)= -x^6+6 x^5-15 x^4+20 x^3-15 x^2+6 x \\ p_7(x)= x^7-7 x^6+21 x^5-35 x^4+35 x^3-21 x^2+7 x \\ p_8(x)= -x^8+8 x^7-28 x^6+56 x^5-70 x^4+56 x^3-28 x^2+8 x \\ p_9(x)= x^9-9 x^8+36 x^7-84 x^6+126 x^5-126 x^4+84 x^3-36 x^2+9 x \\ p_{10}(x)= -x^{10}+10 x^9-45 x^8+120 x^7-210 x^6+252 x^5-210 x^4+120 x^3-45 x^2+10 x \\ \end{array} $$ Suppose we have only the above list of ten polynomials in expanded form. Is it possible to make Mathematica derive a formula that generates $p_n$ (I mean to get $p_n=1-(1-x)^n$ in this particular case)? Note that something like ` FullSimplify[Expand[1 - (1 - x)^5]] ` does not give the desired result, so at least it would be nice to see how to get `1 - (1 - x)^5` from here...
