I try to run mathematica on a grid. Since this is my first time working on a cluster, I have no plan what to do. I have to run a job (pbs-file).               #!/bin/sh     #     #PBS -q express          module load math/mathematica/9.0.1          echo "Started"     mathematica 'pi.m'     echo "Ended"          exit 0      I got always the error : "Can not open display". Anyone know what to do? The file pi.m looks like:               N[ Pi, 1000 ] >>"pi_result.txt"     Quit[ ]
