Personally, I break out in hives if I don't put ADO objects that implement IDisposable in using statements. But at my current contract, I've found that their homegrown enterprise framework "data access provider" code does not 1) implement IDisposable and 2) call Dispose() on anything it uses, at any point, ever. Users have been complaining a great deal about performance issues in the Winforms applications that heavily use this framework for data access, and though there are a LOT of other problems in the code that could be hitting performance, this one just screams at me and is more low-hanging-fruit than the others. So, beyond saying something like "Dispose is there for a reason, use it," what can I tell these people to convince them that this is really, really bad?
