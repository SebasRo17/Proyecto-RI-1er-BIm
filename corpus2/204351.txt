I have a (browser based) web application. On each page, I want to have a little label and link in a corner that displays the user's username and other account information along with a logout button. The information that will be displayed is immutable. Should I store that account information in session attributes when a user logs in and forget about it or should I use a filter/interceptor and load it on each request in the request attributes?
