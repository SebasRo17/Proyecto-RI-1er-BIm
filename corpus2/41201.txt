I couldn't find a similar question so I decided to ask this one. I have a nested list with many sublists of equal length. To make things easier let's say it's like that:               list={{2,1,7},{3,9,5},{4,8,6}}      I'd like to get a list of last elements from each sublist, in this case: > {7,5,6} I'm not sure whether i should think of a pattern to do this or is there a simpler way?
