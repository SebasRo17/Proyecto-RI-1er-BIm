I'm really confused about what's going wrong with my call to FindInstance:               In[47]:= FindInstance[                MatrixRank[{{0, 1, 1}, {1, 0, 1}, {(-1)^i1, 1, 0}}] == 3,                 {i1}, Integers]          Out[47]:={{i1 -> 33}}      The matrix `{{0,1,1},{1,0,1},{-1,1,0}}` has rank 2. Also when I repeat the above call with the `MatrixRank` function set equal to 2, `FindInstance` returns `{}`. What am I missing??
