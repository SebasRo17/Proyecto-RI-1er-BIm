Blend modes (or Mixing modes) in digital image editing are used to determine how two layers are blended into each other. Version 8 has functionality to perform binary and basic alpha blending but nothing for the other standard blend modes (ImageCompose only works with two layers). So the question is: How can I extend ImageCompose to work with multiple layers with masks in any the standard modes such as Dissolve, Darken, or Soft Light... etc?
