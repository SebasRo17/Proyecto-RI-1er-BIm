I'm having a discussion with a fellow developer, and I'm trying to argument this in something like a short "term". SoC (Separation of Concerns) is pretty straight forward design practice, but it dwells deeper. If we want to pick on it's deep corners, we can Google it and there are plenty of articles that pop up, and after taking a glimpse, we know a lot more, and might find some examples. But, what about "Use procedures that execute a single task"? That's also a great design principle to use when writing applications and it becomes more and more rewarding, the larger the application gets. Is there a term for _Use procedures that execute a single task_?
