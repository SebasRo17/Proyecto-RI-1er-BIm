I'm currently mentoring a small team of 4 junior dev in small software company. They are very smart and often achieve their tasks with a high-quality job but I'm sure they still can do better - actually I have exactly the same feeling for myself :) -. Besides some of them are more "junior" than other. So I would like to find of a funny way to improve their CS skills (design, coding, testing, algorithmic...) in addition to the experience they acquire in their daily work. For instance, I was thinking of setting up weekly sessions, not longer than 2 hours, where we could get together to work on challenging CS exercises. A bit like a coding dojo. I'm sure the team would enjoy that but is it really a good idea? Would it be efficient in a professional context? They already spend all their week to code so how should I organize that in order for them to get some benefits? Any feedback welcome !
