I'm creating a RESTfull service for a tree-like resource structure and was wondering what the best URL structure would be? I have three requirements:   1. be able to get a collection of root resources    2. be able to get an individual resource    3. be able to get a collection of child resources My current thought is:               /rest/documents     /rest/documents/{id}     /rest/documents/{id}/documents      I was also thinking of going the singular / plural routes to denote lists or individual elements, but I know I'm going to have a resource that is the same plural as it is singular, so decided against this. Does anybody have any thoughts on the above? or have a different / better way of structuring this? Many thanks Matt
