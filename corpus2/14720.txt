Imagine yourself hired by a new startup backed with few millions coming from venture capitalists. Your mission: `organize the development of the next killer app`. 25 developers is too much to take care of each individually, so **what decision(s) you would make to motivate them?** _I will appreciate any answers from stock options to free cookies ;)_ Of course the trick here (unless you are really a manager of a such startup), is put yourself in the shoes of one of those programmers. EDIT: it's an imaginary context. The purpose of this story is to stimulate your wishes. I want to capture what motivates developers.
