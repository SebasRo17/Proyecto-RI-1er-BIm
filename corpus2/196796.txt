I am maintaining a small code base that I am considering sellingâ€“ but I want to allow developers that use it to submit code for addition to the trunk. This way they can extend the framework and the community can benefit. I want them to retain copyright to their code, but to allow me to use it however I desire, for commercial and non-commercial purposes. I don't want to be obligated to release any submitted source(although as copyright holders they may). The end user product will be binary distributions of the compiled code base. Is there a good existing license for a project of this nature? I could compromise a little to use an existing license which does not fully match this, if it will save me the legal headache.
