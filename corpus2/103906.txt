I am looking for arguments to convince management to invest effort into refactoring. We log work using Jira and relate every svn-commit to a jira call. My idea is to do the following:   * manually spot an area of code which is extremely bad implemented, but often used: both from User-POV and of Developer-POV (bugfixes)   * get the svn-commits which contain the JIRA-Issues   * filter the issues according to some criteria (issue type, version, prio. etc...)   * compute the time/effort spent on these bugs   * estimate efforts and risks of refactoring   * present the numbers and ask for effort to fix it. What do you think of this? Would such a measurement be useful and/or convincing? What are the Pros and Cons?
