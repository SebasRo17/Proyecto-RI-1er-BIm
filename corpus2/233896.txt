I'm working within a team and corporate is breathing down our necks to become more efficient, as projects are on average taking us 6+ months to complete. I was only recently hired (back end development) and it feels very unorganized to me. Unfortunately, being the newcomer, I don't have much of a voice. I'd like to propose a new workflow and was hoping to get some advice that might help make a positive impact / impression? **Current work flow:**   1. Sales - makes a sale. Discusses any potential issues with development before hand.   2. Sales, design and copy meet with client for strategy session. Development is only invited when programming related questions are expected to come up.   3. Design creates a few mockups which are then approved by the client.   4. Copy writes / proof-reads the content, creates a list of keywords for SEO, also approved by the client.   5. Design creates the inner pages and lays the copy into the PSD.   6. Front end development creates the template including all content, and all client-side functionality, approved by client.   7. Back end development creates the databases, programs the website and hooks up CMS / content management.   8. Development trains the client on the back end and if approved, adds analytics and launches the site.   9. Development continues to provide client support if necessary. **Proposed work flow:**   1. Sales - makes a sale. Discusses any potential issues with development before hand.   2. Sales, design, copy and development meet with the client for strategy session, regardless of whether or not programming is involved.   3. Design creates a few mockups which are then approved by the client.   4. Development reviews approved mockup and discusses any potentional issues with CMS / inner page design.   5. Design can now work on the inner pages while both copy writes content and front end development creates the initial template.   6. After inner pages and / or copy is complete, front end finishes the template. Both copy and front end can be simutaneously approved by the client.   7. Back end development creates the databases, programs the website and hooks up CMS / content management.   8. Development trains the client on the back end and if approved, adds analytics and launches the site.   9. Development continues to provide client support if necessary.
