I would like to write a code in _Mathematica_ such that it shows the direction with numbers on points. I wrote this code which does not do this. I want just to complete this code with two options I told. Any Idea. thanks.               ListPolarPlot[{Table[{2^n, 1}, {n, 1, 6}]}, Joined -> True,PlotStyle -> {Blue, Red, Green, Yellow, Gray}, Mesh -> All, MeshStyle -> Red]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OEtml.jpg)
