I support and develop a large system that uses various technologies e.g. c++,.net,vb6 etc. I am a sole developer. I am debating whether now is the right time to approach my manager (who is not a developer) to ask if another developer can be recruited. I don't have any experience working in software teams. I have always been a sole developer. The concerns I have are:   1. There is still a lot to do. Training another developer would take time and distract me from my duties.    2. The company does not invest heavily in tools e.g. source control    3. The code in this system needs to be refactored to introduce concepts such as interfaces, polymorphism etc, which are supported by methodologies such as Agile (I inherited the system about 12 months ago). I am gradually trying to refactor the code. I believe I have two options:   1. Approach my manager now    2. Wait until I have had time to refactor the code so it is more suitable for a team environment. Which option is best? I am hoping to hear from other developers who have been in my situation.
