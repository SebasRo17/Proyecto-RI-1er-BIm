I'm working on a Java-based library which makes use of PKCS #10 requests. There are PKCS #10 libraries available for Java (Sun and IBM libraries that come with the respective JDKs), and the open-source Bouncy Castle library. I'd rather not couple my library to another through the API, so my initial thought was to create a wrapper. However, PKCS #10 is potentially complex, so the scope of the wrapper would expand quite quickly, and users of that wrapper would probably "unwrap" the wrapper and use one of the aforementioned libraries for any heavy-lifting, particularly if they use PKCS #10 in their own applications already. My remaining option is to provide a simple wrapper around a byte array. Is providing a very thin wrapper just for the sake of typing good practice?
