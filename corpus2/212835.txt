I am working in a small company with around 15 people (dev and qa). We are trying to practice Agile in our company. We are doing daily stand-up meetings. We are also doing a weekly project status meeting with our CTO. There we report our CTO regarding last week task and overall project status. My question is whether doing this weekly status meeting with our CTO supported in Agile or not?
