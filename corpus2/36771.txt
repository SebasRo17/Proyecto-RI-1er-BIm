# Slightly clearer, hopefully: I would like to plot Solve[Normal[Series[E^(n x), {x, 0, n}]] == 0 for incrementally increasing n, and show all plots overlayed. Here is my effort with up to n=63 using this code: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/oqfEc.gif) ...Very time consuming though, & I would really like to find a way of plotting it (& similar plots) up to any n without the labour-intensive copying & pasting.
