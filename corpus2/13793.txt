When doing complicated programming in a Mma notebook I define several functions that I use in my higher level funtions, and I use a "Subsection" cell for each definition. For example I might write:               Cell["foo[x,y]", "Subsection"]     foo[x_,y_]:=(* complicated code *)          Cell["foo[x,y,z]", "Subsection"]     foo[x_,y_,z_]:=(* complicated code *)          Cell["goo[x,y]", "Subsection"]     goo[x_,y_]:=(* complicated code *)          Cell["UserIterface[x,y,z]", "Subsection"]     UserInterface[x_,y_,z_]:=DynamicModule[{a,b,c},       a=foo[x,y];       b=foo[x,y,z];       c=goo[x,y];       (* and so on  *)     ]      By using "Subsection" cells, I can close Subsections of code when I don't need to see them. However, I want to make my program a CDF that the CDF-Player can use. As far as I know, I have to use the following approach instead.               DynamicModule[{a,b,c},     a=foo[x,y];     b=foo[x,y,z];     c=goo[x,y];     (* and so on  *),          Initialization:>{     foo[x_,y_]:=(* complicated code *);     foo[x_,y_,z_]:=(* complicated code *);     goo[x_,y_]:=(* complicated code *)}     ]      This becomes unwieldly because I can't minimize the code that I don't need to see at any moment. Is there a better way to make a complicated CDF?
