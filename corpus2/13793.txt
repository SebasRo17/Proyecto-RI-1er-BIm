While travelling I met a mathematician who was sitting near me. In a discussion he said: "... _there is nothing like engineering in IT or rather programming_ ". A true engineering is what Architecture is, what Electrical and Mechanical is. It made me think and I was puzzled. A percent of my brain agreed also because in Indian Army, there is no subject like Computer Engineering in the Engineering Corps. They don't consider programming as engineering. This is what I heard few years back, I don't know what Indian Army thinks now. What are your views?
