I am preparing a single page application that would be sometimes used over slow mobile connection. Some of its part are quite heavy in terms of API requests (fetching ten different resources for a new screen display). Now, is it a good idea to merge these services to one that provides all required data, but is not as "pure" in terms of REST principles? Are there significant performance gains to be expected?
