I am looking for a book on how to design a web-service API. I'm constrained to using RPC-style Web services. In particular, I'm looking for guidance on   * [balancing...] **granular** _vs_ **course services**   * **required parameters** _vs_ **optional parameters**   * **small chatty services** _vs_ **services with large payloads** I'm also looking to address strategies for making reference data and caching on the consumer side. Even things like how to establish a rational naming convention are helpful. Which books are good resources for designing a web API that addresses these questions?
