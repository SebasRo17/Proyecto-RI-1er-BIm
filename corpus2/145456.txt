I have a scenario where a local app is used to take snaps using the iphone camera and the local app can send the photo to a web server... Now when the user visits a website or another web app using his iphone, then the website/webapp invokes the local app to do its work. Do security/other restrictions on iphone prevent such a scenario from being implemented? Can I create a local app with the above scenario in mind? Is there something I should be aware of, before I start creating such an app? And should the user visit a web app or a website, so that the local app is correctly invoked to do its job?
