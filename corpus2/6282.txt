The Cayley graphs produced by Mathematica 8.0's `CayleyGraph` function represent actions that are their own inverses in an unconventional way: rather than using a single edge without arrows, it uses two edges, each represented by an arrow. Is there a way to replace all (and only) pairs of such reflexive arrows in a Cayley diagram with a single undirected edge, while leaving any unpaired directed edges untouched? For example is there a way to make edges in this               CayleyGraph[DihedralGroup[4]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Flv2n.png) look like this ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WCzz6.png) * * * Note that I'm aware that one could generate the desired output "manually", using `Graph` (as was done to generate the example above), but the solution I'm seeking must work for _far_ more complex graphs than the one illustrated here from the simple group specifications that can be provided to `CayleyGraph`.
