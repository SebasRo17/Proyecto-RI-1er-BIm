I'm starting a project with friends which would preferably reach both audiences of windows and linux. The only problem is that none of us have any experience of linux porting or linux coding any way. Thus, I'm asking for information here if it'd be possible to use the same code for both platforms. If it's some choices we had to make while coding it to be for both platforms. Our preferred coding language is C++, but if enough support is gained towards another one, a switch is possible. We haven't chosen a graphics nor a game engine yet because of this fact. With the minimum effort we'd like this to be as close as possible to a "uniplatform" game. :)
