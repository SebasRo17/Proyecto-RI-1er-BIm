All, I have the following code which generates a window containing the variable _PrintOut_ and a Print button. When the print button is pressed the contents of the window are sent to the printer and simultaneously a pdf is generated.               PrintOut = "Some stuff - plots, tables etc.";          DialogInput[       DialogNotebook[        Column[{PrintOut,           Row[{Button["Print",              DialogReturn[NotebookPrint[PrintOut, "filename.pdf"];              NotebookPrint[               CreateDocument[PrintOut, Visible -> False,                 PageHeaders -> {{"a", "b", DateString[]}, {"a", "b",                    DateString[]}}]]]], CancelButton[]}]}]],        ShowStringCharacters -> False,        WindowTitle -> "This Window " <> DateString[]];      The problem arises when _PrintOut_ contains enough stuff to be spread over multiple pages. I wish to have the pages print on both sides but can't figure out how to do it. I have the print settings within MMA set to duplex and when I print a notebook using the front end I get duplex but it does not work for DialogNotebook. I am using MMA8 Help appreciated.
