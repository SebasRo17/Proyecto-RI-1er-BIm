Let’s say you estimated time for a case to be 3 days. In day two you notice that the case is growing and new scenarios are popping up which were not counted when the time estimation where done. The new finding leads to 2 days extra (total 5 days). This is a typical problem that you will face sooner or later as developer.   * Which strategy can be used when you are going to notify project leader the new time of delivery?   * Often you get the question why? How do you motivate the new time of delivery? The fact is that many projects don’t put much time on analysis & design during SDLC. **EDIT:** In very complex projects no matter how much reasonable time you put on Analysis & Design there are always surprises since the business rules are too complex. However in such cases I believe the project leader must be aware of the complexity and have right attitude when unexpected surprises comes up. The question is how to tackle project leaders who don’t understand the complexity.
