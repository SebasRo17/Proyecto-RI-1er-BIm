I was trying to (re)calculate a problem of an older Wolfram blog post (Problem 11457, by M. L. Glasser) with Mathematica 9.0.0.0 (on OS X 10.8.2).               Assuming[0 < a < b, Integrate[ArcCos[x/Sqrt[(a + b) x - a b]], {x, a, b}]]      Instead of the expected solution, it just returns the integral unevaluated. Is this a regression? **More details:** As pointed out in the commentes, the indefinite integral               Integrate[ArcCos[x/Sqrt[(a + b) x - a b]], x]      still gives the same result in Mathematica 8 and 9. The next two each returned ConditionalExpression in Mathematica 8 but return unevaluated in Mathematica 9:               Integrate[ArcCos[x/Sqrt[(a + b) x - a b]], {x, a, b}]     Integrate[ArcCos[x/Sqrt[(a + b) x - a b]], {x, a, b}, Assumptions -> 0 <= a <= b]      The actual problem               Integrate[ArcCos[x/Sqrt[(a + b) x - a b]], {x, a, b}, Assumptions -> 0 < a < b]      computes correctly to `((a - b)^2 \[Pi])/(4 (a + b))` in Mathematica 8 but still returns unevaulated in Mathematica 9.
