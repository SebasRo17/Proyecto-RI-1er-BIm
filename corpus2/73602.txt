I have been wondering if it would be smart to form a single scrum team for several tiny projects. I am aware that it would be very hard to state a single sprint goal, if a team is working on several different projects. On the other hand: Putting projects that usually are assigned to single developers in a common team backlog would (IMHO) benefit by the synergies of a scrum team. I should mention, that the projects does not vary that much from a technical perspective. I am in a consultancy department where we have projects of very different sizes. For some time I have been working on a larger project using Scrum. Lately, the team has been disassembled, and I am left with one-man assignments. The idea came to me because I was getting more and more frustrated about not having my old teammates for sparring, QA and good old fashioned team spirit. I realized that about half of my department is working on one-man assignments. Then it dawned on me, that there might be a way out of the solitude: A Scrum of small projects. I am keen to hear your opinion on the matter: What do you think of the idea?   What are the pitfalls?   What are the limitations? How do i convince management that it is a great idea?
