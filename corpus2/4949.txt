I have a bit of data that looks like this:               data = {79., 79.1, 78.3, 78.6, 79., 77.2, 79.3, 79.3, "", "", 79.3, 76.6, \     79.3, 79.8, 78.4, 79., 78.4, 78.4, 79.4, 79.5, 79.4, 79.3, 79.2, \     79.2, 79.3, 79.6, "", 79.2, 79.3, 79., 79.1, 79.2}      I'm looking to do Linear Interpolation to fill in the missing data. The `Interpolation` functions with `InterpolationOrder->1` seems to be just what I am looking for. But I can't figure out how to feed the data to the `Interpolation` function in order to get a a sensible result.
