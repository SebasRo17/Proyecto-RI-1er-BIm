I can find lots of information regarding the restrictions imposed on linking GPL licensed libraries from non-GPL licensed software. However, I'd like to do the opposite - I'd like to distribute some software under a GPLv3 license that has the option to dynamically link to a proprietary shared library. The proprietary library would not constitute an essential component of the functioning software, since there are other open source (BSD licensed) libraries that could be linked at runtime instead (specifically, I'm thinking about linking MKL BLAS versus ATLAS, OpenBLAS etc.). I found this relevant section in the GPL FAQ.   * Does this mean that I would need to explicitly grant an exception for every possible non-GPL licensed shared library the user might choose to link to at run-time?   * Would I need to write exceptions for libraries that are open source, but not GPL licensed (e.g. BSD)?   * If the library that is being linked to is not covered by an exception (i.e. if it is GPL or LGPL), what would be my obligation to distribute the source code for that library?
