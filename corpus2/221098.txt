I'm developing a small system for internal automation. I use asp.net webforms and faced with a choice:   1. develop a system architecture in an object-oriented style (development becomes more difficult and time-consuming) or   2. just put controls on forms and write sql queries in control handlers (high speed development, the complexity of testing) Ð¡urrently I'm using the first method, but starting to have doubts that my choice is correct. What way is expedient?
