A friend showed me this snippet of code today:               (#[#] &)[#[#][#] &]      I can sort of see that we're constructing an anonymous function that takes a function as an argument and calls that function passing it itself. Then we're calling that anonymous function, passing another, and I get lost... A cogent explanation of this code would be great. Apologies if this is well known, I tried to google for it, but its nature makes searching for it hard.
