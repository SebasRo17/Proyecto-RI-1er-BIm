This is really a question about manipulating the output of `Maximize`. I have a function of 2 variables, defined thus:                Pqpcum[r_, b_] = Integrate[2 Pi*x*Pqp[x, b], {x, 0, r}, Assumptions -> {b > 0}]      I want to find the point where the maximum of a certain function, defined below, occurs:               Abs[Pqpcum[x1, b] - Pqpcum[x1, 0]], x1]      The function `Maximize` returns an array, like this:               In[24]:= Maximize[Abs[Pqpcum[x1, 0.1] - Pqpcum[x1, 0]], x1]          Out[24]= {0.0204023, {x1 -> 1.77787}}      Now I want to plot the location of the maximum, which is 1.77787 in this case, as a function of b. Attempting to get the second element of the array returns an element like this:               {x1 -> 1.777869648006448`}      The above cannot be plotted. I need to do something like this:               Plot[Maximize[Abs[Pqpcum[x1, b] - Pqpcum[x1, 0]], x1][[2]],{b,0,0.2}]      except that the above doesn't return anything, since I have plotted the list. How can I go about doing it? I could discretize the data and manually copy- paste the location of maximum values to do a `ListLinePlot`, but it would be a pain to do it. **EDIT:** I found my answer- I can use ArgMax instead. It directly returns the location of the maximum, so the above can be done. But the question still remains- how in general can one manipulate a list that reads like `{x1 -> 1.777869648006448}` to get only the numeric value `1.777869648006448`?
