I have recently started a job that has me working on an existing system. It requires tweaks and updates as well as new code. I have done several maintainance/feature adding projects now, and several of them have ended up being significantly different from what was actually requested. So, I had to program the item several times to get it to where the requester wanted. Now, I don't mind reprogramming the feature if that's what needs to be done. However, I would like to decrease turnaround time on my projects. The bottleneck seems to be in the requester's perception of what needs to be done. Do you have any ideas on what I could do to figure out what the requester needs more quickly?
