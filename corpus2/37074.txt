I wrote the following code to find the area of the circle $x^2+y^2=1$ using monte carlo simulation :               McArea[Num_] := Module[{hit, miss, index, x, y},        hit = 0; miss = 0;       For[index = 1, index <= Num, index = index + 1,         x = Random[Real, {-1, 1}];         y = Random[Real, {-1, 1}];         If[y <= Sqrt[1 - x^2], hit = hit + 1, miss = miss + 1];];       Return[(hit/Num) 4];]      `McArea[100]` is around `3.56`, and the larger I make `Num`, the result gets larger, but only a bit. It doesn't seem to be the correct because my output is too far from `3.14`. Is there something wrong with the code?
