When I run this,               Product[n^MoebiusMu[n],{n,1,Infinity}]        I get $\frac{1}{4 \pi^{2}}$ Over on Math Overflow they are saying it shouldn't happen. So, how do I determine if it really converges? **Edit** If we could re-order the square-free numbers into sequence by their greatest factors, this product would converge absolutely to $1$. This sum:               Sum[MoebiusMu[n],{n,i,Inifinty}]        would converge absolutely to $0$ with the same re-ordering. **Edit 2**               ListPlot[Table[n^MoebiusMu[n], {n, 1, 1000}]]        ![MoebiusMu Plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mLKGc.gif)
