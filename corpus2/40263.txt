I'm trying to adapt **Nasser** 's method for using a **control variable** inside Manipulate to selectively choose what part of the code should be recalculated depending on the controls changed (see this question). I need this functionality for a simulation I'm working on about the field lines of an electric dipole. In the simulation it should be possible to move the two charges q1 and q2 generating the field and also to move a third point P. The point P only serves to see the field line passing through P. Since the single field line originating from P should have different graphical parameters than the field lines of the "background field", I've created two different Streamplots: " _fieldlines_ " is for the general field and " _fieldpoint_ " is for the single line through P. They are combined together with the " _Show_ " command. Nasser helped me a lot with the code and his version addresses the problem of the selective recalculation. But in my plan I'd like to use three **Locator** instead of 3 **Slider2D**. Locators are easy to set in a standard Manipulate code, but are not easy to implement in a custom code like the following one:               Manipulate[tick;      Show[f2, f1, ImageSize -> 300],           Text@Grid[{         {Grid[{            {"Q1"},            {Slider2D[Dynamic[q1pos, {q1pos = #;                 f1 = fieldlines[q1pos, q2pos, pnts];                 f2 = fieldpoint[q1pos, q2pos, pt];                 tick = Not[tick]} &], {{-6, -6}, {6, 6}, {.1, .1}}]},            {Dynamic[q1pos]}            }, Alignment -> Center]}         ,         {Grid[{{"Q2"},            {Slider2D[Dynamic[q2pos, {q2pos = #;                 f1 = fieldlines[q1pos, q2pos, pnts];                 f2 = fieldpoint[q1pos, q2pos, pt];                 tick = Not[tick]} &], {{-6, -6}, {6, 6}, {.1, .1}}]},            {Dynamic[q2pos]}            }, Alignment -> Center]}         ,         {Grid[{{"pt"},            {Slider2D[Dynamic[pt, {pt = #;                 f2 = fieldpoint[q1pos, q2pos, pt];                 tick = Not[tick]} &], {{-6, -6}, {6, 6}, {.1, .1}}]},            {Dynamic[pt]}            }, Alignment -> Center]}         }, Spacings -> {.5, 1.5}, Alignment -> Center, Frame -> All        ]      ,      {{tick, False}, None},      {{q1pos, {-2, 0}}, None},      {{q2pos, {2, 0}}, None},      {{pt, {-2.5, 2}}, None},      {{f1, fieldlines[{-2, 0}, {2, 0}, Tuples[{-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3}, 2]]}, None},      {{f2, fieldpoint[{-2, 0}, {2, 0}, {-2.5, 2}]}, None},      {{pnts, Tuples[{-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3}, 2]}, None},      ControlPlacement -> Left,      ContinuousAction -> False,      SynchronousInitialization -> False,      TrackedSymbols :> {tick},       Initialization :> (             field[x_, y_, q1pos_List, q2pos_List] := Module[{},          {           (2 (x - q1pos[[1]]))/EuclideanDistance[q1pos, {x, y}]^3 +               (-2 (x - q2pos[[1]]))/EuclideanDistance[q2pos, {x, y}]^3           ,           (2 (y - q1pos[[2]]))/EuclideanDistance[q1pos, {x, y}]^3 +              (-2 (y - q2pos[[2]]))/EuclideanDistance[q2pos, {x, y}]^3}          ];             fieldlines[q1pos_List, q2pos_List, pnts_List] := Module[{x, y},          StreamPlot[field[x, y, q1pos, q2pos], {x, -5, 5}, {y, -5, 5},           StreamPoints -> pnts, StreamScale -> Automatic , PerformanceGoal -> "Quality"]];             fieldpoint[q1pos_List, q2pos_List, pt_List] := Module[{x, y},          StreamPlot[field[x, y, q1pos, q2pos], {x, -5, 5}, {y, -5, 5},           StreamPoints -> {             {              {pt, {Thickness[0.005], RGBColor[1, 0, 0], Arrowheads[0.02]}}              }, Automatic, {ForwardBackward, 400}}, PerformanceGoal -> "Quality"]          ]             )      ]      So my question to _advanced users_ is if it's possible to substitute the 3 Slider2D controls with 3 Locator in this context without disrupting the selective recalculation achieved so far. It seem a **tough thing** to do since these controls are not located in the usual control section of a standard Manipulate command. Thanks for your help.
