I need to do frame-by-frame analysis of videos. I can import the video files I need, but each file is too large to import at once. I can use the `Import[fn, "Frames",{n}]` command to import images one-by-one, but this takes a long time once `n` gets large. For example, the first frame it takes 0.14 sec, but the 200th frame takes 2.2 sec. Mathematica seems to be reading from the start of the file each time I do this. Obviously, this will not work. Is there some way to speed this up. E.g. using streams? Or tricking Mathematica to use `ImageCapture` to get images from a video file instead of a webcam? Thanks
