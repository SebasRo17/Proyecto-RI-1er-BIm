I want to develop a product comparison page, where a user can compare 2 or 3 products. I was thinking about a 3 column list displaying every specification. But I want to highlight the differences. I could use a list and sort them alphabetically. And then if element _x_ of list 1 is not equal to element _x_ of list 2 then highlight it. But I 'm not sure every product has the same elements. Maybe element _x_ is missing in list 2. What could be a good method to develop this? Should I mark some elements on every product that can be compared (like a sort of element classes) ? So that I can check if elements from elements class _x_ differ on 2 products. Any other suggestions?
