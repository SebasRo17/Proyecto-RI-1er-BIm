I'm trying to do a simple variable substitution within a ContourPlot, but it's not working. Here's an example:               ContourPlot[x y == 1/2, {x, 0, 1}, {y, 0, 1}]      ContourPlot[x y == 1/2 /. y -> z, {x, 0, 1}, {z, 0, 1}]      The second line, although mathematically identical, produces no contour. Why? How can I do the substitution correctly? **Edit:** It looks like my initial question is solved by simply wrapping the argument in Evaluate. However, why doesn't Plot obey the same rules? The following works without Evaluate:               Plot[x, {x, 0, 1}]     Plot[x /. x -> z, {z, 0, 1}]
