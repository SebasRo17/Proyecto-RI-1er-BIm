I need to solve a system of differential equations which contains, at minimum, ten thousands of differential equations. Actually, I am trying to solve density matrix equation. It's like something $ \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\rho(t) = \frac{-I}{\hbar}(H(t)\rho(t) -\rho(t)H(t)) $. If the dimension of Hilbert space is $N$, then there is $N^2$ coupled differential equations. I want to know if it is possible to solve this system of differential equations in parallel in Mathematica? My cpu has six cores, so I guess I can get a six times speed up, if I solve the equations in parallel.
