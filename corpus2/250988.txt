Ok so for example I have an array of strings with each string as below:               364VMS1029      364VMSH920      364VMSH192      364VMSU839      364VMN2382      364VMR223     364VMR2X3      364VMN829      364VMN8757      364VMN831      How can I dynamically get the program to recognise the common characters among all strings in the array, which in this case is `364VM` and filter them out? If there's no common character, then don't do anything.
