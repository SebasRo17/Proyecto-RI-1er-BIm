I started a programming blog earlier this year, and since I started it some things have changed. Some changes are due to technology changing, some changes are due to my code libraries improving, and some (ok, probably most) are due to me changing as I learn more. I want to go back and completely re-write certain blog posts. Is it better to rewrite posts to remove old information and update them with new stuff, or to create entirely new posts and possibly take down old ones? I'm not talking about small changes to the code, or an extra few sentences, but complete rewrites with new code, new information, etc. Some things to consider are comments on the post, subscribers who receive updates when new posts are created, and user bookmarks.
