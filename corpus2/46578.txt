I use this script to recognise a date in a textfile and write the result in another file.               For[i = 1, i < 20, i++,       test1 = Import["E:\\data\\MC1 Data\\MC1 Data\\articles\\" <> ToString[i] <>".txt", "Text"];       test2 = {StringCases[test1, DatePattern[{"Year", "Month", "Day"}]],              StringCases[ToLowerCase[test1], RegularExpression["\\w(?<!\\d)[\\w'-]*"]]};     Write[s, test2]];      The result is a file like this: ![example data file](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vIfRf.gif)               test3 = ReadList["E:\\data\\MC1 Data\\MC1 Data\\articles\\testfile3.txt"]      Then I would like to make a selection on the date/first column. In this example, mathematica don't recognise it as a datastring. I tried to convert it like               DateString[test3[[All, 1]]]      but that didnt work. Who has a suggestion?
