I am trying to generate a plottable semi-prime counting function. Have tried:               DiscretePlot[Gather[{a = PrimeOmega[Range[100]];     b = PrimeNu[Range[100]];     Count[Transpose[{a, b}], {2, 2}]}     +     {a = PrimeOmega[Range[100]];     b = PrimeNu[Range[100]];     Count[Transpose[{a, b}], {2, 1}]}],{x, 0, 15}, Filling -> Bottom]]      but really have no clue as to where to go from here!
