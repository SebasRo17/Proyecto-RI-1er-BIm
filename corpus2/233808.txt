I've been writing a small C application that operates on files, and I've found that I have been copy+pasting this code around my functions:               char fullpath[PATH_MAX];     fullpath[0] = '\0';     strcat(fullpath, BASE_PATH);     strcat(fullpath, subdir);     strcat(fullpath, "/");     strcat(fullpath, filename);          // do something with fullpath...      Is there a better way? The first thought that comes to mind is to create a macro but I'm sure this is a common problem in C, and I'm wondering how others have solve it.
