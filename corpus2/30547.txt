I am working my way through Programming Paradigms via Mathematica (A First Course) and have answered the following question in lesson 25: > Write a function of one argument "s", a String, which writes the string "s" > to some file and then reads the string that file back in as a list of single > characters. This operation thus mimics Characters[]. Pay attention to the > methods Mathematica has for reading in data from a file.               In   Characters["the cow jumped over the moon"]           Out   {t, h, e,  , c, o, w,  , j, u, m, p, e, d,  , o, v, e, r,  , t, h, e,  , m, o, o, n}      My function is as follows:               Clear[myCharacters]     myCharacters[s_String] :=       Module[{myStream},        myStream = OpenWrite["file2"];        Write[myStream, s];        Close[myStream];        ReadList["file2", Character]        ];     myCharacters["the cow jumped over the moon"]      which produces an output that includes the leading and trailing quotation marks:               {",t, h, e,  , c, o, w,  , j, u, m, p, e, d,  , o, v, e, r,  , t, h, e,  , m, o, o, n,"}      So thinking back to my previous question, where I had a couple of significant mistakes, I am wondering if there is something that I am missing or is my answer basically correct? Also I would appreciate being shown how I could improve my function even if it does give correct output.
