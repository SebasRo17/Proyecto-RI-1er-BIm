I stumbled upon a blog entry discouraging the use of Strings in Java for making your code lack semantics, suggesting that you should use thin wrapper classes instead. This is the before and after examples the said entry provides to illustrate the matter:               public void bookTicket(       String name,       String firstName,       String film,       int count,       String cinema);          public void bookTicket(       Name name,       FirstName firstName,       Film film,       Count count,       Cinema cinema);      In my experience reading programming blogs I've come to the conclusion that 90% is nonsense, but I'm left wondering whether this is a valid point. Somehow it doesn't feel right to me, but I couldn't exactly pinpoint what is amiss with the style of programming.
