We're using Git as our DVCS and we're about to start to do a clean up (never done before in this team) of files that are not necessary (not part of the sources) from our products. This is done in two ways:   * removing the `product` files from the repo and adding them to the ignore list.    * deleting dead code According to Wikipedia: > Code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code > without changing its external behavior. Refactoring improves nonfunctional > attributes of the software. Advantages include improved code readability and > reduced complexity to improve source code maintainability, and create a more > expressive internal architecture or object model to improve extensibility. and from Martin Fowler's entry: > Refactoring is a very specific technique, founded on using small behavior- > preserving transformations (themselves called refactorings). I haven't read anywhere that removing dead code or removing files from your repo are considered refactoring techniques but I see them both as techniques that _"improve source code maintainability"_ by removing irrelevant code that may distract us later on. Do you think it's reasonable to call those two activities "Refactoring"?
