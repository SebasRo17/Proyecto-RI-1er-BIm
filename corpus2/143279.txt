My nice employer allowed me to visit a software conference in June (International PHP Conference, for those who care). Wanting to make the most of it, I would ask the more experienced conference goers in here to give me some tips on what I could do to maximize my learning experience on the conference, and to reduce beginner mistakes. Sorry that this question is a little ambiguous, but I think it's best to keep it a little bit more open, so I can get a wide range of Ideas, and it will be of more use to further people seeking for an answer.
