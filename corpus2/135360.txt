I am currently doing my Honours in Computer Science and taking Artificial Intelligence as a subject. As part of completing the subject I have to develop my own basic intelligent agent. I have yet to wrap my head around what I actually have to do for this project. I am not the most technically gifted programmer and I have no idea of what to do or where to start Could someone please point me in the right direction as to where to start learning how to develop an Intelligent Agent as well as any possible idea's of what to actually do for a project? The requirement for the project are very vague as we were not told how technical or big the project should be. (Hopefully not too big as I have another 8 subjects who require projects as well). Any VB.net references would be appreciated as well. (I know it's not the best language to develop an IA with, but due to my time constraints this is the programming language I 'feel' most comfortable with).
