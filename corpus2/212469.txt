I am 14 years old, and have been studying web/app/software development. I am trying to learn a backend language, and am considering node.js. I have heard awesome things about it, plus I like that fact that I can already use the JS I know in it. However, I am concerned that it may just be a "trendy/hip" technology, and that it may not be being used in the real-world that much. Are people really applying node.js in production? Or is it just hip right now?
