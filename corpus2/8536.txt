For example, I have a system of parametric equations (`R` is a constant number) :               { x == p +  R Cos[k],       y == Cos[p] +  R Sin[k],       k == ArcTan[ 1/Sin[p] ]   }      Now I am going to find the normal equation of $\; y = f(x)\;$ without other variables. (Theoretically it is possible because there are totally 4 variables and 3 equations.) How can I do this in Mathematica?
