If constants are structured hierarchically, do the "folders" also need to be capitalized? Take for example a Javascript object that needs to store constants for a video player. Is the convention to capitalize the "folders"?               PLAYER = {      VIDEO: {       WIDTH: 640,       HEIGHT: 480       ENCODING: 'h264'      },      AUDIO: {       BITRATE: 128       ENCODING: 'mp3'      }      };          // usage:     alert('The player's video width is: ' + PLAYER.VIDEO.WIDTH);      Or only capitalize the leaf nodes?               player = {      video: {       WIDTH: 640,         HEIGHT: 480,       ENCODING: 'h264'      },      audio: {       BITRATE: 128,       ENCODING: 'mp3'      }     };          // usage:     alert('The player's video width is: ' + player.video.WIDTH);
