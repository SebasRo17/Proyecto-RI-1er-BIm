I'm looking for some advice on interviewing technical candidates. I touched on this briefly in a question I previously asked: template questions in a technical interview and was informed that FizzBuzz questions are designed to weed out candidates you definitely don't want coming near your code. Moving on from that, I'd like to know what FizzBuzz questions work best? In my own experience, the common one I've seen is "Can you write a method to determine if a number is prime or not?". Personally, I find this a little too easy (writing the most efficient one is another story). Are there better FizzBuzz questions that can be used? What ones would you put to a candidate?
