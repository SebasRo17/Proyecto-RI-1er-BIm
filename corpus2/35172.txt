I'm using Mathematica 9.0.1. Sorry for using an image, but pasting code messed up the output formatting. I'd like to represent 25 Btu/(hr ft F). ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/LVn2r.jpg) All units are spelled correctly as identified in the second attempt... not sure what is going wrong in the first attempt? I've also tried: "DegreesFahrenheit" "DegreesFahrenheitDifference" "BritishThermalUnitsIT" No luck. I've seen other posts where people used the Wolfram Alpha capabilities to "interpret" which units were used... I hope I don't need internet connectivity for this simple task?
