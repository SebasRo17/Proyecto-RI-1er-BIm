Making a project estimation with given a requirements set is one thing. But, what happens when the user suddenly starts changing them on the fly and starts adding new requirements to the already defined set? And even goes to an extent to be mad about why the project is not finished in the originally planned time frame. How should I deal with these situations? Proposing some methodologies and readings could be helpful.
