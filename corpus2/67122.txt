We have a multilingual website in which a bug was discovered some days ago. It was displaying other language data in other language and also the mixture of data like English language was selected but it was displaying other language data as well in the page and vice-versa. It is doing it infrequently but is present in the website. Going through the code also doesn't help because this is not always occurring. Any suggestion in finding the issue in a timely manner? I am asking for strategies here.
