I've been delving into more "organized" programming recently and I've been learning that I should be programming to an interface, not an implementation. With that in mind, would it be better to "sketch" out a project in interfaces before writing the implementation for it where possible? And if this is the case, in the case of using 3rd party libraries (ie Lidgren), should I be wrapping those in interfaces as well and resolve them through IOC containers, or is it OK to expose them to the interfaces?
