In general, how do I get Mathematica to symbolically expand various infinite series to an arbitrary degree of accuracy? I deal with q-hypergeometric series quite frequently, and specifically want to expand series like the following: $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^nq^{6n^2}}{(q^3;q^3)_n(-q;q)_{3n}},$$ where $(a;q)_n$ denotes the standard QPochhammer symbol $\prod_{k=0}^{n-1}(1-aq^k)$. I would like to input a maximal degree, and for Mathematica to output the first few terms of the infinite series up until the specified degree. For example, if I inputted $13$, I would want Mathematica to output (I believe, doing this by hand) $q^6-q^7+q^{10}-q^{11}+q^{12}-q^{13}$. I cannot get the existing series functions to give something as clean as what I want. One preliminary input I tried was               FunctionExpand[Sum[(-1)^n/QPochammer[q^3,q^3,n],{n,0,10}]],      which returned               1 - 1/(1 -        q^3) + 1/((1 - q^3) (1 - q^6)) - 1/((1 - q^3) (1 - q^6) (1 -          q^9)) + 1/((1 - q^3) (1 - q^6) (1 - q^9) (1 - q^12)) - 1/((1 -          q^3) (1 - q^6) (1 - q^9) (1 - q^12) (1 - q^15)) + 1/((1 -          q^3) (1 - q^6) (1 - q^9) (1 - q^12) (1 - q^15) (1 -          q^18)) - 1/((1 - q^3) (1 - q^6) (1 - q^9) (1 - q^12) (1 -          q^15) (1 - q^18) (1 - q^21)) + 1/((1 - q^3) (1 - q^6) (1 -          q^9) (1 - q^12) (1 - q^15) (1 - q^18) (1 - q^21) (1 -          q^24)) - 1/((1 - q^3) (1 - q^6) (1 - q^9) (1 - q^12) (1 -          q^15) (1 - q^18) (1 - q^21) (1 - q^24) (1 - q^27)) + 1/((1 -          q^3) (1 - q^6) (1 - q^9) (1 - q^12) (1 - q^15) (1 - q^18) (1 -          q^21) (1 - q^24) (1 - q^27) (1 - q^30)),      which is not the form of output that I want because the sum is not fully expanded as a polynomial in $q$. Also, if I insert an additional `QPochhammer[-q,q,Infinity]` out front, it leaves the $(-q;q)_{\infty}$ unexpanded because there is no degree specification. (This is why I want to implement the degree specification rather than settling for expanded partial sums.) These are two central issues that I'm not sure how to address.
