I've recently really dived into Ruby/Rails and I'm falling in love. I have a gut feeling this might be something that could last for a while. What I've been missing is interaction with people who are as passionate about Ruby, Rails and things closely related to these. I live in a relatively small city, but was able to find five local people through a RoR website. Weekly meetups with Macs, beer and bro-love rushed through my mental theater. Seriously though, I have no clue how I could approach these people. I have their e-mail addresses. Any advice?
