**Background** : Mac OSX 10.9.4, Mathematica _9.0.1_ vs. Mathematica _10.0_ (both versions are Student Editions). I have a notebook. It used to evaluate fine in Mathematica _9_. I upgraded to _10_ and, without doing any modification at all to the notebook, an integral stopped converging. I even tried after quitting/restarting the kernel and doing an OS reboot. In an attempt to provide a minimal test case I wrote a code snippet that had a typo (epsilon instead of 'element of ') which caused a great deal of confusion. The code would not work, neither in _9_ nor _10_. Thanks to Michael for identifying it. The original code in my notebook did not suffer from this typo, although I'm afraid most people thought it did. * * * I narrowed the problem down to the following code:               ClearAll["Global`*"];     u[n_, x_] := If[x <= 0 || x >= L, 0, Sqrt[2/L] Sin[n π x /L]]     φ[n_, k_] =     Assuming[{n \[Element] Integers, L > 0},         Simplify@             (1/Sqrt[2 π]) Integrate[u[n, x] Exp[-I k x], {x, 0, L}]]          Δk[n_] :=     Assuming[{n \[Element] Integers},     Simplify@         ((Integrate[             φ[n, k]\[Conjugate] k^2 φ[n, k], {k, -Infinity, +Infinity}] -         Integrate[             φ[n, k]\[Conjugate] k φ[n, k], {k, -Infinity, +Infinity}]^2)^(1/2))]     L = 1;     (* If I replace ParallelTable[] with Table[], the problem disappears *)     ParallelTable[Δk[n], {n, 1, 1}]          (* If I uncomment the following line, the problem disappears no matter        whether I use ParallelTable[] or just Table[] *)     (*Quit[]*)          (* From now on it's the original code snippet I wrote with the typo fixed *)     ClearAll["Global`*"];     u[n_, x_] := If[x <= 0 || x >= L, 0, Sqrt[2/L] Sin[n π x/L]]          \[Phi][n_, k_] =     Assuming[{n \[Element] Integers, L > 0},         FourierTransform[u[n, x], x, k, FourierParameters -> {0, -1}]]          η[n_, k_] =         Assuming[{n \[Element] Integers, L > 0, k \[Element] Reals},             FullSimplify[                 \[Phi][n, k]\[Conjugate] \[Phi][n, k]]]          Δk[n_] =         Assuming[{n \[Element] Integers, n > 0, L > 0, k \[Element] Reals},         Simplify@Sqrt@             Integrate[k^2 η[n, k], {k, -\[Infinity], +\[Infinity]}]]      Mathematica _9_ yields $n\pi/L$ as a result for the last expression. In Mathematica _10_ I get a convergence error: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Uu9Ww.png) **Summary**   1. The problem is real.   2. The problem happens only when I use `ParallelTable[]` (instead of just `Table[]`).   3. The problem goes aways when I run `Quit[]` just before the 2nd `ClearAll` command.
