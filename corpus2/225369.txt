When I see the term _pattern_ in a description of syntax I infer a regular expression is being specified. Is there a separate term that specifies a wildcard expression?               ^foo.*(bar|baz){3} <--  'regular expression' or 'pattern'     foo*bar.txt        <--- 'wildcard expression' or ...?      Or is a wildcard expression just another type of pattern requiring context information to discern the distinction?
