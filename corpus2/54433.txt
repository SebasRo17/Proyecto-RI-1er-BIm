Suppose we have this equation: $$ sin(x+y+z) = x^2y - wz$$ I want mathematica to plot contours of $x$ with axes of $y$ against $z$ in the limit $w \rightarrow 1$, tried this code but didn't work.               a = Reduce[ Sin(x+y+z) == x^2y - wz, x]     a /. w -> 1     ContourPlot[a, {y, 0, 1}, {z, 0, 1}]      I tried a different method here, using Solve, but didn't work either:               ContourPlot [x /. Solve[Sin(x+y+z) = x^2y - z, x], {z,0,1}, {y,0,1} ]
