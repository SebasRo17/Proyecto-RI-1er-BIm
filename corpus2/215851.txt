I am validating data, in this case I want one of three ints. I am asking this question, as it is the fundamental principle I'm interested in. This is a basic example, but I am developing best practices now, so when things become more complicated later, I am better equipped to manage them. Is it preferable to have the try and catch followed by the condition:               public static int getProcType()     {         try         {             procType = getIntInput("Enter procedure type -\n"                 + " 1 for Exploratory,\n"                  + " 2 for Reconstructive, \n"                 + "3 for Follow up: \n");         }         catch (NumberFormatException ex)         {             System.out.println("Error! Enter a valid option!");             getProcType();         }         if (procType == 1 || procType == 2 || procType == 3)         {             hrlyRate = hrlyRate(procType);             procedure = procedure(procType);         }         else         {             System.out.println("Error! Enter a valid option!");             getProcType();         }              return procType;     }      Or is it better to put the if within the try and catch?               public static int getProcType()     {         try         {             procType = getIntInput("Enter procedure type -\n"                 + " 1 for Exploratory,\n"                  + " 2 for Reconstructive, \n"                 + "3 for Follow up: \n");                  if (procType == 1 || procType == 2 || procType == 3)             {                 hrlyRate = hrlyRate(procType);                 procedure = procedure(procType);             }             else             {                 System.out.println("Error! Enter a valid option!");                 getProcType();             }         }         catch (NumberFormatException ex)         {             System.out.println("Error! Enter a valid option!");             getProcType();         }              return procType;     }      I am thinking the if within the try, may be quicker, but also may be clumsy. Which would be better, as my programming becomes more advanced?
