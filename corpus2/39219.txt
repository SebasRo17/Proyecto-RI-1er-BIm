Sort[{13, Sqrt[157], Sqrt[163]}]          (*{13, Sqrt[157], Sqrt[157]}*)          Sort[{13, Sqrt[157], Sqrt[157]}, #1 < #2 &]          (*{Sqrt[157], Sqrt[157], 13}*)      This seems totally broken to me, 13 should always be > `Sqrt[163]` and `Sqrt[157]`. And I only figured out what the problem was when I pasted this into this message - seeing the Sqrt[] funtion rather than the radical sign in the notebook. From my (admittedly limited) understanding of Mathematica, I can sort see how the Sqrt[] would get in the way, but it seems quite painful to have to run output from functions such as Minimize through N before being able to use Sort or SortBy. So, I guess my question is, is this expected behaviour that I just have to learn to live with, or a bug?
