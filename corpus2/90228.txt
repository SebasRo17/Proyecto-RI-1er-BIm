I'm learning how to program with a book on Objective-c. I know, that's not great start, but anyway. What I want to find is exercises which gradually increase in difficulty from starting ones like hello world to fairly complex ones which require few hours to complete. Is there any site out there that offers those excercises? Not necessarily language-specific. I have seen Project Euler but it is more math based, and I'm not too good in math. I know loops, got some grasp on classes, inheritance. What I want is to make something useful. I can't understand where to start.
