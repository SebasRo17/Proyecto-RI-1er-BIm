PetersenGraph[5, 2, EdgeLabels -> {8 \[UndirectedEdge] 9 -> "hello"}]      appears to evaluate perfectly, as expected, but in my version 9.0.1.0, the option `EdgeLabels -> {8 \[UndirectedEdge] 9 -> "hello"}` is marked in red (as well as the preceding comma), as if it is a syntax error. This happens for all predefined graphs I've tried so far. Either this is an interface bug, or I've managed to mess up my syntax highlighting somehow. Can anyone confirm or deny this behaviour?
