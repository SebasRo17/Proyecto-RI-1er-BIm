just for a trial, I generate two ResourceBundle, one is a property file MyResourceBundle.properties and the other one is MyResourceBundle.java in the same directory.When I tried to get a key with this code,                   ResourceBundle bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle("ResourceBundle",currLocale);         System.out.println(bundle.getObject("name"));      The value is brought from the MyResourceBundle.java file. How java decides to get values from in such a situation where all conditions are same ?
