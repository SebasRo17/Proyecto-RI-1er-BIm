Well, I finished my Masters in Embedded Systems, and I am working in GUI development, and working with graphic tools and images and GUI's keep me glued to my seat more than working on code for MUP/MUC . And I want to give game development a Fair chance, try out developing a game from scratch using basic libraries then tryout the same in a free/open source game engine and there is a good chance I may fall in love with it, but it is poissible for a person with an Electrical and Electronics Bachelors and Embedded Systems Masters ( just a years experience in the field) go into game development and be successful in the profession. And I asked the same question @ stackoverflow.com (wrong place to ask ) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13794822/can-a-guy-with-embedded-system- background-go-into-game-development/13794943#13794943 And I received good but a very generic answer. I would be happy to know the actual pro's and con's of a master's in embedded systems migrating to Game Dev
