The system we are developing, using .NET, is extremely large, complex, and some modules are poorly written. We have a large user acceptance test team that is aiming for 100% business scenario coverage, which takes about 6 weeks. Can we use behavior driven development to replace some of the manual tests being done by the test team? How would that information be readable to the test teams so they can be sure it's working? Does BDD replace our integration tests?
