I'm developing an application based on this structure :               /Root     /--- Index.php     /--- /includes/     /--- /modules/     /-------- /Mod1/     /-------- /Mod2/     /-------- /ModN/      In the future, 2 developers will participate in the project.   1. I have to restrict the access for the developers. They shouldn't get access for the "/includes/" folder. It contains the system's Core. They just will have to code modules.   2. I Will use Mercurial. What is the best "organisation" (repository, lock, permissions...) for this kind of project. A need advices. Thank you :)
