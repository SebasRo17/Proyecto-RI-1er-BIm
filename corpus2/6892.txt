When you plot a dataset with `BoxWhiskerChart` passing over the box in the plot with your mouse pointer shows some specifics about the dataset (min and max values, 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 quartiles). However, if you use `Quartiles` or `Median` to calculate those values, they do not correspond. The values displayed by `BoxWhiskerChart` are different. Does anyone have an explanation or is it simply a bug? Is it system specific (here 8.0.1 on OSX 10.6.8)?               data = RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[0, 1], 20]     BoxWhiskerChart[data]     Quartiles[data]     Median[data]
