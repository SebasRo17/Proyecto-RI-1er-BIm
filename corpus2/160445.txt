I am a QA engineer interested in mobile development and automation.I have basic programming experience (intermediate level Python, C++ programmer) and as most companies choose Java for writing frameworks I need to pickup Java. I use Ubutnu 12.04 LTS and I will be using Head First Java as learning material. When I searched for JDK options I found Oracle Java 6 and 7 and Open JDK. I read somewhere in Ubuntu forums that Java 6 is not recommended on Ubuntu systems and I am a little bit confused about which version should I use, that would be compatible with the book and the OS.
