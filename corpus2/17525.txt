[This question was originally asked on Stack Overflow, but recommended to move the question here.] I can't find anything quite like the question I'm about to ask, so please forgive me if there's something just like it already, please feel free to point me in the right direction. It'll take a bit of background explaining too, please forgive me for that. [backstory] Basically, I graduated from University about 18 months ago with a degree in Business Information Systems and Japanese. The Japanese took up half of the degree so the BIS was only joint. I only learned PHP in terms of languages and basically no computing theory - everything was vocational (Networking, programming basics, CMS development, Office and VBA and then loads of Business theory courses). Since this, I decided to teach myself C# and ASP.Net and try to get a position as a programmer. I created an online shop style website and a small CRM application in Windows Forms to both teach myself and build a portfolio, and luckily I managed to snag a developer position. Bad side? I'm the only developer at my company. Now don't get me wrong, in the last year I've learned loads and loads, I did some devpt. before Uni so knew the basics anyway, but it was very much a "learning from books" job - every night. Now then... I am now at a point where I'm building software on a regular basis, making good judgements for time scales, and have even been told my code and methodology are good by other professionals that have been in the game longer than me, and they have offered me jobs. [/backstory] What this whole thing boils down to, is that I now want to study up on the topics I'll have missed by not doing CS. More importantly, could you recommend books / free online courses? I want to learn about Computer Science theory, not just better coding. Thank you!
