I work for a Multi-national product development organization. I work directly for the person who established the Indian wing of the organization. I work incredibly hard and try to do the best possible work I can. But after 6 months of working here I am finding it hard to stay motivated to do my best because no matter how hard I try I do not get any acknowledgement that I did something right or wrong. Often times what I find that I need to do to get things done are not in the conventional wisdom of how software is made. The problem is bothering me so much that I am considering moving to a different company. I don't know if expecting an occasional "good job" is wrong. But it feels like a little sincere appreciation will help make things better for me. Is it just wrong to need it? Have you had a similar experience?
