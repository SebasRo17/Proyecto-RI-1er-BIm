Reading code and discussions pertaining to code, I often see the words "state" and "status" used interchangeably, but the following tendencies seem to exist:   * When a variable holds a value intended to indicate that something is in a certain state, the name of that variable more often than not contains the word "state", or an abbreviation thereof.   * However, when the return value of a function serves to indicate some such state, we tend to call that value a "status code"; and when that value is stored in a variable, this variable is commonly named "status" or something similar. In isolation that's all fine I guess, but when the aforementioned variables are actually one and the same, a choice needs to be made involving the perverted intricacies of English language (or human language in general). What is the prevailing coding-standard or convention when it comes to disambiguating between the two? Or should one of those two always be avoided? This english.stackexchange question is also relevant, I suppose.
