Given a list of real numbers, I need to write a function that returns the value of the first element in the list that differs from the mean of the previous $N$ elements by greater than $P$ standard deviations of those same elements. (I use mean and standard deviation as sample functions, I may decide to use something else.) Clearly, I can write a loop to do this, but I'd like to use functional programming techniques to do this, and continue to learn better Mathematica programming style. `Select[ ]` looked promising, but I see no way to involve the previous list elements in the selection criterion. Thanks in advance for your help! Tom
