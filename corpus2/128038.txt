I have about 4000 lines of code for a web-application in JavaScript / PHP / CSS / HTML. How can I test it properly? I only support the latest version of IE and Safari. I've worked out all the bugs. Is there a good way to test it so that I could go so far as to call the code robust? I've considered using perl Mechanize to auto fill in forms or do something similar. I also have a PHP test class to test the inner working of my PHP classes. However is there some sort of standard or conformance guidelines to be met? Is there a way to say this code passes IEEE xxx foo standards for code robsustness etc.? I have validated my HTML using W3 validators and I've validated my JavaScript using jslint.com. Here is list of dilligence items:   1. HTML / CSS passes W3 validation   2. JavaScript passes jslint   3. PHP passes internal PHP Test Class User Testing   1. Create a set of User Actions and Implement using perl mechanize or similar. Are there standards or procedures for releasing code to the web?
