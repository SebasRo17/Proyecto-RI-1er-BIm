I have this question at MO and I would like to know if we can give hints to get the symbolic sums and products to come out as $\frac{6}{\pi^{2}}\pm\epsilon$ instead of $0.60792710...$ accurate to $\epsilon$.               ε = 0.000000001; s = 0;     Sum[(MoebiusMu[n] + ε)/n^s, {n, 1, ∞}] /        Product[n^(MoebiusMu[n] ε), {n, 1, ∞}] == 1/Zeta[s] + ε        When $s=0$ we get $-2\pm\epsilon$, but we have to use NSum. When $s=2$ or greater, we get the decimal expansion and I would like to see the zeta values $\pm\epsilon$. Can we do this?
