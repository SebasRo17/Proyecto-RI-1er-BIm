I recently started using arguments in my main program (here written in `C++` but could be any programming language)               #include <iostream>          int main(int argn, char* argv[]) {         // do stuff depending on argv[1], argv[2], etc.     }      For now I am using mostly random naming conventions like `-t` for testing, `-d` for debugging, `-l` for printing logs e.g. There is no need for adding `-`, it is just that most shell parameters are named that way. I also use `--` for second parameters. Is there any established naming conventions for main arguments ?
