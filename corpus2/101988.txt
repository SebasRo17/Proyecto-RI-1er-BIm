I assume there are many developers in a situation like this:   * you are an employed software architect/engineer   * you are good at your job   * your company needs more good developers than they can find   * there are many options to get a new job or get self-employed   * work is not your first priority (you enjoy family/free time) Aren't we stupid when we still accept overtime/weekend work/denied bonus payments?   I would think employers would need to give in, if we demand better working conditions. What do you think would happen when we all demand better working conditions?
