These days I often copy urls from Internet Explorer's address bar. When I paste the url into a Mathematica cell it is neither a string nor a expression. Import@http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/search?q=load+file I always manually add " " to get                Import@"http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/search?q=load+file"      Another method is to use `InputString[]` sometimes, I don't like the pop-up dialog. Is there any more lazy way to make               Import@http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/search?q=load+file      successful, maybe by using a button, or InputField, or other setting, or some styled-cell?
