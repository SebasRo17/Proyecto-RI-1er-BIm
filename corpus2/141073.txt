OK this is a simple question but for some reason I just can't get it right. I have to scan from a file hundreds of lines of code and store it in a array (which I can normally do a ok job with) however At one point the code will specify a number that then corresponds to the next batch of chars ints and floats going into various arrays. As I know I am not describing this correctly here is a example. one line of the file I am reading will contain something close to this. > 0221 T 2 S P 850 150 0.90 0.75 500 24 2 2012 G A 7 9600.00 0.1 1000 > Name_of_place > > 0104 L 1 F 400 1.00 0.75 500 24 2 2012 G A 7 9600.00 0.1 1000 Ballroom the problem I am having is This part here > 0221 T **2 S P 850 150** 0.90 0.75 500 24 2 2012 G A 7 9600.00 0.1 1000 > Name_of_place > > 0104 L **1 F 400** 1.00 0.75 500 24 2 2012 G A 7 9600.00 0.1 1000 Ballroom The rest after this is Generally the exact same however at this point the number at the front descides all the values that are going in. I am almost completely lost on how to write a way that can scan this and store the data into arrays correctly
