is there a resource out there that defines programming folder conventions (e.g. the 'bin' folder)? I googled some but didn't find much. Any relevant discussion on the matter is encouraged. **EDIT** : I'm primarily interested in source management, and I'm not really targeting a specific language (I was hoping to get a reference that might include what's common in the big languages [C, C++, C#, PHP, Python, etc]). Sorry, I didn't mean it to be overly vague.
