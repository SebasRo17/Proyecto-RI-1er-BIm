I have a web-app that provides data (that is updated on an interval) for intranet users, who are able to filter information by location. I was having a discussion with a co-worker about whether that filtering should take place on the client vs server side. The amount of information isn't large, but the users are typically interested in a certain location. My question..Is it preferable to let the database filter the data and send the results to the client, or return all data back to the client and then sort by location? If it's not clear cut, when would you choose on method over the other?
