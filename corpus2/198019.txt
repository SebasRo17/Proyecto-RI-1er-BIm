There are a few claimed benefits to Node.js that I typically hear. Some (many?) I agree with. There is one that I completely do not understand, which is the one language argument: "You can now use one language on both the client side and the server side." This does not make sense to me on many levels:   1. most people already know more than one language, and learning a second is anyway not that big of a deal.   2. JavaScript is not that great of a language; if people had any choice they'd probably choose something else on the client side, but they're locked in.   3. the beauty of the server side is you can choose ANY language (so it makes sense to choose the best, most capable language, with the least baggage). The only reasonable argument I've heard is "if I'm using backbone I can re-use my models". Since I haven't used backbone myself I'm not sure how much that actually amounts too however. Can someone shed some light?
