You can setup "UsefulFunction[a, b]" to use custom infix notation "a [LeftRightArrow] b" as follows:               Needs["Notation`"];     AddInputAlias["4" -> ParsedBoxWrapper["\[LeftRightArrow]"]];     InfixNotation[ParsedBoxWrapper["\[LeftRightArrow]"], FlatJoin];      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/RyG04.png) But using a unicode character that does not have a mathematica definition (e.g. "\\[name]") such as "\:27d7" gives you an error: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4ibPi.png) Now the syntax highlighting is broken, and that is really my question: _how can you tell mathematica to correctly syntax highlight new unicode infix operators?_ (Note: the messages can by avoided by adding internal information on the character as follows:               Notation`Private`internalCharacterInformation["⋗"] = {"0x2295", "Infix", "450", "None", "3", "3", "MyOp"}; InfixNotation[ParsedBoxWrapper["⋗"], FlatJoin]      **Edit:** I'm now pretty sure that the answer will involve editing /Applications/Mathematica.app/SystemFiles/FrontEnd/TextResources/UnicodeCharacters.tr and adding something like               0x22D7      \[FlatJoin]     ($fj$   $&FlatJoin;$   $\oplus$)        Infix       320     None        4       4      and then using the Notations package...
