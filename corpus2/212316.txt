I am new to nopCommerce and ecommerce in general but I am involved in an ecommerce project. Now from my past experiences with RavenDB (which mostly were absolutely pleasant) and based on the needs of the business (fast changes with awkward business workflows) It seemed to be an appealing option to have RavenDB handling all sort of things related to the database. I do not understand design and architecture of nopCommerce fully so I did not reach to a conclusion on how to factor data parts, since it seems the services layer actually does not abstract data-layer concepts away; like bringing in EF working model to other layers. I have found another project which used NuDB as it's database as a nopCommerce fork. But it did not help because NuDB still has the feeling of a RDBMS and is not as different as RavenDB. Now first how can I learn about the internals of nopCommerce (other than investigating the code)? It's workflows? It's conventions? Second has anyone tried something similar before with a NoSQL database (say like MongoDB or RavenDB)? Is it possible to achieve this in a 1 (~2) month time frame? Thanks in advance;
