The following code displays differently with v9 & v10:               VectorPlot[{1, 2 x (1 - x)}, {t, 0, 1}, {x, 0, 1},      VectorScale -> {.03, Automatic, None},      VectorStyle -> {Red, "Segment"}]      In v9 the arrowheads are not present. This is the image I want. ![No arrowheads here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cFyOz.jpg) In v10, arrowheads are present and I do not want them. ![with arrowheads](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5RGOv.jpg) I have tried using VectorStyle->{Red,Arrowheads[0]} in v10 but to no avail.
