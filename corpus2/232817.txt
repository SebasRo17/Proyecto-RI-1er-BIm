It's common practice to make some tweaks or fixes in 3rd-party code (be it a simple gist or an entire library). But it's also common that many of these code have they own licensing rules and eventually a header on every file with copyright informations. After making those modifications what's the correct thing to do next? Keep the licence info untouchable or try to update it including yourself with something like `@author` or `@revision` tags? Another common problem is changing the 3rd-party namespace/package to fit it to your project conventions. Some license types include these kind of information in their license block, can I change it freely? I know the answer for these questions depends on each license type, so to make my question more specific... Considering general license rules (usually they are different in minor aspects, right?), is ethical(or at least allowed) that I freely **add information** to the license block about my modifications and perhaps also **modify how do I refer** to it in my code (e.g use `YACorp.YALib` as `Utils.YALib`)? Actualy my concerns are more about "respect to the community" than the legal aspects, I'm asking more about how much we can "go wild" remaining ethical if our project can be considered private or personal.
