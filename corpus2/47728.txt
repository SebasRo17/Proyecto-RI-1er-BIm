CreateTemporary can generate a unique file name like > >     file = CreateTemporary[] >     (* "C:\Documents and Settings\kkouptsov\Local > \Settings\Temp\m-263a0380-3a03-49ac-95cb-d21390b2d3fd" *) >   How do we generate a unique file name such as above example? The reason I don't use CreateTemporary because I don't need to actually create the file, but only need the file path. I plan to generate many of these names in parallel, and they should be unique to each other.
