I have insert 14.485 lines on MySQL like this:               INSERT INTO `bairros` (`id`,`cidade_id`,`descricao`) VALUES (1,8891,'VILA PELICIARI');     INSERT INTO `bairros` (`id`,`cidade_id`,`descricao`) VALUES (2,8891,'VILA MARIANA');     ...      It took around 5 minutes. I had to insert in another table 16.021 lines, same database, so for test I did this:               INSERT INTO `bairros` (`id`,`cidade_id`,`descricao`) VALUES (1,8891,'VILA PELICIARI'),(2,8891,'VILA MARIANA');     ...      It took just a few seconds. What is the difference, for the database, between the scripts? And why one is faster than the other?
