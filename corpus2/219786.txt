I'm trying to build a bot that will parse the list of classes offered by my university and let me know when the one I'm looking for is open. The problem is that in order to get to the registration/search box, I have to log in with my university username and password. I'm trying to figure out what protocol that my school uses to authenticate me so I can give my bot my credentials and let it log in for me so it can access the registration/search page, so how can I figure out what they are using so I can figure out how to implement it in whatever language I decide to use. I've gone through packet captures but all I can see is the SSL syn/ack, which I guess is the point of SSL haha. Can anyone recommend how to figure out what protocol my school uses to log in users?
