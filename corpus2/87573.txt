According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, this is the difference: > Computer programmers write programs. After computer software engineers and > systems analysts design software programs, the programmer converts that > design into a logical series of instructions that the computer can follow They predict employment to increase for software engineers by 34% but to decline for programmers. Is there actually any such real distinction between the 2 jobs? How can one get a job designing programs (to be implemented by others)?
