I always thought that things in general go faster when working with sparse array but, I got this: > `Eigenvalues::arhm:` Because finding 144 out of the 144 eigenvalues and/or > eigenvectors is likely to be faster with dense matrix methods, the sparse > input matrix will be converted. If fewer eigenvalues and/or eigenvectors at > machine precision would be sufficient, consider using N on the matrix and > restricting this number using the second argument to `Eigenvalues`. >>
