I've read the documentation and tutorials on using _Mathematica_ and the kernel from the command line, and all of these materials suggest that I ought to be able to simply type either               $ mathematica      or               $ math      in Terminal, assuming these these commands have been installed in (variously) `/usr/local/bin` or `/usr/bin`. But I get the usual "command not found" error message that results when this is not the case, even though these directories are in my PATH. Where does _Mathematica_ (9.0) really install `mathematica` and `math` on OSX Lion?
