How can the permutation that takes`{-f, -i, i, -e}` into `{-e, -i, i, -f}` be realised as a sequence of nearest neighbour transpositions? In this case the succession could be               {{-e, i}, {-e, -i}, {-e, -f}, {-i, -f}, {i, -f}}      The transposition operation has the following peculiarity: the transposition `{-f, -i}` leaves `{-f, -i, i, -e}` unchanged since `-f` and `-i` are already in the right order. I'm interested in the (or a) shortest sequence of transpositions. Often there is more then one shortest sequence.
