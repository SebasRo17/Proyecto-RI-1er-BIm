I'm just starting out as a web designer. I'm trying to build up a portfolio for my own website. I'm concerned about designing a site and handing it over to the client. Once I do this I could lose access to the site. They can change the login information and they may not need to me manage it. If the client changes anything on the site that compromises my design work, it will reflect my business. My business' name will be on the homepage of the website. Is this a valid concern?
