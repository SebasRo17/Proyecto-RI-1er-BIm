In my last question we defined a colorfunction `cf`. Now I want to use this `ColorFunction` for a number of different plots (`MatrixPlot`, `BarChart3D`, `ListContourPlot` and `ListPlot3D`) as encoding for the `z` value from a given table. For the `ListContourPlot` and `BarChart3D` it seems to work, but I don't know how to apply the color encoding for the remaining plots. An another problem is the definition of a interval for the color encoding - here I mean that my data ranges from e.g. 0...30 , but i want to define a limit for the `ColorFunction` such that values are encoded from 10...20 according to the `ColorFunction`, values below 10 and over 30 should be clamped to the extrema of the `ColorFunction`. Is it possible to achieve something like that?! Thanks in advance!               dataResponse = {{1, 1, 3.}, {2, 1, 3.5}, {3, 1, 5.5}, {4, 1, 9.}, {5, 1, 13.}, {6, 1,        30.}, {1, 2, 3.5}, {2, 2, 5.5}, {3, 2, 7.5}, {4, 2, 8.5}, {5, 2,        15.}, {6, 2, 30.}, {1, 3, 4.}, {2, 3, 5.5}, {3, 3, 8.5}, {4, 3,        10.}, {5, 3, 20.5}, {6, 3, 30.}, {1, 4, 4.5}, {2, 4, 7.5}, {3, 4,        12.5}, {4, 4, 30.}, {5, 4, 30.}, {6, 4, 30.}, {1, 5, 5.}, {2, 5,        8.}, {3, 5, 14.5}, {4, 5, 30.}, {5, 5, 30.}, {6, 5, 30.}, {1, 6,        7.5}, {2, 6, 13.}, {3, 6, 30.}, {4, 6, 30.}, {5, 6, 30.}, {6, 6,        30.}}          cbData = {{215, 48, 39},{252, 141, 89},{254, 224, 144}, {224, 243, 248}, {145, 191, 219}, {69, 117, 180}}     cbData = Reverse[cbData]     With[{rgb = RGBColor @@@(cbData/255)},      cf = Blend[rgb, #]&;     ]          ListPlot3D[ dataResponse,                 Mesh -> All,                  ColorFunction -> cf,                 Boxed -> False,                 FaceGrids -> {                                 {Bottom,{Range[0,5,1],Range[0,5,1]}},                                 {Back,{Range[0,5,1],Range[0,30,5]}},                                 {Left,{Range[0,5,1],Range[0,30,5]}}},                 AspectRatio->1,                 AxesLabel -> {"Scene Complexity","Object Coherence","Response Time"},                 Ticks -> {  {{0,20},{1,30},{2,40},{3,50},{4,60},{5,70}}, {{0,0.045},{1,0.054},{2,0.063},{3,0.072},{4,0.081},{5,0.09}} ,Range[0,30,5]}                 ]      As you can see the resulting mesh is color-coded along the y axis, but I want to have the z-axis color encoded and in addition the values from 0...10 should have the same blue and values 20...30 should be red --> so that they are clamped ![Mesh](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uRfkZ.jpg)
