I used `Extract` with `Hold` to retrieve a sublist containing expressions I didn't want evaluating, _e.g._               foo = Extract[OwnValues[test], {1, 2}, Hold]     (* Hold[{expr1, expr2, expr3}] *)      I'm sorry to ask such a trivial question, but, how do I get the length of that list? Obviously `Length@foo` returns `1` because the top-level head is `Hold`. But attempting to access the lower levels seems to cause evaluation one way or another. What technique am I missing?
