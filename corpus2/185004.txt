My question is conceptual, yet extremely vital for me. I'm an intermediate Python developer. I know fair enough about it, and actually use it on a daily basis. Now, I would like to transform my capabilities from a library/API user to "designer" one. I found that "Python Requests" library by **Kenneth Reitz** is an extremely good place to explore Python patterns and idioms. I need to learn to split a big problem into its essential `Modules`, define required classes/functions, and use them to work together. I lack such a discipline, and I'm starving to gain this knowledge. How should I dive into this library? It is **big** , with many modules (with logical names, of course), classes, and methods. I started to read the code, but I don't know where I am and what this portion of code is designed for.
