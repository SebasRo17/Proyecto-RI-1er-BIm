Is there any way to highlight the whole selected cell? some times if I want to delete a certain cell and if the code is long and cells are without output, it is hard to know which cell that you are selecting. For example, in this simple file, I want to select a certain cell as seen: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Vv9Mr.jpg) If I want to select the second cell, I may make mistake and select the above or below cell (especially if the code is long). is there any way to highlight the whole cell once I selected it from the right?
