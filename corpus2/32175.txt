I'm trying to do this:               i1 = 1;     i2 = 1;          RandomChoice[{       (i1 = i1 + 1),       (i1 = i1 - 1),       (i2 = i1 + 1),       (i2 = i2 - 1)}]      In order to chose randomly which variable is going to be incremented or decremented - but it's not working. I've also tried with `--` and `++` but I had the same problem. I am clueless about what may be the problem.
