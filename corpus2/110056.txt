Till now, I have had the experience of developing either a desktop application or a Website. But, with this Hotel reservation system, I am interfacing a problem that needs both. The application needs to be fulfil the following requirements :   * Manager can do the bookings/checkout of the incoming customers at the reception counter System.   * Customers should be able to book themselves online.  As you can see, the second requirements clearly means that a web app is required, whereas the first can be accomplished via desktop development. This type of requirement is pretty common. Like, in case of cinema seat bookings, We are free to book ourself online or we can go the ticket window and buy one. The question is how are these simultaneous and different requirements fulfilled for a single project. There has to be a sync or else the customer might book himself in an already booked room. From my understanding, there are two ways to develop this solution.   1. You develop a Web application with a back-end(admin panel) and host it on a server. The customers can book themselves on the front-end, while the manager(at reception desk) can use the administrator panel to carry out his bookings and checkouts. Since both front-end and back-end are using a single database, there is no requirement for sync.   2. Develop a desktop application for use at the Hotel and a website for the customers to book online. The two applications are maintaining a single datbase, therefore synchronization comes into play. Some definite development for the sync is mandatory or else the system will fail.  Which of the above solutions should I choose ?. This is also a common scenario for banks. They handle transactions at the local branch as well as over the Internet. How do they achieve this thing. Much like i mentioned above or something different.
