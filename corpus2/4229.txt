I've got a Manipulate that does a vector field plot. Basically a function that returns a list of Graphics objects and a couple of sliders:               Manipulate[      Show[ReleaseHold[s[v, r1, r1 + s2] ]]      , {{r1, 1.}, 1., 2.5 }      , {{s2, 1.}, 1., 2.5 }      , {{v, 1.}, 0., 2.5 }      ]      Once I set the sliders in a position that I like, I discovered the neat feature "Paste Snapshot" that samples my slider position values, that I can use to save the resulting image to a file. I've just discovered the autorun feature of Manipulate, which is a neat visualization tool. Is there a way save the autorun output showing the image and the sliders all animated in a list, so that I can run Export[ "filename.avi", %] as if I had a plain old table of images?
