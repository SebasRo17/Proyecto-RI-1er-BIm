I want to release a software application developed by me as freeware and after I make considerable profits(from its commercial version), I'll release it as an open source. So, could someone please suggest me how I can release my app under freeware license, from where I can get that license, suggest me the best way. (I don't know much about these governing laws). I hope freeware license we can make it at free of cost. Please don't leave me by giving a set of vendors list, suggest me which one fits to my release. I don't have any specific terms or conditions that user has to obey while using that application. Note: Till now I've not released it or discussed it any where else.
