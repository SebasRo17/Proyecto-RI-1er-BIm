I've come across two methods of using braces with if/for/switch/while/function blocks in Java, JS, C++, and PHP (any language that uses braces for creating scopeblocks) One of them is like this:                If(...){         ...      }else{       ...      }      I've always used this, it's become an unbreakable habit for me. This leads to compact code, but many people who look at my code get confused because they don't realise that there is an opening brace. I personally call this method 'bouncing braces' (don't know why) The other method is this:                If(...)      {         ...      }      else      {       ...      }      This is less compact, but is clearer. This is what most people seem to expect (from what I've seen--and I've not seen much). If they don't see the opening brace below the if, they think its missing. So I have two questions:   * What are these two practices, (if they have names) called?   * Which one is better practice?
