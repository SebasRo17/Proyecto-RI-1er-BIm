I always have trouble figuring out if I should name a certain method starting with `getSomething` versus `findSomething`. The problem resides in creating _helpers_ for poorly designed APIs. This usually occurs when getting data from an object, which requires the object as a parameter. Here is a simple example:               public String getRevision( Item item ) {         service.load( item, "revision" );         // there is usually more work to do before getting the data..         try {             return item.get_revision();         }         catch( NotLoadedException exception ) {             log.error( "Property named 'property_name' was not loaded", exception );         }         return null;     }      How and why to decide between naming this method as `getRevision()` or `findRevision()`?
