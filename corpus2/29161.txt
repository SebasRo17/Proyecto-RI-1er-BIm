I have the following simple code               Clear["Global`*"];          V = v0^2/2*Log[x^2 + (y/q)^2 + rc^2];     sub = {(v0^2/(x^2 + (y/q)^2 + rc^2)) -> (arg)};          Vx = D[V, x];     Vy = D[V, y];          Vxx = Simplify[D[V, {x, 2}]];     Vxy = Simplify[D[Vx, y]];     Vyy = Simplify[D[V, {y, 2}]];     Vyx = Simplify[D[Vy, x]];          Print["******************************"]     Print["Vx = ", Vx //. sub]     Print["Vy = ", Vy //. sub]     Print["Vxx = ", Vxx //. sub]     Print["Vxy = ", Vxy //. sub]     Print["Vyx = ", Vyx //. sub]     Print["Vyy = ", Vyy //. sub]     Print["*****************************"]      which calculates the first and second derivatives the function $V$. The printed results I added a rule `sub` in order to make the output much simpler. However, for a strange reason, the rule applies correctly to the first derivatives $Vx$ and $Vy$ but it has no effect to the second ones $(Vxx, Vxy, Vyx, Vyy)$. Any ideas why?
