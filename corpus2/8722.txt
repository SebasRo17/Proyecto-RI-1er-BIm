I need to produce a 3-dimensional equispaced grid over a given function in a way, that I can calculate intersection points of the function with the grids edges. So my first question is how to produce this grid in Mathematica. I don't really get if this is possible by modeling the grid by `Polygon`s? For this I might need some help then, too. Or can it be done by using more simple graphics objects like done here?
