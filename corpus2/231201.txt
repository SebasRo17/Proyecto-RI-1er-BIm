I have a lot of small projects, and while their source code is backed up and tracked with git, I don't know what to do with the rest of the files associated with a project. These consist of small text files, some images, maybe a prototype or proof of concept, etc. They're not necessary to build or deploy, but I need them while working on the project. It's not really documentation, but rather todo lists, bugs to be fixed, a few screenshots, that sort of thing. As I said before, they're small projects so I don't think I should create a wiki/bugtracker for each one, especially since I'm the only developer :) I backup these, but I feel they could benefit from git as well (in another repository). I've sorted these files in three main folders, "current", "abandoned", and "finished". **Should I use git and just`git mv` the files when the project is finished or abandoned ? I'm a bit new to git, and I don't know how well tools "like" whole folders that move.** If you have a better way of keeping track of those files, I'm interested. It's probably too broad for a SE question, though.
