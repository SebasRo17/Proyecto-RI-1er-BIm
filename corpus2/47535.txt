I want to solve for all solutions to the system of equations $a_1 a_2 a_3 b_4 + a_1 a_2 b_3 + a_1 b_2 + b_1 = 0$ and $a_1 a_2 a_3 a_4 = 1$ where the $a_i$'s and $b_i$'s take on values from $\\{-1,1\\}$. Is there a way to efficiently solve this besides exhaustive casework? Also, is there a way to specify a custom domain for $\\{-1,1\\}$ in Mathematica so I can just do this on my computer?
