I'm interested in the ability of rules engines to:   * launch and iterate over business driven logic   * have "business users" perform the actual modification of those rules rather than developers   * comprehend the business rules in general Also, does using a rules engine impact the quality of an application? Does the use of a rules engine change if you were deploying to a 1-machine setup vs. your architecture vs. a multi-tier cloud-based distributed architecture using thousands of machines? How would it be different?
