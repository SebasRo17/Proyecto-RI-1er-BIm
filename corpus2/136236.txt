I am currently doing my 1st accademic project where we have to work in groups of 4 to develop an application (java ...). Anyways, how might work be assigned so that there is less dependencies on each other and we can work separately instead of waiting on one another? I suggested 1 person develop 1 layer: Model, View, Controller, Data Access. I am working on Data Access but I find I need Model classes: For example My `EventsDataAccess` has a `findEventByName(String name)` that returns an `Event`, which is developed by another person. How should I proceed? Here `Event` is a very small class so it shouldn't take long, but suppose its big, it might be a long wait? How is work usually split up for developers in a small to medium sized team? Its so much easier to work in say a very small familiar team with, say 2 persons only
