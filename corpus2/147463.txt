I'm working on a small open source project, ELLCC, that uses clang/LLVM as a cross compiler for various target processors. For the runtime environment, I'm using the NetBSD libraries and porting them to target Linux and standalone systems. I want to run a POSIX compliance test suite on the code. I've found the Open POSIX Test Suite, which looks like a good start, but it hasn't been updated since 2005. I've done some preliminary testing (with gcc and ecc under Linux), and it looks like it needs a few updates for modern compilers. My questions are:   1. Does the Open POSIX Test Suite live on somewhere in a more up to date form?   2. Are there other open source alternatives?
