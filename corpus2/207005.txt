1. How can I describe the growth function in terms of n for the following algorithm?   2. What is the bounding function (the Big-O)? Is it O(n^3)? * * *               for(i = 0 to n - 1)     {         c = i + 1         for(j = c to n)         {             arr[j] += arr[i];                  for(k = c to 0 step -1) // what does the keyword "step" mean?             {                 arr[k] *= arr[j];             }         }     }
