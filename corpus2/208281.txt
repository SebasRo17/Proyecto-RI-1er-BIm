I am developing a web service in java that requires to do an asynchronous call to a 3rd party app by aggregating about 100 requests or for a minute (whichever happens earlier). Is there any open source framework or known design patterns available to help me in this. I have looked at JMS and Spring-Batch. JMS processes each message (and not aggregate) and Spring Batch provides batch execution but also doesn't provide this aggregation support. I can implement my own queue and handler service to make sure I aggregate the results and process it, but I was looking for solutions like JMS which also takes care of persisting the message/data incase of failure and re-using it once system is back up.
