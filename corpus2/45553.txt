I need to do numerical integration --> differentiation --> numerical integration. I tried to apply the technique described in the accepted answer to a similar question:               y = t^2 x^2;     f[t_?NumericQ] := NIntegrate[y, {x, 1, 2}]     g[t_?NumericQ] := D[f[t], t]     NIntegrate[g[t]*t, {t, 1, 2}]      However, it still generates the error:               NIntegrate::inumr: The integrand g[t] has evaluated to non-numerical values for all sampling points in the region with boundaries {{1,2}}. >>      This approach won't work due to the differentiation in between. What am I missing?
