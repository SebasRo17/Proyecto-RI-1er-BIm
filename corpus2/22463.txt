I am trying to create a pareto chart for some non technical folks and having the hardest time formatting it correctly… Here’s my sample code:               (*Some dynamically generated data *)          mydata = {0.9436, 2.20725333345, 2.1402, 1.8729, 4.9436, 0.4819};     mylabels = {"l1", "l2", "l3", "l4", "some really long label", "another really long label", "l7"};          (*lets riffle and sort the data *)          a =  Sort[ Partition[Riffle[mylabels, mydata], 2], #1[[2]] > #2[[2]] & ];          BarChart[a , BarOrigin -> Left, BarSpacing -> -1, LabelingFunction -> (Placed[#, After] &), Axes -> None, Frame -> True, FrameTicks -> None, FrameLabel -> "Some Title", GridLines -> None, AspectRatio -> 0.3, ImageSize -> Full, ChartStyle -> "Pastel"]      A few questions:   * What is the best way to truncate to 2 digits in the labels, I tried using `NumberForm` in the Sort function but doesn’t work since Numberform is a wrapper.   * Labeling works reasonably well when labels are short but I seem to run into placement issues with long labels… Any ideas on better ways to handle this?   * Frame produced by Mathematica seems to overlap with the labels…  Any suggestions gladly appreciated!
