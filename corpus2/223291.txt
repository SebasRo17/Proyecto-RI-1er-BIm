I previously had an issue with my node.js app on Heroku. I added the dependency into my package.json and now it is working. But, is this the best way to do it?               {       "name": "application-name",       "version": "0.0.1",       "private": true,       "scripts": {         "start": "node app.js"       },       "dependencies": {         "express": "3.4.4",         "jade": "*",         "stylus": "*",         "ejs": "0.8.5"       },       "engines": {         "node": "0.10.1",         "npm": "1.3.14"       }     }      I ask because the other dependencies have a "*" which were there by default in my express app. What exactly does that mean and am I fine with leaving this file the way it is?
