I want to define a function for doing multiple definitions, where I apply the same function `f` to all values, and definitions are done not at the same time but after each other. A simple example: the function I want is `multiDef`, where               multiDef[{{a, 1}, {b, 2}, {c, a}}, f]      should be identical to the sequence of assignments               a = f[1];     b = f[2];     c = f[a];      A simple attempt, with slightly different syntax, is               multiDef[list1_List, list2_List, fct_] /; Length[list1] == Length[list2] :=        list1 = fct /@ list2      Aside from the different syntax the problem here is that it will not set `c` to `f[f[1]]`, but to `f[a]` (or to `f[5]` if we had `a = 5` before running this).
