I am performing a nested integration where the upper limit of the inner integral depends on the value of the outer integral, like in the question [Nested NIntegrate]. As in this question my function can not be symbolically integrated. However, my function is a vector (representing a force field in 3D) instead of a scalar. Wolfram Technical Support confirmed that NIntegrate does not support integration of a list of numerical values. Therefore the answer to the Nested NIntegrate question does not directly work. I have considered simply creating three numeric functions that each calculate the force and take a different component of it, then integrating each separately. I could also create three interpolations and integrate them separately, which speeds up the calculation at the expense of accuracy. Is there a better way to do this?
