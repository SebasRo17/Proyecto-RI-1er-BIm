In my subscription form I want to use a double opt-in method:   * First, the visitor subscribes   * Then a confirmation email is dispatched. If he replies...   * Then I add him to the system.  In the case where the user does not reply, how long can I store their email address? Are there any legal requirements with regard to that? I am from U.S. and I am also interested in the policy in European countries.
