We use sourcesafe to keep all of our code up to date in what we do in our office, but it's getting to the point where we need to write a few notes and attach different versions of our code for different things (mainly webapps, asp.net) Is there a wiki out there designed for this? Ive looked at Trac but i'm not sure it's best for the job. We really just need somewhere where we can login and see okay x did a release to our main server on y with z changes. We could make one but don't really have the time at the moment. Any suggestions? Thanks a lot, Tom
