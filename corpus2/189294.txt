Dear fellow programmers I'm the CTO and the lead programmer at our start-up. Our CEO came into office with hurry and asked me to reschedule so we can pick a very important customer at the airport. When at the airport, I realized the customer is actually more of a business man, a visionary (and a quite successful one) than a programmer. I knew from somewhere else that he was a programmer once so I asked him what happened? After a long humiliating look at my expense he replied : "-What happened ? I have people to code for me !" I have been thinking about what he said since that moment. I am bit by bit losing my interest in development and feel like we are all kinda 2nd class citizens in the IT industry. I can't help feeling like programmers and technical people in general are mere tools in the hands of more visionary people. Your insights are most welcome. EDIT: As it appears, to some the question is unclear. What I'm asking is a comparison between technical and visionary people and to give evidence that technical people are not replaceable work-units in the big scheme of things. The story is just to give the reader a picture of the problem.
