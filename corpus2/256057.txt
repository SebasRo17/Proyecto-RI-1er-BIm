I need to do text processing in files such as `"replace the second column of the third line of all files in the current folder with the string 'hello'"` or `"list all files in folder ./Hello and write the output into the file ./Hello.txt"`. I thought Python would be a good solution but in fact it is not since you can't directly overwrite files. But I might be wrong since I'm beginner. Here is a working example with Python : I have a list of names of files in `listRef.txt` and I want to write in another text file `list.txt` all the names of files that ARE NOT present the folder `C:\interface\output` :               import os          symbolsRef = []          #List of files to python list     for line in open(r'C:\interface\listRef.txt', "r"):         symbolsRef.append(line)          #Remove from the listRef all lines that contain the names of existing files     for symb in os.listdir(r'C:\interface\output'):         symbolsRef.remove(symb[0:-4]+'\n')          #Write list of files in folder to text file     with open(r'C:\interface\list.txt', "w") as presentList:             for filenames in symbolsRef:                 print(filenames[0:-1], file = presentList)      As you can see I have to create a list, work with the list then write it back to my output file. I might be wrong but I'm confident that you can do better with other solutions. I am giving this working example so an experienced programmer can compare the length of the same program but coded with an other solution. So what is, from your experienced point of view, the solution that -in general- requires the least number of line of code to do a wide variety of tasks in text and file processing : use of regex, index dependant line and column replacement, folder listing, file creation-deletion-replacement. Is it shell scripting with sed and awk, Perl, special libraries in Python or maybe some dedicated softwares ?
