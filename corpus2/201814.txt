I have been teaching myself Python as a first language for 2 years now. So far I have done some online courses (NLP, Design of a Computer Program etc.) and solved some puzzles but never worked with big applications. Yet right now I have the opportunity to do some real work with Python on a project at my university. It's a web app using the Pyramid framework, currently at about 8000 lines. And they are using quite a few tricks that I have never encountered before - stuff like `__metaclass__`, lots of OO stuff that I have no prior experience with. Do you believe that I could still do useful work for the project? And what could I do to prove my worth? **Edit:** The developers on the project are at a different university. The job available at my university seems to be a classic code review job: Check the code for security flaws, style, coherence, efficiency etc.
