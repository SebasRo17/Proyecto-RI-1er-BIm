How can I check if an Android application running on a not rooted device is "secure" without knowing its source? I would look for:   1. Plain text in Web-Requests (wireshark and emulator)   2. SQL-injection (in EditTexts...)   3. Doing stuff, that isn't always expected (i.e. fast clicking to check for race conditions) Question: What else could be interesting for auditing Android apps?
