There is a rather simple integral ($K_0$ is the 0-th order MacDonald function) $$\int_0^\infty e^{-x \cosh\xi}\, d\xi = K_0(x)$$ which mathematica cannot solve. This even though the documentation claims that Integrate can give results in terms of many special functions. In fact it can solve the integral obtained by substituting $r=\cosh \xi$, $$\int_1^\infty \frac{e^{-x r}}{\sqrt{r^2-1}}\,dr=K_0(x).$$ In fact it also failed in solving the more general integral $$\int_0^\infty e^{-x \cosh\xi} \cosh(\alpha \xi)\, d\xi = K_\alpha(x).$$ I am using "8.0 for Mac OS X x86 (64-bit) (October 5, 2011)". Are there more recent or older versions of Mathematica which can solve this class of integrals? * * * **Edit:** I want to stress that this is not an arbitrary integral but can be thought of as a definition of $K_0$ (the corresponding integral $\int_0^{2\pi} \\!e^{i x \cos \xi}\,d\xi$ for $J_0$ mathematica handles very well). I am just curious how it can happen that a system as developed as Mathematica cannot handle this "elementary" integral. Here is the Mathematica code for those who want to test:               Integrate[Exp[-x Cosh[ξ]],{ξ,0,Infinity}]      Now I found a related integral which indeed is a bug in mathematica. If you try to evaluate ($x \in \mathbb{R}$) $$\int_0^\infty \cos(x \sinh \xi)\,d\xi = K_0(|x|)$$ then Mathematica claims that the integral diverges.
