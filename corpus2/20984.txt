I have tried various ways to combine Manipulate and Sound/SoundNote that would allow me to vary the frequency of a sound while it is being produced. The addition of Dynamic didn't help, but did increase the variety of error messages. Is this just not possible?               Manipulate[EmitSound[Sound[SoundNote[n, 3]]], {n, 0, 10}]      My goal to listen to, or observe, the beat frequencies produced as a tone becomes closer to or further away from twice the frequency of a second, steady tone. My underlying issue is to develop insight into how original idea of an octave.
