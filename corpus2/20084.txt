I know git is great for open source projects. But i was wondering. For a company with 20 programmers on a 1 year project which source control is desirable? From what i heard GIT uses pulling, wouldnt it be less then desirable to need to go through someone else to get your changes in the main trunk? especially when everyone is working at the same time? Thats just of an example i wonder. I know how to use svn but even at my last job we didnt use it on our projects since everything was done in php and typically standalone 1 week projects. I just had svn for my local code and didnt need to use it with others. So what are good source controls and specifically why is it good for this?
