A website I'm making has been growing larger and larger feature wise. Which means there's more URL parameters that get passed from page A to B or B to C, etc. Does anyone have any tips for how to keep track of and use parameter keys and expected values? Ex. Say a url I need to build is `www.example.com?type=this&mode=a` Is there some kind of a system that will let me easily keep track of the fact that the "type" parameter key is in fact "type"? I tried to keep them all in a constants class, but that class quickly grew out of hand.               public class URLParameters {             public static final String TYPE = "type" ;        public static final String MODE = "mode" ;             //more "keys"            public static class Values {               public static final String TYPE_THIS = "this" ;          public static final String TYPE_THAT = "that" ;               public static final String MODE_PRIMARY = "a" ;          public static final String MODE_SECONDARY = "b" ;              //more expected values       }          }
