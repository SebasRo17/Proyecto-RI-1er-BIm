For an multidimensional integration I want to build up the integration limits with the following code. (the length of vars is also variable)               x = 0.223144;     vars = {x1, x2, x3};     Table[{vars[[k]], -x/(1 + i), x/(1 + i)}, {k, 1, 3}, {i, 0, 2}]      which gives me:               {{{x1, -0.223144, 0.223144}, {x1, -0.111572, 0.111572}, {x1, -0.0743812, 0.0743812}}, {{x2, -0.223144,0.223144}, {x2, -0.111572, 0.111572}, {x2, -0.0743812,0.0743812}}, {{x3, -0.223144, 0.223144}, {x3, -0.111572,0.111572}, {x3, -0.0743812, 0.0743812}}}      As I see it, it makes an outer product. But I just want the the following integration variables with the corresponding limits.               {{x1, -0.223144, 0.223144}, {x2, -0.111572, 0.111572},{x3, -0.0743812, 0.0743812}}      How would I achieve that? Thank you
