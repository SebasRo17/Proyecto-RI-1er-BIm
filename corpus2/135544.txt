The Top 10 programming languages, according to the TIOBE index seem to be heavily influenced by C: **1\. Java** > The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++ but has a simpler > object model and fewer low-level facilities. - _wikipedia.org_ **2\. C** > C is one of the most widely used programming languages of all time and there > are very few computer architectures for which a C compiler does not exist. - > _wikipedia.org_ **3\. C#** > During the development of the .NET Framework, the class libraries were > originally written using a managed code compiler system called Simple > Managed C (SMC). In January 1999, Anders Hejlsberg formed a team to build a > new language at the time called Cool, which stood for "C-like Object > Oriented Language". - _wikipedia.org_ **4\. C++** > It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs as an > enhancement to the C language. - _wikipedia.org_ **5\. Objective-C** > Objective-C is a reflective, object-oriented programming language that adds > Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming language. - _wikipedia.org_ **6\. PHP** > He rewrote these scripts as C programming language Common Gateway Interface > (CGI) binaries, extending them to add the ability to work with Web forms and > to communicate with databases and called this implementation "Personal Home > Page/Forms Interpreter" or PHP/FI. - _wikipedia.org_ **8\. Python** > Python was conceived in the late 1980s and its implementation was started in > December 1989 by Guido van Rossum at CWI in the Netherlands as a successor > to the ABC programming language (itself inspired by SETL) capable of > exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. - > _wikipedia.org_ > > ABC (programming language) Its designers claim that ABC programs are > typically around a quarter the size of the equivalent Pascal or C programs, > and more readable. - _wikipedia.org_ **9\. Perl** > Perl borrows features from other programming languages including C, shell > scripting (sh), AWK, and sed. - _wikipedia.org_ **10\. JavaScript** > JavaScript uses syntax influenced by that of C. - _wikipedia.org_ It appears that most of them borrow their syntax from C and / or are heavily influenced in several other ways, at least in their beginnings. Why?
