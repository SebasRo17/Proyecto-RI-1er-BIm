I'm new to Mathematica, so I don't really know, how do what I want, and I don't even know how to google it. Doing one Mathematica task for my supervisor, I faced the following problem. I need to write a function with such a syntax:               f[{{var1, val1}, {var2, val2}, ..., {varn, valn}}]      Here $var_i$ is a variable and $val_i$ is a value, which will be assigned to this variable. So this functions is a "parallel" analogue of the function Set[]. $var_i$ has already its value, and it can be evaluated (but it's not what I want). Number of variables $n$ can vary. Apparently, I need to set Hold attribute for $f$, but what should I do next? The first thing I've tried to do was just `f[l_] := l[[All, 1] = l[[All, 2]]`, but it didn't worked due to some part assignment restrictions. But if I try to extract variables like `vars = l[[All, 1]]` and than do `vars = l[[All, 2]]`, it doesn't work too, because `vars` just become replaced with values from `l[[All, 2]]`. I know, I must use Hold[] and Unveluated[] somehow, but I don't know how to apply them here. **P.S.** The problem I've really faced is sligtly different: I want to build function, which argument is `{{var1, a1, b1, n1}, ...}` and which will iterate over $var_i$ from $a_i$ to $b_i$ with step $n_i$. I try to implement "parallel" Set[] first, because of its simplicity. **P.S.S.** Sorry for my English, it's not my native language.
