Suppose I want to compute this : `Series[Sin[1/f], {f, Infinity, 10}]` but finally I prefer `Sin[1/f]` up to the fourth order in `1/f`. How can I do this ? My first idea was to use the `O[]` function but it didn't work because `1/f is not a valid variable`. My second idea was to use firstly `/. f -> 1/eps` and then `O[eps]^4` but it didn't work as well... Note also that, for many reasons, `Series[Sin[1/f], {f, Infinity, 4}]` is not a solution to me !
