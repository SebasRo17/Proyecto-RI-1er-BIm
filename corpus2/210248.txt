I have just landed a role as a C#/Asp.Net developer at a large software house. I have previously worked at a much smaller software house for about two years but it was a varied/mixed role there, and here the asp.net applications we have are a factor of 10 or so larger. As seems to be the norm, I have been given the task of fixing bugs. At the moment I am just trying to understand the system. How long , in your experience , does it "roughly" take ( and is generally acceptable) for a new developer to get up to speed? It of course varies from company to company but as a general rule, when you have hired someone/have worked with someone new, how many days/weeks would it have been normal for them to get to grips with the system?
