I have a 3-channel image which shows red and green points (certain labelled proteins) inside blue regions (cell nuclei). After applying some segmentation filters, the resulting image is as follows: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/n6Eit.png) The regions circled in blue are separated into components following steps similar to those mentioned in this guide Count Cells The red and green points are also both separated into components. What would be the best way to count those red and green points which are bound by the blue components?   -EDIT- What I mean is counting the points per blue-bound area, not the entire image as a whole. Sorry for the confusion. A rather brute-force method would be to call SelectComponents with a Do loop using the Label attribute of the components and use that as a mask. Is there a better and more efficient method of doing this?               Do[mask =         Image[SelectComponents[nuclei, "Label", # == nucList[[i]] &]];        redFoci =         ComponentMeasurements[         SelectComponents[ImageMultiply[redChan, mask], "Count",           2 < # < 100 &], "Centroid"];        greenFoci =         ComponentMeasurements[         SelectComponents[ImageMultiply[greenChan, mask], "Count",           2 < # < 100 &], "Centroid"];        AppendTo[fociList, {Length[redFoci], Length[greenFoci]}];       , {i, Length[nucPos]}];     Print[fociList];
