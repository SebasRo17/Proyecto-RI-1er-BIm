I'm actually interest about zero-knowledge storage system. Those system where the storage provider claims he can't have any access to the data stored. As far I know, the data are encryptit using a symmetric encryption system, such as AES or other, But those system needs a key to function. So what happens to the key? is it stored? Where? If a user connect from an other location, and want to retrieve one of his file, he must retrieve the key first. So if the storage provider store the key too, he could have access to the encrypted data. It's like having a chest locked and the code on a paper next to the chest, then claim that you couldn't open the chest. So is there a flaw in that? I'm I mistaking completely about those zero- knowledge system? If they can finally open the file, how some of them could escape justice by saying "We can not know that we are hosting illegal files?"
