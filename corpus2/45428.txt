I am at a crossroad - I've been working for whole 4 years as a support person fixing countless bugs, developing (minimal) changes and improvements to our software, working together with our clients and users. I started as a complete noob, without a good understanding of .NET, C#, SQL Server, etc. I had to work late nights and weekends just to catch up to my co- workers and to prove to myself that I am capable to do the work and do it good. I don't consider myself an expert in those fields, but I feel pretty comfortable working with them. I think I have had enough of it and I want changes - I want to move away from support and start working as a developer. Is there anyone who has gone this road before? Could you, please, share an advice or two?
