There has been a lot of discussion around the excellent question "Will high reputation in Stack Overflow help to get a good job?". I immediately agreed with **JoshK** that basically said "No" (I'll will explain why), but **Joel** chimed in with lot of convincing facts which made me upvote him as well. My question is **what other skills (other than being a technical genius) do you require from a developer?** To get the job, or to _keep_ it. I believe being a genius is far from being enough. I have met many technical geniuses in various companies I have worked for that impressed me a lot, but sadly in lot of cases, they were simply fired after a few months or put in ivory towers (mainly because of internal mutiny from other developers). I've seen many in personal distress as a result of this which I understand. That's why I'm a big fan of non-technical questions for technical positions. I like to know how the candidate will interact with others (including non- technical employees), how much consideration he will have for the business, if he will work for the desired outcome, and so on. I would like to know what you require from your developers and **WHY** it's important _(after all, you hire someone to write code, don't you? Why would you want him to be assertive?)_. **Ideally, I'd like you to come up with an example question you would ask during interviews** in support of your answer.
