I am new to the tablet market, but i am trying to learn more. Are any current tablets capable of running programming software such as Visual Studio? I understand they'd have to come up with some kind of streamlined version, but I can imagine the programmers out there excited about the possibility. Does anything like that already exist, or are there rumors of it being available in the near future?
