Is there some equivalence of MapIndexed for rules? Consider a substitution on               3 a + 4 b + 21 c + ....      The first integer I want to replace by 1, the second integer by 4, and the i'th integer by i^2.               1 a + 4 b + 9 c  + ....      How would you do that? I imagine some kind of indexed replacement would be useful. Addition:I would like to use it to replace expressions like `f[a]@f[b]@f[c]@...@f[X]` with `f[1]@f[2]@f[3]@...@f[n]`
