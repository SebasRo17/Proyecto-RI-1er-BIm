I'm trying to figure out why going to 64 bit processors is such a big deal in an iPhone. I understand that there will be twice as many registers so the processor can work with twice as much data which should increase performance. However I don't see many phones going to more than 4GB of memory any time soon. It seems like overkill and it would negatively impact battery life. Another problem that I see is that most variables now need twice as much memory. This will create problems in a mobile environment with small amounts of memory. I believe that the folks at Apple are intelligent and they probably have great reasons for doing this, I'm just trying to understand them. **EDIT** Don't know much about GPU's but I was told that with 64 bit registers 2 pixels can be loaded into each register and operations can be performed on them individually. Is there a graphical advantage regarding 64 bit?
