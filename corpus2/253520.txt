We usually have a lot of system software inside our PC's like Operating Systems (which contains different interrupt handlers etc.), Assemblers and Compilers, Drivers. My question is how do we store this information in the computer? Are these all softwares stored in machine instruction format inside the computer at specific locations inside the PC-ROM? Or they are stored as is in the high-level language (like C) in which they are written and then compiled every time the programs are called?
