I've been noticing the roles in a development team has been splitted each time more. I remember some time ago, there was a mix between backend and frontend developers. But since the restful APIs has become so popular the tendency seems to be in splits more. Currently in my case, we have a designer who makes the layout, html and css, a javascript developer who only treat with javascript, a Java backend guy and someone on the database side. I know often it depends on the company, there are still several companies which mix the roles. But there is a tendency. How do you see the future of frontend and backend developers? Bearing in mind mobile development, web development. How the frontend and backend will be divided? for who knows about these ones. Is not the technologies such as: JSF and TAGLIBs on Java and others similar in different languages going against the tendency?
