html, css and js can be used to build beautiful(and useful) ui's (specially with html5 and css3) and lots of people already know them. Though its still way beyond my reach, but how difficult can it be to bring the whole web app thing to desktop apps (we already develop apps on our local servers before hosting them). According to me, its a nice simple idea which will bring a boom in desktop apps, plus given that these apps will already be sharing so much code with web apps, they might be able to offer better connectivity. Why isn't it being done?
