If I've got code similar to this (although perhaps not as constrained as warning levels):               switch(item.StatusCode)     {         case StatusCode.SUCCESS:             CallSuccess(item);             break;         case StatusCode.WARNING:             CallWarning(item);             break;         case StatusCode.ERROR:             CallError(item);             break;     }      I often find myself converting it to something more like:               var behaviors = new Dictionary<StatusCode, Action<Item>>     {         {StatusCode.SUCCESS, (item) => CallSuccess(item)},         {StatusCode.WARNING, (item) => CallWarning(item)},         {StatusCode.ERROR,   (item) => CallError(item)},     }          behaviors[item.StatusCode](item);      I find that in a lot of cases this makes for more maintainable code. Is this a pattern, does it actually help like I think it does, and what's its name?
