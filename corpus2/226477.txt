I've been thinking of creating an online database creator (think DabbleDB, Zoho Creator, Intuit Quickbase, etc.). I've been thinking of a couple solutions:   1. Have 4 database tables: **Tables** , **Rows** , **Columns** , **Items**. To create a database as a user, you'd go to the "Add New Table" page, give a name and type to as many columns as you want, then save. Then you'd be taken to a page which displayed a list of rows that had items inside that corresponded with the columns. The problem with this approach is I can't figure out how to link the item with both the row and the column.   2. Create an actual database table for each user, and when they insert a new column ( or field), it would just a database INSERT. Cons: I think this would be slow and expensive (correct?), not to mention would make a feature like how DabbleDB did relationships between tables very hard to implement. So what is the best way to build this? Or is there a better way than even the two I've mentioned.
