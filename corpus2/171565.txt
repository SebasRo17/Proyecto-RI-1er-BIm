The section of an executable that contains code is sometimes called the `.text` section. In segmented memory architectures, a segment mapped as code is sometimes called a text segment. The unix error message “text file busy” (`ETXTBSY`) means “this file is a program that is being executed”. How did _text_ come to mean _executable (machine) code_? An ideal answer would: explain the connection between the word and its meaning; provide a citation for the origin or at least the history of the term; give some idea of which communities use it.
