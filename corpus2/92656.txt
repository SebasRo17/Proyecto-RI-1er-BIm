I am non computer science undergraduate and work as a web-developer(java, python, AS3 etc.) as a professional. I take 1 course per semester at my local university. I had taken Artificial Intelligence(comprising logic, context free grammar, CYK parsing, introductory NLP, markov chains, HMM etc.) last semester. I am planning to take an introductory course in compilers in the coming semster which covers the following syllabus: > Lexical Analysis, Syntax Analysis, Semantic Analysis, Run-Time Environment, > Intermediate Representations, Code Generation, Register Allocation, > Instruction Selection and Scheduling, Introduction to Local and Global Code > Optimizations, Data Flow analysis My question is that, are there any computer science subjects which I should know before taking this course? If yes, it would be great if you could please list those courses.
