so I've been working on developing an idea for an application that I think has the potential to be successful, however after some initial research I've discovered that at least part of my ideas are covered by a patent out there, the patent in particular is held by a really large company (I don't want to give away specifics for fear I'd draw their attention for sure). I'm debating a few options: 1) Develop patents around my ideas that don't conflict and maybe approach the company in question for a license exchange 2) Just approach them for a license outright 3) Just develop around it anyways and hope for the best :-p What have other people done in these situations? Are companies generally willing to grant patent licenses? Are they willing to grant them at reasonable prices? Thoughts?
