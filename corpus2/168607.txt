I have a nice open-source library in mind to write. It would take a few months to develop properly and I would need to stop supporting myself though other projects. Could anybody share experiences and best-known-methods to get some sort of financial support through the Internet whilst developing free, open- source code? Or, phrased more directly: which systems apart from "PayPal" are in use by programmers to get donations for open-source code? Provide a list. Optionally, sort the list as if it were a recommendation in descending order of positive experiences made with each system. Optionally, share a tidbit of your success story getting this kind of financial support. Optionally: give an indication as to how much money can be made that way? (I heard Vim's author could support himself just with donations at some point?)
