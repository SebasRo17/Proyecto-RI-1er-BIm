Why weren't the features present in modern IDEs for Java & C# (Intellij IDEA, Visual Studio, eclipse) developed in (earlier) IDEs for C language? I mean I don't know any IDE which has modern features (auto-complete, code navigation, refactoring, VCS integration etc.) that was developed especially for C. I know that eclipse has plug-in for C and Visual Studio can run an old version of C but they weren't designed for C but rather for Java/C# (or the other .NET languages). I also find it hard to believe that things like "pressing a key to go to a function or struct definition" or "commit to SVN from 2 key shortcuts rather than going in shell and writing a command" or "pressing a key for extracting a method or a variable" are useless and emacs or vim is enough. Not to mention code analysis, code coverage and probably most important specific library/framework support. These are all functions which greatly increases the productivity of a programmer. The only reason I thought of is that there aren't many large projects in C (hundreds of thousands LoC), but still, there are plenty of them; and also, most of the functionality is very useful for smaller projects also.
