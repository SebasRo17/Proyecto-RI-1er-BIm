Over the years I've used various naming conventions for services in my applications for example:               [ClassName]Service       [ClassName]Manager       [ClassName]Factory       [ClassName]Provider       [ClassName]Helper      I generally only use the "Helper" suffix for utility classes that have no external dependencies. However I find that there is a bit of a cross-over between the others, and wondered if there was any recommendations/standards/guidelines on what to use and when?
