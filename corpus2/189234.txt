My approach to programming is very deliberative. I spend a lot of time planning and designing before I code, even for the most basic tasks. I always try to make my code very simple, design everything very elegantly, and always to leave space for flexible changes later on. Some might say I think too much about what else could happen. I wonder, what industry and what tasks would be best suited to someone who works the way I do? Are there jobs out there that require high precision without a lot of schedule pressure, and if so, where should one look for them?
