[Warning]: I am new to the whole unit testing and have been trying to learn as much as possible. I am working on a MS CRM 2011 project and I have been trying to introduce unit testing in my company. For unit testing JavaScript web resources, I found this link at MSDN blog. The Solutions Architect in my company suggest that this is a bad approach as we are not even testing against the IE's JS engine but testing using CScript (Windows Host) and while I agree to that point, isn't the whole idea of Unit Testing all about testing the individual function's functionality and not about the dependency. For testing whether it will work within IE, would a testing tool such as Selenium not be better? Or am I missing something?
