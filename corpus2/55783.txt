I have a function that consists of four variables. Currently, I want to view it as function of one variable over the interval (0, 1) with the other three variables as parameters. I will plug values into those three parameters (and those values will not stay fixed). I want to see how the function changes with as the parameters vary. The function is very complicated, so I want to approximate it in a rational form. I have tried using the `MiniMaxApproximation`. However, it is only good for a single variable. Does _Mathematica_ offer any function that is suitable to my needs?
