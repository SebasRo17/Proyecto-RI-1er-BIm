I want to be a successful enterprise Java developer. With what algorithms and data structures should I be well versed? What books would you recommend to me? To be a successful Java developer, do I need to know all the advanced algorithms such as those given in CLRS? Can you suggest a list of the topics that I should learn in the descending order of their priority? Must I know:   * Searching?   * Sorting?    * Graphs/Trees? etc?
