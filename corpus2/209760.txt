This question has been bothering me for some time now and today I figured I would Google it. I've read some stuff about it and it seemed very similar to what I've always known as processor cache. Is there a difference between the two or am I right when I think they are the same? Is a register actually required to be inside a CPU for it to work? According to Wikipedia a register is a place in the CPU where memory can be quickly accessed and modified before being sent back to the RAM. Did I understand this wrong or are the cache and register actually the same?
