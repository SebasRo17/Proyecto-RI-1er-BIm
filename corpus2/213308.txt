Let's say we have a class that represents a Sudoku grid. In that grid we have a collection of _cells_. Now, if I simply made a collection of these cells accessible through the class the naming it would be pretty straight forward. I would use the plural:               Public List<CellClass> Cells      But what if I wanted to use a square array so that I can easily get a cell at a certain coordinate. Will it be:               Public CellClass[,] Cells      or               Public CellClass[,] Cell      Using a plural _sounds_ intuitive enough since it's a collection, but then you access it like this:               x = myBoard.Cells[2,3]      Which doesn't look nearly as nice (and grammatically correct) as:               x = myBoard.Cell[2,3]      So what do you think would be better? Plural or singular?
