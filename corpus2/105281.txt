I have completed a web application which is basically developed in PHP and is just another regular web application. Usually when I deliver the final production release I just handover the code documentation and the architecture information to the client. However, for this particular project the client insists on having the complete in and out data about the project. So I'm just wondering... What are the mandatory technical and non technical docs that I can give my client apart from the code and architecture documentations ? (Also it would be kinda cool to hit the client about various stats and data about the project so that he would actually know the amount of work involved and how cool the product actually is.)
