I just started working as a novice Web Developer. I know PHP pretty well, as well as some basic jQuery. Anyway, my boss told me I should explore and learn about MVC, Memcache, Design Patterns, how Apache servers work and how to set one up etc. What I want to ask is actually this: What should I learn further? Web Development is a big area and most odds are that I'll never stop learning, but what are the basics I should learn about? What are the fundamentals? Currently I'm focusing on Server Side Development, but a very big part of me also wants to become a front-end ninja, so please consider that in your comments. Thanks in advance, you rock. :)
