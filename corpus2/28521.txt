Suppose that I have a list called `list`. I would like to span an arbitrary function `f` across specified consecutive elements in `list`. Here is an example. Suppose the following:               list = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70};      I would like to obtain the following new lists:               {f[{10, 20, 30, 40}], 50, 60, 70}     {10, f[{20, 30, 40, 50}], 60, 70}     {10, 20, 30, 40, f[{50, 60, 70}]}      Is there a simple (perhaps even built-in) way to accomplish this in Mathematica 8? I have come up with the following function `spanMap`, but my method seems very complicated and clunky:               spanMap[function_, list_List, begin_Integer, end_Integer] :=       Module[{result},       If[begin == 1,        If[end == Length[list], result = list;];        If[begin < end < Length[list],          result =            Flatten[{function[list[[begin ;; end]]],              list[[(end + 1) ;;]]}];];        ];            If[begin > 1,        If[end == Length[list],          result =            Flatten[{list[[1 ;; (begin - 1)]],              function[list[[begin ;; end]]]}];];        If[begin < end < Length[list],          result =            Flatten[{list[[1 ;; (begin - 1)]],              function[list[[begin ;; end]]], list[[(end + 1) ;;]]}];];        ];            result       ]      where               spanMap[f, list, 1, 4]     spanMap[f, list, 2, 5]     spanMap[f, list, 5, 7]      yield the desired results:               {f[{10, 20, 30, 40}], 50, 60, 70}     {10, f[{20, 30, 40, 50}], 60, 70}     {10, 20, 30, 40, f[{50, 60, 70}]}      albeit in a complicated, clunky way.
