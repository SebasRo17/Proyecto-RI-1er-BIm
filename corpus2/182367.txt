I'm working on a project which runs as a process, on a regular basis. The results of the projects daily run are used by other projects. This brings me to question how our team writes stories. The normal format, `As a [role] I want [goal/desire] so that [reason`] does not seem to apply, but at the same time I'm doubting that. This is what we do now: _The system shall execute after process ABC has finished successfully._ Should we be using the other projects (that utilize the data from our process) as the _role_ portion of the stories? What we do now just seems too much like requirements..
