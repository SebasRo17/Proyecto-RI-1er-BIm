My manager told me that working overtime is just part of the job and that I'm expected to work overtime. We're not paid overtime like most companies. I'm aware that most programmers put in 50-60+ hour work weeks, but is that the attitude a manager should take? It seems like they're taking it for granted. Or maybe I'm totally wrong and it's completely normal :P
