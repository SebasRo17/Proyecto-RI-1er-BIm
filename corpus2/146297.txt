So I'm hiring for a senior developer/team lead role for an ASP.NET MVC3 project. This is a big deal position for our team as this person will lead one of our two main products--a product that hasn't seen much developer love in a while. So I need to ensure that my candidates do smart things with controllers, views, view models, DALs, unit tests, etc. I use some trivial programming challenges during interviews but I want to give the folks who have trouble in whiteboard coding a chance to shine. The best assignment I can think of: implementing a trivial log in page, is probably more than an hour of work and even if I cap it at 2 hours, it is unlikely to be 100% finished. Is this fair? I'm trying to strike a balance between keeping the assignment reasonable and giving the applicant a chance to show off the wide range of skills being a tech lead requires.
