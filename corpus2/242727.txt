I am working on geographical data which represents the road network of some city and I need to automatically fix inaccuracies in the data. Data was manually produced by “drawing” the road network over some actual map overlay with a geographical system like `qgis`. As a result, many road portions which connect in reality are not connected in the data, that is, endpoints of connected roads might be off by a few centimeters or sometimes a few meters. As a result, the road network is “wrongly” digitized as a graph or combinatorial object—that is, the simple algorithm assuming that roads are connected when they have a common endpoint is too optimistic and misses a lot of connections. How can I process and fix the geographic data to recover the correct combinatorial road network?
