Once again, I'm not certain this question fits this site but I can't think of a place online that fits it better. What do you think is a better starting point for an absolute beginner to programming: a statically typed, or a dynamically typed language? On one hand, it's easier and "more forgiving" for beginners to use a dynamic language. On the other hand, I feel starting with a static language will grant the beginner much better habits, forcing him/her to think more strictly about types, and which type goes where (as opposed to the duck-typed approach of "send here something that has a `do()`" method). My main concern is what's better _as a starting point_ : i.e. what kind of language would allow the beginner to gain better habits in the beginning and be able to later move on to other languages more easily.
