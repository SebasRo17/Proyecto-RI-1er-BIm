> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  How do I approach a coworker about his or her code quality? My development colleague is producing numerous blocks of code which I am a bit concerned doesn't really make for easy reading and potential issues in the future. I've tried giving little tips along the way without blantantly saying what I think but his technique never seems to change. I wouldn't normally be worried however we never identified any specific programming standards at the beginning of our project and it's now really starting to effect me a bit as I have to go through his code and try and debug it. A small snippet of just a small part of the code is as such.               foreach(DistributionRecord record in _manager.Distributions)     {         foreach (Engine.Model.DistributionModel.LossFromAtmosphericConditionsEnum NLossAt                         in Enum.GetValues(typeof(Engine.Model.DistributionModel.LossFromAtmosphericStructureEnum)))                         if (record.NlossAt.ContainsKey(NLossAt))                             if (record.NlossAt[NLossAt].ContainsKey(DistributionModel.LossFromAtmosphericConditionsEnum.Atvolat))                                 _indirect[GetIndirectSourceEnumFromEnterpriseType(record)] += record.NlossAt[NLossAt][DistributionModel.LossFromAtmosphericConditionsEnum.Atvolat]                                     * _manager.Scenario.Management.EmissionFactors.EmissionFactorIndirectBackgroundVolatisation;                          foreach (Engine.Model.DistributionModel.LossOffEnum lossOff in Enum.GetValues(typeof(Engine.Model.DistributionModel.LossOffEnum)))                         if (enterprise.NlossOff.ContainsKey(lossOff))                             if (enterprise.NlossOff[lossOff].ContainsKey(DistributionModel.LossTypesEnum.lossleach))                                 _indirect[GetIndirectSourceEnumFromEnterpriseType(record)] += record.NlossOff[lossOff][DistributionModel.LossTypesEnum.lossleach][NutrientEnum.N].Value                                     * _manager.Scenario.Management.EmissionFactors.EmissionFactorN2OIndirectBackgroundLeach;     }      I've talked to the boss and without blatantly saying it explained my concerns etc I don't know what else to do. Not sure if this is appropriate for this forum but any advice would be appreciated basically on how I can tackle this with my colleague. Or perhaps I'm just being unrealistic and gotta get with the real world in that this is just how some people write code and it's ok?
