I am relatively new to programming (1yr field experience now) and I think that I am overusing the singleton pattern and I need some input on how to do it in a better way. Right now I am using singletons as an excuse for static global data. I use singleton for Application Status, Application Settings and also a lot for "Managers". Basically they are all objects which are needed by different parts of my application. I think this pattern makes it easier then creating one object and inject it into all parts that need this. Any downsides to this approach? Any suggestion regarding this matter?
