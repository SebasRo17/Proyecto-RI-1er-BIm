I am creating an interface and would like the implementer(s) of this interface to throw exceptions in the case that something goes wrong. Let's call the implementer a plugin. I have a director which can call any one of the plugins. Rather than each plugin throwing it's own random exception, I would like plugins to throw specific exceptions which my director can then handle. For example: If the plugins fail to authenticate with the credentials that are provided by the director or if the requested action times out on the plugin, the plugin should throw an exception. Rather than each plugin throw it's own random exception, I would like plugins to throw specific exceptions that the director knows about and can handle. I do this because if an exception is fatal (like authentication failed) I don't want to retry, whereas if it was a timeout, the director may decide to retry. Now, I am confused as to which of the following ways is better: **Idea 1:** Create a custom exception (lets say `PluginException`) and have an enum type which different types of exception (such as `authenticationfailed`, `timeoutout`, `permissiondenied`, etc.) The director will catch all `PluginException`s and handle each exception case by case. **Idea 2:** Create an abstract exception (lets say `PluginException` again) and have specific exception types derive from my abstract exception (like `AuthenticationFailedException`, `TimeoutException`, etc.) The director can listen for any specific exception it is interested in and also listen for the broader `PluginException` if none of the above exception types match the exception thrown by the plugins.
