I am building my database/models/viewmodels right now and can't think of a good variable name to define for the equivalent of a "state" in other countries. I currently have `Country` and `City` which are pretty common.   I know Canada has `Province`s and France has `Department`s instead of states.   What are some ways you guys have abstracted user's locations? I thought about `FirstDegree`, `SecondDegree`, `ThirdDegree` but that is too vague. What are some common field names you have seen in the past?
