We have a legacy database full of stored procedures. These stored procedures are somewhat CRUD-categorized but upon inspection of some procedures, they are not "simple" as they might update, delete, whatever other records in other tables. So to my mind (correct me if I'm wrong) it would seem that using an ORM would be pretty difficult since   1. I can't access the tables directly: I must use a stored procedure   2. The stored procedures would not map to CRUD I'm leaning toward defining repositories to isolate the domain layer from the database but I fear that I would need to define a lot of infrastructure (caching, unit of work and the like) that I get for "free" in a ORM. Any insights?
