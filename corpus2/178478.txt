I want to embed an image using Data URI within HTML document so that we don't need image as a separate attachment, we get just one HTML file that contains the actual image. What are its advantages and disadvantages? Does IE10 supports it? Is it useful to have such an implementation? I am working on an application, where we have html documents that link towards images stored in some location. If I use tiny online editor, as images are saved somewhere in the server, while editing the document, i can provide a link towards that image, but can't preview the final document with images from within tiny editor. If I chose to download the file locally, then i will need to download the images from server side. It looks a bit overkill, so I thought if Data URI could be used in such a situation.
