I asked how to make resizable chessboard in here. nickjamesuk help me . Here is the code. I thought I can put queens on the board chess board easily after created resizable board, but it didn't work out. Now, I want to write whole problem here. For now, I don't need to solve the N-queens problem. I have some solution, and I want to represent that solutions of N-queens problem attractively. Here is an example: ![Board example](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tj735.png) Also, number of solution is different for each board size. Here is the source. I want to include all the solution for individual board sizes. End product should have two parameters. First one will resize the board from 1 to n. Second parameter will be used changing between different solutions for predefined board sizes. It seems very hard task for me. I will really appreciated everybody try to do it.
