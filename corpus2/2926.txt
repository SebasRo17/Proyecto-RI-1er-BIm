I have the following data set:               data = {{"Jakarta","Surabaya","Bandung"},{1,2,3}}      and I'd actually like to assign the numerical values to the categorical data so that Jakarta = 1, Surabaya = 2 and Bandung = 3. If I use `MapThread[Set, {ToExpression[data[[1]]], data[[2]]}]`it works fine but when I try to assign the variables individually I keep on getting error messages:               ToExpression[data[[1, 1]]] = data[[2, 1]]     Set::write: "Tag ToExpression in ToExpression[Jakarta] is Protected."      However, `ToExpression[data[[1,1]]` works fine May I know why my second approach is not working?
