I have made a simple application which searches for files and folders on users computer. Since, I am a student currently in my 1st year and don't have any formal training and have made my application while I was still learning C# and .Net framework, I didn't have knowledge about unit tests and other good testing methods used by professionals. Although, most of my code is working fine, sometimes it throws exceptions or some other unexpected situation occurs and the code breaks. Keeping the above experiences in mind, I don't think my application is ready for deployment and so , I would like to test my application in a professional way, and be assured that my application is bug free. Therefore, I want to ask professionals here, that keeping my situation in mind, how should I start testing my application.   What are the steps that I should follow, to ensure the quality of my application.
