Given _T={CTAGC, GAGCG, AGCGG, CGGAG}_ , using a greedy algorithm, the superstring _S_ will be _CTAGCGGAGCG_. From `S`, the combination of triplets will be given as _s = {CTA, TAG, **AGC** , **GCG** , CGG, GGA, GAG, **AGC** , **GCG** }_. Both _GCG_ and _AGC_ are repeated. If using _s_ to retrieve the superstring by using Hamiltonian method, would the repeated words will be used or omitted? If the repeated word is omitted, then _CTA_ , _TAG_ , _AGC_ , _GCG_ , _CGG_ , _GGA_ , and _GAG_ constructed back will become _GTAGCGGAGC_. So, in the end, both the greedy method and Hamiltonian method will provide different results in the superstring. Why are they different? In my research, all the examples I found showed that there are no repeated words in the combination, so if I reconstruct the superstring using the Hamiltonian method, the result of the greedy and Hamiltonian methods will be the same. But what about the repeated words?
