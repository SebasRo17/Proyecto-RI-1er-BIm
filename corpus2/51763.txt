I'm a C# developer by trade but have had exposure to many languages (including Java, C++, and multiple scripting languages) over the course of my education and career. Since I code in the MS world for work I am most familiar with their stack and so I was excited when Small Basic was announced. I immediately started teaching my oldest to program in it but felt that something was missing from the experience. Being able to look up every command with the IDE's intellisense seemed to take something from the experience. Sure, it was easy to grasp but I found myself thinking that a little more challenge might be in order. I'm looking for something better and I would like to hear your experiences with teaching your children to program in whatever language you have chosen to do so in. What did you like and dislike? How fast did they pick it up? Were they challenged? Frustrated? Thank you very much!
