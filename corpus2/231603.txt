I am working on an academic research project whose results and _some_ code we intend to publish. Research journals and conferences explicitly require that the authors have copyright over the work done in a paper. However, I would like to share the code with the community as it progresses using an open source license. Is there a license that explicitly retains copyright while allowing sharing, redistribution and derivative works based on the original work? Alternatively, which license would be suitable for such projects?
