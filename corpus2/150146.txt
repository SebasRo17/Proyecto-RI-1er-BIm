I have 2 apps. They both have accounts, and each account has users. These apps are going to share the same users and accounts and they will always be in sync. I want to be able to login automatically from one app to the other. So my solution is to generate a login_key, for example: `2sa7439e-a570-ac21-a2ao-z1qia9ca6g25` once a day. And provide a automated login link to the other app... for example if the user clicks on: `https://account_name.securityhole.io/login/2sa7439e-a570-ac21-a2ao-z1qia9ca6g25/user/123` They are logged in automatically, session created. So here we have 3 things that a intruder has to get right in order to gain access; account name, login key, and the user id. Bad idea? Or should I can down the path of making one app an oauth provider? Or is there a better way?
