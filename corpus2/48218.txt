I have a large `InterpolatingFunction` that I'm transforming to another basis with a few simple multiplications and additions by (symbolic) constants. The transformation is quick to compute. However, when I later want to replace the symbolic constants with real numbers for plotting purposes, a call to `ReplaceAll` grinds for an exceptionally long time on the expression. Why? Is there a way to avoid this without replacing in the transformation itself (an alternative I'd like to avoid for procedural reasons). I would provide code, but I don't know a short snippet that can generate a large interpolating function. Perhaps someone can provide a good example.
