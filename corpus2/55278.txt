I am trying to create a plot of a surface that is yellow above the xy-plane (z>0), but blue below (z<0). My first attempt was to use `ColorFunction->Function[{x,y,z},If[z>0,Hue[0.2],Hue[0.6]]`, but this only gave me a solid yellow paraboloid. I also tried defining a custom ColorFunction scheme with `cf=Piecewise[{{Yellow,0<#3<30},{Blue,-70<#3<0}}]&;` and `ColorFunction->cf` to the same result. Finally, I tried the following based on another thread (Discrete coloring in Plots):               ParametricPlot3D[{x,y,x^2+y^2-5},{y,-3,3},{x,-3,3},PlotStyle->Opacity[.8],ColorFunction->(If[#3>0,Yellow,Blue]&),Mesh->False,BoundaryStyle->{Black,Thickness[.01]}]      Every time, I end up with this: ![yellow paraboloid](http://i.stack.imgur.com/S5t0m.jpg) Any help you can offer would be greatly appreciated.
