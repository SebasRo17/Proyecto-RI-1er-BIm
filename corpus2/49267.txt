When it comes to labelling every single point on a `ListPlot` there might be some labels overlapping. Thus, I would like to manually position the labels with a `Line` linking them to their associated point. The following shows the idea:               coord={{0,0},{1,1}};     Manipulate[       Show[        Graphics[{Red,Line[{#2,1.02*#}]&@@@Thread[{pt,coord}]}],        ListPlot[{coord}],ImageSize->250],         {{pt,coord},Locator,Appearance->(#&/@{"a","b"})}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/omi8s.png) When it comes to more than one dataset I'm having an issue.               coord = {{0, 0}, {1, 1}};     coord1 = {{-1, 1}, {2, 0}};     Manipulate[       Show[         Graphics[{Red, Line[{#2, 1.02*#}] & @@@ Thread[{pt, coord}],                    Blue, Line[{#2, 1.02*#}] & @@@ Thread[{pt1, coord1}]}],          ListPlot[{coord, coord1}]],       {{pt, coord}, Locator, Appearance -> (# & /@ {"a", "b"})},       {{pt1, coord1}, Locator, Appearance -> (# & /@ {"c", "d"})}]
