We need to do some user documentation for a product we have been working on for the past few sprints. We are now starting a new project in the next sprint and the PO is making the documentation for the product produced previously a User story for this sprint. I am just wondering your opinion on this approach. Personally, I don't agree that documentation is a User Story within Scrum because it doesn't produce any code. EDIT: Thanks for your opinions guys. I had it in the back of my head that a sprint was to implement an increment of working software, but your views have changed my outlook. Thank you for all your answers.
