When there are three unknowns (`x`, `y`, `z`), _Mathematica_ can solve it:               Reduce[ Abs[x] + Abs[y] + Abs[z] == 1 && z != 0, {x, y, z},              Reals, Backsubstitution -> True]      for four variables (`x`, `y`, `z`, `t`), _Mathematica_ can't return a result in reasonable time:               Reduce[ Abs[x] + Abs[y] + Abs[z] + Abs[t] == 1 && t != 0, {x, y, z, t},              Reals, Backsubstitution -> True]      _Maple_ can solve this quickly: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GCcZk.png) Is it possible to solve this with _Mathematica_?
