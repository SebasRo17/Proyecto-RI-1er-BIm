In my project, I came across understanding that writing release notes is both helpful and necessary. However, it is not required by my management and I keep these files virtually to myself. You could say, I do it for self-organization. For each version of the internal prototyping software, I create a version number and update RELEASE file with the changes that have occurred since the last version. Release notes are classified into lists of new features, bug fixes and remaining limitations (features to be implemented in the next version). As my management does not require this document from me, I keep writing release notes in a free manner. Now, I am not sure how to best formulate (I hope not be sent to English@SE; I am interested not in grammar features, but in experience of other developers here who _do_ fill in release notes for customers) features that have been implemented. At the moment I use different grammar which is inconsistent between notes. I want to gather experience from other developers. Do you formulate release notes:   * starting with I/we (I/we have integrated/tested/updated some new feature), or   * as unpersonalized sentences (some new feature has been integrated/tested/updated), or   * as nouns: integration/test/update of some new feature, or   * other? At the moment, I mix all of these styles and by choosing one style, I want to be consistent with the industry standard.
