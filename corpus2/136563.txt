As I'm getting more organized, and getting more projects, I'm starting to wonder how to best manage time between them. Especially in regard to how I give estimates to the PHBs. So if the project is broken up into small tasks, say 2-3 hours each, then is it just as productive to work on one task per day as opposed to spending 6 hours a day and working through a good portion of 3 tasks. I realize that to a certain extent this depends on the project, but I also think that it might be better in general to work on components together so that things stay fresh in your mind. That said, it means pushing back other projects a week or two in order to devote 6 hours a day towards those tasks. Just trying to think this through, and thought I'd get some input.
