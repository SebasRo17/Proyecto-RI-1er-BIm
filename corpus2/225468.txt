This was a question proposed by a friend of mine. Define an algorithm that, given 40 unique integers in the range 1-1000, returns 41 unique integers in this range. Given these 41 integers, we must then be able to map them back to our original 40. Does anyone have any insights? I have an idea, but it definitely isn't eloquent. Thanks! EDIT: I think I may need to clarify with an example. One naive solution would be: find the largest number in the set of 40. Increment it by 1 and this is your 41st number. When converting back, just get rid of the largest number. This obviously fails when the largest number in the set is 1000.
