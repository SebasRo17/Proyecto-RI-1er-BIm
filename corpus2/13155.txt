The documentation shows the following example to "Remove a distributed definition..." ![Example](http://i.stack.imgur.com/MQWkv.png) Oh, course this doesn't work without redefining the function prior to re distributing the definition. The following does work:               ClearAll[f];     f[x_] := Labeled[Framed[x^2], $KernelID]     DistributeDefinitions[f];     ParallelMap[f, {1, 2, 3, 4}]      and will give the same output as the above screen clip. OK, but... This seems a very cumbersome way to do this and just doesn't seem right at all. It would seem clearer to me if one could call back the distribution of a function definition, something like `UnDistributeDefinitions[]`, to withdrawal the function from remote kernels rather than needing to clear the function in the main kernel, redefine it, then redistribute it. I came across this issue as I looked to move a DistributeDefinitions[] into a function that will run a bunch of other functions from a standalone cell in a notebook. To test whether it would work, I need to clear all the functions I wanted to distribute or restart the kernel. Just seems a messy way to do things. So, does a way exist to clear definitions in remote kernels without clearing them in the main kernel?
