I would like to draw a cross as an inset in a Graphics environment. I tried the following:               Graphics[{Inset[Style["\[Cross]", 100], {0, 0},{Center,Center}], Circle[]},           Frame -> True]      ![Inset of cross in circle](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vYuvb.png) Unfortunately, the `{Center,Center}` command for specifying the exact point of the cross that is drawn at the `{0,0}` position does not use the intercept of the two parts of the cross. Is there an easy way to produce a cross using graphics primitives rather than special characters? I have not done much with graphics yet and would really appreciate your help.
