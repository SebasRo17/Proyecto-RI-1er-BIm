I'm a fresh graduate in Electronic & Telecommunication field, and in our University, we can have major and minor fields in the relevant subjects. So, I majored in telecommunication and minored in Software Engineering. As I learned programming long before, Now I'm passionate about SE and programming. And, I want drive into the SE field. And, I come to know that, in industries, most of them expect the candidates to have a Bsc + experience of two+ years, or having a MSc in the related field. [I'm referring to my surrounding environment, not all the industries]. My Question is how do they consider those MSc and BSc + experience guys in the industries? IMO, having MSc is great assert when compared to experience. Because, in the industry, you can drive in a particular technology (Java, .Net or some thing else), not all, and with MSc, we can get the domain knowledge, not a particular technology!
