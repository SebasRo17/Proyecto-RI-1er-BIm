I want to plot the output response of a system with gain, first-order lag and time delay, where the transfer function is               tf = 2 Exp[-0.1 s]/(.1 + s)      To plot a time delay, we need to use an approximation, as _Mathematica_ 's `TransferFunctionModel` is restricted to rational transfer functions. We can use a PadÃ© approximation               pa = PadeApproximant[tf, {s, 0, 5}]      and then determine the output response and plot it using               model = TransferFunctionModel[pa, s]     output = OutputResponse[model, UnitStep[t], t];     Plot[output, {t, 0, 10}, PlotRange -> All]      My output response looks very weird: ![time delay plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/h9f6F.png) Can somebody please explain to me what I'm doing wrong?
