Is there a formal/academic connection between an imperative program and algebra, and if so where would I learn about it? The example I'm thinking of is:               if(C1) { A1(); A2(); }     if(C2) { A1(); A2(); }      Represented as a sum of terms:               (C1)(A1) + (C1)(A2) + (C2)(A1) + (C2)(A2) = (C1+C2)(A1+A2)       The idea being that manipulation could lead to programatic refactoring - "factoring" being the common concept in this example.
