Almost every programming tool has a command line version; many of which also have a gui version. It takes a lot of time and memorization effort to learn the different commands and various options/switches of the command line version. So I have a couple of questions (which are not necessarily mutually exclusive): 1) When would you bother learning/memorizing the commands in the command line version of a tool which also comes in a gui version ? 2) What tools should I learn the command line version of ? .... compilers ? version control system ? etc, etc
