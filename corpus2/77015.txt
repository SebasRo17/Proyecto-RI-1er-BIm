First of all, this is not a formal C++ question. I have been working with C++ for many years. Most of time, I improve my skill by working on different projects, reading good books, and learning from teammates. My posted questions are frequently answered by some experts here with quotes from the C++ Standard. I am really amazed how people can know the C++ Standard so well that they can immediately find the corresponding guidelines. Here is the question for those C++ experts: Do you guys really read the C++ Standard page by page or you are the persons who had reviewed the standard in the past?
