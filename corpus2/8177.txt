Is there a way to have Mathematica understand Big-Oh notation? For example, I want something like:               MinBigOh[...]      where               MinBigOh[2x+3, x^2] = 2x+3      or               MinBigOh[2x+3, x^2] = x      The idea here is that I want to be able to augment "Min" to understand Big-Oh comparisons. The purpose of this is so that I can write a bunch of expressions, and have Mathematica reason about the Big-Oh running time somewhat. Thanks!
