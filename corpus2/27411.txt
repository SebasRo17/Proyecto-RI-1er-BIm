I was trying to calculate this integral in _Mathematica 9_ :               2/π Integrate[ Cosh[a x] Cos[n x], {x, 0, π}, Assumptions -> n ∈ Integers]      I got as a result : $$\frac{2 (a \sinh (\pi a) \cos (\pi n)+n \cosh (\pi a) \sin (\pi n))}{\pi \left(a^2+n^2\right)}$$ That's the same result I obtained manually, but how can I force _Mathematica_ to change $\sin(n \pi)$ into $0$ and $\cos(n \pi)$ into $(-1)^n$ ?
