I'm trying to maximize two functions. For the first one, the code runs correctly and returns the desired answer               Maximize[{         ax (Log[a] - Log[ax + cy]) +          bx (Log[b] - Log[bx + dy]) +          cy (Log[c] - Log[ax + cy]) +          dy (Log[d] - Log[bx + dy]),         x >= 0, y >= 0, x + y == 1       },        {x, y}]      > >     {ax Log[a] + bx Log[b] + cy Log[c] - ax Log[ax + cy] - cy Log[ax + cy] + >           dy Log[d] - bx Log[bx + dy] - dy Log[bx + dy], >      {x -> 1/2, y -> 1/2}} >   But for the second one,               Maximize[{         (1/2) (x Log[x] + y Log[y] + u Log[u] + v Log[v]) -          (1/2) (x + u) Log[(1/2) (x + u)] -          (1/2) (y + v) Log[(1/2) (y + v)],          x >= 0, y >= 0, u >= 0, v >= 0,          x + y == 1, u + v == 1       },        {x, y, u, v}]      I just get the same thing I wrote as an input What I'm I doing wrong? How should I fix it?
