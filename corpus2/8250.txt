A quick method to format human-readable data tables with headers, is to use `Grid`, eg:               Grid@ColSel[        PACE["PRE"], {"VISIT_ID", "PHYSICIAN_ID", "PT_DROPOUT_Q",          "DUAL_MONITOR_Q", "VOICE_RECOG_Q", "COMPANION_Q",          "CAM_TRUNCATED_Q"}] /. {0 -> ""}       Which yields this table of which only the top portion is shown (note the horizontal spacing induced by the header) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/kxudE.jpg) It is desirable to segment the data by PHYSICIAN_ID, which can have _variable_ number of visits. Is there a convenient expression to map such a rule to positional information required by `Grid` and `Dividers`? A more verbose alternative is to space by first applying SplitBy #[2] (2nd column = PHYSICIAN_ID), then Grid, and finally Column:               Column[#, Automatic, 2] & @(Grid /@         SplitBy[ColSel[           PACE["PRE"], {"VISIT_ID", "PHYSICIAN_ID", "PT_DROPOUT_Q",             "DUAL_MONITOR_Q", "VOICE_RECOG_Q", "COMPANION_Q",             "CAM_TRUNCATED_Q"}] /. {0 -> ""},         #[[2]] &])      Which yields (again only showing data for the first 3 physicians): ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zoE39.jpg) Vertical spacing is visually less satisfactory than horizontal grid lines (which visually guide the eye). Also note the header has been split from the data so the vertical alignment is lost. So overall Grid and Dividers is preferable; What are the issues in developing a "GridBy" functionality analogous to SplitBy?
