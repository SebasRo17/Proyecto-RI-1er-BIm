I read a UML book a long time ago (15 or so years ago) by the inventors which said something like "software engineering should be like building a house". Meaning architects produce blue prints, and specialized workers utilize various views of them to produce their part of the end result. When I read it, it seemed reasonable, but from my perspective - I don't think much progress has been made to that end. It might be that the goal was wrong, or unrealistic - I'm not sure...
