I am going to have a lecture about C++ for experienced Java programmers. Because C++ is a big language and I have just one lecture, I want to point out the most important "gotchas" and C++ features when migrating from Java to C++. I myself went the opposite way (C++ -> Java) and therefore I would like to hear different opinions on this topic. What would you mention if you were me? The to-mention list I have so far:   * Use cases for C++ (when to use C++ instead of Java)   * Compiler stages (preprocessor, compiler, linker)   * Differences in data types (atomic data types, arrays, structs, classes, unions, enums), automatic conversion   * Pointers and memory management, difference between pointers and references, stack vs. heap allocations   * Interfaces and inheritance in C++ (multiple inheritance, virtual functions and the need of virtual keyword, pure virtual functions)   * Rewriting generics to templates   * STL (thanks PÃ©ter)   * Operator overloading   * Basics of macros EDIT: added suggestions from the answers
