In `Pyrocms` there are `Admin` views and `User` views. Im developing a complex module where my model file is getting to be rather large. Should I be abstracting logic in my model files to also be User models, and an admin models of my database. Currently I have a large Model file called `products_m.php` Should I split this up in 2 files   * products_admin_m.php    * products_user_m.php or should the admin inherit the user model (using PHP include). Where **products_admin_m** extends **products_user_m.**
