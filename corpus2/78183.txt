I have a proprietary project. It's a simple authentication library. I want to write open source(BSD) extension/examples for it. These examples interface code, connecting my authentication library to a database containing users. I'm providing examples which people hardly ever use out of the box, but are excellent starting points for tying it into their own database. I want to be able to release these extensions separately from the library. What is the best way of to this? My idea is to use a free github project and put the extensions there as well as the demo version of my authentication library(ie, just the assembly). How would I manage different versions of the authentication library though? At the moment, I use SVN for managing the source code of the authentication library, though I like git as well, so would switch if that'd be better. Does anyone know of a good way of managing this kind of thing?
