> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  most desirable skills for a graduate software engineer I'm currently doing my PhD in physics and will be finished in about two years from now. I plan to become a software engineer afterwards. I'm now looking for advice on which skills I should improve during this time in order to reach my goal. My background: For my research I need to write my own programs. I've been programming every now and then since I was a child but only in the last 2.5 years I've actually spent a lot of time coding. I've got around 2 years of experience in C++ now and consider myself being good at it. Recently, I started learning Python. I didn't attend any university courses on algorithms, data structures or databases, so maybe I'm lacking some basic knowledge here. I thought about reading books on the following topics:   * General books like Code Complete or The Pragmatic Programmer.   * Test-driven programming and agile development methods (though I'm not sure how widely they are used in companies)   * Databases   * Algorithms and data structures I also thought about learning Java... What would you consider useful in my situation? Which skills are important for a company?
