How do I include the copyright/license for a library if I use on 1 function? Say if I have a class that I have taking 1 function from another library:               class MyClass {         ...         public function someOtherLibrariesFunction() {}     }      And the at the top of the file I took the function from it says:               /*      * This file is part of the Other Library package.      *      * (c) James Smith <j.smith@gmail.com>      *      * For the full copyright and license information, please view the LICENSE      * file that was distributed with this source code.      */      And the LICENSE file:               Copyright (c) 2004-2013 James Smith          Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy     of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal     in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights     to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell     copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished     to do so, subject to the following conditions:          The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all     copies or substantial portions of the Software.          ...standard as is warranty...      So my understanding is I would have to have a copy of the LICENSE file included with my code, and I would also somehow point out the exact function it it applies to?
