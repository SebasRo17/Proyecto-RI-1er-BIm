While developing a FAT32 driver for my bootloader, I thought to make it complete by adding the long file name support.   While watching around for some specification, and I also found articles about Microsoft suing for infringement of their patents on something that basically is a workaround.   Knowing about this events made me think: is it fair to patent things _that are_ workarounds?
