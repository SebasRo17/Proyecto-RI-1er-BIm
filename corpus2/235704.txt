I have some questions regarding creative common.I'm reading the documentation at http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/, yet I'm still confused about these licenses. Suppose there is a company which released a database or ontology about cars on creative common, say based on this license. Suppose I use this database to create a REST API and a mobile application which uses this database or ontology. My questions are:   1. Should I release all my source codes, i.e. the REST API source codes and the mobile application source codes   2. Can I limit API calls to the web service From what I've read, I've only understand that I should publish all mods I made to the current work I took on the license
