I have a full version of _Mathematica Home Edition 9_ installed on a high end desktop. I'm trying to learn how to use it and keep coming up with an error message that I cannot figure out. I want to plot a `3D` graph in cylindrical coordinates. I thoroughly know calculus `3`, so the math isn't the problem. The problem is figuring out what I'm doing wrong in _Mathematica_. I searched many websites and found that I need to load a graphics package called `ParametricPlot3D` in order to get the graphics routines necessary. I copy and pasted the exact commands, and I still get the error message. Below is an exact copy & paste of what I typed and what error I got from _Mathematica_. Can anyone please guide me to correct this?               Needs["Graphics`ParametricPlot3D`"]          CylindricalPlot3D[ 9 - r^2, {r, 0, 3}, {theta, 0, 2*Pi}]      > >     Get::noopen: Cannot open Graphics`ParametricPlot3D. >   >     Needs::nocont: "Context \!\(\"Graphics`ParametricPlot3D`\"\) was not > created when >     Needs was evaluated. " >   I have also tried a different way to load the graphics routines, and here's the message I'm getting:               << Graphics``ParametricPlot3D`          CylindricalPlot3D[ 9 - r^2, {r, 0, 3}, {theta, 0, 2*Pi}]      > >     Get::noopen: "Cannot open \!\(\"Graphics`ParametricPlot3D`\"\). " >   I realize that the `character was missing from the ends of the`Graphics` statement, but this text editor won't let me put one at the end and keep that same character at the beginning. Trust me, it is there. I suspect it might be some sort of setting I have to enable, or maybe a directory path that is incorrect, or even I need to download graphics routines. If someone can point me in the right direction, I'd be truly grateful.
