In one of Leonid Shifrin's excellent summaries, he mentioned that MMA capabilities include developing Domain Specific Languages (DSL). I'd like to develop a Health care IT application that can   * interpret users' natural-language   * perform automatic markup to tag, link and journal clinical documentation and    * communicate orders and queries to web services such as terminology servers and computational knowledge engines (CKE). In Mathematica 8, the `=` operator enables communication with Wolfram|Alpha, indicating that the front end can be programmed to host this type of user interaction. I understand this is very vague and underspecified, but am curious where to start in investigating the capabilities of MMA in developing DSLs.
