I have written a library that is quite extensive and has taken up a lot of my time, so I would like to license it properly. The LGPL seems to have many of the things I want, but does not work with Javascript or other interpreted languages. Here are the things I want my license to say:   * My library can be used in commercial application (either web or desktop applications).   * My library can be used in open source applications (again, any platform is fine).   * You may not redistribute my unmodified library in any form, except for when the javascript is downloaded to the client's browser.   * I would like to remain as the copyright owner.   * If possible, I would like users of my library to be able to use other libraries under any license (though this is less important). I am fine with distributing source of my library, and I'll have to since it's JS, the thing I don't want is others distributing my unmodified library and saying it is purely their work. I am ok with people modifying and redistributing the library, though I would rather they submitted their work to me and I would give them credit. If they do modify and redistribute the library, they must give me partial credit. I have also thought about using the MIT license, but it clearly states that people could redistribute my library unmodified, which is the most important thing to me, to make that impossible. I sincerely apologize if an identical question has been asked on this network, I have done several days' research and have not found one (this is the closest I've gotten, but the answer didn't help me). Also, IANAL so if any of this is legally contradictory or impossible, please explain rather than just stating that it is impossible.
