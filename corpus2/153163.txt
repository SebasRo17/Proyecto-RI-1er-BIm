I am just messing around, trying to figure out how stuff works and right now I have a couple questions about HTML, JS and CSS engines. I know there are two major JavaScript engines out there - V8 and JavaScriptCore (WebKit's JS engine as far as I know). Is that correct? And what are the main HTML + CSS renderers out there? Let's say I want to build a web browser using V8 (I saw it has some documentation and stuff + I like the way it works), what are the best options for me? Partially another question. Is there any bare browser that uses V8 and runs on Ubuntu at least? P.S. I am a Ubuntu user and prefer C++.
