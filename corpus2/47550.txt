DSolve[{2 y[x] y''[x] == y'[x]^2 + y[x]^2, y[0] == 1, y'[0] == -1}, y[x], x]          DSolve::"bvnul" For some branches of the general solution, the given      boundary conditions lead to an empty solution "      It is no solution.But we can check that E^-x is a solution.               2 E^-x D[E^-x, {x, 2}] == D[E^-x, x]^2 + (E^-x)^2     ("True")      But if we write code like this,it has a solution.               sol = DSolve[{2 y[x] y''[x] == y'[x]^2 + y[x]^2, y[0] == a, y'[0] == b}, y[x], x]     sol /. {a -> 1, b -> -1}      1.Whats the mean of "For some branches of the general solution"? 2.How to explain this phenomenon?
