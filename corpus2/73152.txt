I was talking with a friend about developing a mobile app (android/iphone) but I've never messed around with mobile app development code before. My friend flippantly told me that I don't _"need to know mobile app code..."_ because _"there are converters out there that convert your code to mobile app code."_ My question is two-fold:   1. Is this true? Where can I find these fabled converters and are they any good?    2. I'm pretty handy with PHP/Javascript/Java (in order of skill level). Which mobile application language would be a good starting place? Or... which of my following code languages "convert the best" to mobile app language?
