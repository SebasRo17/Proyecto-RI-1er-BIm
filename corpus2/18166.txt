We are a team of two people who need a versioning system for their university project. Due to administration issues, the graders need us to register on a site that happens to only support SVN; however, we cannot commit to SVN from inside the university as the required protocols are filtered out by the proxy (including the HTML extensions that would make SVN checkins over HTTP possible). Sigh. Is it possible to have a hg repo for ourselves that can then be converted to SVN for purposes of hosting on this site? * * * **Please note that practically all students commute to university,** so the "we can't commit from university so we can't do this" is not as strong of an argument as you'd think.
