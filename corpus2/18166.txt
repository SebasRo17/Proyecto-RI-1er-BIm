My wolfram user portal claims that I have 2 controlling processes and 8 computing processes. ![Processes](http://i.stack.imgur.com/eltXw.png) Mousing over the question mark gives me some information, but I still don't fully understand what this means.   * Does 2 Controlling Processes mean I can install Mathematica on 2 different computers?   * If not, what are they and how do I make use of them?   * Are Computing Processes like the number of cores I can use simultaneously? (Does Mathematica even support multicore?)   * If so, how can I make use of this?
