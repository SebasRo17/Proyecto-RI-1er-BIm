I joined a company a few months ago as a Java developer. I like doing coding and it makes me happy. After my Java training I was put into services/support project. There is no coding in this team. When I ask my manager to move me into development project or roll me off from this project he questioned my "Why do you want to do coding?" This is the point where I am speechless to objectify why I want to do coding. How can I convince him to move me to development project? I want to keep gaining knowledge in Java and experience in development.
