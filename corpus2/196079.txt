I'm curious if there are any commonly used large enterprise frameworks for PHP that would be your whole or most of your environment if you were working in PHP. Something comparable to ASP.NET's WebForms or MVC in that when you're working in either one, most of your code and system is based off of working integratively within that framework. Edit: Specifically I'm looking for a framework that fit's the bill of basically being what you would use for 99% of your work in writing your website, this means:   * data retrieval, some kind of ORM in the framework   * data representation, some kind of data aware automatically configured UI controls that make reading and writing to a DB easy   * data caching   * data serialization   * data communication, an easy way to generate and host web services of various sorts
