I'm going to include MongoDb(AGPLv3) in my product. My product is SaaS, I don't install this to client directly. My software is ASP.NET MVC website. But MongoDb's drivers for .Net is under Apache My questions are: 1) Should I license my software under AGPLv3 license if I use Mongo? I use them across drivers which written on Apache, but somewhere I've heard that if use GPL component in your software you must license whole your product under GPL 2) If I license my website under AGPLv3 should I provide code for all customers? Thank you for answers?
