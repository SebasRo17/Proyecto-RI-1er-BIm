I'm starting to think that a lot of my tables could be replaced by only a graph db: For example: I have 4 tables: accounts, votes, posts, relationships but I can represent all these in a graph table with different edges,               NODE1 -> type of relation -> NODE2     account -> vote_+1 -> post     account -> wrote -> post     account -> friend -> account2      is there a difference of performance or other between them?
