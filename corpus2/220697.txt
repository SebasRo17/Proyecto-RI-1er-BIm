I am doing a Windows C# application. I asked this question and I was told that the viewer/presenter should never know anything about the model. Does this mean that I should not add a reference of my model to the GUI I am making and instead of, lets say `List<Car>` I should transport the information using only strings and ints e.g. `Dictionary<carID, carName>`? Because of the fact I am using EntityFramework, half of my domain model are basically in the `DAL` and rest are in the `BLL` and then I would need to add reference to both those layers. Is this the approach or am I doing it wrong?
