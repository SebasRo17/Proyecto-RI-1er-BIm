Right now I have a blank list that I am putting in Manipulate[]. I want to be able to choose whether 1,2, or 3 are in this list by setting z1,z2, z3 as True or False:                z1 = True;      z2 = True;      z3 = False;      list = {};      For[i = 1, i <= 3, i++,        If[ToExpression["z" <> ToString@i], list = Insert[list, i, 1]]]      list      The problem comes when I put this code into Manipulate[], where I have a button called "Update list" that essentially does the process above:                Manipulate[{list, {z1, z2, z3}},        Row[{Control[{z1, {True, False}}], Control[{z2, {True, False}}],          Control[{z3, {True, False}}]}],        Button["Update list",list = {};        For[i = 1, i <= 3, i++,       If[ToExpression["z" <> ToString@i],        list = Insert[list, i, 1]]]]]      But as you shall see, the button does nothing. I want: if box "z1" is checked, 1 is added to the list. if box "z2" is checked, 2 is added to the list. ... if box "zi" is checked, i is added to the list. How do you do this?
