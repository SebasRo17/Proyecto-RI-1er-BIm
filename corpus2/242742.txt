Xamarin 3 was released last week with a great new addition: Xamarin.Forms . This triggered our attention because we've been using such a system for a couple of years now. We've developed it by ourselves and used it for a bunch of projects. We've been looking for a way to make this project open source but we didn't manage to convince the management. They believe we should not make it open source because we won't win anything with it and all that will happen is that the competition will be able to build apps quicker with our library. We believe open sourcing our library will make the world a better place and that it will make our library much more stable and complete. So my question to all you people out there: How can we convince the management to open source our library?
