Ruby by default does not include the method `[]` for `NilClass` For example, to check if `foo["bar"]` exists when `foo` may be nil, I have to do:               foo = something_that_may_or_may_not_return_nil     if foo && foo["bar"]       # do something with foo["bar"] here     end      If I define this method:               class NilClass       def [](arg)         nil       end     end      Something like that would make this possible, even if `foo` is nil:               if foo["bar"]       # do something with foo["bar"]     end      Or even:               if foo["bar"]["baz"]       # do something with foo["bar"]["baz"] here     end      **Question:** Is this a good idea or is there some reason ruby doesn't include this functionality by default?
