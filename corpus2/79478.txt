I want to start web development, I have been learning php.   I have experience in Java, Python, and C++   This experience has made me good at the back end side of web development.   But I am terrible at design and graphics.   I want to start website.   What do you guys suggest I do?   If your suggestion is to get better at graphics, what would be a good way?   I also want to know what you guys use for design and graphics, and what would be a good learning spot for it?
