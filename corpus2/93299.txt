I did an IKM Java test recently and got quite a low score. I only graduated a year ago and I dont have commercial experience in Java (i do web development in my current job). I thought reading up a lot on Java would help me prepare, but when I sat the IKM test i got ripped to pieces. I didn't know much about how the garbage collection actually works, names of other java compilers (i know about javac?), using .dll with Java etc etc. I know a wide range of the basics, but to the extent wether 'int(5L)' produces an integer or not, I really didnt know. My question is that many of the IKM questions I have never come across, yet I have read many of the wider-known Java programming books (Deitel, O'Reilly etc). Am i reading the wrong books??? Could anyone recommend a good plan of action to allow me to go away and self- study and be able to know these really tough java questions?
