I am plotting a dataset on ListPointPlot3D, and in order to give an idea of density of points I used opacity of 0.5. The problem is that that while the opacity of points behind one another is added, when multiple points overlap the opacity is not added; I need a way for the opacity of overlapping points to be added. A minimal example:               ListPointPlot3D[{{1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 1}, {1, 2, 1}, {1, 2, 2}}, PlotStyle -> Directive[PointSize[0.1], Opacity[0.5]], ViewPoint -> {0, 0, Infinity}]       ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Cl1vt.png) The first two points overlap completely (thus their opacity does not add), the latter two points overlap in x and y but differ in z (thus their opacity adds). I want to get the opacity of the first two points to add as well.
