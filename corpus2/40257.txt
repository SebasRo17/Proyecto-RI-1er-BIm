We're looking at internationalisation for our application and are looking for any good resources please can recommend to help us out. Books, blog posts, articles, you name it, I'd be interested. The application is Java / SQL Server / Oracle with both web (HTML / JavaScript) and Java forms user interfaces. Internals include XML / XSL-T. Anything from high level "these are things to think about" pieces to detailed assessments of character sets, sort orders and date formats would be appreciated.
