The CSV file linked below has 3 columns: "PT_ID" (char 4), "PHYS_ID" (char 2) and "VISIT_START_TIME" (varchar eg "0:00:15" hours minutes seconds) "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AqPfEWYQJhXSdGF4ck5pblVlaHB0bkE0MWhsOWZ6M2c&output=csv"               Import["https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=\     0AqPfEWYQJhXSdGF4ck5pblVlaHB0bkE0MWhsOWZ6M2c&output=csv",       "DateStringFormat" -> {"Hour", ":", "Minute", ":", "Second"},       "Numeric" -> False]      Setting `"Numeric" -> False` will result in this output, so the hh:mm:ss is not matched {Q001,01,0:12:15} While setting `"Numeric" -> True` results in the following 2 seemingly unrelated problems: {Q001,1,{2014,1,1}}   1. "PHYS_ID" is cast to `Integer`   2. the 3-element List contains Year, Month, Day rather than Hours, Minute, Second Are there obvious solutions to both 1 and 2? http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/format/CSV.html isn't very usable. EDIT (based on answers/comments): If it is known a priori which elements (columns) should be handled (here column 3, rows >=2), then using "Numeric"->False but not using DateStringFormat, the data can be post-processed using: MapAt[DateList[#][[4 ;;]] &, tmp, {2 ;;, 3}] But the ideal is to have Import deal with it given the documented options in CSV. DateStringFormat almost works. Used along with "Numeric"->True, it incorrectly returns the first 3 elements of DateList@"0:12:15" --> {2014, 1, 1, 0, 12, 15.} rather than the entire list. But if DateStringFormat is not used (and with "Numeric" -> True), then "0:12:15" is imported as-is (String).
