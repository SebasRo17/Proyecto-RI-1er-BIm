This may be a noob question but a colleague and I are working on a project. Some background about our situation is:   * We control versions using a centralized git server inside our office.   * We code in PHP, so we try our code offline in a local apache instance.   * We use local MySQL instances at work. Our client is a bit of a demanding person, and has changed the requirements more than twice. The main problem is that if we need to change something in the database, we have to make clean dumps on other servers (the other teammate's computer, the central server..., and the client's server of course) to make other instances work, too. **My question is, is there a way to synchronize our local databases** (I don't care about the client's one at this moment) **with git or another utility to make my colleague, the git server and my database be up to date when we push changes?** If that is not possible, do you know of any better way to work with MySQL databases stored locally? Thanks in advance. PS: Using only one central database is not a valid solution for us, as we test different features and have different elements stored there.
