I'm developing a simple website for a client. I have read about **phpDocumentor** and **DocBlocks** , and I thought that documenting my classes and functions will be very useful. I'm almost sure I will **not** generate any documentation for the site, since it's a pretty simple website, and guess what? It doesn't have an API... But is it still recommended to write DocBlocks in my code? From what I know many programmers even don't write simple comments, but DocBlocks.   I'm not going to generate any readable documentation by the client/ next programmer but I still think that making some comments that are more than just simple text will be better. _edit -_ If you think that DocBlocks are redundant in my case, are there any other "standards" for writing comments / documentation?   The last time everything that doesn't have a standard makes me feel stupid, that I'm not sure if it's better to write `if(){` or `if () {`, `/* */` or `//`, etc. I'm new to the documentor and DockBlocks, and I'm still not sure if I have to write this question here or in StackOverflow. Thank you very much anyway!
