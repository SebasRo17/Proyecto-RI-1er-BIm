`GeneralMiniMaxApproximation` is used to construct minimax approximations of parametrically defined functions. I am curious about how `GeneralMiniMaxApproximation` is implemented (just a general overview). Any ideas? Or is this a _Mathematica_ trade secret?! The document states that `MiniMaxApproximation` uses Remez's second algorithm, but does this algorithm extend to parametrically defined functions? I can't seem to locate any references.
