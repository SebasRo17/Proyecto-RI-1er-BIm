Recently I am doing my math homework and there is a question asking me to Come up with a dataset X that has at least 10 distinct numbers in it such that Expect[X] = 3.7, and Var[X] = 2.1. Actually I did not know how to use Mathematica before, so I really have no idea how to generate. I read many sources and wrote a code `X=RandomVariate[NormalDistribution [3.7, Sqrt [2.1]], 10]` Unfortunately it does not work...Can anyone tell me what's wrong? Thanks a lot!
