I'd like to connect _Mathematica_ with my Italian electronic trading platform. To connect I need to open a TCP socket client towards the trading platform and send a string command. The high-level description (pseudo code) is like this:               - create new tcp socket on hostname="localhost and port ="5333"     - create out channel     - create input channel          - send request in string format         "function=subscribe|item=<stockCode>|schema=ask1;bid1;last_price"          - read response: if response is like outcom=OK then wait the push update          - read push update            - close socket      But how I can do this with _Mathematica_? Using JLink I should write something like this:               socket = new Socket(TCP_address, TCP_port);     out = new PrintWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(socket.getOutputStream(),     "UTF-8"));     in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream(),     "UTF-8"));     //send request to T3 .     out.println(messagge);     //Wait response      String response = in.readLine();     //[...]     //If response is outcome=OK wait push data     while(true){     String update = in.readLine();     //Thread to manage push data     }     } catch (UnknownHostException e) {     //[...]     } catch (IOException e) {     //[...]     }     //[...]      But I'd like to know if is possible to avoid java and .net !
