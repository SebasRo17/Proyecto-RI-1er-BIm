Or, in other words, has memory and processing power increased over time around basically in the same rate, or we could say that one or the other has increased more? Has cost decreased in the same rate? And how about the near future? I am aware this question is not _directly_ related to programming, but I thought it would be better to ask it here for some reasons:   1. I work as a programmer, not a computer science theorist (so I probably would not find very helpful the kind of question I would receive from the Theoretical Computer Science site, for instance).   2. I prefer answers based upon a programmers real experience.   3. And I am worried about real programming-related issues, specially the functional x imperative debate. About the 3rd item: currently we've being seeing a lot of arguments about how the increase of using functional programming techniques is related to the now common multi-core machines, and how the free lunch is over [pdf]. But it seems to me that the functional paradigm is much more memory consuming (but this is an opinion, not a fact), and I have not seem many arguments about this future increase in memory needs. PS: Sorry about the not very good English, but I guess I have made myself clear (sort of).
