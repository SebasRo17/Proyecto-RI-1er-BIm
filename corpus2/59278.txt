My googling efforts returned nothing so I thought I'd ask here. I often make a ListPlot[] with a huge array, and sometimes it has smaller features that I'd like to take a closer look at, but aren't very visible zoomed all the way out. Obviously I can just change the parameter PlotRange, but that's kind of cumbersome. Ideally, I'd like to be able to select a box around the part I want to zoom in on, and even more ideally maybe use my mousewheel to zoom in on where the cursor is, and be able to "grab" the plot to shift around where I'm looking at, when I'm zoomed in. Most programs that plot things have this functionality, so I'm guessing MM must too. It seems like I might be able to do something similar using Manipulate cleverly (like, at least make sliders to control the zoom and center), but I don't see how to do it easily. Is there any way?
