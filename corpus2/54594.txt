I think an important purpose of the new `Testing Notebook` in version 10 should be to test user packages (instead to test the builtin functions in the `System` context). However, what's the proper way to load a package into the testing notebook? I didn't find an example in documentation. What I have tried is to simply load it as an input. But it doesn't seem to work. For example, I have a file test.m in the system directory, with               BeginPackage["test`"]     testFunc     EndPackage[]      Then I start Mathematica, open `File->New->Testing Notebook`, and input the following as separate input cells:               << test.m (* also tried Needs["test`"] without difference *)      and               testFunc      If I evaluate each cell by hand, there is no problem. But if I quit the kernel (to start over) and then hit the `run` button, I sometimes got `testFunc::shdw` message. By sometimes I mean I did a few tests, each time quit the kernel and start over, and the result is either as left or right of the attached figure ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/lTalR.png) I got really confused here. Also, in the expected output of the right panel, the context becomes explicit. This is quite annoying for a long expression with a long context. I was wondering if it is normal.
