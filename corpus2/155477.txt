I have a bunch of functions that are used across multiple ASPX files. I want to condense these down to one file to be used for all the ASPX files. I have a few ideas but I want to know what the accepted method to doing this would be. I have an idea to just create a class to put them in. However, I was wondering if i could put them in a ascx page, but that does not look like the solution I'm looking for. Is there a accepted method for this type of situation?
