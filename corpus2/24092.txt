This is similar to the closed topic: Frame ticks for a Log Log plot [closed]. Let me reuse (rm -rf)'s example here. FrameTicks given through Show does not appear if used with LogLogPlot:               Show[       LogLogPlot[x^2 + x^3, {x, 1, 100}, Frame -> True],       FrameTicks -> {{All, None}, {{10, 30, 75}, None}}     ]      This works though:               Show[       LogLogPlot[x^2 + x^3, {x, 1, 100}, Frame -> True],       FrameTicks -> {{All, None}, {{N@Log@#, #}& /@ {10, 30, 75}, None}}     ]      Is this a bug or an expected behaviour?
