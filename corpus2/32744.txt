I get intrigued about `Gather` behavior on this post. I thought that `Gather` was invariant under list order? Here is the result I spect:               l1={{1, 1}, {0, 0}, {2, 2}, {5, 5}, {4, 4}, {6, 6}}     Gather[l1,ManhattanDistance[#1, #2] <= 2 &]      > {{{1,1},{0,0},{2,2}},{{5,5},{4,4},{6,6}}} When the list order is changed, I get this:               l2={{0, 0}, {1, 1}, {2, 2}, {4, 4}, {5, 5}, {6, 6}}     Gather[l2,ManhattanDistance[#1,#2]<= 2&]      > {{{0,0},{1,1}},{{2,2}},{{4,4},{5,5}},{{6,6}}} Someone know why?
