I had an interview and interviewer told me to improve on the concepts. E.G.:   * He asked me types of arrays are there and I answered that there was two types of array: A simple array and an associative array.   * He also asked me why we use PDO and I answered we can use any database, E.G. Oracle and MySQL and it helps with SQL injection. He then asked me how it helps with SQL injection and I was told I didn't give the correct answer.   * He asked me about persistent connections and told him I just used `mysql_pconnect`. I don't know where it will be used and how. Is there is any standard way I can follow to help me improve upon these concepts?
