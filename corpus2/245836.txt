In learning Python, I found that when two "names" (or "variables") are assigned to the same value, both of them point to the same memory address. For example               >>> a = 10     >>> b = 10     >>> a is b     True      My question is, when assigning `b`, how does Python figure out that a `10` object already exists? One way might be to create the new object for `b`, scan pre-existing objects in memory to find a duplicate and, if found, point `b` to it. This sounds expensive, and tricky for more complex objects.
