I'm investigating how many iterations are needed for a particular orbit to reach a fixed point of a function. Since I have many functions to test, I want to define a function in Mathematica that will take as its input   1. the function I want to test   2. the seed or starting point of the iteration   3. total number of iterations to carry out. Since the orbit never actually reached the fixed point, I am considering any point that comes within a millionth of the actual fixed point to have reached the fixed point. I have defined the following function               iterationsteps[function_, seed_, steps_] := Length[      Select[FixedPointList[function, seed, steps] - FixedPoint[function, seed], # >= 1*10^(-6)]]      But whenever I try to run it on some test values, it just ends up running for ages and never returns anything. I'd be extremely grateful is someone can point me in the right direction. Thank you! \Edit: Some troubleshooting and the helpful answers below revealed that the problem was caused by FixedPoint.               iterationsteps[function_, seed_, steps_] :=      Length[Select[     FixedPointList[function, seed, steps] -      FixedPoint[function, seed,      SameTest -> (Abs[#1 - #2] < 1*^-6 &)], # >= 1*10^(-6) &]]
