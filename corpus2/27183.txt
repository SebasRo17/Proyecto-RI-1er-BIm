I am using _Mathematica_ at work remotely from a computer in my building and I can edit notebooks by opening them from terminal via ssh without problem (a little slow if there is a figure with many points, but that's all). Now I need to work from home, but editing a notebook that I open from terminal is just impossible because it is too slow and freezes each time I click on it. I am still using ssh on Ubuntu 12.04. Any idea how I can make it faster?
