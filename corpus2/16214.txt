The function I would like to plot is defined as $\sum\limits_{p\leq x}\log p.$ The following gives me I think a plot of the points of interest, but the function is defined for all $x > 0$ and so it's basically a step function between primes. Is there a way to augment the following to include the "steps?"               a8 = Table[Sum[Log[Prime[i]], {i, 1, j}], {j, 1, 10}];          a7 = Table[Prime[i], {i, 1, 10}];          a9 = Table[{a7[[i]], a8[[i]]}, {i, 1, 10}];          ListPlot[a9]      Thanks for any suggestions.
