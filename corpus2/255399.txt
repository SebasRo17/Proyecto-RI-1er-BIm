I have developed websites where users would register with a username of their choice and an entry would be created in a database table that holds their username and some sort of salted password. They would then use this account to interact with the services that the site provides. Now I am interested in providing the ability to sign up an account using facebook, twitter, and basically anything else that might be popular. However, I don't know how to integrate the login workflow into my system. I have read the docs for `Facebook Login` but am still not sure how I would integrate it with my user-account design. This is how my own registration workflow works   1. Choose username/password   2. Create an entry in the "users" table   3. Authenticate by checking the username and see if the password matches With facebook login, they would ideally simply click a button that says "login with facebook" and they would authenticate with their facebook credentials. However, I don't know where I would go about creating a user to associate with their facebook identity. So my question is... What is a common way to use facebook (or other social media such as twitter or linkedin) to register an account into the system? I would like to manage all users uniformly, so no matter how they choose to register an account, they would all be handled in a single `users` table where I could do queries and associations without having to worry about how the account was created or how they logged in.
