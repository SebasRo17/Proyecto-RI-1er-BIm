I often use Epilog to label lines within graphs, and I like to coordinate the color of the labels with the color of the lines they're labeling. This is no problem. However, I'm currently working on a project in which I need vertical connecting lines at selected places, and these should color match as well. For the life of me, I can't figure out how to do this.               Plot[{Sin[x], Sin[x + 0.5]}, {x, 0, 2*Pi}, PlotStyle -> {Blue, Red},       Epilog -> {        Line[{{2, 0}, {2, Sin[2]}}],        Line[{{3, 0}, {3, Sin[3.5]}}]}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/U0XFe.png) Any help would be appreciated.
