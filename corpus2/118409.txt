I have a 11-year old son who wants to do game programming. I've started him on C++ (C++11) and he's learned iostreams, looping, functions, logic and flow control. I'm using the standard library and no memory management at all. But I would like to ask: What language would you suggest for a pre-teen (Python, ...)? What books would you suggest? We looked at one book that was just for console ASCII games. I liked the C++ that it taught but I think he'll get bored without some graphics at some point.
