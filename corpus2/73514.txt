I was recently encouraged by a potential employer to go out and buy a book and begin learning ADA. I generally find that starting out with a good book, then supplementing that learning with continued research on-line with reference as needed to the book is the best way that I learn. What books would you recommend to start out with learning ADA? The job itself would involve embedded programming which I don't have experience with either. Any books that cover both topics well?
