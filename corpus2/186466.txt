I'm building a web-app where users can keep track of who owes whom money. I have users and debts. Given a user I want to be able to find out all the debts to other users, and all the loans to other users. Given a debt I want to be able to find out who the debtor and lender are. The asker of this question ran into a similar situation, but I don't belive our situations similar enough to warrant just using the top answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4729725/how-do-i-do-two-has-many-belongs- to-relationships-between-two-models Taken from that question, the three paterns sugested there are   * well specified associations   * single table inheritance   * polymorphic association What pattern should I use in my situation? One of these three, or is there an even more appropriate one?
