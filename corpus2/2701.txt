Often I have Notebooks where I generate several images and export them into files. Now when I want to change one image, I'd like to just re-evaluate the complete notebook, however I generally do _not_ want all images to be exported again, but only selected ones. For this, it would be useful if I could make _some_ cells confirmation-only. Ideally it would highlight the cell in question, but that's optional (I can just look at which cell is the first unevaluated). It should however make sure that the cell is visible (because Mathematica dialogs unfortunately tend to _completely_ block the underlying notebook). It should ask me if I want to execute the cell, and if I say no, just skip it and continue at the next cell. Is this possible, and if yes, how? Bonus points if it doesn't trigger when doing Shift-Enter from _within_ the cell in question (because in that case, it's obvious that I want it executed)
