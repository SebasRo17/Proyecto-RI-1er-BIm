I am in my senior year of college. I am an intern at a $120 million a year company. I am responsible for maintaining three websites, I'm essentially the dba for the marketing database, and write and support in-house software. I'm booked pretty solid. My issue is that the upper management likes to severely over commit me in about every possible way. For example, the VP of the company told one of our larger customers that we had a cross ref mobile app ready to show them at the meeting a week away. I had not even started such a thing, nor had I ever written a mobile app in my life. It was a fairly simple project, but I still had to kill myself to get something delivered in that time frame on top of my regular responsibilities. It's a double edged sword, if I did not get the app delivered, it would have looked bad on me. However, getting it done gets the VP thinking "well if that's what you can do in a week..." The upper management has no idea of the work that goes into IT projects. They seem to think it is magic. I've complained about my situation to a few people and all I ever hear is "Welcome to _name of our company_ " I would just leave, but it's a great job in many ways in a growing company. Not a bad place to be when I'm about to graduate. Anyways, my question is: As an intern (low man on the totem pole) how do I get the management to understand what goes into my workday and what is reasonable to accomplish? How do I get them to not commit me to projects with out discussing it with me? I don't know what to say or how to say it to put it into perspective for them without sounding like I am whining or incapable. Make sense?
