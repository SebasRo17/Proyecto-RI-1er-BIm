Sorry in advance if this formatting comes out strange, this is my first question! I can't find a way to integrate, e.g., a function of the Hermite polynomials for general (still integer) order. For example,               Integrate[E^-x^2 HermiteH[m,x] x HermiteH[n,x ], {x, -\[Infinity], \[Infinity]},          Assumptions->{m \[Element] Integers, n \[Element] Integers, m >= 0, n >= 0]      will not calculate. But if I give specific m and n,               Integrate[E^-x^2 HermiteH[m,x] x HermiteH[n,x ]/.{m->2,n->1}, {x, -\[Infinity], \[Infinity]}]      the answer comes right out. I know there is a general rule for certain classes of these integrals, and have often come across situations where I end up having to do them by hand. Does anyone know how to make Mathematica recognize/do these integrals? Thanks in advance.
