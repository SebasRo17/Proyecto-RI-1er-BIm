I am using Mathematica 7 to try and plot my quicken data file. I have exported my quicken file as a .*TXT and have made zero changes to it. I want to do a `DateListPlot` on the file. The date is in column 1 and the amount is in column 9. So I want `ALL` data in those columns lined up by date. Now my paycheck I keep track of the taxes I pay so an entry in the file will have those amounts listed but no date in the associate column, so I'm guessing I may need to do some clean up there (many thousands of rows...) I have the following code:               quickentest =       DateListPlot[       Take[Import[         "C:\\location of file\\quickentest.txt", {"Data",           All, {2, 10}}], "DateList" -> "Month", "", "Day", "", "Year"]]      And I get the following output error:               Take::seqs: Sequence specification (+n, -n, {+n}, {-n}, {m, n}, or {m, n, s}) expected at position 2 in Take[{{Date,Amount},{,},{BALANCE 2/18/2006,0.},{2/19/2006,168.77},{2/20/2006,-32.54},{2/21/2006,-20.},{2/23/2006,-103.03},{2/23/2006,-10.},{2/24/2006,-21.75},{2/24/2006,1044.},<<4248>>},DateList->Month,,Day,,Year]. >>     DateListPlot::ntdt: The first argument to DateListPlot should be a list of pairs of dates and real values, a list of real values, or a list of several such lists. >>      I also get some output which for the most part looks pretty good except for the header row which looks like this:               DateListPlot[      Take[{{"Date", "Amount"}, {"", ""}, {"BALANCE 2/18/2006",          0.}, {"2/19/2006",          168.77}, {"2/20/2006", -32.54}, {"2/21/2006", -20.}, \     {"2/23/2006", -103.03}, {"2/23/2006", -10.}, {"2/24/2006", -21.75}, \     {"2/24/2006",          1044.}, {"", -127.18}, {"", -15.13}, {"", -64.73}, {"", -37.87}, \     {"", -1.2}, {"2/24/2006", 68.28}, {"2/25/2006", -32.51}, {"2/25/2006",          0.}, {"2/27/2006", -40.}, <<4220>>, {"12/10/2012", -29.43}, \     {"12/10/2012", -35.55}, {"12/10/2012", -30.}, {"12/12/2012", -18.4}, \     {"12/13/2012", -50.}, {"12/14/2012",          381.27}, {"12/14/2012", -6.29}, {"12/14/2012", -120.}, \     {"12/15/2012", -7.73}, {"12/15/2012", -18.85}, {"12/17/2012", \     -35.02}, {"12/17/2012", -58.73}, {"12/17/2012", -21.72}, \     {"12/17/2012", -15.}, {"12/18/2012", -152.06}, {"12/18/2012", -37.}, \     {"12/28/2012", -959.}, {"1/1/2013", -355.}, {"2/19/2006 - 1/1/2013", \     -1007.55}}, "DateList" -> "" \[Ellipsis] "h", <<2>>, "", "Year"]      I tried to exclude the header by using the suggested code below `2;;` to span out what I want but get errors I listed in the comment section. When exporting from Quicken 2013 Deluxe my only option is a .*TXT file from inside the checkbook registry. Thank you
