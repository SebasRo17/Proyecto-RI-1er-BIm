What reasons do you usually give when you are looking for a change to your prospective employer/recruitment consultants?   1. I need a change, which is basically this question but here, I am asking it more specifically as a response to the recruitment consultants.    2. I am interested in working in .NET 4.0 but my current organization is still stuck on VB6.0   3. I am working in the Telecom sector and I want to move to the Financial Sector.   4. ... The above are more or less responses that either some of my friends (including me) have given or we have heard. What would you classify as a **definite NO NO** reason? More importantly, what would you classify as an acceptable reason?
