This question is a result out of the discussion HERE and was moved from HERE. Is it really good practice to supply EVERY value you display in any view via a model?   Especially variables like the current username. Even Microsoft odes the following in their default template for the `_LoginPartial` in ASP.NET MVC 3+:               "Hello " + User.Identity.GetUserName() + "!"      I think this is OK to not supply this via a model as it is much better in light of maintainability. Or should you obay the "MVC rules" and add a model/sub-model to every page/model to supply such stuff and pass it around in your views and partials? **How do you solve such "problems" or what do you think is the best way of doing such stuff?** Inheritance would be an option:               public class BaseUserModel     {         public string UserName { get; set; }     }      Require every model to inherit from a base model like above containing such values.   But could that cause problems if you need/want to inherit another class for some model?
