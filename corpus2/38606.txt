I want to plot this revenue function: $r=30q-0.3q^2$ I have no range, its an open interval, but when I try to plot in _Mathematica_ it requires the min and max of the plotting limits. How do I do this? *Edit: Thank you for helping, my professor gave us the revenue function mentioned up, and asked us to plot " revenue versus quantity (q) ", he did not specify any range, or max and min. My question is can i plot this without a max and min?
