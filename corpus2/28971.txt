I have imported a data from an excel sheet. I want to extract parts of the list based on some conditions. First I want to create one list whit the `The Coca-Cola` data and then I want another list with `McDonald` data. The key thing is that I want the extraction process to be able to spot when the data moves from one ticker to another.               AA = MatrixForm[DUBS]      > >     {{"Symbol", "Full Name", "Date", "Open", "High", "Low", "Close",   >        "Adj Close", "Volume", "Type"}, >        {"KO", "The Coca-Cola Company", {2013, 7, 19, 0, 0, 0.}, 40.88, 41.1, >          40.79, 41.09, 41.09, 1.14011*10^7, "Stock"},{ >        {"MCD", "McDonald", {2013, 7, 19, 0, 0, 0.}, 100.2, 100.41, 99.53, >          100.27, 100.27, 4.5083*10^6, "Stock"}, >        {"MCD", "McDonald", {2013, 7, 18, 0, 0, 0.}, 100.48, 100.77, 99.99, >          100.18, 100.18, 3.4016*10^6, "Stock"}, >        {"MCD", "McDonald", {2013, 7, 17, 0, 0, 0.}, 100.05, 100.35, 99.3, >          100.1, 100.1, 5.3774*10^6, "Stock"}} >
