I am looking to build a simple Excel type of a table with four columns. I have spent some time researching _Mathematica_ documentation, but haven't come across a way to implement that. Here is a picture of what I am aiming to achieve:   1. I'd like to be able to add new rows to this table by specifying frequency and probability values   2. I'd like the result to be a product of multiplication of freq. and probability.   3. I'd like to increment index as the new rows are added to the table and decrement when rows are deleted   4. I'd like to be able to remove rows by specifying an index number. Can somebody please point me in the right direction of where do I begin; e.g., _Mathematica_ docs or _Mathematica_ SE threads ) I would greatly appreciate any help! ![What I am looking to build:](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9oEdE.jpg)
