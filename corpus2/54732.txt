I currently use the trial version before I decide to upgrade. However, a number of expressions don't work, i.e. it results in some errors that I don't know how to interpret. For example, if I use the simple `GeoGraphics[]` expression from the help menu, it results in the error message               General::unavail: ExportString is not available in this version of the Wolfram Language.      This error pops up in multiple contexts (e.g. other Geo-expressions, `CloudDeploy`, etc.) and I have no clue why.
