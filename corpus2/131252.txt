First off, I am new to licenses and app stores. There is an example app on a framework that has a `Class` file with much of the functionality I'll need for my own app. It's less than 1000 lines of code and distributed under the Apache License 2.0.   1. As far as I know I can use/modify the code and just acknowledge the developer and include the license, but does this mean my _whole_ project will be distributed under the Apache License 2.0 or just does it just apply to that source file?   2. Once my project is done, would I be able to publish my app in the Mac App Store? Would I be able to sell it there?  The file is from an example project that pretty much demonstrates all which is possible in the framework, and using it in my project would save me a ton of time. However, if this is not possible I guess I'll just have to code it myself.
