Problem Link - http://opc.iarcs.org.in/index.php/problems/NUMTRIPLE In my opinion, the problem can be solved by a data structure, that shows how each number is connected to another, and via recursion find the smallest possible value. But my question is, what data structure (most efficient) can hold/represent such data? Also, is there a better (faster) way of solving this problem. Thanks
