The question of managing bugs in production has been a large feature in my mind of late. Sprint's are not meant to have any items added into them, but for **critical** bugs, this is simply unavoidable. How does one go about managing this break in the sprint? Do you simply give a sprint a percentage "allowance" of time, thus only filling say 80% of the schedule with sprint items "just in case"? Thanks, Kyle
