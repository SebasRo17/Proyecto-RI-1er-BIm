I bury a good deal of my ideas for fear that I don't know enough about scaling web applications and high-traffic websites. That said, I'd like to know of any general topics to research in order to ensure that your web app doesn't break / slow down when you start getting to Twitter-level traffic. I'm looking for research topics with, preferably, additional resources. For example: **Make sure you optimize SQL queries (seeHigh Performance MySQL Optimization)**
