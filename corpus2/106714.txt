Recently my university updated their password storage procedure, and they have several criteria such as that the password must contain a number, symbol, and uppercase character, and has a length requirement. Realistically, when a brute force / dictionary attack is being performed, doesn't this just make it easier for the person to crack one that works? I understand that this is to prevent people from doing things like "password," but what about one such as "youwillneverguessmypassword" ?
