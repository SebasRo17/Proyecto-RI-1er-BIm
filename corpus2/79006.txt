Working on a project with a couple of classmates, and I've noticed that we get a lot of partial commits which are then corrected:               Rev 249 Log: committing change foo, yeah!     Rev 250 log: oh dear, forgot these files!     Rev 251 log: oh my, how could I possibly forget another file in the *same* change?      The obvious answer is to be more careful. But as of 2011, programmers are still (almost) human, and are error prone. The problem is that this causes ambiguity when reverting or merging. Do we leave them there? Do we modify the commit history?
