For example, when I first started out freelancing a year ago, my business card had my name, email and website - and up top a list of the technologies I'm comfortable with. In retrospect I don't feel this was a wise decision. Why would a potential client know what Python or Ruby is? How could he know what .NET was? I still have a couple of the old batch left, but I'm going to send out for some new cards. What do you recommend we developers have to show on our business cards? Am I correct in thinking listing technologies is meaningless to potential clients?
