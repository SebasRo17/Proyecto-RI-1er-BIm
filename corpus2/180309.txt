If we have double numbers, let's say I want to see if some double parameter is equal to zero that is passed as double:               public bool AlmostEqual(double x, double y)     {         double epsilon = Math.Max(Math.Abs(x), Math.Abs(y)) * 1E-15;         return Math.Abs(x - y) <= epsilon;     }      considering double shows 15 accurate digits. So do you think what I wrote is good? or it has issues? well then I just wrote a simple method like this:               public bool ReallyEqual(double x, double y)     {         return (x == y);     }      and then I couldn't find a case that return values of those two methods are different. they were always returning the same result. :(
