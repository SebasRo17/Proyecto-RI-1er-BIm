Is there any code built in to add the numbers in a list sequentially? For example, lets say I have a list B. B has 6 numbers like below.               B={0,6,5,4,3,2}      I want to produce a new list C. C will add the first two numbers in the list, so 0+6 = 6. That will be put into the new list C. Then the next term in the list C will be 0+6+5 = 11. And then 0+6+5+4 = 15, and so on. The result of the new list C will be as below.               C={6,11,15,18,20}      Any help is appreciated. Thanks.
