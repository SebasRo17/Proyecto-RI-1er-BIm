I'm English and been living in central Europe for most of my adult life. More recently, I've been having high hopes in a degree in Informations Systems Management and a few months Java training to get into a job as software developper. However, it seems the lack of relevant job experience and age (just turned 36) could form a serious obstacle and cause all of this effort to go to waste. A contact got into a job in London with little formal training so I'm wondering if I should contemplate getting experience overseas. The alternative would do my best to get a position here and perhaps continue with a Master's degree (education is dirt cheap). However, if things don't work out on the job front I fear that I may be sabotaging my chances of getting a good career off the ground. What do you think? Have you been down this road or know someone who has? Would a profile like mine stand a better chance in some countries you know?
