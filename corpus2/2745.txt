At present I am running an analysis on economic data. Within the data I was able to identify countries which went through recession. I then calculated for example the average decline rate of GDP during recession. All my results are in the following list:               CompleteQuarterlyStatData      In this list I had to keep also all the countries which did not go through a recession. So if I ask for the decline rate of Australia during recession I get the following answer:               In[1328]:= CompleteQuarterlyStatData[[1]][[1]][[1]]          Out[1328]= {{"Australia", "AUS", "other countries", "GDP","quarterly data"}, {}}      Whereas position 1 (`CompleteQuarterlyStatData[[i]]`) indicates the key figure (in the above example "decline rate during recession"), position 2 (`CompleteQuarterlyStatData[[i]][[j]]`) the economic indicator (in the above example "GDP") and position 3 (`CompleteQuarterlyStatData[[i]][[j]][[k]]`) the country (in the above example "Australia"). (by the way: In total I have nine key figures (so `i` ranges from 1 to 9), 24 economic indicators (`j` ranges from 1 to 24) and 32 countries (`k` ranges from 1 to 32)) As Australia obviously did not got through a recession I want to get rid of all key figures for Australian GDP, which works with the following code:               If[      NumberQ[CompleteQuarterlyStatData[[1]][[1]][[2]][[2]]] == False,       Table[       Delete[CompleteQuarterlyStatData, i],       {i,        Map[        Part[#, 1 ;; 3] &,         Position[CompleteQuarterlyStatData,CompleteQuarterlyStatData[[1]][[1]][[2]][[1]]]]       }      ]     ];      (Note: Position 2 of `CompleteQuarterlyStatData[[1]][[1]][[2]]` is `{}` and `CompleteQuarterlyStatData[[1]][[1]][[2]]` `{"Australia", "AUS", "other countries", "GDP","quarterly data"}`. (see Out[1328])) So what all countries, which did not go through a recession or a longterm decline, have in common is, that `CompleteQuarterlyStatData[[1]][[EcoIndicator]][[Country]][[2]]` is always of the value `{}`. (Note: `CompleteQuarterlyStatData[[1]]` refers to the key figure "decline rate during recession".) To get rid of all countries which did not suffer from a longterm decline in a given economic indicator I could wrap `Table` around my if-procedure to go through all economic indicators and countries:               Table[     Table[        If[      NumberQ[CompleteQuarterlyStatData[[1]][[EcoIndicator]][[Country]][[2]]] == False,       Table[       Delete[CompleteQuarterlyStatData, i],       {i,        Map[        Part[#, 1 ;; 3] &,         Position[CompleteQuarterlyStatData,CompleteQuarterlyStatData[[1]][[EcoIndicator]][[Country]][[1]]]]       }      ]     ]     ,{Country,Length[CompleteQuarterlyStatData[[1]][[EcoIndicator]]]}]     ,{EcoIndicator,Length[CompleteQuarterlyStatData[[1]]]}];      But that does not work. Does anyone has a suggestion? In fact it would be nice to have something like `Delete[CompleteQuarterlyStatData,ArrayXXX]` whereas `ArrayXXX` represents the position of all countries (which did not go through a longterm decline) within `CompleteQuarterlyStatData`. * * * For better understanding I created an example:               list = {       {        {{{"Australia","GDP"},{}}, {{"Korea","GDP"},-2.45}, {{"USA","GDP"},-2.34}},        {{{"Australia","GDP"},2.34}, {{"Korea","GDP"},1.23}, {{"USA","GDP"},1.45}}       },       {        {{{"Greece", "Imports"},3.25}, {{"Turkey","Imports"}, {}}, {{"USA","Imports"},-2.64}},        {{{"Greece", "Imports"},-1.23}, {{"Turkey","Imports"},3.56}, {{"USA","Imports"},-1.56}}       }     };      The output of `list[[1]][[1]][[1]]` or `list[[2]][[1]][[2]]` matches the pattern `{_,{}}`. In that case I would like not only to delete those parts of list witch matches the pattern `{_,{}}` but also all other key figures which were calculated for the individual country and economic indicator. The result should then be:               {       {        {{{"Korea","GDP"},-2.45}, {{"USA","GDP"},-2.34}},        {{{"Korea","GDP"},1.23}, {{"USA","GDP"},1.45}}       },       {        {{{"Greece", "Imports"},3.25}, {{"USA","Imports"},-2.64}},        {{{"Greece", "Imports"},-1.23}, {{"USA","Imports"},-1.56}}       }     };      The reason: Australia did not go through a longterm decline in GDP, neither did Turkey in imports (if so, all other key figures concerning Australia & GDP or Turkey & imports would be irrelevant for further calculation).
