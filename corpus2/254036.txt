Problem: Find a match of word **S** in text **T** Given: **S** and **T** are **part of spoken and written English**. Example: Match 'Math' in 'I love Mathematics' NOTE: Ignore CASES. My algorithm:               STEP 1) Convert S, T to char[]          STEP 2) for i=0, i < T.length , i++          STEP 3) for j=S.length-1, j>0 , j--      STEP 3 is the magic, instead of going about matching `M,A,T,H`, this matches `M, H, T` and finally `A`. This helps in eliminating a lot of possible partial matches. For example, if I go sequentially like `M A` as in Boyer Moore's method ... it can match `Matter, Mass, Matchstick` etc. using `M _ _ H` will bring down size of partial matches.               STEP 4) if S[j]!=T[i] -> break;             else if j==i -> PRINT MATCH
