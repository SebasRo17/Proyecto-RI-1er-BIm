I've just started using _Mathematica_ 10 on Linux and have immediately run into problems with the fonts. Fonts on Linux are always a headache, but I had managed to find a reasonable one in "Century Schoolbook L". However, in _Mathematica_ 10, this font and many others are being displayed with incorrect special characters and punctuation. It seems like _Mathematica_ is trying to assign sans-serif default (that is, not appearing in the font specified) characters when it needs to be using serif. I have tried messing with "OperatorSubstitution" and "FontSerifed". The former can change the parentheses, but neither affects the Greek. My only current recourse is to select one of the fonts that (seemingly randomly) does not suffer this problem; "Linux Libertine O", for example. Is this a bug? Is there a workaround? ![Example of problematic text; note the Greek and parentheses](http://i.stack.imgur.com/oCoPi.png)
