After reading this question I may have a partial answer to the issue at hand, but I'd like to explore the issue further. I seem to be the only person on my team (a team of 6 people working on an Enterprise software solution) who cares about consistency. At times I am vocal about it, but there are members of my team that are just as vocal against it. I can file tickets, as the question I linked recommends. Which sounds great. But, I think the issue I am having has to do with the mentality or attitude of myself and my co-workers. What concrete steps can be taken if your team-mates don't care about consistency? Do I clobber them with statistics from studies that have been done linking consistency of code with the speed at which code can be read? Do I flood our already overly full backlog with consistency issues that can then either be solved or put on record as being "not important enough"? Should I just shut-up, sit down, write code, and quit worrying about it? How best to handle this situation?
