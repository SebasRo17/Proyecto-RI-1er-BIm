I have some dates in a list, and I want to plot how many of those dates are Monday, Tuesday, etc. I'm using this:               data = {...}     Tally[DayOfWeek /@ data]      and I get something like:               {{Tuesday, 533}, {Monday, 491}, {Sunday, 487}, {Saturday, 481},       {Friday, 422}, {Thursday, 353}, {Wednesday, 371}}      I want to plot my list using `BarChart`, but I have two problems: The data is not sorted by day-of-the-week and all days may not appear in the data.
