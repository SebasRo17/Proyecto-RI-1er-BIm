Two years ago I tried an evaluation copy of _Mathematica_. I reported various inaccuracies in the `GeoDistance` routine to which I never received any fix. Could someone check whether `GeoDistance` is any more accurate now? Thanks. Here are the problems I reported on June 20, 2011:                                                    Mathematica   Correct     Error     GeoDistance[{30, 0}, {-30, 180}]  -> 19928486.7   20003931.5  -75444     GeoDistance[{0.4, 0}, {0.4, 180}] -> 19915473.0   19915472.0       1     GeoDistance[{0, 0}, {0.5, 179.5}] -> 19936426.5   19936288.6     138
