How do I get the coordinates from a contour plot I've done in _Mathematica_? For example, I have a two-variable function `f[x, y]`, for which I can make a contour plot:                   contour = ContourPlot[f[x, y] == 1, {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1}];      I can access a nested list, containing lists of coordinates, from an exported file using                   Export["output.m", contour, "TEXT"]       but the nested list is inside the function `Graphics`. I would like to export only the corresponding nested list. What is a straightforward way to do that? Is there a way of doing that by manipulating directly the variable `contour`? **Edit** @Jens solution was                   Cases[Normal@contour, Line[x_] :> x, Infinity]      Is there a way to generalize it? The issue is that `Line` won't give us the points inside a region. E.g., I would like to get the coordinates corresponding to a region plot:                   region = RegionPlot[f[x, y] > 1, {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1}];
