I want to generate a graphic using               DiscretePlot[primePercent[x], {x, 10^10},        ImageSize -> Full,        Filling -> None,        Joined -> True]       where               primePercent[x_Integer] := 100 PrimePi[x]/x      When I generate it for 10^6, my computer becomes slow as there are simply too many data points. What I'm wondering is if I can get some load off my RAM by continually saving the evaluated data to a file (or using a different evaluation method/graphic options, of course)? Does `Export[]` save the file only once it has been generated?
