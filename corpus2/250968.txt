I don't actually know if my question is correct, but working on a webapp porting from ASP.NET world to Java + Spring platform I came up with this question in mind. Using Spring MVC, the new version of the the application, I'm obviously applying MVC pattern, but which was the ASP.NET design/paradigm. I know that ASP.NET uses event-oriented paradigm, but is this a design pattern? Hope to be clear...
