I copied this code from the official website and I get an error when I evaluate it.               Needs["DifferentialEquations`InterpolatingFunctionAnatomy`"]     uval =        NDSolveValue[{         D[u[x, y], x, x] + D[u[x, y], y, y] == Exp[-(x^2 + 10 y^2)],          u[x, -1] == u[x, 1] == u[-1, y] == u[1, y] == 0},          u, {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1}]      I get the error: > NDSolveValue::ivone: Boundary values may only be specified for one > independent variable. Initial values may only be specified at one value of > the other independent variable. >> Why is this happening? I copied it from: http://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/NDSolvePDE.html I need this for an assignment, my problem is similar, but in this case I used the Laplace equation, but when I substitute my code I get the same error.
