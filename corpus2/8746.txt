**How can I create a colour of my chosen hue with a given fixed lightness level?** For example, how can I create a reddish colour, `col`, so that `ColorConvert[col, "GrayScale"]` will return precisely `GrayLevel[0.6]`? Does Mathematica have something built-in to assist in this, or do I need to read up on how colours are converted between various representations? Note that the `b` value in `Hue[h, s, b]` does not correspond to the `GrayLevel` value. I need to have precise control over what certain colours I use will look like when converted to greyscale.
