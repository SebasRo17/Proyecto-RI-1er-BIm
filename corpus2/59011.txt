I have an image that I'm trying to pad some transparent border. But I get error: "The specified padding value is not compatible with a 3-channel image."               data = Table[{45, 45, 45}, {20}, {25}];     p = Image[RawArray["Byte", data], "Byte", Rule[ColorSpace, Automatic],         Rule[Interleaving, True]];          ImagePad[p, 10, Transparent]      What does this error mean and how to solve it? **Update** If test on the documentation figure, padding transparent works even it has a Automatic color space: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fwHep.png)
