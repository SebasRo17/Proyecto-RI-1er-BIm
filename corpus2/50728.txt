I have a two lists: `list1 = {{x1, y1}, {x2, y2}, {x3, y3}, {x4, y4}, {x5, y5}}` and `list2 = {z1, z2, z3, z4, z5}` and I want to make a third one like this `output = {{x1, y1, z1}, {x2, y2, z2}, {x3, y3, z3}, {x4, y4,z4}, {x5, y5, z5}}` What nice command can do the trick? It is to do a `ListPlot3D` with two lists with more than 10000 entries. I tried with `Map` and pure function but it is giving me troubles. Thank you
