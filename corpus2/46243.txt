Consider the integration, $\int _0 ^\infty dx\ x \tanh( \pi x) \sqrt {x^2 + a^2 } $ where $a$ is a real number. This integral is divergent. We note that an asymptotic expansion of the integrand about $x =\infty$ reveals it to have an expansion of the kind, $x^2 \tanh(\pi x) + \frac{a^2}{2} \tanh (\pi x ) + O(\frac{1}{x}) $ So we can think of "defining" the regulated value of the integral as the quantity that one gets after subtracting off the asymptotic divergence. Hence a possibly sensible definition is to say, $Limit _ {M \rightarrow \infty} \left [ \int _0 ^M dx \left ( x \tanh( \pi x) \sqrt {x^2 + a^2 } \right ) - \int_0 ^M dx \left ( x^2 \tanh(\pi x) + \frac{a^2}{2} \tanh (\pi x ) \right ) \right ]$ I believe that the above is a finite quantity.   * I would like to know how Mathematica can be gotten to compute this above quantity (may be numerically) for any given $a$ * * * If you are worried about motivations then you can think of QFT.
