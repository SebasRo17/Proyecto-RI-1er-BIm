I'm working on a website and was hit with the thought of "do I need to give credit for the languages I'm using to build my website with?" I wasn't able to find any sort of licenses for HTML, CSS, or JavaScript and I'm a bit confused on the wording of PHP's license. My question is: Do I need to specify somewhere on my website (externally or internally) that I'm using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL (and attribute credit, linking to their licenses if they have one, etc)?
