I work in an organization that does extensive Java development. Our group is small with a short-lived project, agile development charter. We will leverage existing QA resources of other groups, and potentially contribute code to customers and partners. The primary arguments against Scala development have been:   * QA will need Scala experience   * Customers will need Scala experience My experience has been that Scala is generally easier to read than Java with minimal exposure to the language, and that the ability to use existing Java tools such as Junit would minimize negative impact to existing testing strategies. I've estimated that development in Scala could be 25%+ faster than equivalent Java development depending on the problem. This is just a finger in the wind based on my personal experience. If anyone has evidence of efficiency increase, please share. I would also like to compile a list of major benefits to using Scala over Java. Please share your favorites. Thanks, John
