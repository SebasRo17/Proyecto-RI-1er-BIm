I would like to create a list of Cauchy distribution pdf's, having different locations of their maxima, and being multiplied by different factors; then I'd like to calculate those functions' values for different values of `x`. I have searched on the Internet and tried various things, and I seem to be able to set up the list, but then I fail miserably when it comes to actually using the functions on arguments. Here's some code:               pos     = RandomReal[10,2]     factors = RandomInteger[{1,5},{2}]          gamma1 = 0.5          peaks = Table[factors[[i]]*PDF[CauchyDistribution[pos[[i]],gamma1],x], {i,1,2}]     Print[ peaks ]     Print[ peaks[0.1][[1]] ]      This gives me               SetDelayed::noval: Symbol peaks in part assignment does not have an immediate value.          SetDelayed::noval: Symbol peaks in part assignment does not have an immediate value.     {3.183098861837907/(1 + 4.*(-6.1318667717670134 + x)^2), 0.6366197723675814/(1 + 4.*(-1.3741656250222944 + x)^2)}     0.1      How can I use each element of my array `peaks` like an individual function? (I'm an absolute Mathematica-beginner, so in advance: sorry for the noob- question...)
