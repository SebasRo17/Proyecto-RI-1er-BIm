I've got an MVC 4 site where I'm using Forms Authentication. I'm setting a cookie when a user logs in. The majority of my site does NOT require a user to be logged in though. What I'd like to do, whenever a user FIRST accesses my site, I'd like to update my "LastLogon" that I have stored in my database table to the corresponding value (if Request.IsAuthenticated). But I don't want it to fire on EVERY page that the user accesses. So, where do I track when the user first accesses my site? Is that in the Global.asax? Is Application_Start method for all first requests to a site, or is that when the website first loads after an iisreset?
