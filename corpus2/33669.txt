I have a Beta distribution, and am interested in calculating expectations and conditional expectations. The domain on the distribution is $z \in [0,1]$ Ignoring constants of proportionality, the expectation of an exponential function is:               $Assumptions = z >= 0 && z <= 1 && a > 0 && b > 0 && c > 0 && d > 0 && d < 1;          Print["*******Different parameters, {a,b}"];     Integrate[Exp[c z]  z^(a - 1) (1 - z)^(b - 1), {z, 0, 1}]          Print["********Symmetric parameter, a"];     Integrate[Exp[c z]  z^(a - 1) (1 - z)^(b - 1) /. {b -> a}, {z, 0, 1}]      The output from this is:               Gamma[a] Gamma[b] Hypergeometric1F1Regularized[a, a + b, c]     (-c)^(1/2 - a) E^(c/2) Sqrt[\[Pi]]  BesselI[-(1/2) + a, -(c/2)] Gamma[a]      These are solid. The problem I am having is when calculating conditional expectations, which is effectively integration over a subset of the domain. Again ignoring constants of proportionality,               Print["********Truncated Integral on [d, 1], symmetric for simplicity"];     Integrate[Exp[c z]  z^(a - 1) (1 - z)^(b - 1) /. {b -> a}, {z, d, 1}]      This is unable to solve it. Any idea on this? Are there any tricks in mathematica, in math that I am missing?
