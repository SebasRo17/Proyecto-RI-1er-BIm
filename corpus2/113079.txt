> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Where can I find programming work online? I saw oDesk.com being mentioned in one thread here for contract work and freelance work, and the people listed for hire is asking for $15/hour and up to $80 or $100/hour -- of the ones that I saw for development jobs. I wonder what alternatives there are besides using oDesk.com for programming contract work? (The fee it charges seems somewhat high, that for $80 / hour that I bill, it charges $8.89 / hour to the employer, so the employer needs to pay $88.89 / hour.)
