My code looks like this               import java.util.Scanner;               public class StudentGrades {          public static void main(String[] argv)     {         Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);         byte q1 = keyboard.nextByte() * 10;     }     }      It gives me an error `Type mismatch: cannot convert from int to byte.` Why would Java store a literal operand that is small enough to fit in a byte, into an int type? Do literals get stored in variables/registers before the ALU performs arithmetic operations?
