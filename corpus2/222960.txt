I'm developing a small open-source javascript library, and I was wondering about the proper method for compiling the source into one javascript file. It's easier to develop if the code is split into multiple files, but libraries are included as one large file when used in another application. My current "compilation" method involves using a makefile to copy each submoudle into the main file and then minify it. What is the proper way to do this?
