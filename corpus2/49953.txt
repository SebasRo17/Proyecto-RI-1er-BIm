I am looking for time tracking software to use as an individual consulting on multiple projects at once. The projects I work on are billable to different clients. Some clients are billed on an hourly basis while others are billed on a project basis. I also track personal projects that may never produce income. I need to be able to track the time down to the individual task level. I am looking for software that is easy to use, cost effective, easy to invoice out of and has data mining reports.
