When I export even simple graphics, say, a `DateListPlot` to PDF under Windows, it refuses to print on any of the printers at work.   ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/f3RGx.png) Acrobat (Reader X) throws three modal dialogs in succession: "The document could not be printed", "There were no pages selected to print" and (sometimes) "There was a drawing error". Strangely, simple graphics (i.e. not a `GraphicsGrid`) will print correctly if you choose "Save Selection As..." or right-click and choose "Save Graphics As..." and save as a PDF. However PDFs produced using the `Export` command, or by saving some more complex `Grid`s of graphics, have this printing issue. I cannot see anything different in the properties of the PDFs produced with `Export` that might cause them not to print, when those produced using the various versions of "Save As..." do print. There is a work-around, which is to go into the Advanced tab of the print dialog and choose "Print as image". Since the intention is that colleagues will be running notebooks that automatically update and export PDF-format graphics, I am reluctant to use this work-around. People will forget what to do and blame me. I have already had problems sending graphics to colleagues that they then can't print. Other than manually exporting things all the time using "Save Selection As" and educating people on print settings, is there anything I can do to avoid printing errors? System: Windows XP, Mathematica 8.0.4. We're going to Windows 7 very soon, so maybe that will help. **EDIT**   I have now uploaded:   1. The file that does not print (produced using `Export`)   2. The file that does print As you can see, they look identical but there are about 100 extra bytes in the `Export`ed version. **EDIT 2** This bug seems to have been fixed in version 9.
