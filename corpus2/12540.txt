I consider an e-reader a software development tool and would like to hear some opinions on reading technical e-books. Questions that I have are things like:   * What are the usability issues you have experienced with e-books as opposed to physical books, what are the advantages/disadvantages of both?   * What experiences have people had with eye-strain on tablets/PC as compared to an e-ink based reader?   * What are people's specific experiences with the Kindle as a technical e-book reader? Does the screen size impact readability? Have you had any other concerns/issues?   * Any other experiences/issues with reading technical e-books...resolution of text/diagrams; ability to keep a page open while referencing another, etc...?   * Any suggestions as to solutions for any of the issues encountered with reading e-books on the device with the issue? P.S. I would like to hear people's actual experiences, and why/how they believe whatever device is currently a superior tool for reading e-books.
