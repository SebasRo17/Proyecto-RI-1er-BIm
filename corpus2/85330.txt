I've written a decent chunk of code over the past few days and I'm ready to `git init` it and push it to github. But before I do so, I want to do this the "correct" way in case anyone else wants to use my code. So I guess I need to pick a license (probably MIT) and implement it, and write some sort of comment at the top of every file. What is a good style comment to put at the top of the file? What info should it include, what should it look like? And do I put the license in a LICENSE folder in the root directory, or at the top of every source file or something? And are there any other steps I'm missing before throwing this up to github?
