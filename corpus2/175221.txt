I'm in a project for creating a game engine and eventually a game, and we need ideas on how to get our game out into the internet. I had an idea with putting it onto the windows 8 store at a low cost(or free) in order to get the word out, but **does the windows 8 store only support apps programmed in windows RT?** Our game will be built in C++ / OpenGL / GLEW / Actionscript / GLM / etc.. , so we won't be using any windows RT functionality at all.
