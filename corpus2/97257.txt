i just want to know what are the good websites to read technical articles on the iPhone, iPad or in generally iOS. Any subscription based services can also be named. i am talking about sites like http://drdobbs.com, which have articles on mobility but indeed very generic. so can you name some good sites with technical articles on IPhone, iPad or general iOS programming.
