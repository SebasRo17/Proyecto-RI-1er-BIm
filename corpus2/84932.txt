I want to create a clone of a Google Code repository, which I cannot download due to Country restrictions and I want to migrate that clone into Github, which I can use without any problem. The thing is I have a Github account and I can browse through GoogleCode but I cannot take my TortoiseHg and clone a repo just like that because I'm from Cuba and I get a lovely Google page saying that I cannot go into Google code. I'm guessing you know how I manage to browse :) I would like to import a mercurial repository into my Github repo, my questions:   * **Is it possible?**   * **How can I do it?**
