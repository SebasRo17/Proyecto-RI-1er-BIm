If I were to download some open source code that does some neat thing that I am needing, but doesn't have nearly as many options or bells and whistles that I need... and I make a TON of changes to where some of the base code is still there from the open source project, but a lot has changed and a lot has been added... will that code ever become "my source" as opposed to "open source"? EDIT: BTW, I don't actually have a project in mind, this is just in general terms - so I wouldn't know the license. This question just crosses my mind from time to time when I see a project that I could improve on...
