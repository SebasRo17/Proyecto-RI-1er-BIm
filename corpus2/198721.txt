I need some advice on how to structure our projects in Git. We use Java and Maven is our build tool. Maven kinda assumes all of your projects have a common ancestor eventually. Maven can also be a real drama queen when things aren't setup _exactly_ the way the Apache foundation sets up their projects (anyone using the release plugin probably knows what I'm talking about). We want a top level parent pom that controls plugin versions and build configuration (repo config, what artifacts to build, naming conventions, plugin versions, etc). Maven would want all of our IT projects to be in subfolders of that main project. This implies one massive Git repo for the organization. This will make for a very noisy environment. If there are two teams working on unrelated projects, they will constantly have to pull in merges from the other team. Ideally I'd like to have one repo per project. But that sort of clashes with the extremely hierarchal model of Maven, which _demands_ sub-projects be sub-folders. I need some advice on how people have reconciled these two models... thank you!
