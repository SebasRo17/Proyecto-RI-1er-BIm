Is there any way to make Mathematica to show the legend labels like a real number rather than in fraction form? I read the `BarLegend` options, however they are just related to graphics so I just set the `PlotLegend` to `Automatic`. A sample of legend I have problem with is shown below:               MatrixPlot[Rm1,      ColorFunction -> ColorData["GrayTones"],      ImageSize -> 200,      PlotLegends -> Automatic]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xo5bZ.png)
