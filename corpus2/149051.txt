C# WinForms: A Combobox with some items in in.   A spread sheet with some items in it. Each row also has a check-box so users can select them. User picks an items in the combobox and clicks a Save button. It means associate that Combobox item to those selected items in the spreadsheet. **Q1:** What's a good structure I can use to keep track of which combobox item is associated with which items from the spreadsheet? NOTE: User can also Move up or Mode Down the items in the spreadsheet. So it gets a little tricky here, they might have associated some items, then they change the order or those items but we still need to know what items are selected for each combobox item **Q2:** What's a good approach to keep track of that?
