I am looking to reproduce the functionality of Photoshop's "Twirl" filter, which twists an image that originally looks like this (pulled from this page): ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Di28d.png) Into this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IBjxt.png) Ideally, I'd like it to approximate the way the Photoshop Twirl filter behaves as much as possible, or at least be flexible enough to be able to reproduce the way the filter works.
