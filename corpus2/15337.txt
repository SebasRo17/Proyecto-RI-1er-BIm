This is really driving me crazy. In one cell, I change `$Path` by removing from it un-needed paths that I do not want for the duration of a computation I will be doing. Immediatly after, in new cell, I type $Path and see it was changed ok. Now, I open a new cell, and do the same. I type $Path again, and now I see some of the Paths I removed are back again! Here is a screen shot from my notebook now ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Isyws.png) You can see the variable $Path now has changed, on its own. This is what I type               $Path =DeleteCases[$Path, "C:\\Users\\me"];     $Path =DeleteCases[$Path, "."];     $Path =DeleteCases[$Path,"C:\\Program Files\\Wolfram Research\\Mathematica\\8.0.4\\AddOns\\LegacyPackages"];     $Path =DeleteCases[$Path,"C:\\Users\\me\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mathematica\\Autoload"];     $Path =DeleteCases[$Path,"C:\\Users\\me\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mathematica\\Kernel"];     $Path =DeleteCases[$Path,"C:\\Users\\me\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mathematica\\Applications"];     $Path =DeleteCases[$Path,"C:\\ProgramData\\Mathematica\\Applications"];     $Path =DeleteCases[$Path,"C:\\ProgramData\\Mathematica\\Autoload"];     $Path =DeleteCases[$Path,"C:\\ProgramData\\Mathematica\\Kernel"];     $Path=DeleteCases[$Path,"C:\\Program Files\\Wolfram     Research\\Mathematica\\8.0.4\\Documentation\\English\\System"];      Then in new cell               $Path      Then in new cell the same. And now the $Path has been reset. I noticed this when I was calling Leonid function he posted, and in it, it uses `$Path`, but I noticed I was getting packages that should not show up since I changed the $Path before calling it. This is really strange. I am using V 8.0.4 on windows 7 **edit** Just installed version 9. Not able to reproduce this. Using the same PC, same notebook, same steps. So it looks like, whatever it was, is fixed in Version 9.
