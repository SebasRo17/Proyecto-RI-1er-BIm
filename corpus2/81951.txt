For example, I'm changing color pallettes throughout a site i'm coding and would love it if i could reference that color somehow instead of replacing the hex value for every item. I know the following doesn't work but i'd like something similar.               color1 = red;     color2 = blue;     color3 = green;          h1 {     color: color1;     background-color: color2;     }          h2 {     color: color2;     background-color: color3;     }
