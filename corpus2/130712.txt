I often represent my software development company at conferences and other events. However this time I got assigned to introduce school children (12-18) years to the job of a software developer. Now the problem is that our PR guys told me to use Facebook ("use the cool stuff kids know") to leave a good impression. Now I'm stumped and have no idea how to bridge the gap between presenting the role of a software developer, requirements engineers, and programming in general to Facebook. I intend to give a 5 minute talk and then let them "do something" that invovles Facebook. Has anyone got an idea how to do something like that? Is it possible to let them develop a simple facebook app?
