I've been doing a Requirements Analysis module in my university. We've covered all kinds of formal requirements stuff, like UML, Use Case Diagrams, Sequence Diagrams and Contracts. I have to ask- are any of these things of any value whatsoever in the real world? The only Use Case Diagrams I've ever seen could be summed up in a vastly more succint and understandable way in plain English- or even code in a reasonable language of your choice- and the same goes for the other things I've mentioned.
