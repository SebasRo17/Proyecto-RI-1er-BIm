I want to create a websocket server and I've found a great article here. However C# will output an exe file. I'd like to have it run on a linux box. What I want to do is to connect to the server, and when something happens on the filesystem to retrieve a message from the server (using the `FileSystemWatcher` on Windows or the `iNotify` daemon on linux) and the program will run the corresponding code. So, how can such daemon for linux (in C#) or any other way to achieve this?
