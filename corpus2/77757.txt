Technically, Is there a difference between these two words or can we use them interchangeably? Both of them more or less describe the logical sequence of steps that follow in solving a problem. ain't it? SO why do we actually use two such words if they are meant to talk of the same? Or, In case if they aren't synonymous words, What is it that differentiates them? In what contexts are we supposed to use the word pseudo code vs the word algorithm?
