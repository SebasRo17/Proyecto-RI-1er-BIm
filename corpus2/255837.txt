I struggle with this every time I work on a project. I am not entirely sure what the standard conventions are for creating view ids. I usually use something like               view_more_button      but then if we have, let's say, multiple dialogs with a view more button then I'll start doing               view_more_button_dialog1      and from there it just spirals downward. Any suggestions?
