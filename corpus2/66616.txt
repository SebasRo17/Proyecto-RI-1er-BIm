I'm building a fairly complex interpreted program in Python. I've been working on most of this code for other purposes for a few months, and therefore don't want my client to be able to simply copy and try to sell it, as I think it's worth a fair amount. The problem is that I need the script to run on a server that my client is paying for, so is there any way I can secure a particular folder on the machine from root access, or make it so only one particular use can access the directory? The OS is Ubuntu.
