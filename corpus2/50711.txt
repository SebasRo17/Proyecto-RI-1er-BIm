I'm looking for some videos on these subjects:   1. A movie/documentary detailing the origin, history, and current state of open source culture    2. A movie/documentary on how open source software actually gets developed. What are the technical workflows. How do people create projects, recruit contributors, build a community, assign roles, track issues, assimilate new comers ... etc etc. Could someone suggest a title?
