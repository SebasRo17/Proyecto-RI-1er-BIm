Suppose I've got this:               In[13]:= Expand[(a + b) (b + c) (c + a)]          Out[13]= a^2 b + a b^2 + a^2 c + 2 a b c + b^2 c + a c^2 + b c^2      And I want to collect only terms involving a^2. In other words, I want the following output:               a^2(b + c) + a b^2 + 2 a b c + b^2 c + a c^2 + b c^2      How can I do this? If I use the following:               Collect[%, a^2]      Then it simply groups terms into the highest power of a, even if the highest term is less than 2. So it results in this:               In[14]:= Collect[%, a^2]          Out[14]= b^2 c + b c^2 + a^2 (b + c) + a (b^2 + 2 b c + c^2)      Ideally, I would like to extend this further to collect all a^2, b^2, and c^2 in one expression. So that running my command would transform the original fully expanded expression into the following:               a^2(b + c) + b^2(a+c) + c^2(a+b) + 2 a b c      In a single command. It this possible?
