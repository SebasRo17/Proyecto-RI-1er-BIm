I have an xml file with song data from iTunes (https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1012958/iTunes%20Library.xml) and I'd like to import it to _Mathematica_ to do some statistics. I get an XMLObject like this:               XMLObject[       "Document"][{XMLObject["Declaration"]["Version" -> "1.0",         "Encoding" -> "UTF-8"],        XMLObject["Doctype"]["plist",         "Public" -> "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN",         "System" -> "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"]},       XMLElement[       "plist", {"version" -> "1.0"}, {XMLElement[         "dict", {}, {...}], {}, "Valid" -> True]      How can I convert it to a _Mathematica_ 10 dataset or table?
