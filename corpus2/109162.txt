I graduated not too long ago with a degree in computer science. I've been working for a software company for a couple of months, but the work that I'm doing doesn't seem to fall into any defined category (at least the categories that exist in my mind - developer, tester, project manager). My job will occasionally require me to do a bug fix in Java (5%), but the majority of it seems to consist of either querying a client's database and adding/editing/deleting information (60%), or troubleshooting and then giving the response, "You forgot to do such and such before you submitted the form, and that's why you got an error" (35%). My worry is that down the road if I try and apply to some other company for a more senior developer/tester/PM position, they'll look at my work experience and say, "You seemed to have dealt more with database management / technical support than the actual software development cycle". Is this a valid concern on my part? **EDIT** Since the consensus seems to be that it's low-end/support, I have another question. I've been here a relatively short amount of time, and I've had offers for interviews at a couple of other companies (residual contacts from posting my resume online) where I would be doing development (which is what I'd prefer to be doing). I took this position because they were the first to make an offer (the pay is pretty decent) and I'm hoping to go to graduate school in the next year or so, so I wanted to start saving money. Would it be worth it to pursue these other interview offers (who are going off my resume of me coming straight from university), and just act like these last couple of months didn't happen (resume wise).
