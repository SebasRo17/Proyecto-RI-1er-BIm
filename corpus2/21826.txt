In Mathematica 9.0.0, when to display the input form of two numbers, I come across maybe a puny problem. In order to focus on the problem, I will put up a simplified version.               In[1]:=InputForm[E]            InputForm[Pi]      and the output is               Out[2]//InputForm=         Pi      The input form of `E` is eaten by the `Pi` one. Why would this happen? And if I add a semicolon to the later one, the input form of `E` will show up. And what's more, if I enter `InputForm` and `StandardForm` consecutively like this               In[7]:=InputForm[E]            StandardForm[Pi]      I get               Out[8]//StandardForm=         \[Pi]                E      the `E` being placed in a separate cell without the `InputForm` label. IMO, the output is made in the wrong sequence. So my question is, what does `InputForm` really do? Why does it "eat" the previous output?
