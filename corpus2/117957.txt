On the matter of Recursion: When you create a recursive function, you create a call stack. Ok, no problem; However, a comment on this page (look for comments by "LKM") triggered my curiosity (and google was no help):   * What is a local stack?   * Why would it be faster than a call stack?   * How would you actually implement it (pseudo-code, js/php/ruby/python are ok)? Subsidiary question (might deserve another question, but I don't know on which (.*\\.)?stack.*\\.com to ask): In these conversations about programming, I often see the "recursion" theme and how bad/newbie programmers don't grok it. I'm self-taught, and I never understood what the big fuss is all about. I use recursion a lot in my everyday coding, both for solving problems and sometimes just because I think they are beautiful. But these articles make me feel like maybe there is something there I just don't see. So:   * What's all the fuss about recursion? What's there not to grok?
