I tried doing a Google search, as well as searching this Stack Exchange site but could not find a question relating directly to this. The PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code has lots of good style recommendations, however I don't think they mention anything about whether a space between a minus or negative sign (`-`) and a variable name would be more or less readable. ### Question It's a (very) minor issue, but which is considered more readable?   * `false_positive = -true_positive`   * `false_positive = - true_positive` ### Motivation I ask not to be trivial, but because in my past math courses I often find myself not noticing the negative sign in important equations, such as the equation for computing entropy: ![entropy formula](https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&chl=H%28X%29%20%3D%20-%20%5Cdisplaystyle%20%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En%20%7BP%28x_i%29%20%5Clog_b%20P%28x_i%29%7D) I often don't notice the `-` sign before the summation, so making it stand out would be desirable.
