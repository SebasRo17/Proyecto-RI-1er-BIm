After reading Tom DeMarco's Slack, I'm wondering how to factor slack into sprints. For those who haven't read the book, TDM describes 'slack' as providing time for innovation and other good things. Scrum leans towards eliminating slack and resisting change within the sprint. Allowing stories to be re-prioritised between sprints. I appreciate the purpose of a sprint, and am not trying to ask how to respond to change within them. My initial thought about adding slack to sprints would be to plan a sprint with 8/9 days of work for a two week sprint. If you're conscious of this decision, can still calculate your velocity accurately? Based on story points completed in your 8/9 day window (vs 10). Conversely, these are two competing ideas and don't belong together... ? gnat's focus factor link is interesting.
