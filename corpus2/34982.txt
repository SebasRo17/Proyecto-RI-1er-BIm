What Obj-C/C libraries have you used for manipulating git repos in your Mac apps? I am working on a Mac app that I would like to be able to clone and modify git repos. Using git directly is not an option as it is GPL and I'd like to sell my app commercially without opening the source. I've seen libgit2, which I could link, but I'm not sure how to do that properly, and it doesn't appear to implement any of the things necessary for pushing/pulling repos over the git protocol.
