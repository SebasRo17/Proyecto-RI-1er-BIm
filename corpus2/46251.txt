I wanted to compute an exact number for two probabilities that I am comparing. These are two normal distributions as: $$Normal(\mu = 5, \sigma = 4)$$ $$Normal(\mu = 5, \sigma = 5)$$ I decided to try to use mathematica and I inputed the following after I simplified a little bit: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/EkDXa.png) but when I press shit enter to compute, it doesn't actually compute it numerically for me. I was wondering if anyone knew why it wasn't computing it. (I tried wolfram first and it said it exceeded time to compute it)
