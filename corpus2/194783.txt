I had learned that following piece of code is bad because it is obstrusive javascript and mixes presentation with logic:               <a href="" onclick="archive()">archive</a>      The best practice was to add some sort of identifier to the link element and then bound an event to it on a separate file. Something among those lines               $("#archive").click(function() {         //do stuff     });      See: Why is using onclick() in html a bad practice How come now most Javascripts MVC frameworks like Backbone.js, Angular.js, etc now encourage pieces of code like this:               <a href="" ng-click="archive()">archive</a>       Taken from: http://angularjs.org/#todo-html Why is this now ok?
