How do you derive (or where can I find a derivation of) the equations to match the five parameters of a general Pearson distribution to a mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, and condition that the function integrate to one? I have been using the method described in the Mathematica documentation under "Examples" and then "Applications". It provides the equations but no derivation. The four equations for the moments are set up as:               eq[r_] := r*Subscript[b, 0]*Moment[r - 1] + (r + 1) Subscript[b, 1]*Moment[r]      + (r + 2) Subscript[b, 2]*Moment[r + 1] - Subscript[a, 1]*Moment[r + 1]      - Subscript[a, 0]*Moment[r]      and               meq = Table[MomentConvert[eq[r], CentralMoment], {r, 0, 3}] /.          {Moment[1] -> μ, CentralMoment[2] -> σ^2, CentralMoment[3] -> Sqrt[Subscript[β, 1]] σ^3,              CentralMoment[4] -> Subscript[β, 2] σ^4}      These set up four linear equations in five unknowns. I am interested in the equation added to fix the normalizing coefficient (so the distribution integrates to one):               meq = Join[meq, {Subscript[a, 0] + (12 μ Subscript[β, 1] +         2 μ (9 - 5 Subscript[β, 2]) + σ Sqrt[Subscript[β, 1]] (3 + Subscript[β, 2]))}];      The equations for the moments themselves are pretty easy to derive, but I have not figured out the fifth equation for normalization.
