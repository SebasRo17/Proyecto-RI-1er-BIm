I decided to do a mini-project by myself to help me understand a bit more about developing web applications before starting the new university semester. Using the Java SE and JEE/J2EE platforms. I will be creating a simple web application that will retrieve data from a database and display the data. I decided to use a Model-View-Controller type pattern and so far decided that the: Models: Will be Java objects which are persisted in the database using a framework. View: will only be the front end, probably written in HTML with some CSS. I have not (at a high level) decided how the controller should be implemented, I initially went along with the idea that I will use JDBC to query results from the database and display it to the front end but the use of frameworks should ease the process. I was told that there are some open source frame-works that help in making web application and a few I looked up were Spring and Hibernate. My question then is there a way of incorporating these frameworks to what I proposed and if so how can I learn about these frameworks in order to create a web application? Would appreciate advice and experiences about developing web-applications. This is something I have not done before so itâ€™s all a new and a learning process for me. In essence I want to create is a web-application using Java as the primary programming language in which database querying functionalities help in displaying outputs to the front end. **Edit:** Edited question to make it clearer for those who want to start similar type projects.
