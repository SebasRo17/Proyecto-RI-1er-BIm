I am working on a company's project alone at the moment, but the company is getting soon a junior developer whom I will be mentoring. Considering he will be learning a lot in first few days I am planning on using pair programming for first couple of weeks. I believe that doing pair programming would make daily standup a redundant practice. I definitely will keep the retrospective as well as tdd. I wanted to ask if you would suggest any other agile practices that would benefit our small team of two developers? What have worked for you?
