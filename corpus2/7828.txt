I want to plot series of slopes: x, 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, 6x... I'm trying to do this:               a = Range[10]; c = 0; Clear[b]     f := ToExpression[ToString[b] <> ToString[a[[c = c + 1]]]]      So everytime I input `f`, it gives me:               b1     b2     b3     b4     ...      Now I want to assign every bn to one of the plots:               b1=Plot[x,{x,1,10}]     b2=Plot[2x,{x,1,10}]     b3=Plot[3x,{x,1,10}]     b4=Plot[4x,{x,1,10}]     ...      I've tried to do this:               f=Plot[x,{x,1,10}]      But It will only switch the variable from the first fuction to the Plot function. How can I do to the `f`become `b1` first and then the `b1` be assigned to the Plot function? I guess it has something to do with evaluation control, something like that. NOTE:. The ? in the title means that I'm not very sure If it's about evaluation control.
