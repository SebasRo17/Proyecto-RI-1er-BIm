I am trying to use NotebookWrite to paste a plot into another notebook. The code looks something like: `ptemp = Show[Plot[x^2,{x,-2,2}],Plot[x^3,{x,-2,2}]]; nb = CreateDocument[]; NotebookWrite[nb,ptemp];` But when I run the code I get an error message: `An unknown box name (Graphics) was sent as the BoxForm for the expression.` Is there any way to use NotebookWrite to insert a graphic? Does there exist any sort of wrapper for Graphics that would make it NotebookWrite-able?
