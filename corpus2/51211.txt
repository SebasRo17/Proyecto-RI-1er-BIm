I have a irregularly placed measurement data. I bring here a small example. I am sorry for that. > mdata = {{20., 1.6, 0.218084}, {4.02807, 1.71068, 0.227565}, {19., 1.6, > 0.240074}, {18.8333, 1.60667, 0.278783}, {17.5, 1.62, 0.406884}, {21.9127, > 1.72134, 0.427501}, {16.89, 1.61925, 0.438591}, {7.22189, 1.70931, > 0.455631}, {16.1132, 1.62516, 0.515403}, {8.51871, 1.68045, 0.524135}, > {8.4419, 1.69226, 0.531889}, {9.6625, 1.68612, 0.601701}, {14.1699, 1.63774, > 0.639421}, {14.5437, 1.63975, 0.65735}, {13.5583, 1.64633, 0.700959}, > {11.9613, 1.66151, 0.704242}, {11.276, 1.67761, 0.706502}, {12.9152, > 1.65519, 0.718618}, {12.3724, 1.66034, 0.719962}, {12.2406, 1.66432, > 0.724829}, {12.9876, 1.6586, 0.734248}, {13.1918, 1.65804, 0.750541}, > {13.8071, 1.6563, 0.754093}, {13.1619, 1.66528, 0.759312}, {13.111, 1.66365, > 0.764214}, {13.2852, 1.67032, 0.787843}, {14.4106, 1.6628, 0.805543}, > {22.6391, 1.68181, 0.810923}, {13.9972, 1.7042, 0.817875}, {14.8398, > 1.66263, 0.818304}, {22.2249, 1.68764, 0.824216}, {19.9883, 1.70148, > 0.827452}, {16.1394, 1.66178, 0.840096}, {15.3544, 1.67243, 0.873424}, > {15.6949, 1.67557, 0.903093}};               ListContourPlot[mdata, Mesh -> All]      ![problematic listContourPlot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gWIMp.png) So the data is not so bad, but the _traingulation(?)_ of the mesh looks ugly. It seems to be issue with the aspect ration of the data as the fallowing plot looks much better:               ListContourPlot[{1, 100, 1} (# - {0, 1.6, 0}) & /@ mdata, Mesh -> All]      ![hack1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/flu76.png) The downside of this trick is, that now I will have to implement the y axes label override in order to show the correct numbers. Is there a smarter workaround? Weakly related is Smoothing ListContourPlot contours but it is about data smoothing. I want to show the actual data. I have the same issue with both _Mathematica_ 8&9. **EDIT** Here is my attempt using overriding the tick labels.               rescaleParams = {1, 100, 1};     dataRanges = {Min@#, Max@#} & /@ (Transpose[mdata][[{1, 2}]]);     tickF[rescaleParam_, min_, max_] := {rescaleParam #, N@#} & /@         FindDivisions[{min, max}, 5];     ListContourPlot[rescaleParams # & /@ mdata, Mesh -> All,       FrameTicks ->        MapThread[        tickF, {rescaleParams[[{1, 2}]], dataRanges[[;; , 1]],          dataRanges[[;; , 2]]}]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vZD3z.png) As I was afraid, it is messy. It is also problematic in the case I want to combine it with some other plots using `Show`. If you made this override method more elegant or at least improve the rounding of the tick labels, it would be appreciated as well.
