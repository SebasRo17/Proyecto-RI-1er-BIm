My requirement is to store a large number of files within a single file.The files stored could be anything like images, videos or simple text files as well. I want some ideas to implement the same. I am thinking of implementing a file system within a file, but am not sure if its a good idea. Adding in more details as requested : Platform to be developed on is Android. The idea initially was to store all the data using sqlite and provide encryption on it, but I think it will eventually lead to a slow down as the file size increases. The file is going to increase in size with time. The main area of concern here is the access time. Also I want to provide encryption for this single file. Any suggestions are welcome.
