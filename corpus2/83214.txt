I'm involved in teaching mathematics to classes with requirements such as AS and A level Mathematics specification. Class books normally provide examples of computer software applied to mathematics tasks, but they are normally based on software applications like mathlab, mathematica or derive. Even when a _real_ programming language is used, it is normally old fashoned language like Pascal. And this is really sad in my opinion. Because, Haskell is famous for his feeling with mathematics, and because I'm interested in it as well, I'd like to ask whether Haskell is a good choice as extension exercise method for students of a first year university class. Typical subjects are functions, caclulus, limits, but also linear algebra for example. I've intermediate knowledge experience in programming (c#, ruby, powershell, javascript, tex) and also have already approached functional programming with XSLT. Answers will be upvoted responsibly. Verbose answers including also some basic examples of Haskell code applied to mathematics, such as linear algebra (e.g. vectorial space), polynomials, solving linear equations are much appreciated and targeted as the wanted one.
