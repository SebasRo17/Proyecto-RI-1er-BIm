I am looking for a software platform/programming framework which can do the following:   * INPUT: a user inputs some text   * PROCESS/REFERENCE DATA: the user is then asked to answer a list some questions regarding the INPUT and attribute the answers either to the whole INPUT or to some parts of the INPUT   * OUTPUT: the list of answers attributed to the original INPUT Some clarifications:   * re: REFERENCE DATA: the list of questions should allow for a sub/follow-up question   * re: PROCESS: the answering process should be as flexible as possible (user should be able to skip questions, provide his or her own answers, etc)   * this is NOT meant to be an automatic/machine learning tool - the user (the human) will be classifying the INPUT himself/herself based on the REFERENCE DATA
