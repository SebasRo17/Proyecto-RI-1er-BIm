To create a means of displaying information about the distribution of primary care providers, the population density and the average yearly Medicare expenditure per enrollee for each state, I would like to create a US map with the state boundaries indicated, and then display a tool tip box containing the data for that state when the cursor hovers over that state. `CountryData["UnitedStates"]` does not have a map that includes the state boundaries. In addition, I would like to colorize the states to indicate the value of a given parameter for that state, such as age-adjusted average yearly cost per Medicare Enrollee, by reference to a color scale. I have not been able to find the _Mathematica 9_ code for an interactive US map in the Mathematica demonstrations and I am interested in suggestions or working code that I could use. My level of proficiency with _Mathematica 9_ is somewhere between beginner and intermediate, so I appreciate the details that might not be necessary for explaining the solution to an experienced user.
