Assuming each odd line is input I would like the even lines to be the output of the following lines. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WZx4t.png) In the above the `Graphics` are inside `Hold`/`HoldForm` therefore IMO it doesn't make sense to have Mathematica try and render such expressions. For example `Hold[Graphics[{Red, Circle[]}]]` throws an error because built in colors don't get replaced. How might I prevent `Graphics` from being rendered and instead print the Graphics code? The following code works at reassigning Graphics inside Hold/HoldForm, but it prints something like `Graphics[{Circle[{0, 0}]}]` without the `HoldForm`/`Hold`.               Unprotect[Graphics]     Graphics /: HoldForm[Graphics[x___]] := (        InputForm[Graphics[x]]        );     Graphics /: Hold[Graphics[x___]] := (        InputForm[Graphics[x]]        );      Ideally the code should be generalize to work with irregular constructs like `HoldForm["a",Graphics[{Circle[{0, 0}]}]]`. More importantly how might you insure `HoldComplete` doesn't render Graphics either. As rm-rf pointed out the Villegasâ€“Gayley trick will likely be needed. * * * Simplifying John Fultz's answer slightly, you get the following:               Map[      (        Unprotect[#];        # /: MakeBoxes[#[expr_], fmt : StandardForm | TraditionalForm] :=          Block[{Graphics, Graphics3D},          RowBox[{ToString[#], "[", MakeBoxes[expr, fmt], "]"}]          ];        Protect[#]        ) &, {Hold, HoldForm, HoldComplete}      ]
