I noticed that if I open a `.m` file in Mathematica and click on the `Run Package` button, all the `Set` definitions will be printed as output if they are not ended in `;`. The same for `function::usage` definitions. This is probably harmless, but I am wondering if there is a guidance on weather semicolons should be appended at the end of `Set` or `SetDelayed` definitions. Looking into the Mathematica libraries source code, I can see both approaches - some `Module` functions have `;` at the end, others do not.
