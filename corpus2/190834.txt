I wanted to perform some actions in my Java program whenever a particular interface comes up (network interface ppp0 e.g.). However I figured out it was way too clumsy to keep polling the interface to verify its status. After finding out `if-up.local` file in Linux, now I can run a bash script whenever the interface comes up. Works fine, however considering my running Java program, how can I make this script interact with my Java code? I am considering the following options:   1. Write a listening socket and from this script send message to this Java socket.   2. Invoke a C program, and through JNI run my java code. I am looking for intuitive and less resource intensive approach.
