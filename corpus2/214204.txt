I was just experimenting with the **Chain of responsibility** pattern, implementing my own version. I'm currently reading Design Patterns, but I'm not really sure whether DP tells to stop your forwarding of requests when a single action is accomplished, or just continuing to the end of the chain. What I'm interested in is how this feature of the COR pattern is managed in most of cases. In my example below, I let the forwarding continuing to the end of my chain. I don't think you need any source, but you can anyway find it here. If **I missed some DP paragraphs** telling about this, please provide its location!
