If the boolean operators &&, || are implemented as infix methods, then isn't short-circuit evaluation just a consequence of being implemented using call- by-name semantics, since, for example, the && method wouldn't then evaluate the second arg in any case if the first is false. I'm just wondering because they are generally treated as separate topics (e.g in the Scala intro course I'm taking - https://class.coursera.org/progfun-003/lecture/5 ) but short-circuit evaluation seems to just be a consequence of call-by-name.
