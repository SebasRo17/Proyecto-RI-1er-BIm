I often see the following in HTML documents               <link rel="self" href="http://example.com/something">      or like this in JSON                link: {          rel="self",          href="http://example.com/something"      }      or in XML                <atom:link rel="self" href="http://example.com/something" />      So I had some questions:   1. Why include this link? What advantage does it bring? (Please tell me there is a reason to it and its not just a "good practice" talisman)   2. How should I exploit this link in my clients? What are the use case for this link?   3. When _shouldn't_ I use this link? When is it pointless to include it?
