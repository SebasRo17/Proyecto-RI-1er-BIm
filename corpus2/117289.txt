I have read that the Model is responsible for maintaining state among HTTP requests, for example in this article: > The Model is responsible for maintaining state between HTTP requests. > > Basically any data whether on a database, in a file, stored in the Session, > or cached inside APC must be preserved between requests and thus forms part > of the state of the application at the time the last request was completed. > So always remember that the Model is not just the database. Even the data > you get from web services can be expressed as a Model! Yes, even Atom feeds! > Frameworks which rattle off introductions to the Model, almost never explain > this upfront which only exacerbates misunderstandings. When we use some implicit Session objects (say in PHP, JSP etc.,) does it mean that this Session is a Model object?
