I have to solve a transcendental equation for a parameter, say $\beta$. Now, the $\beta$ has a range from $ik$ to $k$ where $i$ is the usual imaginary root $\sqrt{-1}$ and $k$ is a real number. Problem is, the transcendental equation has multiple solutions, and so I cannot guess what will be the proper choice for the initial value of $\beta$ in `FindRoot`. I could do it if $\beta$ ranges from $p$ to $q$ where $p$ and $q$ are reals by plotting the transcendental equation's lhs and rhs. However, I don't know how to plot complex ranges. Is there any way to guess the initial values?
