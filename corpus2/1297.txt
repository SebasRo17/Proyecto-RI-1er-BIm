I'm working with a large number of series of different experiments, where there exist a lot of experiments where there are no entries. I now want to draw a sample where there should exist at least 200 adjacent values of data with less than 100 entries of null (A 200 day period of complete data). I started to do it with a loop, checking for 0-200, 1-200 for each dataset which takes ages... Should I use `Row / Scan/ Reap/ Sow`? I'd appreciate a help and guidance on possible functions I can use.
