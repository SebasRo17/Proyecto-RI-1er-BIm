I am working on a CMS that is starting to evolve a bit. We started off with content that had the following priorities ( columnn in the db on the content table): HIGH MED LOW. Data was fetched by priority HIGH being on top etc. Now after a few months a need has risen to have sub priorities: HIGH [ high, med , low ], MED [high, med, low ] etc. I have a test branch with a sub-priority column in the db. So fetch by priority now brings back HIGH(high) HIGH(med) HIGH(low) first. Wondering is there a better way to do this that I not seeing. There is a rails app.
