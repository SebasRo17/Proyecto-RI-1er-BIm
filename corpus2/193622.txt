I have no desire to have a personal Facebook account, I do have one but it has been deactivated for awhile. A client of mine would like me to port over a few web apps to Facebook that are hosted on his domain, and it looks like I am unable to with my business account which makes absolutely no sense to me seeing as it is for a software development company that I own and operate. If I were to temporarily activate my personal Facebook account to create a few apps, will they still be available in the marketplace, I believe it's called "App Central", if I then later deactivate the account used to create them?
