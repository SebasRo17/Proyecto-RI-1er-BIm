Often when I construct some cool `Manipulate[]` function, I would like to share it with others--non-Mathematica users. Some software, notably Cinderella, supports exporting some dynamic calculations to a Java applet. I can see why this would be very difficult to achieve with Mathematica, for it would require exporting all the under-the-hood calculations to Java. Nevertheless, how do you all share dynamic results from Mathematica to others on the web? Often I resort to `Export["filename.gif", {img1, img2, ...}, "GIF"]` to share animations. What better alternatives are available?
