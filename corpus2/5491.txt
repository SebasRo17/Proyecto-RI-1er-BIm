I am wondering and tried to plot a graph having labeling specified on top of the graphic. I kind of know a brute force method to accomplish it, but the results will not even look close to clean looking. Is there a more programmatic way or smoother way to accomplish getting a plot with labeling on it as such: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/f1aym.png) > Instead though, I will like to have the $\mu = \frac{(2n+1)\pi}{2L}$ to be > shifted higher as so in the plot below. I guess, could it be made to easily > be able to adjust coordinates (placement's) or marker on top of the plot. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BWGuE.png)
