One of the criteria of the Joel Test is daily builds. The idea is that if the build is broken, whoever broke it is around to fix it up. If the build cannot be fixed, everyone will have to check out an old version and work on that. I can understand how this can be pretty bad on centralised version control where it is important to avoid merging and branching as much as possible, but this only sounds like a minor nuisance for distributed version control. Do you agree with this? Are there other reasons why daily builds are important?
