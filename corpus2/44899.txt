I have the following simple code               finalList = {};     For[i = 1, i <= myN - 3, i++,      For[j = i + 1, j <= myN - 2, j++,       For[k = j + 1, k <= myN - 1, k++,        l = RandomInteger[{k + 1, myN}];        AppendTo[finalList, {i, j, k, l}];        ]       ]      ] // Timing      for some value of myN I obtain the following execution times               30 0.056     40 0.356     50 1.436     60 4.296     70 12.083     80 43.012     90 116.903      that grow much faster than N^3 (it's about N^6 for the first point and it is increasing for the last two points), and I cannot understand why. Any insight of why this happens?
