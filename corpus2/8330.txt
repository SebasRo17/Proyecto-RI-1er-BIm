According to WRI tech support: _Combinatorica functionality is not technically deprecated, though it is our hope that future versions of Mathematica will subsume it entirely by incorporating its functionality with the built-in Graphs & Networks functionality._ Leaving aside that this seems to conflict with MMA's documentation, eg:               Block[{$ContextPath}, Needs["Combinatorica`"]]      warns: _General::compat: Combinatorica Graph and Permutations functionality has been superseded by preloaded functionality. The package now being loaded may conflict with this. Please see the Compatibility Guide for details._ In the meantime, in order to use Combinatorica functionality like TransitiveClosure on built in Graphs, it's necessary to take a detour through Combinatorica, eg:               AdjacencyGraph[#, VertexLabels -> "Name"] &@      Combinatorica`ToAdjacencyMatrix@       Combinatorica`RemoveSelfLoops@        Combinatorica`TransitiveClosure@         Combinatorica`FromAdjacencyMatrix@          Normal@AdjacencyMatrix@Graph[{"E0" -> "T0", "T0" -> "E1"}]      This yields (sorry for truncation): ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fcBLA.jpg) How to recover the built in Graph's vertex names? (These are extracted from XML metadata and so it's not so convenient to project them to positional indices)
