I used to do a lot of programming in R and recently switched to _Mathematica_. One thing that bothers me is that I haven't found a way to save variables, their values and definition! Let's look at an example:               idx = Partition[RandomSample[Range[20], 20], 3];     Table[Subscript[vars, idx[[i]]] = Total[idx[[i]]], {i, 1,      Length[idx]}];     Subscript[vars,{9,15,8}]     (*32*)      Is there a way to save the variable names as well as the corresponding values. And how would I read them into a new file? So that in a new file I can access with `Subscript[vars,{9,15,8}]` the value. I tried it with `Table[...]>>values.mx` and read it in with `values=<<values.mx` but that only gives me the values, whereas I also need the definitions. I also tried:               DumpSave["values.mx",       Table[Subscript[vars, idx[[i]]] = Total[idx[[i]]], {i, 1, Length[idx]}]]      but got an error > DumpSave::bsnosym: "Table[..] is not defined as a symbol or a context"
