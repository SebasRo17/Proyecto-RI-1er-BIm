Journals are very strict and some of them require special formats. They suggest the .tiff or .jpg format for graphics with many colors. I have problem how to export, for example, this figure consists of 4 smaller but to have optimized quality (Labels to be with correct size of fonts, viewable) and not with large file size.               plot1 = Plot3D[Sin[4 x]*Cos[4 y], {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2},      PlotLabel -> "number 1, gamma, s=1,q=2", AxesLabel -> {x, y},      ColorFunction -> "NeonColors"];          plot2 = Plot3D[Sin[3 x]*Cos[4 y], {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2},      PlotLabel -> "number 1, gamma, s=2,q=2", AxesLabel -> {x, y},      ColorFunction -> "NeonColors"];          plot3 = Plot3D[Sin[2 x]*Cos[4 y], {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2},      PlotLabel -> "number 1, gamma, s=3,q=2", AxesLabel -> {x, y},      ColorFunction -> "NeonColors"];          plot4 = Plot3D[Sin[1 x]*Cos[4 y], {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2},      PlotLabel -> "number 1, gamma, s=4,q=2", AxesLabel -> {x, y},      ColorFunction -> "NeonColors"];          GraphicsGrid[{{plot1, plot2}, {plot3, plot4}}, Frame -> True]
