Standard `FractionBox` syntax allows only 2 arguments and creates 2-part fraction for numerator and denominator. Is it possible to draw similar construction, but with more than 2 parts? Some sort of column with separators only between inner parts? The following code               Column[{"x", 200, Integrate[Sin[x^2], x]}, Alignment -> Center, Dividers -> Center]      draws best what I found but it does dividers of similar length in entire column. I would like dividers to accommodate two adjacent parts only.
