I've started using Emacs, and love it. Naturally, I'm thinking about ways of extending it. I' m particularly fascinated by the thought of creating browser based GUIs for some stuff I would otherwise do in emacs, particularly reviewing fairly static data. An example: I have a bunch of txt files (created and edited in Emacs) containing quotes and passages from my favorite books. It would be cool to present them in a more visually striking/engaging manner. For example with unique color schemes and typefaces for different authors, and several columns of text to use more screen real estate (like in Stanza, the .epub reader). Are there simpler ways of rendering HTML derived from plain text files that are open in Emacs than browsers?
