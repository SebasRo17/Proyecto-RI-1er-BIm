In general, what are the advantages of using Grid versus a combination of Column and Row? Is Grid better in some situations but not others? For example, is there any reason why one would do this:               Grid[{{"Some text I want above a formula:"},           {Integrate[f[x], x]}}]      versus this:               Column[{Row[{"Some text I want above a formula:"}],              Row[{Integrate[f[x], x]}]}]
