I'm trying to get LinkSnooper up and working on a Windows 7 machine to monitor the interaction between the Mathematica front end and MathLink. I'm facing great troubles following the instructions here. Namely, my arguments to MLOpen are as follows:               -LinkMode Launch -LinkName "'C:/Program Files/Wolfram Research/Mathematica/9.0/SystemFiles/Java/Windows-x86-64/javaw' -classpath \"C:/Program Files/Wolfram Research/Mathematica/9.0/SystemFiles/Links/JLink/JLink.jar\" com.wolfram.jlink.util.LinkSnooper -kernelname 'C:/Program Files/Wolfram Research/Mathematica/9.0/mathkernel.exe'"      and when loading the kernel, a file system browser pops up and asks me to select a MathLink program to run. Anyone got this working on a windows machine and perhaps have some suggestions?
