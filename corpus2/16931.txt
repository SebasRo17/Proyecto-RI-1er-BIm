Can't regain the data after Export. Create an array of sampled amplitude values:   2\. Visualize as sound   3\. Save it   4\. Get it back   5\. ???               sound = RandomReal[1, {500}];       ListPlay[sound]       Export["test.txt", sound];       in=Import["test.txt"]       ListPlay[in]      A second example.   Take data from a WAV sound,   Export it,   reImport it,   play it.               tubadat = ExampleData[{"Sound", "Tuba"}, "Data"];       Export["TubaDat.dat", tubadat];       in = Import["TubaDat.dat"];       ListPlay[in]        It is not the original sound.
