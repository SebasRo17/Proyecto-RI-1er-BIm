I think this question has already been asked many times, but I can't find any of them. I have a game project (I'm using Marmalade),and a few trusted developers, but I want to invite more. For adding some functionality, for writing scripts and so on. The question is - how can I don't give them the whole source code (only compiled part of it maybe), and/or give them limited rights to the project for doing them their work, but dont have the opportunity to steal the code?
