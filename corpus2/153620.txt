We are working with a group of developers on a project. The project is still in progress (not completed) and these developers charge us for time spent on fixing bugs on codes that were not written valid in the first place. I understand that we should pay for changes/new requests if any, but not bugs fixes for a work in progress. We also understand that once the assignment is being deployed to the live site, we may be liable for bugs fixes that may arise after a support period is being exhausted. The question now is, is it appropriate for such charges to be levied upon us while the project is still in progress?
