Is there any way to import only the thumbnail of an image instead of the full image? I frequently work with lots of images and it would be nice if the contents of a directory could be quickly displayed as small images, without loading the full image. On my machine (2 x 2.4Ghz, 2GB ram, Win7, _Mathematica_ 8), loading 12 images (PNG, 1200x900, 45KB each) takes ~1.4 sec, which is a bit too much for delay.
