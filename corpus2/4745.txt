I've been trying to export a Plot3D into an X3D (JVX, VRML) file using the Mathematica's Export function. The problem is that when the PlotRange is large compared to the other two dimensions the output is essentially stretched into a thin line. Is there a way to maintain the original scaling? Try the following:               Export["file.x3d", Plot3D[x^2+y^2,{x,-10,10},{y,-10,10}]];      The `VerticalAxis` option does not seem to help... Thanks.
