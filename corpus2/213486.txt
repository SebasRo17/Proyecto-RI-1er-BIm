Lately, I've been noticing that a lot of software, be it a website, a client application, or a video game, often write a representation of quantity as follows: "1 result(s)". Now, I can understand why they would do that 20 years ago. But these days, shouldn't we have enough processing power and memory to be able to say "1 result" and "2 results"? Is there some sort of special reason why it's still done this way? Now before you tell me to Google it, I would. But the thing is, I have no idea what search terms to use. So even some suggested search terms would be welcome.
