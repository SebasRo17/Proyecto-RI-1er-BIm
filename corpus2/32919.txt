I often seek to display two graphs, side by side, with a common label over them. There is no option for adding a label to `GraphicsRow`, which means, I think, that I need to use `Grid` or `GraphicsGrid` and include a row on top that has `SpanFromLeft` set to allow a graphically defined line of text occupy the entire row. It seems like a lot of work to do something simple. Is there a better solution?
