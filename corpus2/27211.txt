I am sure that this is not the most elegant code you will have seen, but I am trying to loop through an expression to see if `FultonHarrisn]` produces any outputs that are equal to a prime squared. My function `FultonHarris` is defined as follows:               FultonHarris[n_] := Product[(Sum[a[k], {k, i, j - 1}] + j - i)/(j - i), {j, 1, n}, {i, 1,     j - 1}]      and my for loop runs as follows, looping through `n` from `3` to `9`, and `j` from `1` to `n`, and `i` from `1` to `j-1`:               numPoints = 10; For[n = 3, n < 10, n++,      For[j = 1, j <= n, j++,       For[i = 1, i < j, i++,          a[i] := x; a[j] := y;  a[k_] /; k != {i, j} := 0;          dd[x_, y_, p_] := FultonHarris[n] - p^2;         FindInstance[         dd[xx, yy, pp] == 0 && xx > 0 && yy > 0 && PrimeQ[pp], {xx, yy,           pp}, Integers, numPoints]        ]       ]      ]      However, when I run this, it doesn't return anything, not even empty braces. Do I need to put a `Print` statement in there?
