**Edit** : Some additional viewpoints were included to make it easier to test. Here's code for an alternative function, the graph of which is a bit less symmetric. Feel free to use either code set:               f = ArcCoth; Manipulate[      Plot3D[Abs[f[x + I y]], {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2},        RegionFunction -> Function[{x, y, z}, x^2 + y^2 <= 4],            MeshFunctions ->         Function @@@ {{{x, y, z}, Re[f[x + I y]]}, {{x, y, z},            Im[f[x + I y]]}}, MeshStyle -> {Orange, Green},        BoxRatios -> {1, 1, 1},        ViewPoint -> Dynamic[vp]], {{vp, {5, 8, 4}, "viewpoint"}, {        {5, 8, 4} -> "mathematicians' default",        {1.3, -2.4, 2} -> "Mathematica's default",        {0, -2, 0} -> "in front",        {0, -2, 2} -> "in front and up",        {0, -2, -2} -> "in front and down",        {-2, -2, 0} -> "left-hand corner",        {2, -2, 0} -> "right-hand corner",        {0, 0, 2} -> "directly above",        {0, -Infinity, 0} -> "xz from y at -\[Infinity]",        {0, 0, Infinity} -> "xz from z at \[Infinity]"        },       ControlType -> PopupMenu}]      * * * It's easy to place preset `ViewPoint`s in a `PopupMenu` in order to switch among them. But if I manually rotate the graphics object, the program ceases to respond to changes in the `PopupMenu` selection. Is there a way to have both functionalities?: (1) the `PopupMenu` and (2) manual rotation. If the answer is no, is there at least a way to turn off manual rotation? Below is a simplified version of the code.               Manipulate[      Plot3D[{x^2 + y^2, -x^2 - y^2}, {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2},        RegionFunction -> Function[{x, y, z}, x^2 + y^2 <= 4],        BoxRatios -> {1, 1, 1}, ViewPoint -> Dynamic@vp],       Control[{{vp, {5, 8, 4}, "viewpoint"}, {         {5, 8, 4} -> "mathematicians' default",         {1.3, -2.4, 2} -> "Mathematica's default",         {0, -2, 0} -> "in front",         {0, -2, 2} -> "in front and up",         {0, -2, -2} -> "in front and down",         {-2, -2, 0} -> "left-hand corner",         {2, -2, 0} -> "right-hand corner",         {0, 0, 2} -> "directly above",         {0, -Infinity, 0} -> "xz from y at -\[Infinity]",         {0, 0, Infinity} -> "xz from z at \[Infinity]"         },        ControlType -> PopupMenu}]]      ![viewepoints](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9fViz.png)
