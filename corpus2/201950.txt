I mistakenly posted this to stackoverflow and now posting here based on a suggestion in on that site ... This is a very high level conceptual question. Say in a software application I have 4 different actions, for example: Upload, Share, Comment, and like And I want to give achievement badges to users like:   * Rookie - Upload your first 5 files    * Upload Junkie - Upload 20 files in 1 day    * Night Crawler - Upload a file after midnight    * Share-a-holic - Share 10 different files    * Likes-everything - Like 20 different files you get the idea. What is he best way to check and see if a user has achieved a particular achievement without having to compile the logic for achievement into my code? And .. - Retain the ability to Add new achievements post compile (xml or db) - Achievements must track specific actions, number of times, and additional criteria (like time of day) - Detection should be near real-time so the user notified almost instantly when an achievement is completed My biggest questions is, how do I detect these achievements being achieved? Do I: 1) Check after every action to see if ... (Most real time) 2) Have another program check the DB at all times against a set of rules? (Easiest) Is there another paradigm that I'm missing? I feel there definitely is because in many games (like jetpack for iOS for example), I'm notified of the achievement I have unlocked in the instant in which I unlock it which I found pretty impressive. Thank you
