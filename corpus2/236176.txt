I was having a conversation with a colleague and although my opinion makes sense to me, I wasn't able to back it up. I'm in the process of creating an API that will be hit hundreds of thousands of times per day. It's fairly simple, and will just be doing some inserts into a relational database. There are essentially 3 functions I would need to create. The question is, what would have better performance, creating one API with different controllers (using .NET Web API or NodeJS something like that) or 3 different API's. My thought is that, for example with the .NET Web API, no matter whether there are 1 or 3 they are all being hosted, and using the same resources. His thought was that having 3 API's would be 3 times faster because it would have 3 times the resources. I simply didn't have the proof to disprove that.
