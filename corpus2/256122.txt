http://www.oodesign.com/command-pattern.html In reading through a tutorial about the command pattern, I came across a UML diagram that seems to omit some relationships. For the following diagram, the client instantiates a stock trade, an agent, and buy and sell stock orders. Why is it that the author omits the relationship arrow to the agent class? Why is the dashed line for <> used in place of a solid arrow like the one from Client to StockTrade? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9clLI.gif) I also compared the above diagram with the one below, which leaves out the Invoker/Agent class entirely and also uses the class CallbackTwo to aggregate Receivers. The C# implementation has an invoker class, although the implementations in other languages don't. Does this mean the invoker relationship is implicit? http://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/command http://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/command/c-sharp-dot-net ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GljS8.png)
