I was thinking about this for quite some time. Is function memoization really only for primitives? I currently have this piece of code:               Public Shared Function Mize(Of TArg1 As Structure, TResult)(ByVal input_f As System.Func(Of TArg1, TResult)) As System.Func(Of TArg1, TResult)         Dim map = New System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary(Of TArg1, TResult)         Return Function(arg1 As TArg1)                    If map.ContainsKey(arg1) Then Return map.Item(arg1)                    Dim result = input_f(arg1)                    map.Add(arg1, result)                    Return result                End Function     End Function      And I'm wondering should i upgrade TArg1 such that it could accept any arbitrary class?
