I have currently reading Grails and I love it. In order to get hands on experience with Grails I decided to create a web application for some Management System. Ya as you can guess there are plenty of entities that goes into the domain model for my web application. Any how as a novice in Web development, I just thought of creating a homepage first of all. Now here comes the problem, I sat for an hour and drawn my domain model(for my homepage alone!). After that I had a doubt that whether we have to enter all the entities(i.e my whole web app entities like user, profile, tasks and their relationships etc) in Domain model first and then start coding or draw domain models for each page in our web app and at last connect all the domain models? Well, what I do is wrong? This is my first project that ever started in my life. Thanks for your advices.
