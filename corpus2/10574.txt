I'm a .NET developer, but I've never been to a .NET user group meeting or anything like that. I might have the opportunity soon to start attending one, but I'm wondering. What happens at user groups? I'm not looking necessarily for info specifically about .NET ones, but they are preferred. What do you get out of it _excluding_ the opportunity for networking?
