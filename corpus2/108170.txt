Suppose a company wants to encourage employees to publish articles, blogposts, participate in community discussions. Let us not consider the pure-rhetorical ways of encouragement ("Guys, you'll be so respected!"). What could be a sensible strategy to encourage publications by money? Many things come to mind, such as "pay for word count", "pay for audience size", "pay for view count", "pay for number of reactions or citations of the publication" etc, but most of them fall apart as unfair in trivial corner cases.
