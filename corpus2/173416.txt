I have files that I want to make available in an variety of formats:   * HTML   * PDF   * EPUB   * Plain Text (maybe) Most of the files will be _sourced_ in doc, docx, or rtf format, so that needs to be considered. So I need some kind of format that converts well from docx, doc, and rtf and has plenty of libraries for converting into PDF, EPUB, HTML etc. Ideally libraries in Python, but Java is also okay.
