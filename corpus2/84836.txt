I am a recent college graduate. I recently interviewed for a Software Developer position. I really like the environment. I got offers from other places but this place just feels really comfortable for me, I am familiar with the frameworks that they are using. Recently, recruiter told me that the team might think that I am a little under qualified. They want someone with a 1-2 year experience now. They are interviewing others with that experience. But I really want this job. I emailed the recruiter that I am willing to do what ever it takes to get this job. I don't mind spending lots of extra time to increase the pace of my learning. I really like that environment and that position. But I think he is out of town. Is it Ok email the manager and tell them about how I feel. I will be willing to do what ever it takes to make this work. I.E take couple of thousand less, or spend extra time. Like I said, I got offers from other places but this place jut feels right and comfortable for me. They got everything I need.
