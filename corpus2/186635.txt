Basically a programmer that comes in during the testing phase of a project and once a tester finds a bug, tracks down the cause. I enjoy this investigative process and am generally able to track down the cause of obscure bugs even in code that I have never worked on. I've done something like this internally in companies I've worked for, but I wonder if this is something people do on an independent contractor basis?
