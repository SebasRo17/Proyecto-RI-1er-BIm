I need Dirac Matrix in my work. They consists of PauliMatrix and ZeroMatrix, which is:               ZeroMatrix:=IdentityMatrix[2]-IdentityMatrix[2]      I define Dirac Matrix as:               gamma = ({{PauliMatrix[0], ZeroMatrix}, {ZeroMatrix, -PauliMatrix[0]}}) // MatrixForm;      I got such result: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Wvc1i.gif) But I need something else: I need a monolithic table, does not consist of individual blocks. How can I get it? (I need something universal, because I need to use it to construct 4 gamma matrices and spinors).
