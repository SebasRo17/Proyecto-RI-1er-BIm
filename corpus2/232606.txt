(I'm talking about HTML / CSS code (not programming languages) but I think we also face the same issue as with programmers.) I am the senior front-end designer in a team and I often have to re-work my juniors' output in tight deadlines. I am faced with 2 problems:   1. Their coding style is a bit of a mess.    2. The aesthetics are not good. Their coding style, I find, is a mixed bag with no proper convention / standard. I am torn between cleaning up the code or just dealing with their code (even copying how they do things). I do find it frustrating to follow their coding style as I feel I might learn bad habits. But then, that is the fastest way of meeting the deadline. For those with much more experience, which is more effective? Should I save the clean-up for later? Or clean-up along the way as I make the changes? (I don't want to sound arrogant though but such is the reality. It will take them more years to write better code. I know, I wrote messy code when I was starting.)
