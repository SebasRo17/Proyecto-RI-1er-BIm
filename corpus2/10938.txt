I am very new to Mathematica. I thought I would try it out for my first assignment in my computer science class. Until now I have only used C-base languages including C#, Java, Objective-C, and Python. This assignment is to implement RSA encryption and I thought Mathematica would be perfect for this. My code works when it is run outside of functions, but for some reason I can not figure out how to make functions and run them properly. Can someone please explain what is wrong with how I have my document set up right now? Thank you. My Document (after attempting to run)![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nlRe1.png) It seems like Mathematica is trying to run the document even though I have not called any of the functions.
