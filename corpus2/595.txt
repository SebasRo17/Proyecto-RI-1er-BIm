May be someone can explain why I can't use `Begin["context`"]` and `End[]` inside a `Manipulate` expression, or inside the initialization section? When I use it in the `Manipulate` expression, and close the notebook and restart, I get the error: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/kzkr3.png) Here is the code, please feel free to modify as needed. I am just trying to see if the idea of different contexts can be used inside Manipulate. It is just not seeing `obj`f[]` at all.               Manipulate[           Begin["obj`"];      f[y_] := y^2 + 1;      End[];           {x, Date[], obj`f[1]},           {{x, 0, "x"}, 0, 10, 1, Appearance -> "Labeled"},      TrackedSymbols :> {x}      ]      I also tried in the initialization section, same problem. I think this is because `Manipulate` itself is a `Dynamic` module, it does not like new context created inside it? This is a snapshot of the above:               DynamicModule[{x = 5},           Begin["obj`"];           f[y_] := y^2 + 1;           End[];           {x, Date[], obj`f[1]}      ]      Outside `Manipulate`, it works fine of course: (restating kernel helps before running this below again after the above just in case)               Begin["obj`"];     f[y_] := y^2 + 1;     End[];          obj`f[2]      gives `5`
