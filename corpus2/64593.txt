Let us say I am writing a Facebook like application. I write code like below               $this->get_user_friends();       then next morning the boss says that we don't want to call Friends friends anymore, we will call them Pal. Then all the templates are changed but what about the code above? After 2 years when some programmer will have to look into it he is likely to get confused isnt it ? What do you guys really do ?
