What is the best way to get data from Matlab to Mathematica? For a new project I want to copy/paste a table (or part of it) of datas from Matlab to Mathematica. Copyed from Matlab it is:               0   0     1,00000000000000e-20    0,100000000000000     1,78810000000000e-09    0,300000000000000     2,94930000000000e-09    0,500000000000000     4,37810000000000e-09    0,700000000000000     5,58330000000000e-09    0,900000000000000     5,60570000000000e-09    1      In Mathematica I get the following:               0 0     1, 00000000000000 e - 20 0, 100000000000000     1, 78810000000000 e - 09 0, 300000000000000     2, 94930000000000 e - 09 0, 500000000000000     4, 37810000000000 e - 09 0, 700000000000000     5, 58330000000000 e - 09 0, 900000000000000     5, 60570000000000 e - 09 1      (In my Mathematica, there are little "x"s between the exponents and the zeros, I guess it is the columns seperator.) So now I have to replace the "," by "." and the "e-" by "*10^-" and so on ... I could, but I don't want to do it manualy, but till now I had no success with any Mma functions. Or is there a better way to do things like this? ... in the end it should look like this:                {{0, 0},      {1.00000000000000*10^-20, 0.100000000000000},      {1.78810000000000*10^-09, 0.300000000000000},      {2.94930000000000*10^-09, 0.500000000000000},      {4.37810000000000*10^-09, 0.700000000000000},      {5.58330000000000*10^-09, 0.900000000000000},      {5.60570000000000*10^-09, 1}}
