I have over 10 thousands matrices each with n by 3 size. For example, M[1]={{1,2,3},{4,5,6},{7,8,9}}, M[5]={{10,11,12},{13,14,15}} and M[20]={{16,17,18},{19,20,21},{22,23,24},{25,26,27}}. I want to form Mfinal={{1,2,3},{4,5,6},{7,8,9},{10,11,12},{13,14,15},{16,17,18},{19,20,21},{22,23,24},{25,26,27}}. I have tried like this mylist={5,20}; Do [Mfinal=Join[M[1],M[i],1],{i,mylist}]. It does not give me the results I desire.
