I need to produce orbit diagrams for different values of x for the following equation:               f[r_][x_]:= r*x - x^3      I'm fairly new to _Mathematica_ , so I haven't had a lot of practice using it. Basically I need to produce bifurcation diagrams for different values of `x`; then, using these plots, identify `r` values at which bifurcation occurs and determine the convergence ratio. Any help would be much appreciated.
