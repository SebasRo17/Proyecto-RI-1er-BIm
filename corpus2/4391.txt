I've programmed a bit of Haskell and Prolog as part of a couple of uni courses, but that's about it. And I've never seen it been used in industry (not that I've had much of working experience to begin with but I've never seen an ad where you are required to know them). So should we be using functional and/or logic programming languages more often? Are there any advantages or disadvantages for using or not using them?
