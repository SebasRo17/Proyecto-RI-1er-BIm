I have a large 1D dataset of double precision numbers that are stored in many external database files. In order to load the whole dataset into Mathematica 8 I iterate over the files `AppendingTo` a `List`. The problem is that my computer keeps running out of memory even though the memory available should be more than enough to store the whole set. When researching the issue I discovered a strange behaviour (see the code below). The list produced by `AppendTo` consumes much more memory than would correspond to the size of an integer. I presume that, in the latter `List`, Mathematica uses some different kind of objects to store the data. Any suggestions on how to reduce the memory usage?               In[78]:= ByteCount[Range[1, 10000]]     Out[78]= 40168          In[79]:= data = List[];     For[i = 0, i &lt 10000, ++i,       AppendTo[data, i];     ];          In[81]:= ByteCount[data]     Out[81]= 320040
