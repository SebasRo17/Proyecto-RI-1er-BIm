I've been using `C#` for a while now, and for the sake of furthering my career and extending my knowledge of programming, I want to get into `C++`. `C#` is very useful, and fast to work with, but since my team and I will be making large scale projects I need to consider working at a lower level language for several reasons. Most commercial companies use `C/C++` due high performance and portability. Of course, `C#` isn't necessarily bad compared to `C` or `C++`, but I just prefer to have a different tool for each job. So I read C++ is harder because it is a low level language, machine code, and doesn't have memory management. But the fact that it is machine code also reduces the amount of memory consumed. The language is hard to work with, but in a way difficulty makes it a powerful language. It was made to be fast and efficient, machine code, but this makes it harder to understand and learn "since it is closer the the machine". * * * I've made up my mind, and I want to learn `C++`, so what are some tips to keep in mind while learning? It's best to avoid getting into bad habits rather than to try and break them later, safe than sorry. I plan to use the resources stated here, but I would prefer any personal recommendations, books or online guides, possibly those that can be easily understood by someone who has fair knowledge of `C#`.
