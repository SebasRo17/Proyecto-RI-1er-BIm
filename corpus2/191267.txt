This may seem like an odd question. However, more and more I am seeing web applications that are built on the "mobile first" / "responsive design" principle that are about as responsive as a wasp in winter. Mobile isn't a "trend" but it's being treated like that. It's "trendy" and "eye-catching" for digital agencies to be "mobile first", but for most that only means one or more of the below:   * @media queries   * Jquery mobile   * Twitter bootstrap I've recently seen a site which was billed as "mobile first" which only used @media to differentiate between devices. It was a .NET webforms application that heavily relied upon view state and the download size for just the homepage (pre postbacks) was over 1mb! Responsive? Not on my crappy Samsung in the middle of a field. I know that this just sounds like a rant, but I'd really just like to know what peoples opinions are on how to tackle device differentiation? Personally, I show / hide markup (ie sections of a page / includes) based on device to ensure, not only the layout and functionality are optimized, but the download total too. Am I a dinosaur?? Am I wasting my time??
