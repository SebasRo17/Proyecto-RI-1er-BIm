Here, I have one problem in finding nontrivial solutions of a system of equations. I want to choose one variable, for example X1 and to get solutions of X2(X1) and X3(X1). It is not difficult when I have three unknowns, it can be solved by hand quickly, but if I have system with many unknowns, how can I find nontrivial solutions of a system with chosen unknown for example first X1 and to find others in function of X1. Here is a an example. I need X2(X1) and X3(X1)                A={{A11, A12, A13}, {A21, A22, A23}, {A31, A32, A33}};      X={{X1}, {X2}, {X3}};          Solve[(A-λ*IdentityMatrix[3]).X==0,{X2,X3}]      or with four unknowns I am looking for nontrivial solutions X2(X1),X3(X1),X4(X1)                A={{A11, A12, A13,A14}, {A21, A22, A23, A24}, {A31, A32, A33, A34}};      X={{X1}, {X2}, {X3}, {X4}};          Solve[(A-λ*IdentityMatrix[4]).X==0,{X2,X3,X4}]
