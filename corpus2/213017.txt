I was browsing around wikipedia on REST, reading specifically the section on REST APIs Reading the different ways to treat elements from collections I read that POST is _not generally used_. How does that work in practice? When successful REST APIs are developed, when it comes to elements, does POST just not exist or return an error? Is there a reasoning behind that I haven't grasped?
