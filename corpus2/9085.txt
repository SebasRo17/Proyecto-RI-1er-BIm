So as the title says I am trying to make a list where each element is determined by a users choice of an element in a PopupMenu. My first attempt:               test = Table["A", {5}];     Table[PopupMenu[Dynamic[test[[n]]], {"A", "B", "C"}], {n, 5}]      Returned the following error               Part::pspec: Part specification n is neither an integer nor a list of integers.      For some reason the dynamic(?) would not allow me to refer to specific elements in the list. I then tried to circumvent this issue by introducing an extra variable _temp_ :               Table[temp = n;PopupMenu[Dynamic[test[[temp]]], {"A", "B", "C"}], {n, 5}]      However, all this did was create 5 PopupMenus that all referred to the $5^{\text{th}}$ element of the list _test_. I tried to put a `Setting[]` around the `Dynamic[]`, but since that removes that effect of `Dynamic[]` nothing happened at all. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
