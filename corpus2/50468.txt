I need to get historical prices of certain non-US stocks (specifically, they are traded at Prague Stock Exchange, Czech Republic) but I am not able to find the proper "name" that Mathematica would accept. For example, is there a way to look up the Mathematica name for a stock if I know the ISIN code or the exchange (but probably not the exchange's Mathematica symbol) where the stock is traded?
