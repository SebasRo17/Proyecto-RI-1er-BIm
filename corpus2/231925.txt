I have a property that is loaded lazily, any time after the ctor is called. It is possible that the binary that my property relies on is invalid. If invalid I might have to throw an exception. Should I   1. Make the property a method, and be done with it.   2. Leave things as is.   3. Leave the property as-is, but add a method to validate the object, which will invoke the lazy parse, that might throw an exception.
