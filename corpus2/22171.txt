I need to simplify a set of solutions of a system, say for example:               A := (a[1] == 3 && a[2] <= 1 && b[1] <= 5) || (a[1] == 3 && a[2] == 1 && b[1] == -7)      I care only about `a[1]` and `a[2]` but I can not use `Eliminate` since I have inequalities. So one solution is:               Simplify[Reduce[Exists[{b[1]}, A]]]      > a[1] == 3 && a[2] <= 1 It works! But since I have a large system (many b's) I need to automate this. Since:               Array[b, 1]      > {b[1]} I tried:               Simplify[Reduce[Exists[Array[b,1],A]]]      > a[1] == 3 && a[2] <= 1 && b[1] <= 5 The second method yields the wrong outcome! What am I doing wrong here?
