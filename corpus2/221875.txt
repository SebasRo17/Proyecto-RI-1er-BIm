I have the task of taking over a C# program that is very badly written, however I am new to C#. The form has many objects including labels, buttons, panels, etc, which overlap each other. The form is overloaded with these objects when viewed in Visual Studio while writing the code. I have at least 5 panels overlapping each other, not to mention the rest of the objects. Obviously when the program runs some are invisible when not in the correct mode. How can we separate these panels and other objects in the design phase (say on to a child form) so that they can be viewed only when needed?
