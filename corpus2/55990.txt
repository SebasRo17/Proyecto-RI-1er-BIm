The documentation on Operator-Input Forms shows the following example ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/trzvh.png) which suggests that there is an alternative, convenient, operator-style, tidy technique for inputting lists. However, there is not enough clarity in the example to determine what that technique or operator might be. I tried `e11``Space``e12` and `e11``Tab``e12`, but they both result in `Times[e1,e2]`, somewhat predictably, since space normally denotes multiplication in Mathematica notebooks. Any ideas whether there is an operator form for inputting lists? What does the documentation mean in this case?
