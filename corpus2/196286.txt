We're developing a site where individuals (store owners) will be able to take pictures and upload to the site. Our biggest concern is the variance in quality of pictures across the site. The options we are considering are:   1. Minimum image cleaning scripts (including filters, resizing, sharpening, etc.)   2. Approval process for uploaded images   3. Having a team take the photos for them I'd like to see if anyone has had any experience with 1 and 2 above. How effective is 1, and how efficient is 2?
