My aim is to, via pattern analysis and statistics, (as well as piece mobility and position) build a chess position evaluation analyzer (rather than simply going brute force ply-searching). Id like to hear some thoughts a language that will be interesting/fun/challenging to learn and reason with. Ideally the language would have be well suited for:   1. Statistical Analysis   2. Pattern Analysis    3. Native Array and Vector Operations    4. Native Mathematical Functions Note:   1. I have no need for a GUI, and may not even get to the point of a 'move engine' but simply stop at a position evaluation engine   2. I am not interested in speed.    3. I am personally most comfortable with Python but I might be interested in trying something else. (though feel free to suggest this if you think it fits).   4. I am particularly curious about how good a fit a functional language would be in this context.
