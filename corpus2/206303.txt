These days password hashing algorithms are designed to be slow. While it prevents black hats from guessing the password (at least partially), it also gives additional work for the server. I can imagine that, if someone wanted to make server run extremely slowly, they could simply send many log-in requests which would lead to many password hash calculations therefore dramatically increasing CPU usage. What is the common practice for preventing such attacks? And how is it called?
