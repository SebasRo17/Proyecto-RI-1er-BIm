I am making a paid App for Windows 8, c#. I am wondering which is better?     1. If my application doesn't need internet connection normally but does requires internet connection for the first time to download content data. --Makes my life easier   2. Load the default data when installing. Then ask the user if he wants to update in app. -- Making the default data will be pain. Now my big question is, is it safe to assume user has access to internet now- a-days when using application that shouldn't require internet?
