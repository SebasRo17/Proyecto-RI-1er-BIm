I've been slacking off with learning how to program because I'm at my wits end trying to figure out the next step. I want to be able to create forms applications just to test random things and give myself the freedom I feel I have with javascript, which is why I learned it and am as comfortable with it as I am. I have no clue, however, what to do in Visual C++. I'm staring at an ugly, gray, blank form right now and have no clue what to click or what to write. I don't know how to find any tutorials either, as it's quite a specific request (c++, visual basic, windows forms). Does anyone have any advice for me? thanks
