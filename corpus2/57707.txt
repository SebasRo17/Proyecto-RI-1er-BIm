I am currently in a task to generate an XML file for an srt text file containing timestamps and corresponding text. To generate an exe file which accepts file name input and outputs the relevant XML file to be used as part of an automated script. Is it Advisable to use Tinyxml for this? Edit: your comments regarding this are very much appreciated what's the easiest way to generate xml in c++?
