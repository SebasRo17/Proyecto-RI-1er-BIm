This question is a follow up from this one. I want to be able to specify a list of colours for my bars in `BarChart`. In responses to the question I linked to, @kguler produced the following, which sets the bars to the left of x=8 as a different colour:               cedF[{{xmin_, xmax_}, {ymin_, ymax_}}, ___] :={If[xmax <= 8,         RGBColor[1, 0, 0], Sequence[]],       Dynamic@EdgeForm[Directive[Thickness[.015], Lighter@CurrentValue["Color"]]],      Rectangle[{xmin, ymin}, {xmax, ymax}, RoundingRadius -> 5]};          Histogram[RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[10, 2], 500],ChartStyle -> "Pastel",        ChartElementFunction -> cedF]      ![kguler example](http://i.stack.imgur.com/lHIGV.png) My question is how to generalise this: I would like to be able to have a list that specifies the colours of every bin uniquely. How would I go about this? If[] statements seem a bit clunky for this application.
