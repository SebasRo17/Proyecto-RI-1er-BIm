**edit:** I should point out; My personal view was that I should be proactive. I know sometimes I have to bite my tongue, and I wanted to get the communities input(was this one of those times). I couldn't find a more appropriate place to ask it in the SO family of sites. Here is the scenario --   * small org < 70 employees   * no qa department   * website viewed by thousands everyday.    * I am the sole website developer   * I have never had a single complaint that the site is broken in IE6   * I've discovered our site has not worked in IE6 for years. The person I replaced who created it must have been "testing" it only on IE7. I fired up Virtual PC and with IE6, and our site is a complete mess. You can not select some menu items they are so garbled. It looks terrible. So again, Is it our job to proactively seek out bugs, or do we just fix what the customer requests.... Personally, I want to leverage this opportunity with my org to drop any expectation of IE6 support or compatibility.
