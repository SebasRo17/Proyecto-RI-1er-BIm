I would like to define a tensor according to its components, something like the following:               [F(x)]_i,j = Integrate[f(x,y)A_i(y)B_j(y),y]      where i and j are components between 1 and 3, i.e. A_i(y)B_j(y) is a 2nd rank tensor. F is also a 2nd rank tensor, with components i and j. Now, I don't want to explicitly enter the separate values for this definition, i.e.               [F(x)]_1,1 = Integrate[f(x,y)A_1(y)B_1(y),y]     [F(x)]_1,2 = Integrate[f(x,y)A_1(y)B_2(y),y]      etc. How can I do it generally? Also, I would not like to enter specific values for A and B components, but keep it general for arbitrary A and B. * * * ### EDIT Suppose I have the following:               f = 5 x + 3 y;     A = {8 y^2, 5 y, 17 y^3 + 3};     B = {7 y + 3, 4 y, 5 y + 3 y^2};      Now, I don't know my exact input (that's what I am asking) but it would be something like that:               F[i,j]=Integrate[f A[[i]] B[[j]],{y,0,8}]      I want it to be defined as a tensor, so that later I will be able to contract its indices with other tensors. My output should look like:               F = {{Integrate [f*A[[1]] B[[1]], {y, 0, 8}],            Integrate [f*A[[1]] B[[2]], {y, 0, 8}],            Integrate [f*A[[1]] B[[3]], {y, 0, 8}]},          {Integrate [f*A[[2]] B[[1]], {y, 0, 8}],            Integrate [f*A[[2]] B[[2]], {y, 0, 8}],            Integrate [f*A[[2]] B[[3]], {y, 0, 8}]},          {Integrate [f*A[[3]] B[[1]], {y, 0, 8}],            Integrate [f*A[[3]] B[[2]], {y, 0, 8}],            Integrate [f*A[[3]] B[[3]], {y, 0, 8}]}}      I want this to work when I don't define explicitly `A`, `B`, `f`. without definitions, I want _Mathematica_ to write the answer in terms of `A[[1]]` etc, and understand it as a tensor, so I can use it later. I hope now it's clear.
