In a software firm there are three kinds of jobs   1. Software Developer   2. Software Quality Engineer   3. Software Tester The role of a software developer is quite clear but what's the difference between the jobs done by a Software Quality Engineer and a Software Tester? It's very strange for me why there is so much of a difference in the salary levels of a Software Quality Engineer and a Software Tester.
