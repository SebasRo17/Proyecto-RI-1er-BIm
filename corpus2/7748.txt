I'm trying to use phase-shifted `SquareWave[]` functions to create a rectangle wave:               SquareWave[{0, 1}, x/100] * SquareWave[{0, 1}, x/100 - offsetx]      Two things:   1. This only allows for duty cycles less than 50 %.    2. While it's handy (it's always the phase shift $0\dots 1$, regardless of horizontal scale), I'm confused that `offsetx` isn't a function of the `x` scaling Is there a general function to create rectangle waves with duty cycles from 0 % to 100 %?
