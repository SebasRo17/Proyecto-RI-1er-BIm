Here is the conundrum I am faced with. I have two computer. One with Mathematica (and hence `MathematicaScript`) but generally _poor_ resources. The other without Mathematica but _excellent_ resources (good amount of disk space, RAM, processor power). Since the local IT department who are the computer overlords here will take forever to get Mathematica installed on the better of the two machines... > Is there a way I could modify my Mathematica script's shebang to access > `MathematicaScript` over an ssh connection?

I'd like to incorporate an ssh access functionality to it.               !#/usr/local/bin/MathematicaScript -script
