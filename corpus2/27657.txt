I am getting unexpected plots from `PolarPlot` when I provide a list of functions that I generate using `Table`. I suspect the issue is related to the presence of nested lists, but I want to understand how `PolarPlot` is rendering the nested list of functions. I expect the output to be a plot showing the curve of each function in my list. I do not know what functional form would generate the plot that I do observe. For example:               f[a_, b_, c_, t_] := 1 + (1/a)Sin[b + c*t]     t1 = Table[f[a, b, c, t], {a, 3}, {b, 0, Pi/2, Pi/2}, {c, 1}]     PolarPlot[t1, {t, 0, Pi}] (* Not expected result *)     PolarPlot[t1[[1, {1, 2}, {1}]], {t, 0, Pi}] (* Not expected result *)     PolarPlot[Flatten[t1], {t, 0, Pi}] (* Expected result *)     PolarPlot[t1[[1, {1, 2} ,1]],{t, 0, Pi}] (* Expected result *)
