Mathematica 8.0.0: I am stuck trying to get a Mathematica Mathlink connection from my Windows computer working that should connects to Linux over network (or vice versa) and then launches a Kernel on the remote end (which I want to use to do some calculations on my Windows PC or vice versa). For local connections it works on both operating system and I can use this Mathlink connection to launch a Kernel:               Needs[ "SubKernels`LinkKernels`"]     kernel = FileNameJoin[{$InstallationDirectory, "MathKernel.exe"}];     link = LinkLaunch[kernel <> " -subkernel -mathlink"]          LaunchKernels[link]      I have already tried to create MathLinks on one computer (let's say IP: 192.168.1.1) where the kernel is launched with:               (*Computer which creates the remote link*)     kernel = LinkLaunch[First[$CommandLine] <> " -mathlink"];         LinkRead[kernel];         LinkWrite[kernel, Unevaluated[$ParentLink = LinkCreate["8000", LinkProtocol -> "TCPIP"];]]      But I cannot access this link when I use:               (*Computer which wants to use the remote link*)     link = LinkConnect["8000@192.168.1.1", LinkProtocol -> "TCPIP"]     LinkRead[link]     LinkRead[link]     LinkWrite[link, Unevaluated[$ProcessID]]     First[LinkRead[link]]      Somehow I am also missing authentication informations for the computer which wants to connect in my code but I did not get an example which shows me where to state these credentials.
