If anybody has ever noticed that when you open a image in Facebook something like this happens:- suppose you are at your homepage on Facebook:- the URL is https://www.facebook.com/ now if you open a image it gets opened in new modal like window and URL changes to:- https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151125374887397&set=a.338008237396.161268.36922302396&type=1&theater As far as I know in any common case a modal overlay would have kept the url in the address bar the same , My question is how does facebook / pintrest achieve this behaviour of not re-loading the whole page but still achieving the change in the address bar. Is there any jquery or javascript plugin for this?
