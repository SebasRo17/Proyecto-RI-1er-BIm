I would rather use Wolfram|Alpha on my iPad then _Mathematica_ , so I need your answer to be applicable to W|A. I want to input a function or an expression in a way that Wolfram|Alpha will understand that my references to $n$ are references to an integer. For example, I want to simplify $\frac{-\cos(n \pi)}{n \pi}$ to something more comapct. How could this be achieved? Any suggestions?
