I recently saw a question on SE about how to do such and such when creating an IRC bot. The only use of IRC bots I was familiar with was message flooding and spamming. I did a Google search for the string I used as my title and was led to an **article** that was an eye opener as to what all an evil IRC bot could do, but I did not see any explanation of a benevolent (or neutral) use of an IRC bot. Is there any? If so, what are they used for?
