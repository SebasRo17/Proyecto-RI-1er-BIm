I need to come up with a design for real-time data update from a COTS product (a Point of Sales system) to a custom-built .NET application (an Inventory Management system). Particularly, any sales transaction happening in POS system needs to update the inventory database (present in Inventory Management system) immediately (in real time). The only way any other system can communicate to the POS system is via its API exposed as web services. I have thought about introducing a Service Bus (or any such EAI tool) in between the two systems and taking advantage of the publish-subscribe model so that any sales depletion happening in POS system will trigger data update to the IM system via the service bus. My questions are:   1. Is it a good/feasible solution?   2. Do you have any other suggestions for such real-time data synchronization between different systems?
