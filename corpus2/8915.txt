Hopefully this will be a quick question + a quick answer: Say I have a C++ (or C) code using LibraryLink. I am using a library that defines a specific matrix class, as many numerical libraries commonly do. So during the computations I am using this class and, at the very end, I want to convert it to an MTensor to be used as output. What is the simplest way to do that? Hopefully, one that does not require reallocating the entire matrix? [Not sure it helps, but the matrix elements are assumed to be stored sequentially.] Thank you in advance for the support. Gabriel **Edit:** Two examples are the NVector class in SUNDIALS and the Matrix class in numerical recipes (3rd Edition in C++). Here is a quote from Numerical Recipes ($n$,$m$ are integers): let               MatDoub a(n,m);     Doub *b &a[0][0];      Then $a[i][j]$ and $b[m*i+j]$ are equivalent.
