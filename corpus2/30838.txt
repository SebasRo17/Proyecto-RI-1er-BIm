I have the following list:               AA1 = {{55.3346, 694.253}, {55.3373, 691.275}, {55.34,         688.323}, {55.3426, 685.396}, {55.3453, 682.494}, {55.348,         679.617}, {55.3506, 676.765}, {55.3533, 673.936}, {55.356,         671.131}, {55.3565, 668.277}, {55.3565, 665.428}, {55.3565,         662.604}, {55.3565, 659.803}}      By interpolating the data, I get an error:               AA2 = Interpolation[AA1, InterpolationOrder -> 1]      "Interpolation::inddp: The point 55.3565` in dimension 1 is duplicated. >>" Therefore, I want to delete the duplicated terms:               DeleteDuplicates[AA1[[All, 1]]]      But how do I merge these values with the **correct** values of the second part in list AA1 (694.253 until 659.803?
