We have a need to FTP files that are generated by our system, so we're trying to decide whether we should spend the time to build something that meets our criteria (relatively easy, .NET has FTP functionality built in, among other more advanced libs from 3rd parties). Or if we should buy something off the shelf. Our requirements are roughly:   * Must be able to trigger a file send programmatically   * Needs to retry _N_ number of times (configurable)   * Queryable status of FTP requests   * Callback on completion or fail of an FTP request I don't need to be sold on the relative simplicity of building something like that for myself. However I do want to do the due diligence of seeing what products are available ... because if something does exist that matches the requirements above, I wouldn't mind paying for it :-) Any thoughts or links would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
