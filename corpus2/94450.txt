I have seen the forum dba.StackExchange, but this question involves Visual Studio as well, therefore I wanted to post this question here. One of my old application was built on VS-2008 and MySQL back-end. After three years, I don't have any major issues with it and the database performance is also good. I am scaling this application to a WPF application and want to know whether SQL Server has any added advantages when used with VS-2010, other than that it is from Microsoft, over MySQL? In most scenarios, I notice query execution in MySQL is faster as compared to SQL Server.
