First off, thanks for reading the question. I understand that this would theoretically be best asked in the SQA stack area \- but - seeing as how that doesn't officially exist yet, maybe this was the most appropriate place for it for now. I'm looking into tracking down a certification in Software Quality, however, there are so many different awarding bodies and certifications that telling the difference between them is difficult. So far I've found:   * Six Sigma - a QA process, originally founded by Motorola & not limited to software. (in fact I'm not sure if it even covers software development). Based on a series of 'belts' (black being the best, I assume it starts at green? or white?)   * ASQ - American Society of Quality - offers numerous certifications in quality     * CQA - Quality Auditor     * CQE - Quality Engineer     * CQIA - Quality Improvement Associate     * CQI - Quality Inspector     * CQPA - Quality Process Analyst     * CQT - Quality Technician     * CRE - Reliability Engineer   * QAI Global     * Software Testing     * Software Quality Assurance     * Process Engineering     * Process Management With all the different designations and levels, I'm having trouble understanding the differences and the 'start point' and progression between the levels. (Are they a hierarchy or are they in parallell?)
