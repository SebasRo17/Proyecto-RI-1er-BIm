I am having trouble getting _Mathematica_ to solve really simple inequalities. I started with               Solve[{y^x >= 2*y - 1}, x]      but _Mathematica_ can't solve it. So I tried               Solve[{y^x >= 2*y - 1, x > 10, y > 10}, x, Reals]       with still no luck. I tried `Reduce`, but that didn't work either. An obvious solution is $x \geq \frac{\ln(2y-1)}{\ln(y)}$. How can I persuade _Mathematica_ to give me that?
