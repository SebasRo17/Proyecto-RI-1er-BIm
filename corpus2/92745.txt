Most of my projects start small. Many times I start with a web page (1 file) that has the code to... select stuff from the database => display it to the user and offer editing => receive the edits (sometimes complex enough that it requires parsing) => update the database all of this in 1 file, of course. As the project grows it always becomes annoying to have so much code in one pile, 50 `if` statements. **Question** : What is a good, proven & intuitive data separation? I guess i'm looking for a diagram that explains which code goes in what file. I would like to keep this language independent, but in case it matters I'm using PHP and MySQL.
