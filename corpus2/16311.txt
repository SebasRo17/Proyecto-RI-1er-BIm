I need to use symbols with suffixes in order to make my code readable in relation to the Eurocodes. To do this I use `Symbolize` from the `Notation`` package, but have noticed that the syntax colouring does not work on symbols created in this way. This makes checking the code more difficult. Is there a way of getting the syntax colouring to work or am I doing something wrong? Here is a toy example which seems to work if you copy and paste and then change it to Standard Form (`Control`-`Shift`-`N`). Note the W is shown black whereas the subscript is shown in blue. All the other symbols are shown blue even after they are defined.               Symbolize[     ParsedBoxWrapper[     SubscriptBox["\[Gamma]", "M0"]]];     Symbolize[     ParsedBoxWrapper[     SubscriptBox["M",      RowBox[{"c", ".", "y", ".", "Rd"}]]]]; Symbolize[     ParsedBoxWrapper[     SubscriptBox["W",      RowBox[{"el", ".", "y"}]]]];          Subscript[M, c.y.Rd] = 50;     Subscript[W, el.y] = 0.05;     Subscript[\[Gamma], M0] = 1.2;          \[Sigma] = Subscript[M, c.y.Rd]/(Subscript[W,       el.y]/Subscript[\[Gamma], M0])      1199.9999999999998 ![Here is an image of what I mean](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nMjnn.png)
