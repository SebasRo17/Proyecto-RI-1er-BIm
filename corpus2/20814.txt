$c$ is a vector with real numbers.I want to separate the positive ones and the negative ones into two vectors: $a$ and $b$. I have the following problem: When I do:               c = RandomReal[{-1, 1}, 20];     {a, b} = GatherBy[c, Positive]      Sometimes, $a$ is the one with positive numbers, and some other times $b$ is the one with the positive numbers. Any solution to this problematic randomness?
