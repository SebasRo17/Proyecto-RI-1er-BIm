I've been looking for various licenses that I can use for an open-source project of mine, but all of the projects that I've seen, with all kinds of licenses, appear to have a giant, obnoxious (in my opinion) notice in each source file that states that the file is listed under a certain license. I don't think that I've found a single source project that isn't public domain that _doesn't_ have a notice like that. This just seems like a waste of time and file space. I plan on putting `@license` and `@author` tags in my projects, but I don't see why I need to list such a giant notice in each individual file if I don't want to make my code public domain. Is there any reason why I would want to include such a notice in my projects, or would simply including a notice in the `README` and a `@license` tag be good enough? Does this affect the "clearly stated" rule of most licenses, or is it just overkill so that people won't argue?
