I'm working on an old vb6/access2003 app which is used to handle orders, bills of materials and that sort of things. I'm thinking about creating a form that I call every time the users needs to search for something. This should work like these:   * Click on the field to complete, let's say name of a buyer   * Open new form, search for the client and click on it   * Return the name of the buyer to the previous form (probably the header of the order) So, I would need to pass to the new form something that identify the type of search I have to do (so what access table to open) and return some values. Is my idea correct or there something better? I would like to use only one form for all the searches, now the app works with a lot of msflexgrid for every form.
