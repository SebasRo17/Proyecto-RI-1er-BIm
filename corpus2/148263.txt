I have a 4 years old project which is written in Swing + SwingX. Currently, it is still alive and still kicking. However, as more GUI related feature requests coming in (For instance, a sortable tree table), I start to feel the difficulty in fulling the requests. This is true especially since there isn't any active development going around SwingX project. Also, I can hardly find any good, yet actively maintained/ developed/ evolving GUI Java framework. I was wondering, do any of the Swing developers feel the same thing? Have you start to migrate your Swing project to a much more active developed GUI framework, like JavaFX?
