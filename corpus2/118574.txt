I have a homework assignment and I need to evaluate which approach is better according to GRASP "Protected Variation". I found a question on Stack Overflow about the separation of header and code files in C++. However, what I want to know why Java does not follow C++ in promoting the separation between class definitions and class implementations. Are there any advantages with the Java method, over the C++ method?
