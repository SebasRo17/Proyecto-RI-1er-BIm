I am trying to expand out expressions that have several terms similar to               E[-lH] Sinh[l (H - h)]      The `Expand` command just gives me back the original expression. Even when I do a partial expansion, and then try `Expand`:               Expand[E[-l H] (E[l (H - h)] - E[-l (H - h)])]      I get back:               E[-H l] (-E[(h - H) l] + E[(-h + H) l])      From `ExpandAll`:               -E[-H l] E[h l - H l] + E[-H l] E[-h l + H l]      I would like `E[-lH] Sinh[l (H - h)]` to be expanded as:               E[-h l] - E[(h - 2 H)l]
