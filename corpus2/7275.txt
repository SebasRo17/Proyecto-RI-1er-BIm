I found this plot on Wikipedia: ![domain-colored plot of sine function](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GjMe4.jpg) > Domain coloring of $\sin(z)$ over $(-\pi,\pi)$ on $x$ and $y$ axes. > Brightness indicates absolute magnitude, saturation represents imaginary and > real magnitude. Despite following the link and reading the page nothing I have tried is giving me the result shown. How should this be done?
