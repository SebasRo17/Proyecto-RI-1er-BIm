I have a list of names in which I would like to check for duplicates. However, within the list, the duplicates may not show up as exact duplicates of each other - for instance, `{Barack Obama, Barack H. Obama, Barack Hussein Obama, Obama Barack Hussein}` are all considered likely candidates to be duplicates of each other. Furthermore, the data may contain slight mistakes - for instance, the following and other variants would be considered (near) duplicates too. `{Barack Obama, barack Obama, Barrack Obama}` What I would like to do is to automatically **highlight** these duplicates _(for example, by changing their font size or color as displayed on screen)_ so that I can later go through the list manually and confirm whether or not the duplicates are indeed duplicates. My current approach is as such:               nlsplit =      StringSplit /@ namelist; (*splitting the names at the whitespace*)     nlsplitsort =      Map[Sort, nlsplit,      2] ; (*sorting the names of each person alphabetically - for     example, John Anderson Doe becomes {Anderson, Doe, John}*)     nlsplitsortpad = Transpose[Map[PadRight[#, 5] &, nlsplitsort, 2]][[1]];     (*pad each person's name with zeros so that Mathematica doesn't sort     based on list length but on name*)     Sort[nlsplitsortpad]      This question may be linked to mine, but I feel it's sufficiently different to merit a post. Mr Wizard also informed me that a question of Soft-Match String Comparison may have been asked before and the link is here as Sjoerd C. de Vries points out. **Edit** : It would be great if the following could be done, but from my knowledge of Mathematica, I'm not sure whether it's worth the effort.   1. The process of highlighting duplicates does not change the ordering of the original list, but simply highlights them, and    2. I could simply hover over a duplicate candidate where using `Tooltip` we display the possible matches identified as similar to this duplicate candidate.   3. By choosing from a list of options I could do one of the following:      * select the current duplicate candidate as the entry I want to keep (and remove all other similar candidates from the main list)     * skip to one of the other matches displayed by the `Tooltip` and choose that as the entry I want to keep (removing all other similar candidates from the main list)     * confirm that the current candidate is not in fact a duplicate, and remove it from the list of any candidate of duplicates.
