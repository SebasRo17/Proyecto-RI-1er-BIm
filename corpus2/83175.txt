I am a front end programmer. I'm good with design, html, css, and jquery, but I want to learn javascript more than anything. I've taken a couple of courses, read books and tutorials online and feel like I have a good grasp of the core principles: variables, logic etc. This is where I see to differ from all the other "What's the best way to learn js" questions on the web. What I can't seem to do is put this into actual practice. I can't take the jump from knowing the bits and pieces to figuring out how they work together to become a program. What's the best way to get actual applied knowledge with js? I assume becoming an apprentice or being tutored would be the best, but you don't hear about those sorts of things often.
