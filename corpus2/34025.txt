I want to verify a theory stating that a golden mean spiral plotted on a polar graph will have intersection points at specific values. ![golden mean spiral plotted on polar graph](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ljuGi.png) There should be 8 concentric circles, each **at the same distance** as the previous one. The radial lines should be in 10-degree increments, and the spiral should start from `0` on the first circle in the middle and end on circle #8 at `360`. The golden mean spiral should progress independently of the grid lines. If all these requirements are met, `NSolve` should reveal where the intersection points are (the theory claims - 0deg at circle #1 - 120deg at circle #2 - 190deg at circle #3 - 240deg at circle #4 - 280deg at circle #5 - 360deg at circle #8). If the initial stretch of the spiral proves the theory wrong, trying to stretch the spiral between any 2 intersection points might do it. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ii22f.png)
