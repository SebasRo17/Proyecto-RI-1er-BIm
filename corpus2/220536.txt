I am developing an app in Android, i need get information from a external database in mysql and i read about Rest.. REST is using HTTP verbs GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to respectively get, insert, update, delete resources on a server. E.g. GET with url: controller/customer/{id} But why not use a simple Php ? is really necessary to use REST? i dont understand why i must use Rest if a simple PHP will do the same. Rest with php is a RESTFul?
