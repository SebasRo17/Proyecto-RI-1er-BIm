Like what the title says, why are there animations in CSS3? With basis from the "rule" of separation of concerns, HTML is the content, CSS is the **_style_** , and JavaScript is the interactive component. And by interactivity, one can conclude that anything moving due to any interaction, user or non-user triggered should be covered by JavaScript, not CSS. So why did they make CSS3 capable of doing animations? Doesn't it breach the rule, which is separation of concerns? Is there anything I missed that makes animations qualified to be classified as styles rather than interaction?
