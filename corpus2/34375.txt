The question given to me: **a**. Find the _perfect numbers_ between $1$ and $10^6$ **b** : Find the _abundant numbers_ between $1$ and $1000$ * * * For **a** , I wrote               Select[Range[1, 10^6], All]      I think I'm suppose to use divisor in there somewhere, but I'm not sure where to put that since I think me selecting all the numbers between $1$ and $10^6$ won't give me the list of all the perfect numbers... For **b** , I think it's similar to part **a** , which I'm in a dead end with. * * * I'm trying to find a simple input since I'm still a beginner and want to stay with the basics.
