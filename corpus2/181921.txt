So every number in the code that we are sending to a method as an argument is considered as a Magic Number? To me, it shouldn't. I think if some number is let's say it is for minimum length of user name and we start using "6" in the code...then yeah we have a maintenance problem and here "6" is a magic number....but if we are calling a method that one of its arguments accept an integer for example as the ith member of a collection and then we pass "0" to that method call, in this case I don't see that "0" as a magic number. What do you think?
