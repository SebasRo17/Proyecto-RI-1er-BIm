I'm doing some investigation into the role of maintenance in software development and the use of metrics within the development cycle. What I am asking is for a point in the right direction or possibly a direct example in which there has been software failures due to the oversight of maintenance costs. More specifically I am looking for a case in which an implemented system has failed as the costs/effort for maintenance has been far too great as there has been poor or no projections from metrics. I understand this is a very specific question, but I've been racking my brains thinking of all the software failures I know of and none of them fit the criteria.
