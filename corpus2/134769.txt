I program a data-analysis framework for my company (20000LOCs by now). There are 2 programmers who help writing individual module for interfaces I have predefined. So far I haven't used much planning or tools. I basically think of new classes in my head and write them down in Python+Eclipse. As Python is good for proto-typing I can easily modify it if I overlook one aspect. However, sometimes I need to refactor some structure and I wonder if that hadn't happened if I used planning tools. What do you think is the most important start to plan programming more professionally? The project won't become too big as it's only for data analysis, but managing which data is processed which way is also tedious. Can you suggest methods, reading or tools? My class hierarchy is pretty flat so I don't see much use in class diagrams. However, something like call diagrams and diagrams which show how objects reference each other might help. I've learned OOP by myself, but I'm confident that once I consider all requirements I can design a nice class structure. What about TDD? For the moment I cannot imagine how to use it since most calculation are on network-like data with objects and many object references (links). Moreover data content hasn't been a problem yet. Yet, I suspect that some more professional approach might be more efficient. Ideas?
