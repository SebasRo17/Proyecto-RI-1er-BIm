My company's management wants to deduct from the salary of under performing employees. I'm a member of the Core Strategy committee and they want my opinion also. I believe that the throughput from an employee depends on a lot of things such as the particular work assigned to them, other members of his/her team, other reasons etc. Such penalizations will be demoralizing to the people. How can I convince my management not to do so?
