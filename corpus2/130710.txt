I have a situation where I have to access several "sub-properties" of an object and find it quite appalling to write such code. I was wondering how best to deal with this situation:               void Main()     {         MyAClass aClass = new MyAClass();         aClass.BClass.CClass.DoSomething();     }      In addition to it being an eyesore, there are no null checks, and if one were to do them, the code would look even more cluttered. At the moment I create shortcuts, but they are a bit of a code smell too:               public class MyAClass     {         public MyBClass BClass { get; set; }              public void DoSomething()         {             if (BClass == null || BClass.CClass == null)                 throw new Exception();                  BClass.CClass.DoSomething();         }     }      What's the best way to access multiple properties like this?
