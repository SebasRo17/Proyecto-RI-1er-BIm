I'm trying to solve with Mathematica an integral equation. I found this excellent answer (How to solve a non-linear integral equation?) solving with a collocation method a problem which can be restated as: $$ \int_a^b f \left( \phi \left(x \right) \right) \mathrm{d} x= 1 $$ for some function $f$, $\phi(x)$ being the unknown. My problem is slightly more complicated: $$ \phi(x) = \int_a^b K \left( x, y \right) f \left( \phi \left( y \right) \right) \mathrm{d} y $$ and the kernel $K(x,y)$ is singular for $x=y$, it behaves as $\sim \frac{1}{\left| x - y \right|}$. I would like to know if it is possible to extend the collocation method to this case, or, alternatively, which other methods can be used to numerically solve my integral equation. Thanks in advance! Edit: some more details: $$ f(\phi(x)) = \frac{\phi(x)}{\sqrt{\phi^2(x) + C^2}} $$ $$ K(x,y) = y \frac{\mathrm{e}^{-\left| x - y \right|}}{\left| x - y \right|} $$
