I'm writing an application that deals with the network and the hard drive. For the network portion, the application measures in bits per second, while the disk portion measures in bytes per second. This becomes an issue as they both are abbreviated `b/s` or `bps` everywhere I've seen. How could I inform the user that one means _bits_ per second, while the other means _bytes_ per second? If I were writing a specification, I could just add a footnote, but as this is an application, I can't do that. So, my question is **How do I tell a user that one means bits per second while the other means bytes per second and how would I style the lettering (i.e. megabinarybytes is MiB, but what is megabinarybits)?**
