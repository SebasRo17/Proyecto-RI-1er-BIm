Is there such a market for programmers who are interested in security (exploits, antivirus, firewalls, etc)? Reason I ask is that I really love software development and I am also interested in security. I'm wondering if I can have a career in this field. If there is such a market, what kinds of concepts and topics should I learn? Any particular languages or operating system? I know some basic networking concepts, C, Unix..
