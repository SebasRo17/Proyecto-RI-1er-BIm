I am trying to construct a recursion, `g[t]`, where   * `g[t] = a[t]` if `g[t-1] = 1`   * `g[t] = b[t]` if `g[t-1] = 2`. Additionally `a` and `b` are defined as:               a[t_] := If[0 <= RandomReal[] <= 0.94, 1, 2]     b[t_] := If[0 <= RandomReal[] <= 0.9, 2, 1]      So then I want (I've also tried it where I replace `a` and `b` with their original defintions):               g[t_]:= Piecewise[{{a[t], g[t - 1] = 1}, {b[t], g[t - 1] = 2}}]     g[1] = 1      This, however, is not working.
