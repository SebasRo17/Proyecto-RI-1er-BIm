I have a matrix like this:               Reverse@Array[List, {8, 8}] // MatrixForm      ![matrix](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cHW1x.png) I need a function that given an element of this matrix will return all the elements corresponding to the two diagonals that run through it. The first diagonal can be found like this:               Diagonal[matrix, j-i]      where `{i,j}` is the element. How can I get the diagonal that runs orthogonally to this through the same given element `{i,j}`? (It is somewhat related to this question but my problem is more that I can't figure out which diagonal I want once I've reversed the matrix.)
