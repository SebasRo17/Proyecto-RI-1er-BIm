A probability distribution can be created in Mathematica (I am using 8.0.1) with e.g.               distribution1 = ProbabilityDistribution[(Sqrt[2])/Pi*(1/((1+x^4))),      {x,-Infinity,Infinity}];      Random variates from this distribution can be created with RandomVariate easily:               dataDistribution1=RandomVariate[distribution1,10^3];     Histogram[dataDistribution1](*Just an optical control*)      How can I create random variates from a 2-dimensional probability distribution? Let's say my 2-dimensional distribution is of the following form (very similar to the previous one):               distribution2=ProbabilityDistribution[((((Sqrt[2] π^(3/2) Gamma[5/4])/     (Gamma[3/4]))^(-1)))/((1+x^4+y^4)),{x,-Infinity,Infinity},     {y,-Infinity,Infinity}];      I thought it would be logical to try               dataDistribution2=RandomVariate[distribution2,10^3];      But that does not work. I get the following message then:               RandomVariate::noimp: Sampling from ProbabilityDistribution[Gamma[3/4]…}] is not implemented.      I tried a lot of variations of this approach to create random variates from such a distribution but without any success. Either I am doing a lot of things wrong (very likely in my experience ;-) or Mathematica cannot deliver random variates from 2-dimensional probability distributions. But in the help of RandomVariate (under “Simulate a multivariate continuous distribution”) one can see that this should be possible. Perhaps somebody of you can tell me, how I can generate random variates from 2 dimensional probability distributions? I would be very happy about any help!
