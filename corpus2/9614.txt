Is there a difference between 'scripters' and 'programmers'? What is the dividing line between scripters and programmers? Perhaps all scripters be considered to be a programmer. If not all scripters can fall into the same camp, what about those people who use external objects such as COM objects, Win32's, etc. via an interop library? As far as script languages I'm thinking of are (but not limited to) perl, bash, javascript, powershell, and batch files.
