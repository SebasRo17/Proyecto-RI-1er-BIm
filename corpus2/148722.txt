To note, I'm not interested in simply 'hiding' content for mobile devices, I want to filter out that content completely. I'm also not trying to address the issue by building a mobile specific interface (mob.example.com). There was another question regarding something similar: How do I prevent useless content load on the page in responsive design? The solution, in that post, was to set a session during the initial request, and then use the session to filter content on subsequent requests. I primarily develop in Rails, and I'm wondering if there are any gems or ruby- specific solutions to this problem?
