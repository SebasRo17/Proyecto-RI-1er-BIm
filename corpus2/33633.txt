I find myself frequently highlighting and formatting portions of text cells in a _Mathematica_ notebook. Bold and Italic typesetting is easy to handle but I would like to use `backticks` to provide formatting similar to the SE editor or perhaps use underscores and asterisks to auto-format in other ways (say for example, text within ** here ** would be red and text within _ here _ would be highlighted yellow. Is it possible to customize a stylesheet to afford this type of formatting?
