Say I have a function with a few definitions that also implements memoization:               f[x_] := f[x] = x^2     f[x_, y_] := f[x, y] = x^2 + y^2      I then apply the function to some data:               f /@ {1, 2, 3}     f @@@ {{1, 2}, {3, 4}}      Now the function will have a bunch of `DownValues` both for the stored results and for the pattern based definitions. Is there some easy way to retrieve only all the stored result, leaving out the pattern based definitions?
