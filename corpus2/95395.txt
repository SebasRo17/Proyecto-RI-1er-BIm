I've been an ASP.net web developer for about 2.5 years now. I would describe my technical training before that as being "classical" C++. It seemed like it took an eternity to get up to speed with ASP.net. I kept wanting to think of programming in VB.net and C#.net as if it were C++ programming, which of course, it isn't. Even my supervisor admitted that at the beginning he had doubts about "keeping me on board", but I made it. I've now been working on a project of my own for about a year. Here are some concepts and technologies I've picked up some skill with along the way.   * class inheritance   * separation of concerns   * LINQ   * SQL   * Session State   * JavaScript   * jQuery   * AJAX   * CSS The first two that I mentioned are essential for keeping the code organized. LINQ is very nice to have to avoid having to write `for` loops over and over. JavaScript seems to have become the backbone of web programming in spite of its shortcomings and jQuery seems to couple it very tightly with CSS. I've been making a big effort to learn to write better JavaScript; mainly by reading on Douglas Crockford's web site. I would like to know, from more experienced web developers, besides what I mentioned here, what are the most important tools to have in your toolbox to write great web applications?
