I have a client who is requesting that we develop their fairly small web application directly in their environment by RDP to the server that will host the app. They have had a contractor do this for a while and it has worked "fine" for them, so they are comfortable with that approach. The client's biggest concern at this point is cutting costs - they have a very tight budget. My manager does not seem to care or think that it makes a difference. However, I strongly do not agree with that practice. How best can I convince the client that it is bad practice to do things that way? I need to use "management" language, not developer language. I can think of a few advantages of developing locally (as a developer):   1. We can not guarantee code quality in the remote environment (why not?)   2. Internal team collaboration increases efficiency (how?)   3. Internally, we can take better advantage of source control (although that can also be installed on the server)   4. Internally, we can follow better quality control processes   5. With RDP, only one developer can work on project at a time   6. Developing locally increases a developer's efficiency (how? maybe because it is their comfort zone? maybe with multiple monitors? how does that benefit the client?) Unfortunately, these do not necessarily translate to something management appreciates (e.g. dollars and cents) Please help.
