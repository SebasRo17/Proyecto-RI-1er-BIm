I am an new user of _Mathematica_ and learning basics so please guide me I tried to use this code               Animate[Plot[x^2/a^2 - y^2/b^2 == 1, {x, 0, 2}, {y, 0, 2}],        {a, 1, 3},        {b, 1, 3}]      but I got this error message: > Plot::nonopt: Options expected (instead of {y,0,2}) beyond position 3 in > Plot[x^2/FE`a$$116^2-y^2/FE`b$$116^2==1,{x,0,2},{y,0,2}]. An option must be > a rule or a list of rules. >> All I want to do is to animate a hyperbole with its asymptotes.
