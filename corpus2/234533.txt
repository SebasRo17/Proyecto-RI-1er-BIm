Should performance tests be instrumented by build tools as part of the build process, or should they live completely outside? If outside, then where in the deployment pipeline should they live? I currently see performance tests being attached to integration testing lifecycle phases. While it's fine for now, I know this doesn't seem quite right, and I'm having difficulty finding an actual answer as to where we should be attaching and running these performance tests. For the sake of the question, we can assume an environment utilizing Jenkins for CI, and Maven as a build tool. We can also assume a scrum SDLC.
