At my previous job I was the lead programmer and I worked with this guy who was a self-admitted hacker. We respected each other and had a great relationship. The company was much better off because we blended our talents. I would tend to look for an elegant, graceful solution that we could add to our code library. He would tend to find, tweak, and fit some strange piece of code into a solution. One of the most valuable lessons I learned from him was you don't always have to build the solution from scratch, there's a ton of code out there you can borrow from. What kind of things have you learned from a hacker? **Edit - Added My Definition of Hacker**   By hacker I mean someone who for the most part, cannot create something from scratch. However they are very good at morphing code that others have written.
