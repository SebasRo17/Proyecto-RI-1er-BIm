I'm new in Mathematica so this is maybe super easy to do, but I can't figure out how. I've got a function `plus[a,b]` that sums two numbers and I need to implement a function `derivation[a]` that will derive the input like this:               derivation[e_Integer] (* returns 0 *)     derivation[x] (* returns 1 *)      I've got a problem with this rule:               derivation[plus[a, b]] := plus[derivation[a], derivation[b]];      When I implement it this way, it doesn't work because plus is evaluated before derivation. I.E. `derivation[plus[x, 3]]` should return `1`. Is there some other way how to implement it?
