I am new to _xAct_ packages and I'm having some problems to compute tensor quantities with _xCoba_. I defined a manifold and a metric. I computed All quantities of `MetricCompute`. What I need now is to calculare things like:               DefTensor[ G[d],M]     IndexSet[ G[h_] RiemannCd[h, a, b, c] Cd[-a][F[-b, -c]]      where `F` is antoher defined tensor. I know how to select components of a tensor, so for example, let's say that I would like to compute explicitly `G[{1,B}]` in my Chart `B`. I tried with things like:               ToBasis[B]//TraceBasisDummy//ToValues      but they don't work. I imagine that there is a simple solution to my problem, but I cannot find it. I hope that someone can help me.
