I am learning system design (on my own) and still I am not clear on a few things. Assume there is a simple application with a front-end and a database for storing of the data. In the system architecture diagram, will there be only two parts (UI and DB) or should I include some UI modules for calculations, for example? And what about hardware devices that the system is using? To give a more precise example: I have an application that is used by two types of users (one has limited access). This app uses a DB and its modules are working with an external hardware device. I am not sure how should I start with the system diagram.
