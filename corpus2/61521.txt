I am considering making a smart phone app. Before I start, I want to see whether it is worthwhile at all. Unfortunatelly, I find it very hard to find any hard evidence on how much the developers of such apps actually earn either via application purchases, or in-app advertisement. The best research I have found so far states that the average IPhone app earns 682$ per year. Then again, there are loads of apps some of which might not even work and their earnings also count towards this statistic. Therefore, I am after some specific examples of an app and its earnings.
