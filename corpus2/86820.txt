I am a java developer (web app and standalone applications) who knows JavaScript, HTML, CSS and has mostly worked on Web applications. I have no knowledge of C/C++ or any other lower level languages. I feel like I should strengthen my CS basics by learning a fundamental language. Should it be C or C++? I am also inclined to learn Objective-C. Does it need basics of C or C++? Or should I go for new languages like Python, Google's Go etc. I know this is a cliche question asked very frequently, but I can use some help here.
