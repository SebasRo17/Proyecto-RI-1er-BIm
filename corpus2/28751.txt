Let's say I have a function of the form.               Test[File_,text_]      What would be the most automated way and flexible way to generate an input cell of the form, ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/l3CUl.png) such that when you press the File Button and select `"C:\\\Users\\\path\\\testing.txt"` it autofill with the textual arguments. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nG6Mj.png) I'm quit interested to see what the Mathematica community thinks is the best technique for specifying which arguments should be File `Button`s and if it might be possible to incorporate the File buttons with Template Completion. My current code is below, which isn't generalized to all function definitions, but I knew it would be best to attempt to create a partially working solution. I used the following question to help piece a together my partially working example. * * *               MakeBoxes[replacementMarker[a_, tag_], StandardForm] ^:=        TagBox[MakeBoxes[a], tag];           replaceMark[rule_, nb_: EvaluationNotebook[], which_: All,         cell_: EvaluationCell] := (        SelectionMove[nb, which, cell];         NotebookWrite[EvaluationNotebook[],          NotebookRead[EvaluationNotebook[]] /. rule]        ) ;          CellPrint[      Cell[       BoxData[RowBox[{"Test", "[",             RowBox[{               ToBoxes@replacementMarker[              Button["Browse",               replaceMark[                file = SystemDialogInput["FileOpen"];                TagBox[_, "replaceThis"] :> "\"" <>                  StringReplace[file, "\\" -> "\\\\"]                  <> "\""                ]               ], "replaceThis"]            , ",",                TagBox[                 FrameBox["test"],                 "Placeholder"]}], "]"}]]       , "Output"]      ]
