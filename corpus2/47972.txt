I'm currently trying to find a way to eliminate from a square matrix of generic dimension the duplicate (up to sign) rows and columns, obtaining a smaller dimensional matrix. I searched around here but I couldn't find an answer, neither I managed to combine methods for list manipulation in order to arrive at my result. I'll make an example in order to clarify. Suppose I have a matrix of this form: $$ \left(\begin{array}{cccccc} x_1 & w_2 & -x_1 & -w_1 & -w_2 & w_1\\\ z_2 & x_2 & -z_2 & z_1 & -x_2 & -z_1 \\\ -x_1 & -w_2 & x_1 & w_1 & w_2 & -w_1\\\ -y_2 & y_1 & y_2 & x_3 & -y_1 & -x_3\\\ z_2 & x_2 & -z_2 & z_1 & -x_2 & -z_1\\\ y_2 & -y_1 & -y_2 & -x_3 & y_1 & x_3\\\ \end{array} \right) $$ I want to eliminate rows and columns 3,5,6, (copies of 1,2,4) ending up with the matrix $$ \left(\begin{array}{ccc} x_1 & w_2 & -w_1\\\ z_2 & x_2 & z_1\\\ -y_2 & y_1 & x_3\\\ \end{array} \right) $$ I would like to implement this operation so that it can act on matrices of arbitrary dimension. Thank you very much! Stefano
