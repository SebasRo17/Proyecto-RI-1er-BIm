I've often written this sort of function in both formats, and I was wondering if one format is preferred over another, and why.               public void SomeFunction(bool someCondition)     {         if (someCondition)         {             // Do Something         }     }      or               public void SomeFunction(bool someCondition)     {         if (!someCondition)             return;              // Do Something     }      I usually code with the first one since that is the way my brain works while coding, although I think I prefer the 2nd one since it takes care of any error handling right away and I find it easier to read
