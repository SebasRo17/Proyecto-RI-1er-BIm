I can't understand why is it that               In[88]:= Sin[2]     Out[88]= Sin[2]      while               In[89]:= Sin[2.0]     Out[89]= 0.909297      I even tried               In[90]:= 2 + Sin[2]     Out[90]= 2 + Sin[2]      thinking that it might force the evaluation, but apparently not... Now, I know that I can just do this               In[91]:= N[Sin[2]]     Out[91]= 0.909297      but I am curious why doesn't just `Sin[2]` work. Even though the _Documentation Center_ page for `Sin[x]` contains _Possible Issues_ examples this behavior is not mentioned. I know from some experience with **Python** and **C** that expressing a integer number, e.g. **2** , as a rational number, i.e. **2.0** , can influence the way an expression is evaluated, e.g.               #Python code         >>> 5 / 2     2     >>> 5 / 2.0     2.5      Even though I personally don't agree with this behavior (I think there should be different operators for _integer division_ and _rational division_ since it will always cause some confusion) if you just see some examples it becomes clear what happens. Here I don't have any idea what **Mathematica** thinks when it sees `Sin[2]` _**Note_** :   * I'm using **Mathematica v7.0**   * I'm basically a beginner.   * I don't plan and have time to go through a tutorial, I just wanted to play around. I expected the simple/common things to behave intuitively enough.   * I also appreciate if you point me to some resources where this behavior is explained.
