Is there any convention on what to capitalize in (x86) assembly? For example, which one of these 'looks best'? (Or maybe none of them do?)               [BITS 32]     %define MACRO 1     MyLabel:         MOV EAX, 2      versus               [bits 32]     %define macro 1     MY_LABEL:         mov eax, 2      versus               [Bits 32]     %define MACRO 1     MyLabel:         mov EAX, 1      versus all the other possibilities?
