So I have talked my employer into finally jumping on version control...up until now my experience with git has been for personal projects and freelance work where everything is on one server, or small scripts...so, this is a bit above my knowledge. We are going to have 3 web-serversâ€¦ test, staging, production. We are going to use beanstalk (like github) which will store our repositories remotely and beanstalk will deploy to our servers via sftp (or ssh or whatever we decide). Inside our htdocs folder we have a drupal multi-site install, and we have a bunch of stuff outside of drupal (landing pages, etc...). We would like to have all of our htdocs (except images, file folders, etc...) inside of version control. Should we use one repository with multiple branches? Or 3 separate repositories, each with one branch since they will be deploying to 3 separate servers?
