I've read about Template Method Pattern but I'm not sure about one thing. The steps (methods) of an algorithm are supposed to be in the template method. In the case my template method's algorithm is about 2 completely different tasks that I would like all my objects to perform, let's say the one is drawing and the other calculating, can I still put all these methods in one method and call this my template method?
