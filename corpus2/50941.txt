It was said such real objects of famous topological surfaces were plotted by the cooperation between mathematician Richard Palais and artist Luc Benard, and published as the cover page of _Science_ magazine (issue on Sept 22 in 2006): The cover page of _Science_ , Sept 22, 2006 Comments by Rachel Thomas ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ijaGb.jpg) How to create such surfaces with the same color, rendering, lighting and opacity effects via Mathematica? ( **answers with only similar rendering results for these surfaces one by one are also acceptable if the same rendering effects as the samples are too difficult to realize** ) Another similar question with anwser can be seen from this link: another topological surface example with answer **Surface information are** : Klein bottle; symmetric 4-noid; breather surface; Boy surface; Sievert-Enneper surface. It was said these surfaces in the figure were created via 3D-XplorMath software. **EDITS:** unfortunately it is voted as `on hold`; but I personally believe Mathematica's rendering should be powerful enough to realize such effects( at least more powerful than the open source 3D-XplorMath The author on MathOverflow); Here I add two of the surfaces obtained and rendered which are already good enough; There are documents on these surfaces from this link: documents on surfaces There are five different surfaces; I have found four of them; but only three as below look beautiful; so I will not post others here; ![Klein bottle](http://i.stack.imgur.com/toktc.gif) ![breather surface](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pN8qv.gif)               Clear["Global`*"]; (* Sievert-Enneper surface *)     \[Phi] := -u/Sqrt[c + 1] + ArcTan[Tan[u] Sqrt[c + 1]]     a := 2/(c + 1 - c Sin[v]^2 Cos[u])     r := a Sqrt[(c + 1) (1 + c Sin[u]^2)] Sin[v]/Sqrt[c]     Clear[x, y, z, p]; p =       ParametricPlot3D[{x = r Cos[\[Phi]] - 2, y = r Sin[\[Phi]],          z = ((Log[Tan[v/2]] + a (c + 1) Cos[v])/Sqrt[           c])} /. {c -> .4}, {u, -Pi/2, Pi/2}, {v, 0, Pi},        PlotPoints -> {30, 30},        PlotStyle ->         Directive[Opacity[0.65], LightPurple, Specularity[White, 20]],        Mesh -> None, RegionFunction -> Function[{x, y, z}, Abs[z] < 2.2],        Axes -> False, Boxed -> False]      ![Sievert-Enneper surface](http://i.stack.imgur.com/RgjH3.gif)
