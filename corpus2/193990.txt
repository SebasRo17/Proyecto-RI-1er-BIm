I am currently maintaining/enhancing a project a bit old speaking of the 1990's. Atleast 15 developers would have worked over it. Going through the code for understanding is bit difficult.   1. No coding standards being followed.   2. OOP concepts not clear.   3. Too many unnecessary methods and functions, also unused files.   4. Worst of all global objects (hard to determine when its created and destroyed). At times I feel should I be correcting the code so its better to work on, but my PM says we should not bother about it. As we have to finish the tasks within deadlines. This also leads to difficulties in tracking the bugs occurring. Any suggestions on how should I approach it?
