I'm able to plot two lists with a tooltip on the curves to display the name of the curve:               list1 = {{{0, 1}, {1, 2}, {2, 4}}, {{0, 3}, {1, 1}, {2, 5}}};     names = {"curve1", "curve2"};     ListLinePlot[Table[Tooltip[list1[[i]], names[[i]]], {i, Length[list1]}]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/I6GRm.png) Now I would like to evaluate this action when I click on a curve:               Manipulate[dummyFunction[nameOfTheCurve, variable], {variable , {0, 1}}]      with dummyFunction being               dummyFunction[t_, u_] := If[u == 1,       Graphics[{Green, Disk[], Black, Text[t]}],       Graphics[{Red, Disk[], Black, Text[t]}]     ]      and `nameOfTheCurve` being the name of the clicked curve. I've tried               ListLinePlot[Table[Button[list1[[i]], Manipulate[dummyFunction[names[[i]], variable], {variable , {0, 1}}]], {i,Length[list1]}]]      but this doesn't work (I can't click on the curve). What's the correct syntax? And more precisely, I would like to plot the output of dummyFunction (the Disk) under the first graph, not replacing it.
