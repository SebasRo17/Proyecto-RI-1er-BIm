I have a function `Q`, and I want to find the maximum value, the corresponding arguments for the maximum value, and the mean over a certain range of arguments. I have the following working for finding the maximum value, which works:               Best[a_, b_, c_] :=        Max[Table[Q[a, b, c, w, v, x, y, z], {w, 0, 4}, {v, 0, 4}, {x, 0, 4}, {y, 0, 4}, {z, 0, 4}]]      Unfortunately, you can't use `ArgMax` and `Mean` in the same way as `Max`. I tried the following for finding the maximum arguments:               Args[a_, b_, c_] :=         ArgMax[{           Q[a, b, c, w, v, x, y, z],            0 <= w <= 4 && 0 <= v <= 4 && 0 <= x <= 4 && 0 <= y <= 4 && 0 <= z <= 4 &&              Element[w | v | x | y | z, Integers]         },          {w, v, x, y, z}]      This is the type of error message I get: > Part::pspec: "Part specification 1 + v is neither a machine-sized integer > nor a list of machine-sized integers. I tried similarly for the mean of the function:               M[a_, b_, c_] :=        Mean[{           Q[a, b, c, w, v, x, y, z],            0 <= w <= 4 && 0 <= v <= 4 && 0 <= x <= 4 && 0 <= y <= 4 && 0 <= z <= 4 &&              Element[w | v | x | y | z, Integers]          }]      Any help would be appreciated.
