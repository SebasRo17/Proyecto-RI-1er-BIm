Generally speaking, is it better to make all the functional parts or get UI working first - or a mix of the two? Assuming you're working on something large, is it generally accepted practice to get all the functional data harvesting blobs working before any UI, get all the UI working one piece at a time as you go, or something in the middle? We all know to break work down in to manageable pieces, but the question is ultimately whether UI is included in manageable pieces I suppose. For the case of the example, consider a GUI application with one root window, but over a dozen tabs in various docks to separate different data components. Each individual tab has a relatively complex set of moving parts behind it from a functional units perspective. The example application in this particular question is here with the accompanying blog and the original commercial product.
