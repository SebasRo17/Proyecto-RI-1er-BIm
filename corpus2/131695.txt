I am just starting out in programming learning Aspect and I'm nearing the end of the introduction. I've learned about algorithms and functions and types of code and Python and briefly the basic ideas of programming. And I have to say it totally fits the description of a language it is like learning how to speak again. So what I would like to know is after this trivial and trying stages of learning just how to get into this gate of overstanding, does programming become easier and more fun? Also I would like to get an idea of how long or far into the learning process it is, before you can speak this language and do things like write an application or design on the web and all these electrifying things are graspable and doable?
