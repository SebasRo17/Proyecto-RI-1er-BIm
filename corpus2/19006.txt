In your resume, what would you classify as a Programming Language? For instance, under Programming Languages (or a similarly titled section of your resume), do you list C#, Java, C and leave it at that or do you go and add XML (because, well it is eXtensible Markup Language) and XSLT and jQuery and all that too? If you are not going to add jQuery under languages, where exactly would you put it? One resolution to this dilemma would be put in the technologies you have used under the project, but that way, you are forcing the recruiter to go through the projects that you have done rather than giving a highlight of the technologies and languages you are familiar in. What are your thoughts?
