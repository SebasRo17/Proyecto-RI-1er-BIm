I wonder if there is an easy way to convert from TableForm to Grid. I have an existing data format that uses the Table function that I’d like to prettify…. Let’s setup a nested table as follows:               params = {"A", "B", "C", "D"};  (*example, can be more *);     axes = {"x", "y", "z”}; (*fixed number*) ;     mean = {l1, l2, l3, l4, l5, l6, l7, l8, l9, l10, l11, l12}; (*example data, maybe more*);     stdev = {m1, m2, m3, m4, m5, m6, m7, m8, m9, m10, m11, m12};     stat = {n1, n2, n3, n4, n5, n6, n7, n8, n9, n10, n11, n12};     labels = {"params", "axes", "mean\[PlusMinus]stdev", "other stat"};      My data format is as follows:               expr = MapThread[{#1, {#2, #3}, #4} &, {Flatten@      Table[axes, {i, 1, Length@params}], mean, stdev, stat}];     mytable = MapThread[{#1, #2} & , {params, Partition[expr, 3]}];      Visualizing the table:               TableForm[mytable]       ![TableForm output](http://i.stack.imgur.com/13Qt0.png) I’ve been banging my head on how to format this table using Grid while maintaining the general structure of the table. Q1. **What is the best way to convert this from TableForm to a Grid.** Q2. **Is there a better data structure I could use that would allow me to use TableForm or Grid interchangeably?** Related Question: Grid - sizing and spacing problems with spanning cells
