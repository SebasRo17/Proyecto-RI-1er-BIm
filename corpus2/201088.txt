I'm a php developer working on a startup, and my friend, my partner(a developer also), who is building the startup with me, is an asp.net/C# developer. How do we work together collaboratively, as we program in two distinct languages? I know you can use Mono http://mono-project.com to design android applications, (which is java based) by writing C# codes and iOS. Is there any platform or framework we can use to create php apps by writing codes in C# or a framework that can convert C# codes to php, just like Mono?
