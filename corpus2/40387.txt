I am trying to get an equation from summing other equations but it doesn't result in a correct answer. Is there another way of doing this?               n = 4; xList = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; yList = {4, 5, 6, 8, 7};     equation[x_] = a*(x^4) + b*(x^3) + c*(x^2) + d*(x^1) + e*(x^0);     eqSummer = 0;          Do[       eqSummer = eqSummer +  equation[xList[[i]]];       , {i, 1, Length[xList]}     ];          eqSum     36768/25 + (512 c)/5 + 10 e
