If I have a view called, for example, `ViewDetails` that displays user information in labels and has a Model called `ViewDetailsModel` and if I want to allow the user to click a button to edit some of these details, is it considered bad practice is I pass the entire Model in the markup to a controller method which then assigns the values for another model, using the values stored in the Model that was passed in as a parameter to that action method? If so, should there instead be a service method that gets the data required for the edit view? For example: In the `ViewDetails` view, the user clicks the edit button which calls an action method in the controller (and passes in the Model object). The action method then uses the data in the Model object to populate another model which will be used for the `EditDetails` view that will be returned.
