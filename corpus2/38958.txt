There is a Business Cycles Map on Phaser 3.0 and I've trying to run it on _Mathematica_ the last four days without succes. The equations are $$ x_1 = (1.0 - a s)x_1 + a \left[s m + g \left(\frac{s m}{d} - x_2\right) + \mathrm{atan}(x_1 - m)\right], $$ $$ x_2 = (1.0 - d)x_2 + s m + g \left(\frac{s m}{d} - x_2\right) + \mathrm{atan}(x_1 - m) $$ with the initial conditions $$ t = 0, \quad x_1 = 17, \quad x_2 = 30, $$ and $$ a = 8.0, \quad d = 0.2, \quad g = 0.4, \quad m = 15, \quad s = 0.4. $$ ![How it is showed on Phaser](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Du8An.png) I'd just copy the result on Phaser, but i have the trial version. The code I thought it could work is this:               a = 8.0; d = 0.2; g = 0.4; m = 15; s = 0.4;     x[0] := 17; y[0] := 30;     x[t_] := x[t] = (1.0 - a s) x[t - 1] +         a (s m + (g*(((s m)/d) - y[t - 1])) + ArcTan[x[t - 1] - m])     y[t_] := y[t] = (1.0 - d) y[t - 1] + s m + (g*((s m)/d) - y[t - 1]) +         ArcTan[x[t - 1] - m]     data = Table[{x[t], y[t]}, {t, 0, 100}];     ListPlot[data, AxesLabel -> {"x[t]", "y[t]"}, Joined -> False,       PlotRange -> {{0, 30}, {25, 35}}, Mesh -> Full, PlotMarkers -> None]      But it doesn't. Any suggestions?
