On my team, we carry out code reviews (without the use of external tools). The reviewer produces a list of items which the developer should address or consider and then essentially leave them to it (after discussing with them the relevant points) without follow up on their subsequent changes. Occasional spot checks suggest that for the most part all the comments are being addressed. However, in a lot of literature on the subject of code-reviews there is a strong emphasis on verifying that the code review comments are addressed. I'm wondering what people's thoughts are on this. Does your team have (or had) issues with people not addressing comments? Does your team behave like mine and not do the verification step? If your team does do the verification step, how often is it just a rubber stamp exercise?
