I'm looking to start a new application and I want to use Dependency Injection. I have a lot of "Microsoft is the only way to go guys" in our shop so of course Unity is the way they wanted to go. However I am leaning more towards Autfac because of its speed and its Module feature. I found the speed results on this page. If you use Autofac or Unity can you give me some solid reasons not to use Unity and to use Autofac over Unity? If not, can you point me into a good direction to do some research on bringing back to our next meeting?
