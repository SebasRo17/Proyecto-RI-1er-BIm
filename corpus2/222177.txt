I am currently writing a transformation from model space to clip space for use in OpenGL. From what i have seen, programmers typically use a traditional rectangular frustum to define the clipping boundaries in their model space. I personally had in mind a shape like a frustum, except the near and far planes are spheres centered at the apex of the frustum (the camera). So something that looks like this: ![Circular sector](http://i.stack.imgur.com/i05pA.png) The yellow region corresponds to OpenGL's clip space, and the two spheres (depicted as circles in this cross-section image) correspond to OpenGL's z=-1 (inner sphere) and z=1 (outer sphere). Is this a more realistic way to model the projection, or should i stick with the traditional rectangular frustum when designing my projection matrix?
