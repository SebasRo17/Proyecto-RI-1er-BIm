I want to find the integer values $k$ so that `D[f[x], x]` has integer solutions. I tried               f[x_] := 2 x^3 - 3 (m - 1) x^2 + k * (m + 2)*(m - 3) x + 1     g := D[f[x], x]     d = Discriminant[g, x]     Reduce[{d == 0, -10 <= k <= 10}, {k, m}, Integers]      I got               (m == -3 && k == 4) || (m == 1 && k == 0) || (m == 7 && k == 3/2)      As you can see in the last solution `k=3/2` which is definitely not an integer, as I have specified in the domain used by `Reduce`. Is this a bug? Can anyone comment on this?
