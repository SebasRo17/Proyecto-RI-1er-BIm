At my company, I find that there are some days that there are very few tasks to do. I make it a point to do research to learn new things about my craft on these days. I would say that on average, I have about one day per week that there is not much to do (or some combination of time over the week). I would like to know if this is a common situation in software development environments, and does the answer to this question vary between full-time and contract work.
