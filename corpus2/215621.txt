When creating constructors with multiple arguments, is ok to use the generic `String[] args` or is it better to list the arguments? Does it really make any significant difference as the coding becomes more complicated?               public static void Something (String[] args)      {     }      or               public static void Something (String lots, ... int some, ... etc)      {     }
