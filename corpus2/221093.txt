One of the things that Valve's Steam distribution platform is known for is its Custom Executable Generation system, which creates a unique copy of a program for each person that buys it. I'm sure that Valve isn't the only company or person to have implemented or thought of implementing such a system, however. If I wanted to try and roll my own system that generated executable files on the server side that are unique to the downloader or their account, what would I need to know how to do? What are the basics of such a system in the first place?
