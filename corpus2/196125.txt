Lets says I have a `Car`class:               public class Car     {         public string Engine { get; set; }         public string Seat { get; set; }         public string Tires { get; set; }     }      Lets say we're making a system about a parking lot, I'm going to use a lot of the `Car` class, so we make a `CarCollection` class, it may has a few aditionals methods like `FindCarByModel`:               public class CarCollection     {         public List<Car> Cars { get; set; }              public Car FindCarByModel(string model)         {             // code here             return new Car();         }     }      If I'm making a class `ParkingLot`, what's the best practice? **Option #1:**               public class ParkingLot     {         public List<Car> Cars { get; set; }         //some other properties     }      **Option #2:**               public class ParkingLot     {         public CarCollection Cars { get; set; }         //some other properties     }      Is it even a good practice to create a `ClassCollection` of another `Class`?
