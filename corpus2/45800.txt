Let's say I want to calculate the following scalar-by-matrix derivative $$\frac{\partial}{\partial A} \text{tr} \left[(\vec X^T A)^T (\vec X^T A)\right],$$ with $\vec X$ and $A$ being a $n \times 1$ and a $n \times m$ matrix, respectively. Is there a way in Mathematica to get the result $$2 \vec X (\vec X^T A)$$ without explicitly defining (for instance)               n=3     m=2     A=Array[a,{n,m}]     X=Array[x,{n,1}]      and calculating               D[Tr[Transpose[Transpose[X].A].Transpose[X].A],{A}]      ? The problem with this approach is that the Mathematica result cannot be easily cast back into an human-readable form like $$2 \vec X (\vec X^T A).$$
