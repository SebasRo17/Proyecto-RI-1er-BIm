If I wanted to solve equations like Cos[x]^2 = A Cos[Bx + C] + D what function should I use? The Solve function seems to only solve for as many variables as there are equations. Please note that my given equation is only an example of what I would like to do. I am not asking for the solution to that specific equation. I know I could use TrigReduce, but I would like to know how to do this more generally for expressions that aren't even trigonometric. I also know I could sample Cos[x]^2 and just do a fit with those parameters, but I was looking for a cleaner, non-numeric way of solving this. Is this possible? edit: It now looks like SolveAlways is the right function for the task, but unfortunately it doesn't solve my example equation.
