I would like to create a map which will show lakes and rivers together with elevation contours and contour labels. What is the simplest way to do this with `GeoGraphics` in version 10? The solution I have (below) looks much too convoluted. * * * I need to plot this point on the map:               pos = WeatherData["KP60", "Coordinates"]      This is good, except the background is not what I need:               g = GeoGraphics[{PointSize[Large], Darker@Red, Point[pos]}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8BHhV.png) Since I can't seem to mix two `GeoStyle`s, I tried overlaying a polygon that contains the contours. This lead to the following:               {range, projection} = {GeoRange, GeoProjection} /. Options[g, {GeoRange, GeoProjection}]          {a, b, d, c} = Tuples[Reverse@range]          GeoGraphics[{{GeoStyling["ContourMap", ContourShading -> None,  ContourLabels -> True], Polygon[{a, b, c, d}]}, {PointSize@Large, Darker@Red, Point[pos]}}, GeoRange -> range]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XNRp5.png) However, now the projection has changed, and adding `GeoProjection -> projection` causes the polygon not to show. Is there a fix for this?
