I have an interactive demonstration, which (very simplified to leave out unnecessary details) looks as follows:                   Manipulate[      Show[{        Plot[{x, a*x}, {x, -1, 1}, PlotRange -> {-1, 1}],        RegionPlot[x < y < a*x, {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1}]        }], {a, 0.5, 1.5}]      On the screen I see this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Q8NIX.jpg). I draw the arrow to point out a defect in the shading: the shading does not cover a narrow triangle in the vicinity of the coordinates origin, though it should. More than that. The degree of shading varies as I move the slider. I could, of course, use the option "Filling" in the Plot statement and remove the RegionPlot at all. I need, however, the filling to show the region where one of the lines is above the other. It seemed that the RegionPlot is in this case a more natural choice. Can you imagine a workaround with the RegionPlot, or I should inevitably go to Filling in the Plot statement?
