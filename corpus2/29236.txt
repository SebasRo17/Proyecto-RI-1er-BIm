Apologies for the long question title, but I couldn't come up with something shorter to describe the following. Starting with a clean session, there are no symbols in, let's say, `myContext`:               Names["myContext`*"]     (* {} *)      But if I now evaluated this If statement,               If[False, myContext`mySymbol = "value"]      all of the sudden `mySymbol` has been created in `myContext`:               Names["myContext`*"]     (* {"myContext`mySymbol"} *)      but, as expected, `mySymbol` doesn't have a value:               myContext`mySymbol     (* myContext`mySymbol *)      My question is twofold: why has `mySymbol` been created, and how can I prevent this from happening?
