With so many ORM tools for most modern languages, is there still a use case for writing and executing SQL in a program, in a language/environment that supports them? If so why? **For clarity:** I'm not asking about if programmers need to know SQL, or if I should have a SQL tool on my desktop. I'm asking specifically why I might have it _in code_ (or config, or whatever) as opposed to an ORM.
