I have many times seen various benchmarks that show how a bunch of languages perform on a given task. Always these benchmarks reveal that Python is slower then Java and faster than PHP. And I wonder why is that the case.   * Java, Python, and PHP run inside a virtual machine   * All three languages convert their programs into their custom byte codes that run **on top of** OS -- so none is running natively   * Both Java and Python can be "complied" (`.pyc` for Python) but the `__main__` module for Python is not compiled Python and PHP are dynamically typed and Java statically -- is this the reason Java is faster, and if so, please explain how that affects speed. And, even if the dynamic-vs-static argument is correct, this does not explain why PHP is slower than Python -- because both are dynamic languages. You can see some benchmarks here and here, and here
