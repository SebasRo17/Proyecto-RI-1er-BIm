I came across these essays the other day whilst dreaming of becoming a Lisp hacker: http://paulgraham.com/yahoo.html, http://paulgraham.com/gba.html and they crystallised for me that the reason for the unrelenting failure I'm seeing in so many software projects I find myself working on is that programming is seen as a low-end commodity resource that is an afterthought in comparison to the heavyweight layers of non-technical management that strategise above the code. Given our commodity nature, what practical steps can we take to inspire hacker culture in our fellow commodities?
