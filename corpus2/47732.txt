Are there any standard surveys or questions that are useful for gauging software engineer or programmer job satisfaction? I hypothesize that determining software engineers' attitudes toward their jobs can reveal problems within an organization. I'm thinking about questions such as the following:   * Are you reaching your full potential?   * Are you learning or improving skills that you could put on a resume?   * Are your skills valued within the company?   * Are your skills utilized?   * Is your voice heard?   * Do you have a mentor?   * Are you satisfied with your supervisor's leadership?   * Are you able to experiment and try new ideas? Obviously the questions would need to be tweaked to get useful answers from a survey.
