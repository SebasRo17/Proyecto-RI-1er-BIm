What is the best way to query data from a MS SQL Server in C Sharp? I know that it is not good practice to have an SQL query in the code. Is the best way to create a stored procedure and call it from C Sharp with parameters?               using (var conn = new SqlConnection(connStr))     using (var command = new SqlCommand("StoredProc", conn) {                                 CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure }) {        conn.Open();        command.ExecuteNonQuery();        conn.Close();     }
