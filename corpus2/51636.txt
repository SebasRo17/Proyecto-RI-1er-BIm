I am plotting 3D points and it occurs to me that Mathematica doesn't have an easy way to specify my points to be plotted in a uniformly scaled cartesian space. For example I plotted               Show[ListPointPlot3D[{{0, 0, 0}, {1, 2, 3}}], AspectRatio -> Automatic,  PlotRange -> Automatic]      And I get this: ![0,0,0 and 1,2,3](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rb0oi.png) I would like to be looking at a box with the dimensions 1,2,3, not something like 3,3,1. The AspectRatio and PlotRange do not help, by the way.
