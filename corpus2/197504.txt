Normally I start a project working on a site, I'd do the basic html skeleton and then start tweaking the styles using CSS. Slowly I'd just add one CSS rule after another with no "organized structure" or groupings in the CSS rules. And at the end of the project I look at the CSS document and the abomination I have created. Often spending quite some time trying to search for the spot in the document where I added a certain style. Is there some type of 'rule-of-thumb' that one can use in laying out and getting more organized in your CSS documents? And I'm not just talking about adding comments...
