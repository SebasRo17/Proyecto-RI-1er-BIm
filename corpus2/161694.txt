I wrote a program which scrape internet sites. It is pretty straigtforward because it process link one by one. With the limiting factor of the internet speed, the process is rather slow. I wonder, how can I make it multiprocess? The modules of python is confusing. I don't know the difference between subprocess and multiprocess. I've heard that multiprocessing is difficult and ineffective because of the GIL since python 2.x. I am using Python 3.2, so I wonder if things have been improved.
