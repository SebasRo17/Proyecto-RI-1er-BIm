Our test automation team writes tons of automation tests for our WEB application, but it seems to me that their code is becoming way too complex and warrants that someone will test it as well. Is there a best practice for writing these automation tests? I'll appreciate any answer with concrete inputs from someone who experienced this problem. If it matters - we are using jSystem for automating our WEB application tests - if there are frameworks which simplify life - I'd like to hear about them.
