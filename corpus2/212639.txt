I have a number of (large) test files that need to be maintained. This means access to their history is a requirement. **Benefits**   * Any new developers get the entire test suite with just a `git pull`.   * The history of the files is backed up.   * The files themselves are backed up. **Drawbacks**   * Huge increase in size of repository.   * Huge increase in download size of new developers copying the repository. What are the best practices for maintaining test files? Do I store these files in source control? Are there any alternatives?
