Premise: I know that such a game would be better solved by MCTS, however, from a theoretical point of view, would it be possible to apply minimax to a bayesian multiplayer game where the order of playing is determined by result of the previous turn? Game description:   * Players: {A,B,C,D} (A and C are the maximizing team while B and D are the minimizing team)   * Bayesian to set for example players' cards.   * Turn 1: A->B->C->D   * Turn 2(the order depends of the actual epilogue of Turn 1): C->D->A->B   * Turn 3: B->C->D->A   * ...   * Turn N: game ends. My feeling is that wouldn't be possible because after Turn 1 finished, in minimax standard definition, I must be able to start the next turn from a known player, while chance should be only applied to game's payoffs. Any opinion would be helpful.
