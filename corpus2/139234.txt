Several people have forked my github repo but they have not fetched-merged from upstream. So my original repo has evolved significantly since the fork took place, and meanwhile these people are showing an old outdated version of my work, which kind of makes me look bad (e.g. what they're displaying is incomplete, contains bugs that I've fixed since then, etc.). These people apparently don't understand what a fork is for; they just push the fork button (perhaps as a way of saying "this is cool") and then walk away. Ideally what I'd like is for them either to keep their fork updated from upstream or make a significant contribution or delete the fork. Is there anything I can do about this? (There isn't, is there? This is just the price of being open source, isn't it?)
