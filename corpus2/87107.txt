The way I see it is if you write code that does something useful then you're a software engineer but from what I gather QA engineers seem to have an inferiority complex. It seems like QA engineers are much less reluctant to call themselves programmers than software engineers. Are there any real reasons for this divide and the perception that software engineers are the "real" programmers?
