Given is an integer with the value 5. Given is a range with start and end values of 2 and 5. So is the integer 5 now between the range? What should a 'InBetween()' method return and which one is the correct representation of 'between':               int val = 5                    if(val >= 2 && val <= 5) // would return true                    if(val > 2 && val < 5) // would return false
