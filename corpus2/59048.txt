I can plot a sphere of the form x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = ...., but when I try:               RegionPlot3D[(x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 + (z - 3)^2 = 14, {x, -1, 1}, {y, -1, 1}, {z, -1, 1}]      I get an error: > >     Set::write: Tag Plus in 4. +9. +16. is Protected. >> >   which I don't understand at all. I can't find examples of such equations plotted either.
