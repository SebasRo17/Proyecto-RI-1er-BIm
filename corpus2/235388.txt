I recently found a package (JavaBuilders) that I like and I think will help develop on my project but it has some issues:   * No longer being developed (last commit on github >1 year ago)   * Lack of activity implies no longer supported by Developers   * No noticeable community implies it is not supported by a larger userbase For all I know this package is dead and any issues we have will be insurmountable without a large re-write to remove it's use in the Worst Case Scenario. Separately (probably worth another question) if this package is not widely known, it'll increase lead-in time for any new members who join the team. Is there a more reliable way to gauge the use of a package, to see if it's 'supportable' and flexible enough (e.g. if we want it to do feature X we can't go back to a developer who has vanished from developing the package) to not put the project at risk?
