I just finished college a couple of months ago and im taking time out to improve my knowledge. I love programming but i feel like i dont know enough to be confident if I went for an interview. Last night i was browsing through questions and came across a question that asks interviewees how to work out a linked list. I learned these at college but if i was asked on the spot how to do it i wouldnt know. So that's another thing added to the list of what to learn. This is when the anxiety hit me because i have so much to learn in so little time (at least it feels that way). Upon introspection i think this anxiety is related to my perfectionism even though being perfect isnt rational e.g. Shakespeare and Einstein failed 80% of the time. So the questions are, have you felt this anxiety of not knowing enough? If so, how did you deal with it? I suppose there's a point in time when you begin to feel comfortable in your abilities?
