I have a `Manipulate` construct with a square `Graphic` on the left side and all the controls placed on the right side. There are so many (and also pretty large) control items, however, that they take up about double the vertical space of the graphic. Is there a simple way to place the controls into two seperate columns (like in the sketch below)?                _________     |         | Control 1 | Control 4     | Graphic | Control 2 | Control 5     |_________| Control 3 | Control 6      I could do something similar using `Item` and `Grid`, but as far as I know, in such a construct the default control syntax wouldn't work and I'd have to re- program all the controls with `Dynamic`. It seems `ControlPlacement` also does not support multiple columns. **Edit:** To be clear: I'm trying to find a solution that preserves as much of `Manipulate`'s properties as possible, i.e. things like alignment, labeling and using default control types.
