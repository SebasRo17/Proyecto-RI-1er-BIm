I can't find this now but I've read it before on various blogs discussing the topic. I'll give an example and hopefully it's clear (albeit it may not clarify anything at all). Given this piece of markup (arbitrary on purpose):               <div class="myWrapper">       <a href="somepage.url" class="img">         <img url="someimage.url">       </a>     </div>     <div class="yourWrapper">       <a href="somepage.url" class="img">         <img url="someimage.url">       </a>     </div>      While the CSS could read like this:               .myWrapper .img img {border: thin black solid;}     .myWrapper .img {margin:10px;}     .yourWrapper .img img {border: thick red dashed;}     .yourWrapper .img {margin:20px;}      It could also be written like this:               .myWrapper {       .img {          margin:10px;         img {             border: thin black solid;         }       }     }     .yourWrapper {       .img {          margin:10px;         img {             border: thick red dashed;         }       }     }      But I can't remember seeing where that was discussed or if it's something in the works. Anybody know what the hell I'm talking about? And I don't think this is an SO question or I would've put it on SO.
