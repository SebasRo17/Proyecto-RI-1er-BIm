I have a text file containing many, many lines of text like `test` in the following:               test = "word  123  456    7890.000      0.12000";      I would like to extract all of the "string representations of integers." However, I need to be clear about what I would like. In `test` above, I would like the output to be:               {"123", "456"}      since I am only interested in _actual_ , _isolated_ (delimited by spaces) string representations of integers. Yes, `7890` is an integer, but in `test` above, it is not isolated, so I do not want my function to return it (since `7890.000` is a decimal). In the case of `test`, I could use this:               StringCases[test, Repeated[DigitCharacter, 3]][[1 ;; 2]]      which returns               {"123", "456"}      However, this is not general, because my string may contain more than two string representations of integers. So I would like my function to also take this input:               test = "word  123  456  123    7890.000      0.12000";      and return:               {"123", "456", "123"}      I have thought about using `StringSplit` followed by `ToExpression` and `IntegerQ`, but this seems like it would be very (unnecessarily?) complicated. Perhaps Mathematica has something better built in that I can use? Do you have any advice? Thanks!
