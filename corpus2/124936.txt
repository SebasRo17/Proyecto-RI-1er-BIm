If I publish some software on my website which can be downloaded and used free of charge, do I still need a disclaimer? I mean, I am not even selling anything, there is no contract, so why should there be an _implied warranty_? (Which also makes me wonder why there are disclaimers on things like the MIT license.) **Edit:** I am not a US citizen, I am kind of looking for answers as general as possible and as specific as necessary.
