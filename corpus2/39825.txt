I am trying to compute a Voronoi diagram bounded by a box. In some cases, the points used to compute the diagram form a diagram such that at least two boundary points are within the same polygon. For Example:               centres = {{0, 1250}, {4750, 2000}, {-2500, -2500}, {500, 750}};     boundaries = {{10000, 10000}, {-10000,          10000}, {-10000, -10000}, {10000, -10000}};     {diagvert, diagval} = BoundedDiagram[boundaries, centres];      With the Voronoi diagram: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Hbg4q.jpg) This leads to the error: > BoundedDiagram::notuniq: BoundedDiagram requires that boundary vertices lie > in unique Voronoi polygons. Since I am trying to generalize the scenario, I can't design a specific boundary for the points, and I would like to use a general big enough boundary. Is there any way to allow multiple boundary points within the same polygon? Or perhaps a different approach?
