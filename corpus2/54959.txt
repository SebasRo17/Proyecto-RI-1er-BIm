Consider the code defining two constants:               a=Cos[t]     b=Sin[t]      Suppose that we have another value in terms of `Cos[t]` and `Sin[t]`, for example,               c=2*Cos[t]+Sin[t]^2      How to show the result of `c` in terms of `a` and `b`, that is, instead of the line above I'd like my computations being showed as               c=2*a+b^2      In other words, how to ask Mathematica to recognize `Cos[t]` as `a`?
