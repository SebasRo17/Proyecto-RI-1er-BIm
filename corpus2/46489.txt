I have five histograms, `hist1 = Histogram[data1, 20]`, to which I append `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}` via `Data1 = Map[{#, 1} &, hist1]`, and then plot * * *  ![3DHistogram](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XAmoQ.jpg) * * *               Histogram3D[{Data1, Data2, Data3, Data4, Data5}, 10,        ChartLegends -> Etc, Boxed -> False,        FaceGrids -> {Bottom, Front, Left}, ChartStyle -> "Pastel",        Ticks -> {Automatic, None, Automatic},        AxesLabel -> {"x","y","z"}]      I cannot see how to control the width of the histograms (in the _y_ -direction). Right now there is a gap between the 1st and the 2nd, etc. What control am I missing?
