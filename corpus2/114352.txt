Being careful is usually enough to prevent problems, but sometimes I need to double check the branch I'm working on ( _e.g._ "hmm... I'm in the `dev` branch, right?") by checking the source control path of a random file. In looking for an easier way, I thought of naming the solution files accordingly ( _e.g._ `MySolution_Dev.sln`) but with different file names in each branch, I can't merge the solution files. It's not that big of a deal but are there any methods or "small tricks" you use to quickly ensure you're in the correct branch? I'm using Visual Studio 2010 with TFS 2008.
