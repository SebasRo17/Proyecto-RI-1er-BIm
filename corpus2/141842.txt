I have two related questions:   1. Are there any good books for multithreading in C++, especially now that C++11 contains multithreading in the standard library?    2. I have the Wrox Programming on Unix book (1000 pages fat red one) and within it, it uses the Unix Thread class.      * How does this code relate to boost and the C++11 multithreading libraries?      * Is it better/worse/just specific to Unix etc?      * Is the performance the same?
