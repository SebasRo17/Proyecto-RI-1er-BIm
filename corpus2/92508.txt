I work at a place that is CVS-crazy and Bugzilla-nuts.   1. There are so many branches off each release that one cannot count them. Everyone is constantly auto-merging.    2. There is no _fluidity_ at this job. Everything feels _lock-step_. It takes 25 steps even for a simple thing. It's not like being on a factory production line: it's like setting up a factory myself every day. Example situation: To fix a single bug, first I obtain a clean, new virtual machine. Then I create a branch for that single bug fix, based on another branch described in the Bugzilla report. I install the branch on the machine, set that up. I fix the bug. I check it in, leaving it and the machine for others to test with. Then I have to go into the bug control software and explain what I did and write a test case, with all the steps. Eventually someone else merges it with a release. No matter how tiny the bug is, I have to do all of these things. Sometimes people combine work on multiple bugs, but as I said there are so many branches that this is hardly possible. At any other job, I'd just go in and fix the bug. I barely even remember using SCM, although every job I've had has used it: that's because at every other job, they somehow kept it _out of the way_. _Is there a point at which the process gets in the way and becomes an end unto itself? Is that even engineering?_
