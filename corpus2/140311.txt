Any .NET developer who is interested in different programming languages knows that F# is the most popular functional language for the .NET platform nowadays. The only fact describing the popularity of F# is the great support of Microsoft. But we are not limited with F# at all. There are some other functional languages on the .NET platform. I'm very disappointed with the fact that Nemerle isn't well-known. It's an awesome language which supports three paradigms: object-oriented, functional and meta- programming. I won't try to explain why I like it so much. The problem is that I can't use it at work. I think that only really brave companies can rely on Nemerle. It's almost unknown, that's why it's hard to find new developers for the project. Noone wants to make a first step with Nemerle if it can influence the budget what is reasonable. So, here is a question: **what can I do to make Nemerle more popular?** Here are my first ideas:   * implement open-source projects using Nemerle;   * make presentations on different conferences;   * write articles.
