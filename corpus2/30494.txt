I have noted that in Mathematica 9 my code, which involves a lot of calls to NDSolve, slows down considerably after some time. Apparently, the problem is NDSolve itself and it seems to be related to Mathematica 9, as the following example shows:               RunNDSolve :=  Timing[Do[NDSolve[{f''[x] == -f[x], f[0] == 1, f'[0] == 0},{f[x]}, {x, 0, 1}], {1000}]][[1]]      RunNDSolve integrates a simple differential equation 1000 times using NDSolve and returns the time needed to carry out the integrations. In Mathematica 9, RunNDSolve takes longer and longer times as it is called again, as the following example shows:               Table[{j, RunNDSolve}, {j, 50}]      In Mathematica 9 (extract of the full result):               j, RunNDSolve     1, 0.712     10, 2.649000     20, 4.869000     30, 7.326000     50, 13.372000      In Mathematica 8 (extract of the full result):               j, RunNDSolve     1, 0.5880000000000001`     10, 0.593`     20, 0.5719999999999992`     30, 0.5670000000000002`     40, 0.5770000000000017`     50, 0.5850000000000009`      Does anyone have an idea what the problem could be and how to fix it?
