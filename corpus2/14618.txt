I'm 10 months out of school and I lost my first programming job last week. I personally know a lot about different stuff - just look at my StackOverflow account, but I don't feel I have the professional experience necessary to ask more in salary. For example, I was told they were looking for a mid-level person at $75k/year. I told him I wasn't sure where I fell. He asked me where I could fall, so I said I was worth only $50k/year - which was close to my last salary. The guy told me I wasn't what they were looking for. How do I not undersell myself when looking for a job, while remaining honest?
