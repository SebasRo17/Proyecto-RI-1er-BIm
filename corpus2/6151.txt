I am using a `Manipulate` control to show different calculations for the same user-specified parameters. I would like to show the results for the calculation the user selected and also provide some formatted text to describe how I arrived at the result. So as a test I placed the formatted text in a `Cell` set as `Text` and assigned that cell to a variable. I then show in a `Table` the results of the calculation and the text cell. What I'm finding is that the text displays the _Mathematica_ functions which are used to format the text instead of just displaying the formatted text. If I use `CellPrint` for this text variable I can get the cell to display properly in the notebook. `CellPrint` however returns `Null` so I can't pass it's value to my `Dynamic` or `Manipulate` controls. Let me show an example of my code:               testText1 :=       Cell[TextData[{Cell[          BoxData[FormBox[SuperscriptBox["R", "*"], TraditionalForm]],           FormatType -> "TraditionalForm"], " = Rate of star formation = 10 "}],        "Text", CellChangeTimes -> {{3.547210260347546*^9, 3.547210296541616*^9}}]          CellPrint[testText1]          Manipulate[      Switch[testStatChoice, 1,        testText1], {{testStatChoice, 1,         "Select Calculation"}, {1 -> "1: First Calculation Example"},        ControlType -> PopupMenu}]      I have hunted around for other methods or properties that will allow me to display my paragraphs of text with equations within an `Manipulate` but haven't yet found a solution. Edit: So I am now headed in the right direction. So a trimmed down version of what I have so far is the following: [Code sample deleted. Look at final solution below.] My issue is with the 2nd, 3rd and 4th paragraphs. The text continues onto the next line but it gets indented. Edit2: I solved the line indenting issue with RowBoxes that continue onto another line by wrapping the RowBox with a StyleBox and setting the LineIndent property to 0.0 for that StyleBox. You may have also noticed that I was using spaces for my indenting of my code lines. That was ugly and I replaced that with AdjustmentBoxes that have BoxMargins set so that the line was indented to my preference. I am going to delete my large code insert above and replace it below with my fixed end result. I still have an issue with my last paragraph but I think I should be able to solve it.               stat1TestText :=        DisplayForm[        Column[{Cell[           "This statistic is calculated by adding up from the beginning \     of the Milky Way the time it took for the first Sun-like stars to \     come into existence, the time that elapsed on Earth for life to start \     on Earth once the Sun had formed and the time it takes for new life \     to come into existence based on the given set of Drake Equation \     Parameters."],           StyleBox[           RowBox[{"The last number to calculate is the amount of time (on \     average) that it would take for life to come into existence given the \     first 4 parameters of the Drake Equation", " (",              SuperscriptBox["R", "*"], " = rate of star formation, ",              SubscriptBox["f", "p"], " = fraction of stars with planets, ",              SubscriptBox["n", "e"],              " = # of planets that could support life, and ",              SubscriptBox["f", "l"],              " = fraction that develop life).
