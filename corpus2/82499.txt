I want to add logging to an application I'm currently working on. I've added logging before, that's not an issue here. But from a design perspective in an object-oriented language, what are the best practices for logging that follow OOP and patterns? _**Note:_** I'm currently doing this in C#, so examples in C# are obviously welcome. I would also like to see examples in Java and Ruby. * * * **Edit:** I'm using log4net. I just don't know what's the best way to plug it in.
