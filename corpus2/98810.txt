I understand the concept of CSS. But on many projects I've found that I tend to lose myself and end up with a millions CSS files for a millions different pages! I realise that the point of CSS is that it cascades. Otherwise it would just be a style sheet! I would just like people to shed some light on how they use CSS to its full potential! On my current website I've got a MasterPage and one css file for that. then for all the sub pages i tend to write a separate css for every 5 pages or so. I dont like my css files to be HUGE cos then i just get confused. How do you do it? I find it hard to comprehend that some people use one css file for the WHOLE website. or is that the done thing?
