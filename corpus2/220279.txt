I'm impressed with the efficiency of some algorithms and I noticed the way the problem is solved can be and/or appear really unintuitive. It may sound dumb, but I would like to know:   * **How do the authors come up with amazing algorithms? Do they just keep thinking about the problem and end up with the answer? Are they geniuses?**   * Which leads me to my next question: **how long do they take to find the solution? Hours, days, months, years?** I know there isn't a definite answer to these questions. But I would like to know how it usually works regarding the most used/known algorithms.
