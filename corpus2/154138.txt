I have just moved from Linux to Windows, and I have to use the Zend Framework library. Where should the library be placed?   * Directly on C drive   * Create a lib folder like C:/lib/    * Create a lib folder in my user folder I am wondering if there is a classic folder where these kind of libraries are placed. **Update** :I am asking about the location on my own standpoint. The Zend Framework library is a PHP framework.
