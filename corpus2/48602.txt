I'm not a software expert but need to outsource a web-based scientific GUI application, and I'm considering Adobe Flex. My math routines are currently in Javascript and C/C+. Having no experience with Flex, was hoping someone could help me understand what options are available for performing (preferably fast and efficient) CLIENT-side calculations. That is, can Flex interact with Javascript and/or C easily? If not, is actionscript or other language preferred? Downsides/tradeoffs? Need functions like LOG10, LN, SQRT, and would be nice to also have the error function (ERF) and complementary error function (ERFC), although I may be able to derive these last two from more basic functions if necessary. Thanks!
