I was thinking it would be nice if I could export Mathematica expressions as svg, but I am having some issues. At first blush everything seems to work fine. This piece of code does produce a svg file:               res = Solve[x^2 + a x + 1 == 0, x]     Export["res.svg", res]      The problem with the svg file are the fonts. If I try to open the file in Adobe Illustrator I get this message:               SVGMathematica2Mono:          Font not found on the system; missing font has been substituted.     - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -           SVGCourier:          Font not found on the system; missing font has been substituted.     - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -      The end result looks like this: ![SVG issues](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DpEev.png) It looks bad in several other svg viewers as well. Is there some way to either embed the needed fonts in the svg file or convert the expression to a graphic and export it as such?
