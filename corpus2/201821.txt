I have a product that lets game developers create games. Inside of their games they are required to give all the elements of their games GUIDs. I've told them that they need to generate their guids using a specific mechanism, but they seem to think that it won't cause any issues. What I'm concerned about is GUID collisions between games. Some developers just sequentially increment the last digit of their GUID, others zero out the last block and increment other parts, well others just pull together a random armada of numbers and letters for each one. My argument is that by doing this it dramatically increases the risk of colliding with other games that are both following the standard, and those that don't. Just as a heads up there are potentially hundreds of thousands of GUIDs involved here. Am I right in thinking this, or is it really improbable that this will really happen?
