Currently trying to use elements from a matrix in defining a function however having some trouble. This is a somewhat simplified version of the problem. Say I have the matrix               m={{Sin[x],Cos[x]},{Tan[x],ArcTan[x]}}      And I want to define a function in terms of the first element. How would I go about doing this ? Have tried               f[x_]:=m[[1,1,1]]      This seems to work until I try and evaluate it for a value of x.Then it just returns Sin[x]. Any help would be much appreciated.
