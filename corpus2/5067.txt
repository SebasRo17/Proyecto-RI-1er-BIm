I want to have a function (called `otimes`) with the following two properties:   1. it has the attribute `OneIdentity` and `Flat`   2. if evaluated with a single argument it returns that argument The built-in function `Times` has these properties; e.g., evaluating `Times[a]` yields `a`. I am struggling implementing my own function having the same behavior. What I tried is the obvious implementation               SetAttributes[otimes,{OneIdentity,Flat}]     otimes[a_]:=a      However this does not work and leads to an infinite recursion when I evaluate otimes[a,b]. I do not now how to implement the desired behavior consistently. Maybe somebody can help?
