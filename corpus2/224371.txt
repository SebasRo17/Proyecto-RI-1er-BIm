I need help creating view models for the following scenario:   1. Deep, hierarchical data    2. Multiple views for the same set of data   3. Each view is a single, dynamically-changing view, based on the active selection   4. Depending on the value of a property, display different types of tabs in a tab control ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dIvrO.png) My questions: **Should I create a view-model representation for each view (VM1, VM2, etc)?**               1. Yes:         a. Should I model the entire hierarchical relationship? (ie, SubVM1, HouseVM1, RoomVM1)         b. How do I keep all hierarchies in sync? (e.g, adding/removing nodes)          2. No:         a. Do I use a huge, single view model that caters for all views?      Here's an example of a single view Figure 1: Multiple views updated based on active room. Notice Tab control ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YQ0qj.png) Figure 2: Different active room. Multiple views updated. Tab control items changed based on object's property. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bfZIC.png) Figure 3: Different selection type. Entire view changes ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ta17v.png)
