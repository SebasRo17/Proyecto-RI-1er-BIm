This is my first question on stackoverflow, so please bear with me. I'm trying to stay away from any form of trolling or flame baiting as i have a tremendous respect for both languages. I'm a python programmer (though not an expert) and i love it. My first language was C++. My line of work (web development) is pushing me towards other languages like php and javascript. Recently, I've been very excited by Ruby's increasing popularity. However I used to be under the impression that Python and Ruby were so close that there was little point in trying to learn and master both. But I get the sense that I was wrong, hence my question : I'd like to hear from python programmers who have either switched entirely to ruby or added ruby to their toolset. What specific benefits did you get from switching (entirely or partially) to Ruby from Python ? Ideally I'd like to hear from real world experiences.
