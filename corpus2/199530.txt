So, I got a table _UserProfiles_ in my database, that, similar to C#'s Settings file, holds a property with the appropriate datatype and the specified setting in the profile. Now each time I add a new setting, I need to update the database, the model and end up rewriting the queries. I've then thought about changing the table to only contain two columns: _Key_ and _Value_ with a varchar datatype to store the users settings... But what is considered to be best practice in such design-questions? Is this approach advisable (for example because it needs custom parsing from string to the needed datatype)?
