Here is my issue. On my _Layout, I have a help button that shows up on every page in my MVC application. Is there a way to assign the Viewbag with my simple model without having to put in every ActionResult method throughout my application? A global method?               public ActionResult Index()     {        var query = db.OnlineHelp.Where(a => a.PageUrl == Request.RawUrl).FirstOrDefault();        ViewBag.htmlraw = query.PageContent     }      and on my _Layout.chtml               @Html.Raw(@ViewBag.htmlraw)      The Request.RawUrl tracks the user and depending on the page, the database is queried and returns the result such as /Home/Index
