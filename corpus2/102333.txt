I work at a medium sized software corp. in India (abt 6,500 employees). This company has a star performer policy; basically they select a person from each "grade" every quarter and give her the award(some gift vouchers and a trophy). Well, not that I am jealous ... but a colleague just got the award and I sort of feel left out. I cant seem to get over the fact that I didn't get it. Do these awards actually provide any benefit to a Programmers career? Do other programmers think more highly of programmers who have won these awards?
