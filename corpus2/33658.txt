While executing code it is normal to get the messages like shdw,argx etc. I wanted to know if there is anyway i can store all these messages into a array or a variable so that i can pinpoint where the error occurred. The scenario is that i have written few functions in webmathematica and deployed the files on the server. So in future if there are any issues with those functions i want to use the errors(messages) and convert these errors into diff user defined http requests(in turn used to send a mail containing these messages).
