I am using spring xml mapping and I have to handle a request that is coming from sms gateway and I want to send the response as SMS. My scenario is like   1. user sends sms from mobile in the format `code subcode XXXXX`.   2. sms gateway will generate a request and send to my registered url using the format `url??mobileNumber=99999999&timeStamp=2014-01-06 16:10:20&operatorName=&areaCode=&message=code subcode xxxxxxx` I want to handle this request from my spring controller. Right now what I did was I created a controller and handle it from reference data. Any other better solutions?
