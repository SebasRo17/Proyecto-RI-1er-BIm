We are a small team of 5 developers and I'm looking for some great advices about how to document the software architecture and design. I'm going for the sweet spot, where the time invested pays off. I don't want to use more time documenting than necessary. I'll quickly give you my thoughts. What are the diagrams I should made? I'm thinking an overall diagram showing the various applications and services. And then some sequence diagrams showing the most important or complicated processes. About the code it self, I really don't see much value in describing or making diagrams for the code outside the .cs files them self. About text documents, I'm a bit uncertain about when to put down on paper. Most developers don't like to either write or read long documents.
