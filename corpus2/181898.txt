What I have done   1. Identified important patterns to learn   2. Read the books    3. Implemented the patterns using favorite programming language    4. Identified pros/cons    5. Practiced some design patterns in real world projects   6. Found some example in Framework libraries Having done that I still struggle to   1. Explain them to seasoned interviewers   2. Clearly differentiate between structural and behavior design patterns. I believe my communication skill is not that bad, but somewhere I have not understood the concepts clearly. How to learn the design pattern concepts to become capable of what I miss now? (If that matters, I am talking about popular GOF design patterns like Strategy, Decorator, Observer, Command, etc)
