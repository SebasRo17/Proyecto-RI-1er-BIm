So we're trying to re-imagine our web solution in an MVC fashion. Going from an old webforms based solution to working with ASP.NET MVC with a bootstrap main menu and adding functionality in the forms of widgets using HTML.Action() that calls a controller and action to fill in the information on that part of the page. We're now thinking of how the CSS and resources that we are going to be getting for each widget separately in their own controller can be effectively used in this scenario. If we only use HTML.Action and letting a controller add our functionality to the page, we lose our connection to the page as a whole, and we could possibly load the resource package and CSS for the same type of objects over and over again. How would one solve this and make it possible for our web portal to have knowledge over which css and resource files have already been added to the solution?
