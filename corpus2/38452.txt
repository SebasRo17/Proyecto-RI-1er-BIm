I have a numerical solution from a differential equation that is in the form of a list, in $(x,z)$-plane. I would like to rotate the 2D `ListPlot` around the $z$-axis to generate a 3D plot. The length of the list is $25\,000$; the step size between each point is $0.0003$. I have tried rotate each point $36$ degrees for $9$ times to obtain a list of triples and then use `ListPlot3D`. This method, however, takes about $5$ minutes to generate a plot. Is there a more efficient way of rotating a 2D `ListPlot`? I was thinking about cutting off the number of points being rotated. How many points can I omit to retain most of the features of the original plot?
