What tools are necessary when developing efficiently with Silverlight 4? VS 2010 is a gimme, but what version? Is Pro enough? Premium? What about Expression Blend/Web/Both? When considering VS 2010, premium comes with an MSDN subscription but it's at the high end of the budget. It makes sense if Expression comes with it though. It's for a one man development show, making an LOB app that will integrate video/audo and mic/webcam equipment.
