The following:               ExportString[Cell[TextData[{StyleBox["BOLD", FontWeight -> "Bold"], " non bold"}],      "Text", FormatType -> "TextForm"], "HTML", "FullDocument" -> False]      gives me               <p class="Text">      <span style='font-weight: bold;'>BOLD</span> non bold     </p>      So it seems that there has to be a way to find out whether a string is surrounded by a StyleBox and by applying ConversionRules I should be able to get something like this               <p class="Text">      <b>BOLD</b> non bold     </p>      So far all my attempts have failed. Moreover I've noticed that making the following ConversionRule `""->{}` I get no styling at all, that is:               <p class="Text">      BOLD non bold     </p>
