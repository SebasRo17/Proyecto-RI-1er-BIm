Currently I'm checking some client and server software and I wish to expand the testing coverage for it. Specifically I want to increase the quality of the load and stress testing that is performed so that it better reflects user usage. To this end I've been looking at JMeter, however I've encountered an issue. Unlike a web browser, the client does not have support for using a proxy. This presents the problem that JMeter can't monitor the communication between the two systems to build up the test data. Possibly JMeter provides for this very scenario, however it's not been obvious in the documentation that there is any facility for this. Although I have some ideas on how to approach this I can't be the first to have encountered this issue, so I'm putting the question out there: how best would you solve this issue?
