**does Java have graphs as an intergrated data structure**? How about Python? I was assigned to write a program, that solves the TSP (travelling salesman problem) via the GRASP (greedy randomized adaptive search procedure). I'm just familiarizing myself with GRASP, and I would like to have a good working data structure for graphs, that includes **plotting the graph** and the option to assign special colour to edges (so I can colour the final solution: cheapest hamiltonian path). I'm gonna have a presentation, explaining my final solution, whence the need for plotting the graph. Also, it would be desirable to have the option to **generate a random graph on n vertices** , so I have some easily accessible examples. I was really hoping this has been done by someone before, so I don't start from scratch. I'm a mathematician (or atleast trying to be), so please, no fancy programmer slang. thank you
