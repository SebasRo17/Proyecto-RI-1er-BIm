In hopes of getting myself and my coworkers to adopt automated unit testing methods in future projects, I would like to see a proper example on how it's done. Simple introductionary lessons to unit testing only cover very basic examples and they don't seem to convince anyone of the benefits unit testing can offer. What are some open source projects written in PHP that come with an extensive array of unit tests that are done "properly", and can be used as an example of how testing should be done?
