I am trying to make an intuitive Mathemtaica program to show the principle of quantum walking. The idea of quantum walking is very simple and direct, but when I try to transfer it into Mathemitca codes, I meet several difficulties. The principle of quantum walk is introduced here http://susan- stepney.blogspot.jp/2014/02/mathjax.html and here http://xxx.tau.ac.il/abs/quant-ph/0303081 There are two operations in one step:   1. Coin operation (Hadamard coin H) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TDGx6.png)   2. Step operation (S) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/khlvJ.png) With these two operations, bellow shows the first three steps of a quantum walk ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/suzFK.png) I hope to express this process in an intuitive Mathematica codes. The result of one step can be expressed as ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jslqP.png) The two operators, H and S, are put on these two variables ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/b0JFA.png) I do not know how to realize such a tensor product in Mathemcatica. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/67afI.png), where S and H are two operators; x and y are two variables; x is an array; y is an integer. But I guess this equation is correct, because similar equation is shown in wiki( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_product) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/X1otL.png) To realize this equation in Mathematica, I test an example first, as shown below . ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/hxwHX.png) My expected result is ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/248Zr.png) But I cannot obtain this result. My questions are:   1. How can I realize ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/LDbEK.png) in Mathematicaï¼Ÿ   2. How to intuitively express the first three steps of quantum walk using Mathematica codes? I have tried to solve this problem for several days, but made no progress. Any help or suggestion will be highly appreciated,
