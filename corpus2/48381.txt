I'd like to pass an assumption to `FullSimplify` so whenever it gets a function that is squared and square rooted would return me only the function body, without `Abs[f]` (I've tried assumption `_Symbol ∈ Reals && _Symbol > 0` but it gives `Abs[f]` instead of `f`.               f[x_] := a x^2;     FullSimplify[Sqrt[f[x]^2], _Symbol ∈ Reals && _Symbol > 0]      > >     x^2 Abs[a] >
