I wanted to know if anyone had any tips for transitioning from small personal projects and coursework, to a large enterprise scale project? Im in my second year at university and have attained a placement with a large tech company, to work on a pretty large project, I'm just a little apprehensive about 'finding my way around' such a large project.
