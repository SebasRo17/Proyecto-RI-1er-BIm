Sorry, I didn't mentioned clearly in my earlier post. I want to build a transparent `Rectangle`, within which I want to diffuse a certain color of my choice which is also transparent. After this, any objects that I place inside the transparent building should be visible in its assigned color. One of the things that I tried to do after making a rectangle shape with light colored walls was to place `Points` with `ImageSize-> {20, 20}` and different colors. For that purpose I wrote the following code.               w = 100;     l = 200;     h = 30;     f = Graphics3D[{Transparent,Polygon[{{0, 0, 0}, {w, 0, 0}, {w, 0, h}, {0, 0, h}}]},           Lighting -> {LightBlue}, Boxed -> False];     b = Graphics3D[{Transparent,Polygon[{{0, l, 0}, {w, l, 0}, {w, l, h}, {0, l, h}}]},           Lighting -> {LightBlue}, Boxed -> False];     s1 = Graphics3D[{Transparent,Polygon[{{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, h}, {0, l, h}, {0, l, 0}}]},             Lighting -> {LightBlue}, Boxed -> False];     s2 = Graphics3D[{Transparent,Polygon[{{w, 0, 0}, {w, 0, h}, {w, l, h}, {w, l, 0}}]},             Lighting -> {LightBlue}, Boxed -> False];     sur = Graphics3D[{Transparent,Polygon[{{0, 0, 0}, {w, 0, 0}, {w, l, 0}, {0, l, 0}}]},               Lighting -> {LightBlue}, Boxed -> False];     top = Graphics3D[{Transparent,Polygon[{{0, 0, h}, {w, 0, h}, {w, l, h}, {0, l, h}}]},             Lighting -> {LightBlue}, Boxed -> False];     Show[{f, b, s1, s2, sur, top}]      I tried to set `Lighting` options for the 3D objects. However that does not seem to work. Can anyone help me? One another option that I was thinking of was to have something similar to a heat map.
