My thinking is that a company who's primary business is making widgets groups developers with networking, support, etc because none of it is the business, it's support of the business. If your primary business IS selling software, then I would call the development group "Research and Development" or something similar. Maybe if you had some developers who worked strictly on internal apps then they would be in with IT/Support/Comms, etc. What is the norm for companies like Microsoft, Google, etc? Is there some dictionary for this type of thing in CIO magazine or something? What does your company do?
