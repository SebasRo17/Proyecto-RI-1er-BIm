It is obvious that first cout prints 7 7 but why the second one prints 8 8 7 ? Why not 7 8 8? How does such constructions work in c++?               int ink(int *x){          *x += 1;          return *x;     }                    int main(){         int *a;         int b = 6;              a = &b;              cout << ++b << " " << b << endl;            cout << b << " " << ink(a) << " " << b;              return 0;      }
