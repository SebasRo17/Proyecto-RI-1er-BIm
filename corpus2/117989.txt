My parents complain about me choosing a career in IT instead of business since most companies outsource IT nowadays. I always thought IT/Desktop supports are the ones who got outsourced, but it seems programmers are being outsourced to India as well. I need to choose the most secure area (less affected by outsourcing) in order to convince my parents. Which areas in IT are mostly affected by outsourcing?
