I have attached below a piece of code that has been running successfully but takes extremely long for mathematica to compute. I believe it is the last "rms" calculation and the fact that I am using very small numbers that is really pushing mathematica. Any suggestions or help would be greatly appreciated.               c = 3*10^8;     e = 1.6*10^-19;     m = 9.1*10^-31;     rc = 2.8*10^-15;     gamma = 1600/0.511;     n = (10^-10)/e;     sbeg = 9.6*10^-5;     send = 1.1*10^-5;     lm = 0.5;     theta = 0.04;     r = lm/theta;               sL[phi_?NumericQ] := (r*phi^3)/24          lambda[z_, phi_] := n/(((send - sbeg)/theta phi + sbeg)*Sqrt[2 Pi])        Exp[-(z^2/(2*((send - sbeg)/theta phi + sbeg)^2))]               de[s_, phi_?NumericQ] :=  With[{sL = sL[phi]},      (-((2*n*rc*m*c^2)/(3^(1/3) r^(2/3))))      *((lambda[s - sL, phi] - lambda[s - 4 sL, phi])/sL^(1/3)       + NIntegrate[(1/(s - sprime)^(1/3)*D[lambda[sprime, phi], sprime]),            {sprime, s - sL,s}])]          total[s_?NumericQ] := NIntegrate[de[s, phi], {phi, 0, theta}]          rms = Sqrt[       NIntegrate[         1/(sbeg*Sqrt[2 Pi])           Exp[-(s^2/(2*(sbeg)^2))]*(total[s])^2, {s, -10 sbeg,           10 sbeg}] - (NIntegrate[          1/(sbeg*Sqrt[2 Pi])            Exp[-(s^2/(2*(sbeg)^2))]*(total[s]), {s, -10 sbeg,            10 sbeg}])^2]
