I'm reading a book's chapter ("Controlled Exception Test" in "Testing Object- Oriented Testing") about testing exception handling in a running system (not at unit level). The conclusion is that it is hard to automatically trigger an exception at a given layer in the system other then simulate a cause for an exception. Wouldn't usage of AspectJ or any other AOP approach solve the problem? With AOP I can create an aspect that will throw an expected exception and attach it to the method called before exception handling.
