I was going over this video lecture on master theorem from Introduction to Algorithm  and while explaining case A of the master theorem professor says that some function `f(n)` is polynomially smaller than some other function at point 53:08 seconds: ![formula](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CxEWP.png) What does it mean for a function to be polynomially smaller than this function? I am confused here as polynomially is not equivalent to poly-logarithmically. Has the professor used the wrong term here ? It is highly unlikely though since he goes on to say the same term a number of times.
