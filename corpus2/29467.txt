The _JDBC Connections_ section of the help file http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/DatabaseLink/tutorial/DatabaseConnections.html gives me the impression that I can connect to a MS Access Database (*.accdb) using the following statements:               << DatabaseLink`;     conn = OpenSQLConnection[JDBC["odbc", "MTData.accdb"]];      where _MTData.accdb_ is the name of my database. I have verified that the file does exist using `FileNames[]`. Upon executing the statements above, however, I receive the following error message: > JDBC::error: "[Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Data source name not found > and no default driver specified ...". Typing `JDBCDriverNames[]` gives a list with " _Microsoft Access(ODBC)_ " Would somebody please be able to clarify whether I should be able to access a MS Access database using these statements? Thanks. **EDIT:** I have also tried accessing the database by providing a DSN (Data Source Name), created by opening the ODBC Source Administrator (as I have a 64-bit operating system, but 32-bit Office, I used the program at location C:\Windows\SysWOW64\odbcad32.exe). Executing the following code, where "MTDB" is the DSN: `conn = OpenSQLConnection[JDBC["odbc", "MTDB"]];`, I get the following error message: > JDBC::error: [Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] The specified DSN contains an > architecture mismatch between the Driver and Application
