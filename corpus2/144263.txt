I see the term "enterprise" being thrown around software developers and programmers a lot and used loosely it seems. > **en·ter·prise/ˈentərˌprīz/** > > Noun: A project or undertaking, typically one that is difficult or requires > effort. Initiative and resourcefulness. Can someone please clarify what this term actually encompasses? "At an enterprise level", "enterprise scale"? There are even "enterprise editions" of things. What exactly does it mean? It obviously doesn't make sense judging by the above definition so more specifically to software what does one mean when using the word enterprise? **EDIT:** To add a spin on this - how does this term then fit into phrases such as Enterprise Framework Model? What does data access and data context have to do with company-wide descriptions?
