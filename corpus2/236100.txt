I have a small C# project that reads a file and gives me an output: a string that does not contain spaces nor any types of punctuation marks. It may also contain a few misspellings. Ex. Output:   THEQUICKBROWNFOXJUMPSOVERTHELAZYDOG **I wonder if there is a way to analyze this string by using text mining/data mining and/or regular expressions to indentify the words (preferably nounds, verbs and so forth.) in the string?** I want to read a bunch of files giving me different outputs and put them in statistical order from the one with the most found words to the one which only contain a string of mumbo jumbo. Also, if the string contain misspellings like:   THEQUICGBROWNFOSJUMPSOVERTHHLAZYDOG   I know that regular expression can calculate the "distans" from a misspelled word and find the most matching one (using a corpus and probability) but this might prove more of a challenge as the string does not have any spaces or punctuation marks. Any ideas how I can solve this?
