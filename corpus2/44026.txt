I'm in a very beginning of the design phase of an application that will have to run in the following platforms/devices:   * Desktop: Windows, Linux & Mac   * Mobile: Android, iPhone/iPad & Windows Phone 7   * Web: Silverlight I will use C# on Mono and I want to maximize code re-usability. Except for the desktop (I'll use WinForms/GTK#), **my concern is related to many different GUI that I will face**. What would be your approach? Obviously, the views will be different, but what about the controllers, data access, utility classes, etc. Is it really acceptable to share everything but the views?
