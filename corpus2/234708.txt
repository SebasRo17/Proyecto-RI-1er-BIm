I'm not quite sure what the real practice is in the programming community. But when a user deletes content from your service (ie. deleting a status update, a photo of theirs, a comment they made). Should I actually delete them from my server or just hide it? The reason why I am asking this is because we live in a age where the services we build are data hungry. The data is the most valuable aspect of the service you build and keeping everything that comes in is vital. What is the general practice for these type of situations? What are your recommendations?
