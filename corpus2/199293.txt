I'm currently writing an API and its documentation. For example I have something like this:               public interface Event {     }          public interface Process {     }          public interface EventProcessor {         /**          * Starts to process the sepcified event asynchronously. The returned          * {@link Process} can be used to track progress on the processing. If the          * specified event causes more {@link Event events} to be processed in this          * system, then they are also tracked via the returned {@link Process}.          *           * @param event          *            to be started to process          * @return          */         Process startProcessing(Event event);     }      In the example above, the javadoc link to the interface `Process` is repeated. In the API I'm writing there are cases where I have several more references to the same class in a single javadoc comment. Should I always mark references to the class/method/etc. as javadoc links? Generally, I think having many links in a javadoc comment is a sign for high cohesion. But when it's often the same target, which is linked, I'm not sure if this is good.
