I recently played around with establishing a remote kernel setup without using mathematica grid. To do this I use the `LaunchKernels[]` command and `ssh` to establish the connection. A call to my remote desktop (RemoteDesktop) then looks like:               Needs["SubKernels`LocalKernels`"]     LaunchKernels[RemoteMachine["RemoteDesktop",        "ssh -x -f -l username `1` math -mathlink -linkmode Connect `4` -linkname `2` -subkernel -noinit >& /dev/null &", 8]]      Which returns the following error: > SubKernels`Protected`kernelFlush::time: Operation LinkWrite timed out after > 15.` seconds It actually took me some time to figure out, that launching a kernel on RemoteDesktop actually takes longer than the predefined limit of 15 seconds. If I increase the limit to some way higher timespan like this:               Parallel`Settings`$MathLinkTimeout = 100.      `LaunchKernels[]` sure takes its time, but all the kernels are launched eventually. **So I cannot help but wonder: Is this an ordinary behavior or do you think something is going wrong regarding my setup, which results in launching kernels taking more time? If so, what could be the reason?** Further information: I am working on a MacBook Pro with OS X 10.9 and Mathematica 9.0.1. I testet remote connections to another Mac with OS X 10.8 and Mathematica 9.0.1 and a 64 Bit Linux Machine. Launching kernels took way longer than 15 seconds in each of these two scenarios.
