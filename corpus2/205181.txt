As title: Why is aggregation function bad idea for RESTful? Although I know CRUD is good for RESTful. For example, the resource is ' _employee_ ', and client needs to retrive sum of total ' _salary_ ' of all employees. Shouldn't RESTful service provide such sum function? Further question: if aggregation function is bad for RESTful, how can a client get sum of total salary? To retrieve all 'employee' records and sum up itself?
