Is it necessary to use interfaces for small projects? I work at a shop writing small custom applications for clients, primarily data manipulation. I'm mostly self-taught but also took some programming classes in college. I've been trying to apply more OO concepts to my coding practices, but I really don't see the need for interfaces in the work that I do. My largest project so far had around 10 classes in it. Are interfaces necessary for small projects/applications or only for large- scale software systems? EDIT: This is not a duplicate. I'm asking about using interfaces in general for small projects, not using an interface for when there is only a single implementation...
