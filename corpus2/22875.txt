I am new to mathematica and was experimenting with NDSolve and doing a simple demonstration of orbital motion and Newtons laws. I put together the following code which all seems to work except the Graphics object at the origin seems to flicker/move ? I tried moving the graphics object that displays this object to the initialisation section but that doesn't seem to help. I've also tried trackedsymbols but that doesn't work either. Any ideas/suggestions much appreciated.               Module[{t,tfinal=20,x0=1.5,y0=1.0,xv0=0.2,yv0=0.5,range = {{-3,3},{-3,3}},eqs,sol,fx,fy},     eqs = {y''[t]+y[t]/(x[t]^2+y[t]^2)^(3/2)==0,x''[t]+x[t]/(x[t]^2+y[t]^2)^(3/2)==0,x'[0]==xv0,y'[0]==yv0,x[0]==x0,y[0]==y0};     sol = Flatten @ NDSolve[eqs,{x,y},{t,tfinal}];     fx[t_]:=x[t] /. sol;     fy[t_]:= y[t] /. sol;     Manipulate[     g =Graphics[{Red,PointSize[0.02],Point@ {fx[t],fy[t]}},PlotRange->range];     Show[p,g,p1],     {t,0,tfinal},     Initialization :> {p=ParametricPlot[{{fx[k],fy[k]}},{k,0,tfinal},PlotRange->range,PlotLabel->"Planetary motion"],p1=Graphics[{Blue,PointSize[0.03],Point[{0,0}]},PlotRange->range]}     ]     ]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xUuAV.gif) Here's an `ImageDifference` of two adjacent frames of a screen recording of the animation: ![image difference of two frames](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QeNfn.png) The central dot has moved sideways...
