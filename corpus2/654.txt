I first thought that doing Quit[] in a cell, or Evaluation->Quit kernel, is supposed to remove all Global variables, but I have a case where this is not happening, then I read that there is a command Quit from the menu to also shut down the front end, so I wanted to try that to see if that will clear those variables, which I suppose are saved by the front end. (I know I can ofcourse just type Remove["Globals`*"], but was looking looking at what seems like a symbols leakage problem with Manipulate. **Any one knows how to close the front end please?** I can't find this Quit command from the menu, which is supposed to be different from the Quit[] for the kernel? I only see Quit kernel in the menu. But when I try that, these variables are not cleared! ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2Udnz.png) Again, the reason I wanted to do the above is because not all variables are cleared when I restart the kernel (either by Quit[] or by stopping the kernel from the menu: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/EkBjW.png) Btw, according to this answer here Quit[] the kernel is supposed to clear all variables ! but this is not the case with me here. ps. I never even knew before there was a `Quit` command for the front end. ps. I will be happy to post the code that generates this if needed. thanks edit(1) According to help message above, it said there is **Quit** menu item to close the from end, but on windows, V 8.04, I only see Quit kernel, which is the same as Quit[] typed in the notebook. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OCO24.png)
