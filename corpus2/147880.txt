I've got a senior developer with eight years of .NET experience starting tomorrow to work on a 11,000-lines-of-code application. In the team there's myself and another programmer. We've both got about three years experience each. It's my first project as a manager (I'm also a developer on the project) and this is the first time I've ever had to introduce someone to an already established code base. Obviously I'll be going over each module, the deployment process, etc., and handing them the location of the source control repository, documentation (which isn't the best), etc. How long should I give them before they're ready to start writing new features and fixing bugs?
