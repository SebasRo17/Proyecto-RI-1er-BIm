I tried searching here (and SO) without much luck. I also stared at the yellow box to the right and think this question is relatively on topic and can be answered. A co-worker asked me if I had any suggestions for how to find a tutor for his son. In this specific case, it was for Eclipse and Java, but it got me thinking about good general strategies one could use in situations like this. He preferred a local 1-to-1, but I suppose online might be a reasonable (or perhaps more likely) alternative. Any suggested strategies?
