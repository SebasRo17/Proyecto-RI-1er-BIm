Is there a phrase or word to describe an algorithim or programme is complete in that given any value for its arguments there is a defined outcome? i.e. all the ramifications have been considered whatever the context? A simple example would be the below function:               function returns string get_item_type(int type_no)     {       if(type_no < 10)         return "hockey stick"       else if (type_no < 20)         return "bulldozer"       else         return "unknown"     }      (excuse the dismal pseudo code) No matter what number is supplied all possibiblites are catered for. My question is: is there a word to fill the blank here:               "get_item_type() is ______ complete"      ? (The answer is not Turing Complete - that is something quite different - but I annoyingly always think of something as "Turing Complete" when I am thinking of the above).
