To me, boilerplate code is obviously bad. However I've met a developer who displays resistance in any attempt to reduce boilerplate. I realized I didn't have a readily formed, well thought out argument past the abhorrence I have developed for it over time. So that I can form a convincing argument for favoring less boilerplate, what are some counterarguments? In other words what are the arguments (if any) in favor of boilerplate? (I mean what I think is generally meant by boilerplate, but a good example is getters and setters in Java.)
