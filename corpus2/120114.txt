I'm currently finishing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and thinking a lot about which specialisation to choose in my Master's degree. One subject I'm particularly interested in is parallel programming. However, this topic does not seem to be a standard topic in Computer Science degrees, although it is something that is used more and more - new processors nowadays are usually dual or quad cores. So I was wandering: does anybody know a good study program in this field? I was mostly looking for it at universities in Germany, but they tend to combine the application side with some type of engineering or natural science. Thus, programs are more the "Computational Engineering" or "Computational Science" type, but I'm more interested in the Computer Science part of it, i.e. parallel programming, languages and compilers, algorithms and hardware.
