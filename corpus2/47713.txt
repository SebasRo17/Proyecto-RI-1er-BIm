I want to add coordinate axis to a figure of nested spheres. I have the command.               Graphics3D[Table[{Opacity[.6], Specularity[White, 20], Sphere[{0, 0, 0}, r]},      {r, 1/2, 3, 1/2}], Boxed -> False]      Which reproduces the set of nested spheres ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5tN0r.jpg) Now, I would need to add axes X, Y and Z It would also be good to be able to label the spheres 1, 2, 3... Thanks Edit: and to do something similar to this picture? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4Nywf.png)
