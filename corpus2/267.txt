Is it possible to cause a notebook to be hidden (`Visible -> False`) instead of closing it when pressing the close button in the title bar? The `Messages` window seems to work this way. The `Notebooks[]` function will list it even when it is not visible (or it has been "closed"). Is this special behaviour, or is it possible to make any notebook window behave like this? * * * Motivation: As part of a user interface, I would like to gradually collect some information into a notebook (lets call it a "log-notebook"). The visibility of the log-notebook would be toggled with a button. This log- notebook should persist across kernel sessions, but not across front end sessions (it will never be saved).
