Simple question: I would like to dynamically specify a list of 3 elements, `{x,y,z}`. Then I'd like to find that list, _or_ any of its permutations, in a parent data set. The parent data set is composed of lists which are at least 3 elements long (like mine), but could also be 4 or 5 elements long. I will then be dynamically deleting the entire part which has an occurrence of `x,y,z` or `z,x,y` etc. from the parent data set (list of lists). The first way I tried doesn't work for obvious reasons (I've removed `Dynamic` functionality because it doesn't work anyway):               data={{0,0,0},{1,1,1},{1,2,3},{3,2,1,9}};     x=3;     y=1;     z=2;     DeleteCases[data,Permutations[{x,y,z}]]      As you can see, I want this to find and delete the 3rd and 4th elements, so that `{{0,0,0},{1,1,1}}` is returned. I'd also like to update `{x,y,z}` dynamically. Are there any tricks to make this work? Or am I doing it entirely wrong? Thanks!
