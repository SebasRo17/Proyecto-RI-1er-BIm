I assume that my project is decoupled enough to allow for unit testing. But how big, exactly, in terms of clases and functions does my project need to be to make unit testing worthwhile? We all make mistakes and no one's perfect, but I consider myself a decent programmer to handle small projects' errors with stepping through. Or is unit testing a hard necessity no matter of what size your project is?
