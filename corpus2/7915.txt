I have an array of 10000 elements. I want to randomly assign energy to these 10000 elements using Gaussian or Exponential distribution, such that each time a particular element is selected its energy should also be shown in the output. Can anyone suggest me how to solve this problem? Let's say, I have 10 elements in the array {8,4,6,2,9,0,5,1,7,3} and I am assigning energy to these 10 elements randomly. After that I am selecting one of the element in the array, say 7, when I select this number I also want to know the energy that number possesses. This is the program I wrote to generate 1000 elements.               l = 0;     For[i = 0, i < 10, i++,      For[j = 0, j < 10, j++,       For[k = 0, k < 10, k++,        Xarray[l] = A[i, j, k];        Print[Xarray[l]];        l++;        ]       ]      ]     Xarray[5]      When `Xarray[5]` is given it will show the coordinate it possesses. In addition to this I want to know the energy when I am giving `Xarray[5]`, `Xarray[998]`, etc.
