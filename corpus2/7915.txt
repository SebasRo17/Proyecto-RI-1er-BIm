I have been offered an interesting job, but there's a big caveat for me: they use pair programming. I hate the idea of pair programming, and I'm probably not suited for it: I like to do frequent pauses, I hate to see someone programming (I would constantly poke the pair away to code myself), I have to be in full control of the machine I'm working on, I like to work listening music, and basically I don't like to being tied to someone else. I'm not even a social person. I have however never actually worked with true pair programming (besides few times for a short time to help someone else or to solve a complex task together)... so it is pair programming really that bad? And given my attitude, should I refuse the job or should I leave my current one and give a try? * * * For people that asked about it: I'm looking for a job where formal design and development are used, as I hate my current job where we are "coding in the wild". The company is very interested in my technical profile so they insisted even when I specified I never worked with pair programming and that I probably wouldn't like it (besides being an unsociable loner programmer, I don't like and believe the very concept of pair programming).
