For instance, a processes can be described in BPMN, EPC, IDEF0, SOMF, etc. Additionally, different process execution languages such as BPEL, RPC, Wf-XML are available. If I were to develop software for the BPM-market, which standards should I implement or focus on? Which standards are most suitable if my BPM software was going to be implemented in my client's IT-System?
