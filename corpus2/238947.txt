Take the (unprecedented and groundbreaking) example of the calculator:               public class Calculator     {         public double Add(double augend, double addend)          {             return augend + addend;         }     }      When I write `calculator.Add(val1, val2)` which of the following am I doing?   * Telling the calculator to add the inputs   * Adding the inputs with the calculator (One could also ask: "Is it a method _of_ the object or is it a method _on_ the object?") Other examples: do we tell the repository to add the entity or do we add the entity to the repository? Do we tell the message service to deliver a message or do we send a message through the message service? Do we tell the can of paint to mix itself or do we mix the can of paint?
