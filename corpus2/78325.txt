Is there a good book and/or series of articles that explains IT concepts such as networking, windows domain, security (SSL certs), cryptography, IT infrastructure, etc? I'm a mid level developer who would like to build a good foundation on these topics as it would help me see how my system fits in.   Now, I realize that these topics are vast and have great deal of resources available on individual topics. My goal, at this point in my career, is not to necessarily gain the depth of the information, instead I'm looking for a good overall working knowledge and when required I'll resort to those special topic books. I'm certain you folks had to overcome this bump in your career as enterprise software developer. What did you do? What resources did you resort to? How does one go about bridging the gaps in knowledge and gaining the necessary understanding that is essential to your success. I'm very interested in reading about your experiences. Thanks for the comments so far. Thanks in advance!
