I search the forum and found a question about exporting interpolating functions to excel. Unfortunately, I can't use it to export the results to excel. This is the equation : `u = StateResponse[ssm, UnitStep[t] , {t, 0, 1},Method -> {"NDSolve", MaxSteps -> 1600000}]` and the answer is : `11.2822InterpolatingFunction[{{0.,1.}},<>][t]+0.1206InterpolatingFunction[{{0.,1.}},<>][t]+34.117InterpolatingFunction[{{0.,1.}},<>][t]+2.335InterpolatingFunction[{{0.,1.}},<>][t]+63.1235InterpolatingFunction[{{0.,1.}},<>][t]+5.8206InterpolatingFunction[{{0.,1.}},<>][t]` I would appreciate that someone can help me to export this equation to a excel file.
