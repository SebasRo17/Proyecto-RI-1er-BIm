Suppose I design a platform over a platform (say Java or Win32 or .NET), which consists of various layers like Database, User Interface, Cloud etc. Now every team would be working to make their product, say database best and less focused on their relationship with other teams, hence resulting in various issues when doing an integration of it. Now, these are my questions in order to achieve a stable and bug-free platform:   1. How could one ensure that while integrating all the layers, there is less overhead involved and also is there any other way to automate this process ?   2. Also, if one particular team is using the API calls provided by other team and if the other team is still not ready with the API calls, there comes a DEADLOCK . How to step over such situations ?   3. Say, I want to monitor and get feedback from various teams regarding their progress. Is there any automation available for such activities ?
