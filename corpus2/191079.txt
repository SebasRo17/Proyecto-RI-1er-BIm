Is there a fun way to learn Java? Instead of what's the "best" way to learn it, I'm wondering the funnest way to learn it. I'm taking an introductory course on programming right now to see what it's all about, but quite frankly it's not very enjoyable. I certainly love programming in an applicable sense (for accomplishing layout and analytics tasks), I find that it takes a while to get to the point (it took me a year with JavaScript) to feel like you can just dream things up and try them out. I realize the subjectivity of the questions avails it to flames, etc., so I'll restate the spirity of the question. I want to know what resources/methods people have employed to make learning a programming language more enjoyable.
