When working with symbolic matrix operations or other objects which don't have commutative multiplication, it would be nice to not have to constantly switch out times for `NonCommutativeMultiply` (`**`). So I was wondering if there is a way to do something like               matrix /: Times[pre___, a_matrix, post___] :=  NonCommutativeMultiply[pre, a, post]     a = matrix["a"];     b = matrix["b"];      and then have it replaced automatically. However since `Times` is orderless, this doesn't preserve the order. In general, is it impossible to get the order of inputs when doing this kind of "overloading" though upvalues of an orderless function?
