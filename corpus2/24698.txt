In this post, the OP requires finding a Fibonacci number having some divisibility property with _Mathematica_ and _Maxima_. I ~~tired~~ tried that Mathematica code on Mathematica 9.0 and it's still slow (about 100 seconds). Can we improve the Mathematica implemention?               fibRatio[a_, b_] := FullSimplify[Sum[Fibonacci[n + i], {i, 0, a}]/Fibonacci[n + b]]          Select[      Flatten[Table[{a, b, fibRatio[a, b]}, {a, 1, 10}, {b, 1, a}], 1],      IntegerQ[#[[3]]] &      ]
