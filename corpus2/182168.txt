I would have two questions related to cyclomatic complexity:   1. Can I use this metric for a whole app? I guess I cannot, as it would be incredibly large number, considering functions calling functions etc. Is it just for module/method/unit?   2. In Visual Studio, for starting app with just calling the `Main` method, the cyclomatic complexity value is 2. Why? There is just one possible way if I run the program - it ends.
