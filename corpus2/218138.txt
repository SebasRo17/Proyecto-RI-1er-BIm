The best idea I have so far is to rotate first array by {0, 90, 180, 270} degrees and reflect it horizontally or/and vertically. We basically get 16 variations [1] of first array and compare them with second array. if none of them matches the two arrays are rotationally and reflectively distinct. I am wondering if there is more optimal solution than this brute-force approach? [1]               0deg, no reflection     0deg, reflect over x     0deg, reflect over y     0deg, reflect over x and y     90deg, no reflection     ...
