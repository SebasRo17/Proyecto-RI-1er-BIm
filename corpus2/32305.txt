I create a `Graph` which vertices are lists (points in n-dimensional space)               v1 = {{1, 2} -> {3, 4}, {5, 6} -> {7, 8}};     g1 = Graph[v1];     PropertyValue[{g1, VertexList[g1][[1]]}, VertexWeight] = 10      and I get a message error: > >     Set::write: Tag PropertyValue in PropertyValue[...] is protected >   Now, if I do               v2 = {1 -> 2, 3 -> 4};     g2 = Graph[v2];     PropertyValue[{g2, VertexList[g2][[1]]}, VertexWeight] = 10      everything is fine. `g1` and `g2` are structurally indentical, the difference is only in vertices type: list(`g1`) and scalar(`g2`). What's the problem here?
