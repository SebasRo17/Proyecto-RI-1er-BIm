I'm thinking of using TFS Build workflows for complex deployments. We have some that may need to deploy:   1. Web applications and services   2. Database   3. SSRS Reports   4. SSIS Packages   5. Who knows what else I like the fact that I can give the workflow some basic parameters like which build to deploy and it would just run. Potentially, some parts might need human approval, and I know that workflow can handle that too. An example is that we might use the workflow to create a change script from our Visual Studio Database Projects, but the DBA group will want to approve the script before it is run. I'm interested to know whether others have used "builds" for this in the past, and what problems were found.
