Ever since I started programming I've seen a header at the top of most code files indicating some sort of copyright: e.g.               /* Copyright (c) 1998 Innotech */      or               /* Copyright (c) 1998-2008 Innotech */      Conceptually I get the idea... depending on your wants/needs it _roughly_ translates somewhere between: > Hey check it out! I made this! I'm awesome! to > Don't copy/redistribute this! Our lawyers will come after you if you do! On the one hand I find the whole thing somewhat humorous as often this is a file that no one outside of in-house developers will ever see, but **_presuming_** this line may actually one day "mean something" I'm curious about the date part.   1. Does a single date imply that the author claims copyright of the file from that date until eternity?   2. If a date range is used, and not kept up to date has the developer invalidated his/her own copyright beyond the date range?   3. Without some additional legal filing of some kind - does the copyright header provide any real legal strength of any kind? or are we all just fooling ourselves.
