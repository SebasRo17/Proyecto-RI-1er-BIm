http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext: > Hypertext is text displayed on a computer or other electronic device with > references (hyperlinks) to other text that the reader can immediately > access, usually by a mouse click or keypress sequence. Apart from running > text, hypertext may contain tables, images and other presentational devices. > Hypertext is the underlying concept defining the structure of the World Wide > Web.[1] It is an easy-to-use and flexible format to share information over > the Internet. So any webpage that does not have hyper links is NOT hypertext? second question: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_markup_language: > HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the predominant markup > language for web pages. So HTML is not hypertext because it is not displayed on an electronic device, but HTML that is displayed on an electronic device like this:               <b></b>      is considered hypertext? (I was debating whether to post this here or in English.StackExchange but thought probably here is a more appropriate channel)
