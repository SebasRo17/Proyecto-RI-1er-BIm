I know there is a difference between `INNER JOIN` and `FULL OUTER JOIN`, I can see it, but, what is the difference between the two following: `JOIN ... ON...` and `INNER JOIN...ON...` and still yet `JOIN...ON...` vs `FULL OUTER JOIN...ON...` Reason being is I think maybe just using `JOIN` is messing up a query I am working on that is posted on SO, link to question HERE. So basically what is the syntactical difference between the actual set operations themselves? Thank You,
