I have: List of points on 2D plane:               pointsz0 = ToExpression@Import@"http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=VQfP0HgB";      And I have some values in those numbers:               table = ToExpression@Import@"http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=7g4QNPPw";      Now since `pointsz0` are only 2D (notice `z = 0`), I would like to create a 2D graph. At a `point[[1]]` I want `table[[1]]`. To make things a bit more clear. My numbers are actually vector norms and I would like to make a nice graph showing how the norm of a vector changes in given points. Most likely using colors. That's the idea.
