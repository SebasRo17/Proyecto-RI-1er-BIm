I have several .eml email files to import. Some of them were saved as quoted- printable 7-bit encoded. I skipped through the _Mathematica_ documentation and found `ToCharacterCode` and `CharacterEncoding`. However,               Import[foo.eml, CharacterEncoding -> "PrintableASCII"]       does not lead to conversion of the 7-bit characters to the default set (8-bit I guess). In particular, I want to get rid of encodings like `=FC`, which is a German Umlaut-u (`Ã¼`). After that I would like to be able to proceed with normal text analysis. Does anybody have experience with the right functions?
