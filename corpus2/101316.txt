There seem to be a lot of developers who write their SQL by capitalising the keywords:               SELECT column     FROM table          INNER JOIN table          ON condition     WHERE condition     GROUP BY clause     HAVING condition      I'm wondering why people stick to this approach? Clearly, it's a long established convention - but I've never run into a RDBMS that _requires_ capitalisation. Personally, I find KEYWORDS THAT SHOUT to be calling attention to exactly the wrong part of the query, which is why I write the keywords in lowercase. Still, enough people use this convention that I figure I might be missing something, hence this question.
