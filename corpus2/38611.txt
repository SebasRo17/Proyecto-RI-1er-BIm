I have a question in regards to `PseudoInverse`. I have $A$, an $n\times 2$ matrix, and when I want to compute $(A^T A)^{-1}A$, by using `PseudoInverse`, _Mathematica_ is able to give me an answer for this. However If I want to compute $(A^T A)^{-1}$, I am not able to. Here are the data:               goog = FinancialData["goog", {2012}]; yahoo = FinancialData["yhoo", {2012}];     A = Transpose[{yahoo[[1 ;;, 2]], constant}] (*Where constant is a list of value 1(Intercept)*)     kik = PseudoInverse[A]\[Transpose]*goog[[1 ;;, 2]]     Total[kik[[1 ;;, 1]]] (*gives me the coefficient*)     and Total[kik[[1 ;;, 2]]] (*gives me the intercept.*)      Now I often get mathematical equations which is written as $c^Tc$, lets say that $c$ is a vector list, but _Mathematica_ always gives an error. where c=RandomReal[100, 100] And if we look at the data given here as x, if I want to compute $(xx^T)^{-1}$, how is this done? I am struggling with the understanding of matrices and I therefore need a good understanding of how _Mathematica_ deals with these situations, I am also very sure that this would benefit other _Mathematica_ users, based on the fact that the other students taking the same class as I, are struggling with exactly the same thing in _Mathematica_.
