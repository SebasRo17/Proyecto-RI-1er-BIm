> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  How do you keep track of the authors of code? One of my colleagues is in the habit of putting his name and email address in the head of each source file he works on, as author metadata. I am not; I prefer to rely on source control to tell me who I should be speaking to about a given set of functionality. Should I also be signing files I work on for any other reasons? Do you? If so, why? To be clear, this is in addition to whatever metadata for copyright and licensing information is included, and applies to both open sourced and proprietary code.
