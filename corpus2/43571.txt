Recently, I have encountered an issue with ArrayPlot after performing a Fourier transform of a table. ![ArrayPlot of a 2D table with precalculated values](http://i.stack.imgur.com/y1IuJ.png) Picture presented above is an ArrayPlot of a 2D table. Using Fourier on this 2D table I obtain the following ArrayPlot: ![Fourier transform of the first image.](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3lO3a.png) After this procedure one ends up with the result which consists of data at four vertices of the square. The thing is that I would like the result to be in this form: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/oA5Qe.png) I have tried different Fourier transform parameters but none of them had delivered the demanded image. Thank you in advance for your reply!
