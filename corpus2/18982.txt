I would like to simplify some database notation, and I'm doing some tests with `UpValues` for that. For example, if I set this Upvalue fot tab1:               tab1 /: tab1.column1 = 1      When I evaluate               tab1.column1      I get `1` as expected. But if latter I set `column1 = "x"`, when I evaluate it again, I get `tab1."x"` instead of `1` as I need. There is some way that I can change this behavior? So I could get `1` and prevent variables name conflict? **Update** To avoid missinterpretation there is the sequence of evaluation. Quit the kernel and evaluate:               tab1 /: tab1.column1 = 1;     column1 = "x";     tab1.column1       The result is `tab1."x"` in the first evaluation.
