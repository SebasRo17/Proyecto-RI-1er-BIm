I stumbled on this:               ?"NDSolve`FEM`*"      > >     <list of many functions with names like ...Mesh...,Tetrahedon..., > Triangle..., ProcessBCs, ...> >   I'm tempted to conclude that _Mathematica_ has built-in finite element modelling capability, but the documentation seemingly does not cover it. What does FEM mean in this context? What is an example of an equation that `NDSolve` would use these functions to solve?
