If you were to accept a role as a full time web app developer responsible for creating a new application from scratch, how much of a defined specification and design would need and/or expect to start development? What tools/software is even used for this (for web apps built with something like RoR)? I would expect a mockup/wireframe to be required, but what else is done in the design stage? What is the best method or process to convey the functionality of the application so that developers know what to translate into code. I'm interested to hear from web app developers who have thought: "If I only had <this>, I could develop this so much quicker/easier/cleaner", or "I have no idea what this customer wants unless they document it in <thing>." I'm not trying to start a philosophical debate, I am curious from the developers' perspective what is the "right" way to design web apps from scratch. There is probably a book somewhere that someone can tell me to RTFM, but I've only been able to find resources on learning actual coding and development, not the design phase.
