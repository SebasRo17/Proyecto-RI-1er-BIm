My team at work is moving to Scrum and other teams are starting to do test- driven development using unit tests and user acceptance tests. I like the UATs, but I'm not sold on unit testing for test-driven development or test- driven development in general. It seems like writing tests is extra work, gives people a crutch when they write the real code, and might not be effective very often. I understand how unit tests work and how to write them, but can anyone make the case that it's really a good idea and worth the effort and time? Also, is there anything that makes TDD especially good for Scrum?
