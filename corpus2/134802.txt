I'm lost in a mass of licences - GPL, LGPL, Creative Commons, BSD, Apache, etc, and looking for a beginners guide. When using a component under a popular licence like these, what are the restrictions for using them without paying in a commercial product? E.g.   * do I have to redistribute the source?   * do I have to credit them?   * what if I modify the component? etc. From what I can tell from http://www.codeproject.com/info/Licenses.aspx, only GPL and Creative Commons force you to redistribute source?
