I can't understand why connection pooling improves application performance. I suppose connection establishment would cause latency. But reusing an established connection requires more complex error handling. Application server need track state of every connection to set connection to initial state before reusing (such as discarding all transactions, switching to the default isolation level), which also costs time.
