I live in Manchester, UK, and while there are lots of developer communities (regular events, get togethers etc) in London, there are not many "up north". I know of a few (NxtGenUg and ManchesterGeekNights) but there must be more than this. What's the best ways of finding out about these? How have people got involved with communities in there area?
