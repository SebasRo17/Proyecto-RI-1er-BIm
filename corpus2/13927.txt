Background of the problem: A patient takes a drug every $X$ hours with a half- life of $Y$ hours. How much of the drug will be (exactly) in his system after $h$ hours? For $X=24$, and $Y=24$ I made the following function showing the concentration of the drug for the first 96 hours.                Clear[m]      m[h_] := Exp[-(h/48)] /; h < 24      m[h_] := Exp[-(h/48)] + Exp[-((h - 24)/48)] /; ( h >= 24 && h < 48)      m[h_] := Exp[-(h/48)] + Exp[-((h - 24)/48)] +           Exp[-((h - 48)/48)] /; ( h >= 48 && h < 72)      m[h_] := Exp[-(h/48)] + Exp[-((h - 24)/48)] + Exp[-((h - 48)/48)] +          Exp[-((h - 72)/48)] /; ( h >= 72 && h < 96)      m[h_] := Exp[-(h/48)] + Exp[-((h - 24)/48)] + Exp[-((h - 48)/48)] +          Exp[-((h - 72)/48)] + Exp[-((h - 96)/48)] /; ( h >= 96 && h < 120)      Plot[m[h], {h, 0, 120}, AxesOrigin -> {0, 0}]      This is exactly what I want. But now I want to optimize the code, so that I can also `Plot[]` for periods up to several weeks. Question: How can I rewrite `m[h]` such that there will only be one line involved, i.e. add the `Exp[-((h - 72)/48]` type of terms automatically?
