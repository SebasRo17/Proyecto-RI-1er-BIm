Awhile back I posted a question about a kid I know and his dilemma about getting a college degree. He has decided to go for it and apparently already has some credits in computer science and math already (AP or something?), so he gets to move on to more interesting stuff. One of his choices as an elective programming class is to either take Objective-C for Mac or C++ programming. I am guessing that these classes won't teach programming concepts like a CS 101 course or something would but probably more how to build programs out with a specific toolset. He asked me which he should go for; he wants to do the Objective-C because he has a Mac and an iPhone and it would be a good way to get his feet wet, I think he should do C++ because it's more standardized and widely used in industry. Then again, maybe it doesn't really matter since it's all just experience anyway and that never hurts. Any thoughts about this? I always hate giving advice to aspiring programmers because I am always afraid that I'm just passing along what my ideals are and what I think is important when it might not be. It's been a long time since I did CS classes and I'm not sure what the curriculum is like these days. When I went to school it was C and then Java for OO later on; I never had a choice really it was what it was.
