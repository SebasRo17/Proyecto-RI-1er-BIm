Perhaps this is just an overly futurist version of those "does programming have a future" topics, but the questions been on my mind a lot lately. Maybe you've seen this future timeline or things like it, and one of the predictions it makes is that by the year 4000, computer science will be dead as a science. That is to say, that the hardware will have reached the limits of physics and that all the problems of algorithms and software will be solved. Is that a thing that can happen? I could see how, theoretically, physics might reach an end point where you've found all the natural laws there are. But I'd always considered computer science to in some ways be more like economics, a field about decisions and trade-offs. Or could we someday discover all the algorithms, and then it's just a matter of software engineering to select the most appropriate one to use?
