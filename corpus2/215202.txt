I am wondering which is the best way to go with java code. I need to create a class with simple prompts for input.. I have tried using both classes and cannot work out the particular benefits for each. Is this because I am still in the early stages of programming or are there situations that will occur as it becomes more complex??               import java.util.Scanner;          public class myClass     {         Scanner stdin = new Scanner(System.in);          public String getInput(String prompt)        {             System.out.print(prompt);             return stdin.nextLine();         }      ... or               import java.io.*;          public class myClass     {         public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException         {             BufferedReader stdin = new BufferedReader (new InputStreamReader (System.in));             System.out.print("Input something: ");             String name = stdin.readLine();      I know these examples are showing different methods within these classes, but thought this might serve well for the discussion. _I'm really not sure which site is the best to ask this on._
