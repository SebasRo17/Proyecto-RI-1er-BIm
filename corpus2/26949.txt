I am doing this which is supposed to be an easy problem and which I think my code should be correct but for some reasons it is not working. May anyone help correcting my mistakes? How should I write the correct code? This is the question: > Write a function that takes a polynomial in the variable x as input and > computes its degree. Using a pattern test your function should print an > error message when the input is not a polynomial. (It is acceptable if your > function regards a string object such as "Math" as a polynomial of degree > zero). My answer:               If[Function[y, PolynomialQ[y, x]][x^2 + 3 x], Exponent[y, x], Print["error"]]      My code always returns zero and I have no idea why. Also, do we have to use Function[] to write a function? Many thanks in advance for all the helps! Edit:   Thanks @0x4A4D for suggestion.   Here is my edited code:               If[Function[x, PolynomialQ[x^2, x]], Exponent[y, x], Print["error"]]      which I think doesn't quite make any sense, the code does not even produce any output. I guess something is wrong with Function[], but not sure how. I would be grateful if anyone could lend some help. I have been doing this question for quite a long time. Thanks!
