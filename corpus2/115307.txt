Currently I am a high school student and new to the natural language processing field. I am trying to write a Java program that can provide answers that can be understood by humans to the questions that are in natural language. I have looked at Java documentation and Lynda.com site but I am afraid that I am jumping in further than I can reach. I am learning very quickly so I might be going into the deep end. For example I know that I can use the `split` function for minimal parsing but I am unsure where to move past to get actions that I require and I am not getting in enough hours per day to sit down and read all the vasts amount of information. It would be great if there was an entry point for a student like myself that I can take one section at a time. What would be an ideal starting point in terms of CS topics (and documentation) to get myself immersed in this topic?
