In http://www.json.org Douglas Crockford shows the specs of the JSON format in two interesting ways: In the right side column he lists a text spec that looks like a YACC or LEX listing. In the main body of the homepage, he put several images that gives us a simple way to visually understand the valid sequences that composes a JSON string. Those images look like a description of the path that a finite state automaton would follow when parsing the JSON string. Wich are the names (if any) of that listing format and that kind of graphics? Is there any software that renders a source file containing the specification into that kind of images?
