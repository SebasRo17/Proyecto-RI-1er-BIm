I want to plot a 2D vector function such as $F(x,y) = (a(x,y),\,b(x,y))$ in a 3D graph so that the vectors are embedded in the xy plane. I tried to do the following: First I defined a piecewise function like this               g[z_] := Piecewise[{{1, z == 0}}, 0]      Then I converted the 2D vector function to a 3D one by setting the 3rd component to zero and multiplying 1st and 2nd components by `g[z]` so that the x and y components are null when `z != 0`:               f[x_, y_, z_] := {x g[z], y g[z], 0};      Plot the function:               VectorPlot3D[{x g[z], y g[z],0}, {x, -5, 5}, {y, -5, 5}, {z, -5, 5}]      The issue with this solution is that `VectorPlot3D` won't evaluate the function in the relevant points, The above example shows an empty graph, because _Mathematica_ jumps from `z = -1` to `z = 1` without evaluating `z = 0`. I tried with `RegionFunction` (which would've rendered the definition of the above-mentioned piecewise function useless), but that only accepts inequalities, and I want to evaluate the function at any coordinate `{x ,y, 0}`. I could feed it a list of vectors via `VectorPoints -> { {a, b, 0}, {c, d, 0}, ...}`, but that's not an elegant solution at all. Are there other ways to do this?
