I have 24 months experience develping .NET C# client/server apps in my profession as Soft developer. Now starting in a new company I have a probation time of 6 months. My new employeer wants to give me 6 month of time to get the MCPD Web Developer 4. If I understood the Microsoft website correctly I have to pass FOUR exams those are:               Web Developer 4 on Visual Studio 2010               Exam number          MCTS prerequisite: TS: Web Applications Development with Microsoft .NET Framework 4          Exam 70-515          MCTS prerequisite: TS: Windows Communication Foundation Development with Microsoft .NET Framework 4          Exam 70-513          MCTS prerequisite: TS: Accessing Data with Microsoft .NET Framework 4          Exam 70-516          MCPD requirement: PRO: Designing and Developing Web Applications Using Microsoft .NET Framework 4          Exam 70-519      Can this be achieved at all within 6 months? I think thats ridiculous. What do you think what is the best way to achieve this? Even more I would like to hear your experience how you have done the "MCPD Web Developer 4"
