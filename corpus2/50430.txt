I have a difficulty to programmatically adjust the size of a polygon within an inset of a conic (here I limit myself to a circle) in order to have all its vertices on the circle:               a = {-2, 0}; b = {2, 0}; c = {Sqrt[2], Sqrt[2]}; d = {-Sqrt[2], Sqrt[     2]}; e = {0, 2}; f = {0, -2};         ContourPlot[{x^2 + y^2 - 4 == 0}, {x, -2.5, 2.5}, {y, -2.5, 2.5},      ContourStyle -> {Blue, Thin}, Frame -> None, Axes -> True,      AspectRatio -> 1, Epilog ->      {        {Blue, PointSize[0.02], Point[a],            (Text[Style[#1, 14], #2 + {-0.1, .1}] & @@ {"a", a})},        {Blue, PointSize[0.02], Point [b],         (Text[Style[#1, 14], #2 + {-0.1, .1}] & @@ {"b", b})},        {Blue, PointSize[0.02], Point[c],         (Text[Style[#1, 14], #2 + {-0.1, .1}] & @@ {"c", c})},        {Blue, PointSize[0.02], Point[d],         (Text[Style[#1, 14], #2 + {-0.1, .1}] & @@ {"d", d})},        {Blue, PointSize[0.02], Point[e],         (Text[Style[#1, 14], #2 + {-0.1, .1}] & @@ {"e", e})},        {Blue, PointSize[0.02], Point[f],         (Text[Style[#1, 14], #2 + {-0.1, .1}] & @@ {"f", f})},        {Inset[Graphics[         {ColorData["Legacy", "Banana"], EdgeForm[{Thick, Pink}],           Opacity[0.15], Polygon[{a, b, c, d}]}], {0, 0}, {0, 0}, 4.2]},        {Inset[Graphics[         {ColorData["Legacy", "SlateBlue"], EdgeForm[{Thick, Pink}],           Opacity[0.15], Polygon[{a, e, c, f}]}], {0, 0}, {0, 0}, 3.6]}      }]       Although the two polygons I defined here out of six points have coordinates that are on the circle, I need to adjust the `size` parameter of the `Inset`, for every different position of a set of four points.   By trial an error I achieved something but far from satisfactory: I need to include the code above in a notebook under development where all the points are on the conic and dynamic and the polygon is constructed in the `Epilog` with these points.   Is there a way with MMA to compute the value of the `Inset size` parameter according to the vertices coordinates?
