SO I'm about to put together a new site and I'd like to go about it by making a web application that parses /#!/ url's and requests content accordingly via AJAX calls to a JSON API that is already put together. My questions are...   1. What are the best practices concerning #! url's   2. Are there any good JavaScript libraries that are built to handle Routing as well as History? or should I roll my own?   3. What are the pitfalls I should be aware of? Please no "/#!/ url's are breaking the internet!" comments , I've read Mike Davies Article as well as this one and this other one. I want to hear from people who have already implemented this type of a url structure and can tell me about their experiences.
