In terms of integration, I usually utilize Mathematica 9 to compute scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory. Recently, I employed it to compute a particularly difficult integral, and it outputted a lengthy combination of hypergeometric Appell functions. Is there any way I can determine how Mathematica actually 'evaluated' the integral, or more appropriately, 'manipulated' the integral into the form required to equate it to a bunch of Appell functions. What I'm looking for is essentially what Wolfram Alpha does when you click 'step by step solution,' but for Mathematica.
