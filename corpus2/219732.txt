I'm maintaining some legacy code of a physical simulation. The calculation object is build as a singleton, to ensure there is only one instance. A co- worker told me, that singleton are completely out-of-date and I should instantiate it through a smartpointer. But I think it is not the same, because the initialization by a smartpointer doesn't garanties me, that there is only one instance of this object, right? If I wanna have one single instance of an object in my code, which way is preferable: To use the singleton pattern or the initialize the object through one of this smartpointers (`auto_ptr<>` or `unique_ptr<>`).
