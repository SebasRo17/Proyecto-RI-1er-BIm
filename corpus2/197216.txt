I developed a pretty big website. I tested it myself to the best of my ability, but I cannot test all scenarios that my users may run in to. I found a testing team in India, but they don't seem to have any systematic approach to testing website functionality. They test each individual page rather than the full process that user takes on website. What processes or tools should I use to thoroughly test my website?
