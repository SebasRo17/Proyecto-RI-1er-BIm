> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  How many monitors do you use? Why? How they are used? Ive seen people mostly freelancers work with three or four monitors around them and it looks so cool. I personally have two screens in my office and i think it suits my needs well except certain situations where i feel that another display would have made it easier for me. So as a programmer/developer what is the ideal number of screens and display setup that would increase productivity. Will going to three or four screens decrease productivity as opposed to increasing it?
