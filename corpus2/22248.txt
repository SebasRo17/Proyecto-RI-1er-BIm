I have an N by N (N>3) matrix generated from fortran. I would like to find determinant of that matrix using mathematica? I could do this for a 3 by 3 matrix. I can also import the fortran output file to mathematica but how to write down the data in the prescribed format : Det[{{a1, a2, a3}, {a4, a5, a6}, {a7, a8, a9}}] for large N? Writing the data one by one is a tedious job.Kindly help. fortran output of a 5 by 5 matrix:               row1(0.600336   -0.169615    0.054516   -0.003712   -0.038923)     row2(0.637602    0.363638   -0.069266    0.006823    0.035388)     row3(-0.032774    0.876752    0.226435   -0.020353   -0.017496)     row4(-0.024340   -0.144815    0.950590    0.182733   -0.007234)     row5(0.024211    0.030092   -0.161703    0.966905    0.173151)
