It is clear that the knowledge of low level stuff is very important in our work. But in a situation where you're already developing commercial software on a high level, _and_ when you already have a chosen direction but don't have any assembly skill, isn't it more reasonable to focus on studying stuff related to your direction? Or is there a reason you should spend some time to learn the low-level basics anyway? When is it too late, and when it is not? And if it is _not_ too late, then how would one go about learning optimally (in the sense of not spending excessive time to get some depth and understanding)?
