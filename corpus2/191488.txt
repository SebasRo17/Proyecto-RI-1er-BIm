Given that C# has the `unsafe` keyword, are there situations in which it would still be beneficial to interoperate with C libraries? I could see the need for very fast number crunching, graphical manipulation or matrix operations, using pre-existing C libraries. But is there a use case for writing greenfield DLL's in, say, C99, and interoperating with them from C#? I imagine that there might be edge cases where dropping down to C (in the sense that it is closer to the metal) would be the only way to get the needed performance characteristics.
