I just finished learning the basics on data structures and algorithms using Python and C, completing some of the exercises from the book I read. I feel that it is necessary to implement some of these data structures and algorithms to enhance my understanding about the material that I just learned, such as the red-black tree and priority queue. Are there any good websites with material for me to use when practicing?
