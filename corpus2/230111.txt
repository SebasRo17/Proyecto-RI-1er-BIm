Is there a general rule of thumb, when we should pass a value as as class variable and when as a method argument? Or is it just a choice of the developer? For example -- are there any reasons, why following (PHP code):               class SomeClass     {         public function __construct()         {             $this->id = $_GET['id'];             $this->showMessage();         }              public function showMessage()         {             echo 'The ID is '.$this->id;         }     }      is better (or worse?) than this:               class SomeClass     {         public function __construct()         {             $this->showMessage($_GET['id']);         }              public function showMessage($id)         {             echo 'The ID is '.$id;         }     }      Note, that I'm only asking about differences between passing value as class variable vs. passing as method argument. Please, don't point out, that I should never operate directly on superglobals in PHP. I know, that this is wrong. I used it here, to simplify the example.
