I have had this burning question for a while. If I have a job and I comment my code well, to the point that anybody can now understand my hard work, would it make me less indispensable to the company? From my experience any homework assignment I hand in that is fully commented receives lower grades than, for example, a friend who submits fairly similar code without comments. Almost as if the comments helped nitpick the assignment. I have observed this several times in different classes. I have seen this even in my own tests. One question I commented the code and it was nitpicked until I lost 2 points. Then another question I was unsure and I didn’t comment, I earned full points on it and when I tested the code at home it not only failed to compile but it wouldn’t solve the problem. In the other hand I like comments, it helps me code, but now that I have a job I feel like submitting my code without comments. Any advice on the matter? * * * Since it was mentioned that I might be writing comments that don't contribute positively; here is a sample of something I just coded:               // Deactivate all enemies.     foreach(Transform t in transform)        t.SendMessage("Deactivate");      In this case I do think my comment is helpful, since it won't be clear that `Transform` is actually an `Enemy`, it could be anything really.
