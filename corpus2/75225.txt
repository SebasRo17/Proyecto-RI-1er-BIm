When I first started programming, I assumed that I would one day get to the point where I would start a project by sitting down and sketching a UML diagram of all the classes, then pretty much stick to that. I have now been programming for a couple years and it is not turning out that way. As I go through a project, I am often saying   * "Hey, I need a class to do ___ _. I didn't think of that before."   * "Wait, this function should really be in that class instead of this one. I'll move it over."   * "This should actually be two classes instead of one. I'll split it up."   * "I should make these three stand-alone classes all inherit from one abstract class."   * Etcetera, etcetera. Is it a bad sign that I am often redesigning like this as I go along? Does this mean I'm a poor programmer or is this normal?
