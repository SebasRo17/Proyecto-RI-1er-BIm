My background is back-end server development. **Very** back-end. Now I work in a position where I need to also take care of front-end. Nothing fancy but I need to be able to code for front-end as well. As I said no fancy stuff as I am not a designer. I know some very basic stuff about html/css/js but most of the time I spend googling when I need to do something. So I am wasting time. **To give an example** I needed to upload a file from the web page but I was not aware that there is an `input` tag specifically for file-upload. So I spend quite a while googling to figure out how to do it. So I am not sure if for example this should be something I should have known and it is a gap that I have or not. So what I am interested in is in what should I invest time to "master" so that what I daily need to do, I will be able to do, without spending too much time searching my way.   In a nutshell I am interested to understanding on what are the core "fundamentals" I should focus. **To give an example:**   In CSS I think I should invest time in attribute selectors or positioning but spending time learning fonts is a waste of time for my needs. Am I wrong? So with this is mind I am interested in the what to _must_ know to survive in html/css/javascript? **UPDATE**   None of the answers so far are really relevant and I really need some help.   May be my post need some clarifications? Is there something not clear?
