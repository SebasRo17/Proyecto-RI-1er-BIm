The Einstellung Effect refers to "a person's predisposition to solve a given problem in a specific manner even though there are "better" or more appropriate methods of solving the problem." As a programmer with a decent amount of experience, how can one combat this tendency to always approach problem solving from "tried and true" paths from past experience? To give two very concrete examples I have been building web applications for a long time, long enough to predate wide use of Javascript frameworks (e.g. jQuery) and better web application frameworks (e.g. ASP.NET MVC). If I have client work where I am under a time crunch or pressing issues from the problem domain or business rules, I tend to just use what I know to try to achieve a solution. This involves very ugly things like               document.getElementById       or using ASP.NET with template bound controls (DataList/Repeater) rather than figuring out how to rearchitect things with an ASP.NET MVC approach. One technique I've used in the past is to have personal projects which exist simply for exploring these new technologies but this is difficult to sustain. What other approaches could be recommended?
