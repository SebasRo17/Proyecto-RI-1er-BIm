I have a compiled program with MathLink. I want to use it from other C program, without Mathematica being involved at all. If i create my program with MathLink and connect to this external program, than i get number packets with number of functions: `DefineExternal ["funcname[]" , "{ }" , 89 ]` that registers these functions as external in Mathematica. How could i, from my C programm, call analog of Mathematica `CallPacket[89,{}]` function to call "funcname". Sending directly `MLPutFunction(lp, "funcname")` to this external application does not seems to be working, as, i suppose, it is intended to be used only for communication from external program with Mathematica, or?
