I have designed my first website recently. I created my own blog like thing in PHP. I write articles and below the articles there is a place to add comments. Sometimes I get random comments something like 'sd$^&(87&(*2d10hsdasko' with no meaning. There are hundreds of them. I think some silly person with lots of time must be playing with my website for fun. I am thinking of finding his IP address and blocking it. Has someone faced such a problem? How do you prevent people from playing with your website?
