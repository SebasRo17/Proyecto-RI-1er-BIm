If you're developer (Senior or Lead Developer) and you'd rather stay with code/design than pursue a management career, what are the available career paths at your company, or any you've heard of? How far can you go? Is it possible to continue being a geek until you bite the dust or is that too naive? Are people like Uncle Bob for example still considered developers, as they claim?
