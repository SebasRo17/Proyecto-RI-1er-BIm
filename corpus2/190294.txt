I would like to ask for your help. I searched a lot on Internet, but I found mismatched informations. **My questions:**   1. I tried to buy the "ISO/IEC 14882:2003(E) Programming Languages - C++" standard on the ansi.org, but i have not found it. However, I found this standard on nssn.org: www.nssn.org/search/DetailResults.aspx?docid=338353&selnode= But unfortunately this standard has been deleted or replaced with an another one. webstore.ansi.org/RecordDetail.aspx?sku=INCITS/ISO/IEC%2014882-2003 On the iso.org, it's also the same situation: www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=38110 Yes, I know that the actual standard is C++11, but I'm need the C++03 standard. From another sources, I heard that, the C++03 standard has become an open standard, so I can download it from the Internet for free, THE FULL, OFFICIAL standard, for example: code.google.com/p/openassist/downloads/detail?name=C%2B%2B%20Standard%20-%20ANSI%20ISO%20IEC%2014882%202003.pdf cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring13/CSCI-GA.2110-001/downloads/ Is this true? And it's the full, official C++03 standard, not just a draft?   1. Is that true, the C99 (C programming language, 1999) has also become an open standard? If yes, this is the full C99 standard?: cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring13/CSCI-GA.2110-001/downloads/C99.pdf
