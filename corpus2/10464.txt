I'm still very frustrated about the separation of the menubar (File, Edit, Insert, ...) and the open notebooks in different windows. I would prefer to have the menubar directly above each notebook in the same window, following the "normal" user interface principles of Windows and resulting a minimum of one window after startup instead two ones. Is there any command argument or preference option I didn't find so far?
