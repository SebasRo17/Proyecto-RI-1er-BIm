I used to work alone on small to medium sized programming projects before and **have no experience working in a team environment**. Currently, there will be 3 of us in an in-house software development team that is tasked to develop a number of software for an academic institution. We have decided to use the web for the majority of the projects and are planning to choose Ruby on Rails for this and I would like to ask for your inputs, advices and approaches with regards to software development as a team using the RoR web framework. One thing that has really confounded me is how you divide the programming tasks of a project if there are 3 of you that are really doing the coding. It’s obvious that we as developers approach a problem in a modular way and finish it one after another. If the project consists of 3 modules, should each one of us focus on each of those modules? Would it be faster that way? How about if the 3 of us would focus on one module first (that’s what I really prefer). Is using a distributed version control system such as Git the answer to this type of problem? Please don’t forget to put your tips and experiences with regards to team software development. Cheers!
