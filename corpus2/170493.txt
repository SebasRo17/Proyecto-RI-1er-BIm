Inevitably I'll stop using an antiquated css, script, or image file. Especially when a separate designer is tinkering with things and testing out a few versions of images. Before I build one myself, are there any tools out there that will drill through a website and list unlinked files? Specifically, I'm interested in ASP.NET MVC sites, so detecting calls to (and among many other things) @Url.Content(...) is important.
