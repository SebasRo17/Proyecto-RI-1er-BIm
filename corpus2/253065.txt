I am working on a system that controls a label printer and occasionally the label printer will print the same label 2,3,...,10 times. The error is transient, occurring once per 3000-4000 (once a month) or so labels. I am adding tracing to a log file to see what commands are being sent to the printer and state of the printer (we have a state machine defining allowable commands). But since this is a transient problem that may tell me that we had an error, but not why we had the error so I can fix the problem. I am also trying to get the print job files for the errant jobs so that I can emulate the job in my test environment. Hopefully with these I can reliably make the error occur I am curious how other might approach diagnosing this type of transient error.
