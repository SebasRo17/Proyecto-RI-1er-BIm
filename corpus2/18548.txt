I love how notebooks work in Mathematica. You can edit code in real time and hit Ctrl+Shift to run it. Additionally you copy and paste different cells around to organize and test ideas. Search and replace, plot/visualization,etc.. are built into the system. My question: **How could you adequately adapt Mathematica to use as a terminal replacement?** If not (this might get transferred to stackoverflow.com) is there a terminal editor that exists that works like Mathematica's notebook interface?
