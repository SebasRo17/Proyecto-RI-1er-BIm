I have been programming for over 15 years now. I consider myself a very good programmer, but I understand (like all of us) there are things that I need to work on. One of these things is code repetition when dealing with conditions. I will give a generic sample:               if(condition1)     {          //perform some logic          if(condition2)          {               //perform some logic               if(condition3)               {                    //Perform logic               }               else               {                    //MethodA(param)               }          }          else          {               //MethodA(param)          }     }     else     {          //MethodA()     }      Now, I cannot make it easy by doing the following:               if(condition1 && condition2)     {          }     else     {          }      I cannot do this since I need to perform some logic if condition1 is true and before I test condition2. Is there a way to structure if...else blocks to where if you need to call a method in each else blocks, you are not repeating yourself?
