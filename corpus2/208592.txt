I'm a newbie in php and i want to know if php can handle mouse events such as upon mouseCicked, mouseDoubleClicked, mouseMoved, mouseHovered etc.. And can events like button click , like displaying alert after clicking the submit button If yes, how can it be done ? I know that this can be done in Javascript               <script>         window.onbeforeunload = "Are you sure you want to leave?";     <script/>      Are there any other ways to do it ? Thank You !
