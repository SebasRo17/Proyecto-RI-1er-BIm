With               M = Partition[Range@10000000, 1000];       V = Range[10000] - 1;      I got the following timings:               Table[Prepend[M, V]; // Timing // First, {10}]      > {0.358802, 0.561603, 0.546003, 0.546003, 0.577203, 0.592803, \ 0.561603, > 0.577203, 0.561603, 0.561603} I was irritated by the fact that the first timing (0.358802) was significantly faster than the others. This also happened with similar functions and other sizes of `M` and `V`. Later I found the timing function recommended here:               timeAvg =        Function[func,         Do[If[# > 0.3, Return[#/5^i]] & @@ Timing@Do[func, {5^i}], {i, 0,           15}], HoldFirst];      Using it I now get a much "better" result:               Table[Prepend[M, V]; // timeAvg, {10}]      > {0.574083, 0.514803, 0.577203, 0.561603, 0.546003, 0.546003, \ 0.561603, > 0.546003, 0.546003, 0.530403} Why the initial jump with the inbuilt `Timing`?   Should I always use `timeAvg`?
