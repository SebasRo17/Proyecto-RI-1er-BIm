I am starting a new role running engineering in a young startup. The stuff they have is in SQL Server / Windows. I get the feeling we should think about moving to an OSS architecture, main reasons being cost, the ability to test new tools on the fly as they come out, and integrate with leading technologies like RoR and Python easily. Anyone has any suggestions on this? Can it get ugly if we keep our DB backend on SQL Server / Windows and build a Linux / OSS architecture on top of that? Or is the software BizSpark gives you access to enough for anything you need while you stay in the MSFT world? Are tools like LINQ and SSRS good enough? Don't mean to start a fire here, just a real issue our company is struggling with. Thanks for any replies.
