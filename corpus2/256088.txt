I am desperately trying to understand linq and now I have a concrete example of what I want to do (and fail):               Console.WriteLine("{0}", (from myaddresses[x].PostalNr where x => myaddresses[x].SortType == "110" ))      `myaddress` is a dictionary of `OneAddress` objects (my own object) and that object contains the properties `SortType` and `PostalNr`. I thought I didn't need a loop to do the above, but when the above is rewritten to work it might only take the first hit it gets or? The questions I want to perform is:   For each entry in the dictionary that has `SortType` set to 110, print out it's postal number.
