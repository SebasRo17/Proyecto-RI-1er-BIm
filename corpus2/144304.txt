One of the features in our project is to implement a comparison algorithm between two versions of text and provide a % change between the two versions. While I was researching, I came across google java-diff-utils project. Has anyone used this for comparing text using java-diff-utils ? Using this utility, I can get a list of "delta" which I assume I can use it for the % of difference between two versions of the text? Is this a correct way of doing this? If you have done any text comparison algorithm using Java, could you give me some pointers?
