My company has a client (in the US) that currently offers small businesses web-based payroll software. They want to offer small businesses a web-based accounting package that integrates well with their current web-based offerings. The company does have a CPA on staff which is a bonus. To this point they have said it needs to be a double-entry accounting system, GL, subledger, sales invoicing, cash receipts processing, payables entry and payment processing. So my question is … Should we try and write this ourselves from scratch with the on-staff CPA, try the open source path and see if we can adjust it to what we need or is there a different option that I’m not thinking of? Any advice in any direction would be greatly appreciated.
