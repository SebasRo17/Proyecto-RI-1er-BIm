I have a client right now requiring me to develop a school enrollment system. Now this is the first time im having this kind of challenge. Most of the past software that i created are not that complex. I know most all of you have created complex softwares, i just want your advise on this. Should i design first the front end or back end? thanks! Here's a conclusion of an article I found in the internet a while ago. Just whant to share http://www.skitoy.com/p/front-end-vs-back-end-developers-my-take/157 **Front-end vs. back-end developers (my take)** My personal take Again it’s a matter of training, some broad stroke generalizations: **Front end developers**   * **Typically don’t have a CS degree, or have a CS degree from a 3rd tier school.**   * Work in languages that similar to basic (see PHP is Basic)   * Have a visual skill in converting photoshop documents to CSS/HTML/etc.   * Have a high tolerance for iterative programming, due to type free languages **Back end developers**   * **Have a CS degree or lots of experience**   * Tend to me more systematic in their problem solving approach   * Don’t mind spending days finding the one object that is leaking   * Try and build tools to solve problems
