I'm working on a project where exist one method with title               string ValidateNewPasswordExpireCurrentPasswordAndCreateNewPassword(...)      I'm sure the method name must be changed. But can't found good and descriptive alternative. Also I can't separate method in multiple methods, like ValidateNewPassword(), ExpireCurrentPassword() and CreateNewPassword(). How can I rename the method and the same time to not lose self describing ability ?
