I have a 5x5 matrix function `H[kx]`               H[kx_]:={{T1, kx T8, -I T6, kx T9, -I kx T10},       {kx T8, T2, -I kx T11, kx T12, I kx T13},       {I T6, I kx T11, T3, -I kx T14, kx T15},       {kx T9, kx T12, I kx T14, T4, -I T7},       {I kx T10, -I kx T13, kx T15, I T7, T5}     }      with real parameters `T1` to `T15`, and I have data as follow               dat={{-0.005, -0.418971, 1.24115, 2.6321, 3.07757, 4.40013},       {-0.004, -0.418735, 1.24086, 2.63201, 3.07785, 4.40028},       {-0.003, -0.418551, 1.24063, 2.63194, 3.07806, 4.4004},       {-0.002, -0.41842, 1.24047, 2.63189, 3.07822, 4.40048},       {-0.001, -0.418342, 1.24038, 2.63185, 3.07831, 4.40053},       {0., -0.418316, 1.24034, 2.63184, 3.07834, 4.40055},       {0.001, -0.418342, 1.24038, 2.63185, 3.07831, 4.40053},       {0.002, -0.41842, 1.24047, 2.63189, 3.07822, 4.40048},       {0.003, -0.418548, 1.24063, 2.63194, 3.07807, 4.4004},       {0.004, -0.418728, 1.24085, 2.63201, 3.07785, 4.40028},       {0.005, -0.418959, 1.24114, 2.63211, 3.07758, 4.40012}     }      For each `i`, `kx=dat[[i,1]]`, and `dat[[i,2;;6]]` are the eigenvalues (from small to big) which will be fitted by `H[kx]`. The aim is to find all the parameters `T1` to `T15` which best produce the eigenvalues given by `dat` for all `kx`. How can I achieve this?
