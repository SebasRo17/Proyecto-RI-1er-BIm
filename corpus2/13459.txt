Please consider the following:               zeros={0.,0};        data={1, 0., 0};      DeleteCases[data, #]&/@zeros     Head/@zeros     (*{Real, Integer}*)     (*{{1, 0}, {1, 0.}}*)      For my understanding all integers (e.g. `0`, `2`) are element of the real numbers (e.g. `0.00000`, `2.00000`). So why would Mathematica not delete all zeros form `data`. I know from here that one can solve the `DeleteCases`-problem via `DeleteCases[Rationalize@data,0]` but this is not the point here. **EDIT** The following test may explain my problem slightly better:               sets={Integers,Reals,Complexes};     test=Table[Element[j, i], {i, sets}, {j, zeros}];     (*{{False, True}, {True, True}, {True, True}}*)      `test` returns as expected that `0` is element of `Integers`, `Reals` and `Complexes` for which reason I would expect for `DeleteCases[data, #]&/@zeros` the following result:               {{1}, {1, 0.}}      For the latter `0.` can not be deleted from `data` because I called _delete all 0-Integers_ whereas in the first case all zeros can be deleted as I called _delete all 0-Reals_. **Note:** Instead of `0` and `0.` we could use also `2` and `2.`. The value does not matter.
