I have been going over YouTube watching videos on eMail encryption and everyone seems to explain it from a different perspective. Some do it for a CompTIA exam while others just provide a primer. Here is what I understood: ![email encryption](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2Ooj8.png)    **Step1** : You compose an email that you want to send. Without encryption, it will be simple ASCII text that will be visible to anyone along the way.   **Step2** : You generate a digital signature to make sure that nobody gets to re-transmit your email and claim it was you. _Digital Signature_ is generated using **_Sender's private key_** which is usually a hash of the password and is then combined with the original message to form one long hash string. These signatures are _one-time-use-only_ and a new one is calculated for every email.   **Step 3** : You encrypt the compose of your email using **_Receiver's public key_** so that the only person who can read it is the intended receiver using their **_private key_**   **Step 4** : When you hit the send the email, what is transmitted now is gibberish to everyone apart from the intended receiver who will decrypt is using their **_private key_**   And there are various ways to do it like PEM, PGP, etc.      Correct me where I am wrong or refine where necessary.
