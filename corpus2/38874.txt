I have a sum that ordinarily takes some time (2 - 3 seconds) to calculate. When I put it into a manipulation though, it becomes very temperamental. It will work on some very small calculations, but completely refuses to output anything for larger values. Is this a characteristic of `Manipulate`, or is there some way to work around it? I looked here, but can't get it to work on `Manipulate`.
