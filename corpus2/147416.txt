I am relatively new to web development and haven't had to provide estimates for many large projects yet (my last large project was just paid for by the hour without a strict deadline or budget). A client is asking me to provide a cost and time estimate for providing a myriad of changes to another developers code for a website (php/mysql backend). Can anyone provide some advice or links on how to go about analyzing and estimating this? The code is horrible (the website was originally outsourced to india years and years ago) and it's hard to know if I'm going to suddenly hit hurdles and blow my estimates out of the water.
