Here is the typical sequence of events when someone navigates to a page in my application:   * The user navigates to my application, including URL parameters and query strings.   * The server receives the request and generates the HTML   * On the client, AngularJS grabs any parameters and makes an AJAX call   * The resulting data is then bound Personally, I find it a bit wasteful that this requires two hits to the server. It leads to a delay between the HTML being returned and the inputs being populated. Am I missing something? Is there a way to avoid going back and forth the first time?
