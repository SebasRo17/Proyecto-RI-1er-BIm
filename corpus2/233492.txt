## The Question What are the origins of the Public/Private function paradigm? ## Background A question came up in chat about Header files in C, and their usage being mainly to help the compiler, _not_ the programmer. It's my understanding though, that this is the first usage of the concept of "Private" functions, or functions which aren't prototyped in the header file. Had C not used header files to declare functions, would we still have the current concept of Public and Private functions as seen in C# or Java? Or was this concept initially developed elsewhere and simply implemented in the C Header/Source scheme
