I'm trying to solve the following system with Mathematica:               Poblacion = {       {1900, 1.65},       {1910, 1.75},       {1920, 1.86},       {1930, 2.07},       {1940, 2.30},       {1950, 2.53},       {1960, 3.02},       {1970, 3.70},       {1980, 4.45},       {1990, 5.30},       {2000, 7.29}       }          P[t_] := 1 / (-q (K t + C))^(1/q)          NSolve[{P[1900] == 1.65, P[1910] == 1.75, P[1920] == 1.86}, {K, q, C}]      But I can't get it working. Could you please tell me what I'm doing wrong?
