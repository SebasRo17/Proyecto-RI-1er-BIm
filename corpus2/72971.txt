I love programming and I can't imagine living without it. The problem is when I am developing my own unique algorithms I find it difficult to properly co- ordinate my thinking and I spend more than the reasonable time trying to visualize the solution, although I usually find the solution. I think spending that much time on sometimes "not that hard" algorithm show's that my thinking strategy might be wrong. Have you experienced similar issues? How do you solve it? Or am I wrong? Please advise me.
