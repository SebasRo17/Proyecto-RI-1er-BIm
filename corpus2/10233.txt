I've been working here for about 3 months now, and this company has been around since 2003. I've the only full time developer, and I don't know what happened to the part time guy who was doing work before I got hired, I haven't seen him since a month after I started, aside from a couple emails. Essentially, that makes me the only developer, trying to balance adding new features to our main product (subscription website service), developing an Android-based version of the product, handling client issues, working on migrating clients from old version to new version (and the headaches that will result from this), fixing issues with a signup service for out ISP side of things, and helping with tech support for the ISP side. Not to mention the massive overhaul I'm fairly certain the database needs, that will mean at least a few months' work. My bosses hired an intern to help me with the Android version, but the one boss randomly went to England until December, taking the intern with him. Any tips I can use on convincing management to hire somebody else? Even if just a second full time support guy to help with the phone calls?
