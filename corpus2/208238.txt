Nearly all open source software licenses require (or at least lawyers generally suggest they require) users to include the full license in the root of the project that they are protecting. One lawyer I spoke to suggests this is a legacy of the CD age, when it was necessary that a full license be included in a jewel case. But today, we're living in the cloud age. Why can't I, for instance, simply host the full license at my website, and include the title + URL of that license in the header of my source files? **Bonus:** If it's generally agreed that established licenses must be kept intact in the root, why hasn't the OSI of FSF approved a license that you _can_ refer to by URL, and what is keeping someone from creating that license?
