Like many corporations the company I work for is transitioning to a performance review system based on SMART objectives. My team is a high functioning agile development team employing practices from both SCRUM and Extreme Programming. To our great benefit our employment of agile practices has the full support of immediate and upper management. To accomplish work our team utilizes three week iterations. Beyond the immediate iteration we have a general plan laid out into quarters. Meaning that what we will have accomplished a few quarters from now is a lot hazier than what we will be accomplishing in the immediate quarter. We certainly have a general idea of where our project is headed, but the keyword here is general. Given our approach to project planning members of our team and myself are finding it difficult to write objectives which are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound. Two existing questions on Programmers.se do a good job of addressing some of our concerns:   * What is an example of a good SMART objective for a programmer?   * Are SMART goals useful for programmers? However, the questions elicited more general responses than specifics for dealing with SMART goals when working on an agile development team. As an agile developer how do you write five to seven, year long objectives which are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound?
