I have method like this:               methodA(someParams)     {       do some initializations,etc;       call methodB(someParams);     }          methodB(someParams)     {       do work;       if blah then raise exception::FileNotFound       if blahblah then raise exception::ResourceNotFound     }      When I am adding documentation for `methodB`, I am also documenting the exceptions it can raise. But how about documentation of `methodA` ? It IS consuming `methodB` that may raise exceptions, so should I still document those exceptions for methodA as well? Right? wrong?
