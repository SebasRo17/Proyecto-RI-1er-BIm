In a _Mathematica_ session, I evaluate:               Needs["FiniteFields`"];     fld = GF[2];      Now, for example, I'd like to compute $a^3+a^5$ for $a \in{Z_2}$. The result I'd like to have is $0$, because in $Z_2$, $a^n=a$ and $a+a=0$. I tried:               fld[{a^3}] + fld[{a^2}]      But _Mathematica_ gives me:               Subscript[{Mod[a^2 + a^3, 2]}, 2]      How can I simplify $a^3+a^2$ in $Z_2$ to get zero?
