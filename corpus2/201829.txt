I'm building a contest where you can win prizes by opening boxes. Whatever the box is open, i just send a request to the server to test if the user won something. Since this contest is not a "Register and we'll draw a winner after some time" type of contest, i'm a bit puzzled at what algorithm i should be taking to calculate chances to win. I've devised in an excel spreadsheet what i call a progressive winning algorithm in the form of:               ([Number of prizes left] / [Prizes i should have left at this time of contest]) / 4      Which gives me a rough percentage change of winning an item off the pool of remaining items around 25%. If there are many winners within a close timespan, the algorithm should automatically lower the chances of winning while going in the opposite direction if the scenario is different. What i'm afraid of is that not all my items will be drawn by the end of the contest because it's a linear calculation of expected gifts left or i'm afraid that, by chance, most of my prizes will be won after only half of the contest (and by chance i mean that lots of player get truly great random odds and keep winning) So my question is, how should i tackle this kind of scenario, what are already known methods for this and please keep it simple, i'm no mathematician nor statistician. * * * **Variables to take into account**   * 100 prizes to give out total   * Contest lasts five whole days   * Unknown number of participants   * Unknown participation rule but will probably be once per day based on a unique credential such as an e-mail address.   * It's an online contest where a user opens a virtual box, nothing physical
