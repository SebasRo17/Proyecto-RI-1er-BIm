Working in a Biotech company, there are many opportunities for automating the processing of information. There are also many software solutions e.g. LIM systems, ELN's etc. to fit those specific needs. What I have found and am continuously learning about is that these systems, despite doing their specific jobs very well, are isolated from one another. Typically, for one piece of information to get related to another piece of information in another system, some coordination between the users needs to occur via e-mail, word- of-mouth, etc. # The Problem Coordination and delivery of the information usually takes days or in some cases, a week or more to accomplish with what seems to me a high-potential to misinform and make non-tracked mistakes. # Possible Solution The role I have at this company is an experimental one to play around with the proposed solution of having a resource to develop software solutions to connect these isolated systems. We can use open-source libraries, external services, build it from scratch, etc. # The Question Since the Biotech company is not a software company, should such a company make such an invest in developing its own software solutions especially when there is nothing available on the market that fits their processes exactly? Are there systems out there that fit this kind of work? What experiences validate your answers? Thanks, in advance!
