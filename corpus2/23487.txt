Bellow I have a differential equation which hits a singularity at low values of t. What I want to do is somehow utilize the `WhenEvent` command in order to replace the last factor of the equation (`2/t a'[t]`) with 0 at low values of t in order to avoid getting errors. Is there a way to do this? Here is an example of the equation and how I attempted to use the `WhenEvent` Command.               q = NDSolve[{a''[t] ==           1/2 a[t]^2 + 1/6 a[t]^6 - 1/4 a[t]^4 - 2/t a'[t], a[0] == 1,          a'[0] == 0, WhenEvent[t < .1, a'[t] -> 0]}, a, {t, 0, 1}];      Any help would be appreciated!
