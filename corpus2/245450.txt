As part of a service orientated architecture (SOA) I've been asked to create a web service which itself acquires data from a third party web service. I'm to hide any implementation specific details of the third party web service and map the data returned so as to avoid leaking any implementation details of the third party service. I'm new to SOA. I would colloquially call this project something like " _a web service bridge_ ".   **What is the correct SOA enterprise architecture pattern term for this?** I'm very confused as many of the enterprise architecture patterns seem to be describing the same thing (service facade?, message broker? message channel? proxy?). I don't think I'm quite in tune with the level of abstraction required.
