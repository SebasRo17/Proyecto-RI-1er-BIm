I want to graph more than two, lets say 5 different `ParametricPlot`-s all in terms of different time variables. Is there any way to do this, such that they all show up on the same plot? For example, I want to plot:   * `{3Cos[a],4Sin[a]}`.. on some interval,   * `{4Cos[b],5Sin[b]}`.. on some interval,   * `{5Cos[c],6Sin[c]}`.. on some interval,   * `{6Cos[d],7Sin[d]}`.. on some interval,   * `{7Cos[e],8Sin[e]}`.. on some interval, all on one picture. Thank You Very Much.
