I'm trying to draw up an optical system where I can show an example of wavefront error on an exit pupil. It would be great if I could take the results of a 3D function from Plot3D and use it as a graphics object that I could transform to fit into my Graphis3D drawing. Below is some code that does not work but it shows a very simple case of what I would like to be able to do.               pic = Plot3D[Sin[x] Sin[y], {x, -5, 5}, {y, -5, 5},              RegionFunction -> Function[{x, y, z}, x^2 + y^2 <= 20]];          Graphics3D[{Rotate[pic, \[Pi]/4, {1, 1, 1}],              Arrow[{{0, 0, 0}, {5, 5, 5}}]}]
