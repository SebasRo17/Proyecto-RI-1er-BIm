How can I make a construct similar to C++ functions:               try{} catch{}      I want to use it to avoid showing a lot of errors in the plot area when for example one of the arguments becomes complex or overflows etc. I want to avoid of creating a plot if ANYTHING goes wrong, so it does not look like the one below:               Show@Graphics[Line[{{Complex[1, 1]}, {Complex[2, 2]}}]]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/b7tJG.png) Approaches like:               Check[Show[Graphics[Line[{{Complex[1, 1]}, {Complex[2, 2]}}]]], Show[Graphics[{}]]]      or               Check[Graphics[Line[{{Complex[1, 1]}, {Complex[2, 2]}}]], Show[Graphics[{}]]      also fail.
