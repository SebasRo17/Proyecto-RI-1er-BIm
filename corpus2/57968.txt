Michael Trott posted this incredible tour-de-force on the wolfram blog: http://blog.wolfram.com/2014/08/19/which-is-closer-local-beer-or-local- whiskey/ The length of the post is overwhelming, so I'm trying to crawl through it with a fine toothed comb looking for some Mathematica tricks and techniques that are new to me. I would be very interested to see what others noticed, since I doubt I will find everything in there. Some of the things I noticed were:   * use of TimeSeries, which is a new discovery for me in MMA 10   * {Except["Alaska"], "UnitedStates"} as a pattern for Cases ... I regularly struggle with using Cases, so this is mysterious to me   * the StringReplace / Shortest / StringCases constructs when parsing the distillery information is not something I had seen before and seems powerful
