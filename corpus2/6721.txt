I've made a simple `.cdf` that makes a function from a list of data I've provided in table form (using `ListInterpolation`) and plots it on a graph (no importing, exporting or conversion of data from string) and I still get a grey block when I try to post it online, indicating that I'm violating some security rule. It works with the `{fullscreen: 'true'}` workaround, but I don't know what I'm doing that necessitates this. Advice? Thanks
