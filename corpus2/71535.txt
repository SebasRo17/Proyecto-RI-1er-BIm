For custom software, when you are giving your customer an estimate, how much detail do you tend to include? Do you:   * break it down into small tasks that can be done in a few hours and give them the full list?   * give them one big number and work towards that? And if so does that come from a more detailed estimate that you don't need to show them?   * Do you break it up into big "phases" and give them a number of hours for each phase? This isn't for fixed bid contracts or anything, just more of a "We think this will cost you X hours at $Y an hour" kind of situation.
