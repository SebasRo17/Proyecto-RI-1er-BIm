In process concurrency and thread concurrency it's quite obvious how the kernel sees these as they map directly to real things that the kernel manages. When it comes to Golang goroutines and Ruby Fibers (these are similar things right?) I'm clueless as to how these are managed. Are they managed by the respective languages implementation/Virtual Machine(I know Go doesn't have a VM) or are they mapped to something that the kernel is better at handling?
