Suppose I have a tesselation, e.g. the Stanford bunny:               bunny = Import["http://graphics.stanford.edu/~mdfisher/Data/Meshes/bunny.obj", "OBJ"]      ![Stanford bunny](http://i.stack.imgur.com/lOysk.png) I'd like to be able to click on one of the vertices of the tessellation and either get its coordinates, or even better, its index in the `GraphicsComplex`. Is there a way to do this?
