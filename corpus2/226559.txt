In my Android application, I am using a couple of open source libraries. The only requirement these libraries have is that I must show their respective copyright notices in my application. I am trying to understand where would one typically display third-party copyrights. I could probably create a menu item "About" and display an about dialog box that has all the copyrights listed. However, I would appreciate your feedback on what the standard practice is.
