I don't really know the nomenclature regarding these matters, but here is a brief description of what I want. Please let me know if I should substantiate more. So I have this larger project involving databases, different languages, and interfaces (SQL, R, C, Python, both GUI & CLI). It's growing a little too big to fit into a simple mental construct of what is actually going on. I am interested in making the mother of all charts mapping out the project from a system architecture perspective. Generally speaking I'd like the information to show some meta information of the data rather and where it is produced / consumed. I guess it is close to a flow chart, but as I am no expert in these matters I am asking for help. Are there any tools for this? Any best practices regarding formatting etc? How about symbols for all the procedures / classes / methods / functions? Please chime in if you have any opinion regarding the matter. Just to frame a little bit more what I would be interested in:   * I rather use tools like Latex than Visio   * I hate large and fancy IDEs, but I adore VIM   * I would do with static solutions, but I would be interested in automated solutions too (as long as they are not too complicated of course)
