# Background I have a business question regarding web-based software licensing. A number of web sites offer software as a service for various APIs. A good example is Google's Custom Search API. The process to use web services typically resembles:   1. **Account.** User creates an account.   2. **Server.** User defines the IP address(es) of the server(s) that will make API requests.   3. **Key.** User receives a public API key for the desired API(s).   4. **Guide.** User is given documentation that shows how to use the API key to make a request.   5. **Test.** User can make test requests to verify integration functionality.   6. **Billing.** User pays to activate the account.   7. **Production.** User integrates the web service into their applications.   8. **Deactivation.** System deactivates accounts when expired, exceeds request limit, etc. These requirements are in addition to integration with the service being licensed. # Problem That is a lot of work for a small business. # Questions What off-the-shelf, open source projects address this problem? If there are no such projects, what would you do to architect a viable, low- cost solution (ideally, a percentage of each license)? That is, what software or existing commercial services would you use for a small business (having little to no income) that seeks to license web-based services? Thank you! # Related Links   * License key solution in web application, what is the best approach?   * API Management System
