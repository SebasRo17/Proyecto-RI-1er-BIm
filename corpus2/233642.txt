I am only coding in Objective-C and I have no experience with backend coding, only a high-level understanding. I understand why a lot of programming projects require backend servers but I'm not absolutely clear on a high-level perspective why Mailbox needs their own. They get their data from the Gmail API, It is my understanding that most iOS client app receive data from a backend from a public API (like Gmail), download in the iOS app and show it in their app. Therefore they have no need for their own servers in order to receive the appropriate data to show it to their users. My only explanation is that Mailbox follows this logic: Gmail data --> Mailbox's app AND servers --> users interact with app --> save changes on their own servers and Google's via the API The last part to me would mean that they would basically keep the data of all the Archived, Delayed, Deleted, and Listed emails on their own servers rather than Google's. Is my understanding correct? Thank you
