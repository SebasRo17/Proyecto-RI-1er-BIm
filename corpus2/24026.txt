I try to compute the distance between two curves. I use the `EuclideanDistance` to do that. Here my code:               j = -1;     a32 = 3.9683436;     a43 = 4.2925064;     alfaF32 = 1.54553;     alfaF43 = 2.34472;     mu = 10^-3;     tot4 = alfaF32*mu;     tot5 = alfaF43*mu;          S = ((EuclideanDistance[{a43 (-Sqrt[(16 tot5*i)/                   3 (1 + tot5/(27 i^3))] - (2 tot5)/(9 j*i)) +               a43}, {a32 (Sqrt[(16 tot4*i)/3 (1 + tot4/(27 i^3))] - (                 2 tot4)/(9 j*i)) + a32}])/(3/2 - 4/3))^2;     n = ListPlot[Table[S, {i, 0.0001, .3, 0.0001}]]      But the x-axis is wrong, i try to explan. The x-axis must go from 0.0001 to 0.3 as in the S function. But the x-axis is completly wrong (the dimension is from 0.3/0.0001). Someone could help me?
