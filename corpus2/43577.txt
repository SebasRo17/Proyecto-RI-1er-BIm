I have a real symmetric matrix **H** which is in symbolic form, I need a matrix **P** that can diagonalize **H** ; also **P** is orthogonal and its columns are the eigenvectors of **H**. How can I doing this in mathematica? Below is my sample matrix.                H = {{λ - u, -t, -Δ, 0},          {-t, -λ - u, 0, -Δ},           {-Δ, 0, -λ + u,  t},          {0, -Δ, t, λ + u}} // MatrixForm
