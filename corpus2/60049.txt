I am about to start a new project (a game, but thats unimportant). The basic idea is in my head but not all the details. I don't want to start programming without planning, but I am seriously fighting my urge to just do it. I want some planning before to prevent refactoring the whole app just because a new feature I could think of requires it. On the other hand, I don't want to plan multiple months (spare time) and start that because I have some fear that I will lose my motivation in this time. What I am looking for is a way of combining both without one dominating the other. Should I realize the project in the way of scrum? Should I creating user stories and then realize them? Should I work feature driven? (I have some experience in scrum and the classic "specification to code" way.) **Update** : How about starting with a "click dummy" and implementing the functionality later?
