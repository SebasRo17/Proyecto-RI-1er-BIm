If I have a list of n number of rules, what is a concise way of breaking the data into 2 lists of the first and second part of the rule? This works, but seems like an unnecessary amount of code to me:               data = {       1 -> 3, 1 -> 3, 1 -> 3, 2 -> 3, 2 -> 3, 2 -> 1,        3 -> 2, 3 -> 2, 3 -> 3, 4 -> 1, 4 -> 2, 4 -> 2     };          list1 = First[Partition[Flatten[data /. Rule -> List], 2, 2, 1, {}]~Flatten~{2}]      > >     {1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4} >                 list2 = Last[Partition[Flatten[data /. Rule -> List], 2, 2, 1, {}]~Flatten~{2}]      > >     {3,3,3,3,3,1,2,2,3,1,2,2} >
