Suppose I have list               a = Range[10]      > `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}` in which I want to set some elements to be a list               a[[4 ;; 7]] = {1, 2, 3};       > `{1, 2, 3, {1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}, 8, 9, 10}` Which is fine and dandy unless my part span is the same length as my list:               a[[4 ;; 6]] = {1, 2, 3};      > `{1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10}` How can I force the assignment to behave consistently? In my case, I always want the first behaviour. But conceivably someone might always want the second behaviour with errors if the lengths don't match.
