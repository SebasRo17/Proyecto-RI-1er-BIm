What do you do when you don't have any good code samples available when asked by a prospective employer? I like to consider myself a fairly capable developer but I can't share any of the software I've been writing for my company the last few years. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find the time to put much work in my personal projects either. Basically, I don't think I can find any code samples that are a good representative of my skills that I can share. Any ideas? Thanks in advance.
