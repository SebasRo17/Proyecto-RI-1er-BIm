I've come across some comments and answers on Programmers.SE that decry the use of the phrase "Code Smell" and I've been wondering what the reasoning is for those who dislike it. I first encountered this term when I read Fowler's Refactoring back in 2000, yet it's only in the last year or two that I've heard any complaint about the use of the phrase. **Q:** Would it be correct to say that the phrase _Code Smell_ has recently started to fall into disfavor, and if so why does/should this metaphor no longer apply? * * * I am looking for well defined answers supported by sound reasoning as I realize that this question is borderline subjective.
