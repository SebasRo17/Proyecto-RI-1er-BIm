As I am reading a Book about "Algorithm Analysis", I came across count_sort Algorithm. A question has been raised in my head. I read in many other papers, that "Quick Sort/ Merge Sort" are the best and the most efficient sorting algorithms. However, the complexity of this Algorithms is O(n+k), same for Quick sort, and better than Merge sort O(n ln n). My question:   * What is the problem with this sorting Algorithm.    * What are the best sorting Algorithms that I have to check ?              def count_sort(seq):         b, c = [], defaultdict(list)         for x in seq:             c[x].append(x)              for k in range(min(c), max(c)+1):             b.extend(c[k])         return b
