I'm trying to get all isolated finite equilibria of a moderate multi- dimensional non-linear system of equations. Particularly I have 9 independent variables and third order at most. It turns out that, as this system models chemical kinetics, all coefficients have disparate magnitudes. When I throw my system into NSolve it just keeps running. Forever. It does not throw empty brackets or errors or anything of that sort. Furthermore, I know that it has at least one equilibrium point because I used it in a transient problem, i.e. one isolated solution is a steady state (I need all equilibria though). This is first time I try solving such systems in Mathematica but I don't think it is too large for the software to handle it. Is it common for NSolve to take such a long time solving these multidimensional non-linear systems of equations? Would I have to rescale my polynomials before throwing it into NSolve so that I get a better performance? Thanks!
