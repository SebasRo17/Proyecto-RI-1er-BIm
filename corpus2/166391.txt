I have a MFC CMap object, each object stores 160K~ entries of long data. I need to store it on Oracle SQL. We decided to save it as a blob. Since we do not want to make additional table, we also thought about saving it as local file, with the SQL column pointing to that file. We would prefer to just keep it as blob on the server and clear the table every couple of weeks. The table has a sequential key as ID, and 2 column of time. I need to add the blob column in order to store on every row that CMap. Can you recommend a guide to do this approach (read/write Map to blob or maybe a clob)? Thanks.
