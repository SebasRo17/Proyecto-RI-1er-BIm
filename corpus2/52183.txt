I am using this code inside of a Manipulate:               Switch[cases,           "custom", Control[{{names, True}, {True, False}}],          "a", Control[{{slide, 0}, 0, 1}],          "b", Control[{{setter, "das"}, {"das", "der", "die"}}]],         {{cases, "custom"}, {"custom", "a", "b"}}      The variable cases is supposed to control which other control type is visible. However i get the following error message: > Manipulate::vsform: Manipulate argument Switch[cases, > > [...] > > does not have the correct form for a variable specification. >> [...] is a placeholder which in mathematica displays the controls i specified above (Odd, right?). I cannot post screenshots yet unfortunately. Does anybody have an idea why this isn't working or how to better implement a manipulate control wich which i can dynamically alter the number and types of the other controls?
