I am happy to discover that I can run a Mathematica session tunneled over SSH. However, as expected for X11 applications over the network, Mathematica's GUI does not have the responsiveness that I wish it had. I have enabled SSH Compression to the highest level, and I am using ethernet connections where possible, though my cable modem is probably the bottleneck. For various reasons, I am unable to install NX, x2go, xpra, etc. Also, it turns out that remote MathKernel/local UI will not be an option. It seems that some stock X applications (such as evince and gnome-terminal) run acceptably over my current setup. My wish is to trim Mathematica GUI as much as possible, so as to minimize re-draws and the like which would slow things down. I have been through the appearance preference pane, and turned off various "code intelligence" features which seem to cause things to redraw, and lowered graphics quality to their lowest. Also, I have disabled niceties such as the Suggestion Bar. But it is possible that I am missing something that others have found. Which settings/modifications have you found to reduce the latency of Mathematica GUI sessions?
