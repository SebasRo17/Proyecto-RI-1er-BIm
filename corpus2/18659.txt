> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Is it possible to customize the Suggestions Bar? I have written a little code (like a minipackage) of different functions. In using my code, the user typically starts by running my integration function `integratePV[]`. Then, typically, the most natural thing to do from there is to use one of two functions: `refinePV` or `expandPV` on the output of the previous expression. How can I influence the Suggestion Bar to make these two user-defined functions `refinePV` and `expandPV` appear right after the function `integratePV[...]` has been called?
