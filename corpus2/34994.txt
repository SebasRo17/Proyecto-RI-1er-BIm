I don't understand what _Mathematica_ is doing to get these solutions. I ask it to solve two equations, the left hand side of both expressions are the same, the right hand sides differ by a ± sign. I really don't think the solutions should be the same, but that is what _Mathematica_ returns, without any comment.               FullSimplify[{       Solve[1/2 E^(-((2 I l π)/k)) (-(-1 + E^(I ((4 l π)/k + δ))) Sqrt[ρ] + Sqrt[-2 E^(I ((4 l π)/k + δ)) (-2 + ρ) + ρ + E^(2 I ((4 l π)/k + δ)) ρ]) == E^(2 π I m/n), ρ],        Solve[1/2 E^(-((2 I l π)/k)) (-(-1 + E^(I ((4 l π)/k + δ))) Sqrt[ρ] + Sqrt[-2 E^(I ((4 l π)/k + δ)) (-2 + ρ) + ρ + E^(2 I ((4 l π)/k + δ)) ρ]) == -E^(2 π I m/n), ρ]     }]      _Mathematica_ returns > >     { >       {{ρ -> (-1 + Cos[(4 m π)/n - δ])/(-1 + Cos[(4 l π)/k + δ])}}, >       {{ρ -> (-1 + Cos[(4 m π)/n - δ])/(-1 + Cos[(4 l π)/k + δ])}} >     } >   Can anyone can shed some light on this, please?
