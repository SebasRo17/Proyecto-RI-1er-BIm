I am attempting to perform a comparison of pseudorandom number generation with the RAND Corporation's "A Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates" for a Computational Physics course. I have the text file, which is available from the RAND Website. I have tried Import and Import["data.txt", Table] with minimal success. My desire is to get this in a table format where I can then use them in a Monte Carlo simulation. I would prefer to be able to address this in the format "randData[m,n]" like addressing the value in an m,n matrix. I am aware of similar questions, and have used the search. Thanks in advance for your assistance. importing a matrix Importing data sets from plain-text files and performing operations on them
