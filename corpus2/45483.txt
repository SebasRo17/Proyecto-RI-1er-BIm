I performed an experiment where I measured diffusion in a lipid bilayer. I performed the measurement by fluorescently labeling some molecules in the bilayer, and the irradiating them with light until they become nonfluorescent (bleached). This results in a dark spot in the field of view which gradually regains fluorescence as time progresses. The data here represents the normalized fluorescence recovery. at t = 0 we have no recovery so the value is zero. As time progresses the fluorescence recovery increases until about 70% of the initial value. I am trying to fit the following two functions to my data. However they are not converging. For fitequation1, I can get convergence if I specify constraints. For fit equation2 I cannon get convergence. Any suggestions?               normalized = {0., 0.136813, 0.260859, 0.426885, 0.469779, 0.505445, 0.543104, \     0.566412, 0.579988, 0.595328, 0.617525, 0.644393, 0.647385, 0.665809, \     0.670076, 0.673314, 0.675727, 0.665924}          fitEquation = a (1 - Exp[-b t]) + c (1 - Exp[-d t]);     fitEquation2 = y0 + a (1 - Exp[-k t]);          soln = FindFit[     normalized, {fitEquation, {a > 0 , b > 0, c > 0, d > 0, a <= 1,      b <= 1, c <= 1 }}, {a, b, c, d}, t]      soln2 = FindFit[     normalized, {fitEquation2 , {y0 + a < 1,  k <= 1}}, {y0, a, k}, t]
