I have a list, for example               list = {2, 1, 3, 5, 4, 6}      How to find longest ascending sequence of this list? There are two meanings of this question:   1. Find the largest subset that $$ X_{i_1} < X_{i_2} < \ldots < X_{i_{n-1}} < X_{i_n} $$ where $$ i_1 < i_2 < \ldots < i_{n-1} < i_n $$   2. Find the largest subsequence that $$ X_i < X_{i+1} < \ldots < X_{j-1} < X_{j} $$
