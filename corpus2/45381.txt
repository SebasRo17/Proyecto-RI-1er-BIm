when we wish to use one list to select items from another using something like `Pick`, writing the following code, for example, causes us to lose the 1-to-1 correspondence between items in the two lists:               dataArray = {"A","B","C","D","E","F","G"};     testArray = {0.223,0.3,1.2,0.44,4,0.24449,1.01};     dataArray = Pick[dataArray, #>= 1 &/@ testArray];          output = {"C", "E", "G"}      Without having to make a copy of anything, how do we safely prune items from, here `testArray`, to restore the previous 1-to-1 correspondence between elements in `testArray` and elements in `dataArray`? For example, if `B` in `dataArray` corresponds to `0.3` in `testArray` (based on its index), it should again do so after the `Pick` pruning step.
