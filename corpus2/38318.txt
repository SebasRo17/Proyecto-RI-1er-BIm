Though I learned Systems Analysis in college, I feel like I am out of date. All I really remember is certain aspects of the SDLC which I realize is a little pass√©. I've been on the implementation end of the development process for the past five years, and I am wanting to explore design and perhaps do a few projects of my own. So I have two questions. What is the most popular design methodology? And what book would be a good place to start for someone who wants to learn that methodology. I know quite a lot of methodologies and patterns (PRISM, MVVM, UML, etc..), but I am having a very hard time picturing the overall process of design. Also, is there a website that offers sample requirements documents? That's the hardest part of starting your own projects is finding something to do.
