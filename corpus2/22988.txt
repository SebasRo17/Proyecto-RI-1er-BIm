I am having issues using `Manipulate` to plot the (numeric) solution to an ODE for different parameter values. I have a code that has several stages, which seem to all work when I do them one after another. This code solves a system of ODEs (for particular parameter values), then does a parametric plot of the solution. The problem is I need to put the lines together to wrap them around with `Manipulate` (for I can do this code again easily for different parameter values), and this is causing me a lot of pain. My initial code is:               (*this is my ODE*)          unforced[x0_, p0_, α_:α, δ_:δ] :=      {x'[t] == p[t],       p'[t] == -α x[t] - δ p[t] + α (x[t])^3,       x[0] == x0,       p[0] == p0     }          (*Choose some parameter values*)          α = -1, δ = 1          (*Solve my ODE*)          s = NDSolve[unforced[x0 = 1, p0 = 1], {x, p}, {t, 20}]          (*Plot It*)          ParametricPlot[Evaluate[{x[t], p[t]} /. s], {t, 0, 20}]      But now I want to be able to `Manipulate` the parameter values `α` and `δ`. So I start putting the lines of code together... and problems happen.               ParametricPlot[Evaluate[{x[t], p[t]}/.                    NDSolve[{x'[t] == p[t],                              p'[t] == -α x[t] - δ p[t] + α (x[t])^3,                              x[0] == 1, p[0] == 0}, {x, p}, {t, 20}]], {t, 0, 20}]      This plots an empty graph. This confuses me because it seems like all I did was substitute into my previous code. Because this doesn't work, I can't put a `Manipulate` around this. If it worked then I would have tried:               Manipulate[ParametricPlot[Evaluate[{x[t], p[t]} /.                     NDSolve[{x'[t] == p[t],                                 p'[t] == -α x[t] - δ p[t] + α (x[t])^3,                               x[0] == 1, p[0] == 0}, {x, p}, {t, 20}]], {t, 0, 20}],                 {{α, -1, "α"}, -2, 0}, {{δ, 0, "δ"}, 0, 2}]      How do I get around this problem?
