ESRI shape files (shp): importing the polygon data can yield a very large list. It is computationally intensive rendering the polygon. I have been trying to convert to `GraphicsComplex` by extracting all the vertices, indexing them and then specifying the polygon by the vertex index. However, the computational effort of removing duplicates (shared borders) seems to be computationally worse than the original issue (for the large input size of the list of vertices). Can someone advise me if there is a better way to work with these files? I am able to use them but not efficiently.
