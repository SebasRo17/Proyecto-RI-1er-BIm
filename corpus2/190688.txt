I have a WCF web service hosted in a load balanced environment. I do not need any WCF session related functionality in the service. **QUESTION** What are the scenarios in which performances will be best if   1. keepAliveEnabled = false   2. keepAliveEnabled = true **Reference** From Load Balancing > By default, the BasicHttpBinding sends a connection HTTP header in messages > with a Keep-Alive value, which enables clients to establish persistent > connections to the services that support them. This configuration offers > enhanced throughput because previously established connections can be reused > to send subsequent messages to the same server. However, connection reuse > may cause clients to become strongly associated to a specific server within > the load-balanced farm, which reduces the effectiveness of round-robin load > balancing. If this behavior is undesirable, HTTP Keep-Alive can be disabled > on the server using the KeepAliveEnabled property with a CustomBinding or > user-defined Binding.
