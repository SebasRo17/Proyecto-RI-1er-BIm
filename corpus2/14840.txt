I'm having some problems with the _Mathematica_ graphics inspector. I want to make a graph with the following code:               GraphPlot[{{1, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 1, 1}},         DirectedEdges -> True, MultiedgeStyle -> True, SelfLoopStyle -> True]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Vcgft.png) Which results in a good looking graph. But when I use Graphics Inspector to alter the weight of the edges, it gives me an error and _Mathematica_ closes. Does anyone else have ever experienced this? Or do you have another solution for me to achieve my graph with weighted edges? I'm using _Mathematica_ version 7.
