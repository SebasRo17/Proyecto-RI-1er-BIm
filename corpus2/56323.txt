Assume that there are three different points in x-y coordinate like:               p1={4, -1};     p2={5, -2};     p3={1, 5};      In order to compare these points to each other in a specific criteria, I have first built `List1` which includes the whole possible states:               List1={{{4, -1}, {5, -2}}, {{4, -1}, {1, 5}}, {{1, 5}, {5, -2}}};      The criteria is: > If any of these two points has an x value bigger than the x value of the > other point and a y value smaller than the y value of the other point, add > this point to a different list. Otherwise move on to the next pair of > points. Give a number which shows how many times point1 from List1 satisfies > the criteria. In order to clarify the problem : > first element of `List1` includes two points : `{{4, -1}, {5, -2}}` `point1 > = {4, -1}` and `point2 = {5, -2}`. x1 = 4 < x2 = 5 and y1 = -1 > y2 = -2. So > point `{5, -2}` dominates point `{4, -1}` : ( 5>4 and -2<-1 ) > > Now put point {5, -2} in a list and give a number which shows how many times > point {5, -2} satisfy the criteria. The final results have to be like bellow: > >     DominatePoint1 = {{5, -2},2} >     DominatePoint2 = {{4, -1},1} >     DominatePoint3 = {{1, 5},0} >   How can this be implemented in _Mathematica_?
