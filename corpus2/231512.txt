Still learning .net and OOP and have a basic question I hope. This is an asp.net mvc app. Looking at the code below, I am most concerned with the line in CheckShippingVendor that says ValidateDelivery(shipmentItem). Is it okay to pass in an object as a parameter and have the private static method update that item. When I did a resharper Extract Method refactoring this is what it did for me. Class is instantiated and call the CheckShippingVendor method:               var packageStatus = _inventoryService.CheckShippingVendor(shipmentId, shipmentFile);      Here is the rest of the code:               public PackageStatus CheckShippingVendor(string shipmentId, mvFile shipmentFile)     {             var packageStatus = new PackageStatus();             using (var shipmentItem = shipmentFile.Read(shipmentId))             {                     ValidateDelivery(shipmentItem);                     shipmentFile.Write(shipmentId, shipmentItem);             }             return packageStatus;     }          private static void ValidateDelivery(mvItem shipmentItem)     {             int shipped;             var shippedResult = Int32.TryParse(shipmentItem[1].ToString(), out shipped);             if (!shippedResult)                 return;                  int delivered;             var deliveredResult = Int32.TryParse(shipmentItem[57].ToString(), out delivered);             if (!deliveredResult)                 return;                  shipmentItem.Message = "NO INFORMATION AT THIS TIME";     }
