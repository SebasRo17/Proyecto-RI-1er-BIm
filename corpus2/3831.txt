Consider the following graph (source): ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/hhPr9.png) Is there any way to extract the data points from this image in a semi- automatic way? I have seen, and tried the methods suggested in this question, but they did not work, as most of the approaches there utilize color contrast to extract the data; I couldn't get `barChartDigitizer` to work, either.
