Our functional / business documentation is spread across Word files on our corporate Intranet. It's difficult to find and update information. There has to be a better way. Any ideas? We had thought a Wiki would work great. Would seem to be an easy way to find information and easy for individual developers and analysts to add bits of documentation quickly and easily. We'd be curious to know if other development (or business analysis) teams use Wiki's with success. The target for this documentation is the internal development team: developers, qa, and to a lesser extent business analysts.
