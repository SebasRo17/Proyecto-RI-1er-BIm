I have recently installed Mathematica 9 on my macbook pro, os version 10.6.8. As you can see in the minimal example notebook you can download here: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1163801/crashing_notebook.nb when I simply run a sequence of inputs everything is fine, bit as soon as I put exactly the same inputs into a function of two variables and call this function with the same parameters used before the UI crashes. This doesn't happen for all functions, but for this one it does. Any ideas? Any help would be very much appreciated. PS: Don't ask why I define a constant to be a function of S, this will be used as a function of S later.
