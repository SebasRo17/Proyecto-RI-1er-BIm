I haven't worked with Pascal so far, and my problem is understanding the recursive aspects that prm assignment operators and how the final (correct) value is derived. Would someone please explain that line for me.               Program test(output);          FUNCTION prm(az:integer) : real;     begin         if az = 1 then             prm := sqrt(12)         else             prm := sqrt(12*prm(az-1));     end;          begin         writeln(prm(30):0:2);     end.
