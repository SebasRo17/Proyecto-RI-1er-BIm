How should I go about making a switch from doing help desk type work to embedded software development or any type of development that is done at a lower level? I will finally finish my degree in December and really want to get started building systems. My degree is an Applied Computer Science degree. I have taken classes in Assembly, C++, VB.NET, and Java but have not been able to use any of these to a great extent in any of my jobs. If anyone has advice on how to go about getting into the embedded development field that would be great.
