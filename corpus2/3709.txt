The product page for _Mathematica Home Edition_ says: > Mathematica Home Edition is intended for hobbyists and enthusiasts alike, > for non-professional use. If you wish to integrate Mathematica in your work, > teaching, or research, other licensing options are available. but I cannot find there nor here any technical description of the differences. Are those two different products? Or is it the same software sold under two names corresponding to two different licensing restrictions?
