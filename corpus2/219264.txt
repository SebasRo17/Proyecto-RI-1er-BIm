I need to compare two curves f(x) and g(x). They are in the same x range (say -30 to 30). f(x) may have some sharp peaks or smooth peaks and valleys. g(x) may have the same peaks and valleys. If so I want a measure on how well these features coincide without visual inspection. I have tried to solve this problem in the following way.   1. Normalize both functions by dividing each data point by the total area of the function. Now the area of the normalized function is 1.0   2. At each x get the minimum value out of f(x) and g(x). This will give me a new function that is basically the overlapping area between f(x) and g(x).   3. When I integrate the resulting function of step 2 I get the total overlapping area out of 1.0 However this does not tell me whether the peaks and valleys coincide or not. I am not sure if this can be done but if someone knows a method I would appreciate your help. ==EDIT== For clarification I have included an image. ![Sample curves](http://i.stack.imgur.com/JafS4.jpg) The difference between the two curves (black and blue) may not be the same but will have complementing shapes. Background: The functions are projected density of states (PDOS) of atomic orbitals of a compound. So I have states for s,p,d orbitals. I want to determine whether the material has s-p, p-d or d-d hybridizations (orbital mixing). The only data I have is the PDOS. If say the PDOS of s orbital (function f(x)) has the peaks and valleys as at the same energies (x values) of the PDOS of p orbital (function g(x)) then there is s-p mixing in that material.
