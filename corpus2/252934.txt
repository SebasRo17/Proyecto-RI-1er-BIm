In the project I am working, we are using Freebsd and we are creating our software packages for it. Now we are planning to change distribution to Centos and rpm for packet manager. Since our codes are not platform independent, we have to make many change on it. Also we will continue to use freebsd until migration is completed. What is the best git usage way for this type of migration. Should we use a new branch or a new repository?
