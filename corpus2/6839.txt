I recently introduced my WildCats package in the Meta Thread What third-party packages do you use? and @Szabolcs promptly observed that:   "I noticed that there are many cell groups in the documentation that are collapsed. The documentation browser doesn't display cell brackets so it's a little difficult to expand them (I used the Ctrl-' shortcut)." Indeed I like to close all section groups in the tutorial pages so - upon opening the doc window - the user can immediately see the summarized full contents of the (often long) tutorial. This is much better than having to scroll through a long doc page in search of the relevant piece of information. But then the question is: how do we open these closed section groups, given that documentation pages do not display (section) cell brackets? One solution, although not very user-friendly, was already suggested by Szabolcs: use the Ctrl-' shortcut. But there are better ones! and since they do not seem to be very well-known, I thought of posting this question and my suggested solution
