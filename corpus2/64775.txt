I am writing my first research paper on distributed storage systems. We also have a prototype working (partially). The project was a complete implementation based project where we envisage to take this project a step further and do some future development. So, my questions are:   1\. How should I go about creating the "skeleton" or the outline of the paper? Any pointers.   2\. I understand, benchmarks and some working stats of the systems is important, but what is the breakup? How much content should be dedicated to theoretical algorithms (which we implemented, did not create new ones) and the benchmark data.   3\. What format (IEEE, ACM etc) should I select and why? PS: The project does not really concentrates on creating something new and unique, but it's aim to create an app which can be used by students and researchers to help understand the field of study better. Performance is not an objective for us, since there are alot of open source implementation (production quality) of the same domain. Think of Kaffe for JVM, that's what we are building for distributed storage systems.
