I want to get a Hough transform of some edged image. When I compare the same transformation on the same image I got different results.               i = 0; While[i < 10, i++; Print[Radon[imgEdged, Method -> "Hough"] ==                     Radon[imgEdged, Method -> "Hough"]]]     True     True     True     False     True     True     False     False     False     True      Why isn't repeatability provided in result of this function? Update: imgEdged = ![edged image](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nnzdN.jpg)
