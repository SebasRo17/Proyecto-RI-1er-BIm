I am having problems persuading _Mathematica_ to solve even the simplest recurrence relations. As an example, how would you do the following?               RSolve[{q[i] == 1 + (i - 1)*q[i - 1], q[0] == 0}, q[i], {i}]      ~~**Addendum.** As a further frustration, isn't this exactly equivalent? _Mathematica_ can't solve it it seems. > RSolve[{q[i, k] == 1 + ((i - 1))*q[i - 1, k - 1], q[1, 1] == 1},   >  q[i, k], {i, k}] ~~
