Is there any way to expand this expression               a+b(1-Exp[-T/(b c)]/(z-Exp[-T/ (b c)])      (where `a`, `b`, `c`, and `T` are constants) as a series in _negative_ powers of $z$? The result should be in the form               a0 + a1 z^(-1) + a2 z^(-2) + a3 z^(-3) + ... + an z^(-n)      I tried solutions like `Series[a + b (1 - k/(z - k)), {z, 0, -5}]` but this did not work. Thank you.
