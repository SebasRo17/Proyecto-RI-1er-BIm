> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Good interview programming projects We are looking to hire some more Java developers onto our team, and plan to test their coding abilities with a test. We currently use a web-based Java test that automatically compiles and runs the code, but it is very flaky and we're having problems with our candidates losing their work on this site. Not only is this frustrating for everyone, it makes us look like we don't know what we're doing. Is there a popular testing suite out there? What do you use? I'm **not** interested in dogmatic arguments on whether or not I should be testing my candidates in this way, I'm looking for a tool that will help me do it.
