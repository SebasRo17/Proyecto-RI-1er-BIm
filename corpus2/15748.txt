I'd like to run the R version installed in my Windows 7 system from within Mathematica 9 but when I execute the following command:               InstallR["RHomeLocation" -> "C:\\Program Files\\R\\R-2.14.2\\bin\\x64"]      I get the following error message: > InstallR::fail: Failed to install R. The following error was encountered: > Unable to load dynamic libraries Does anybody know how to fix this issue? Many thanks in advance
