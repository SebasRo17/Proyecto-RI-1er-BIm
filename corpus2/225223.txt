It seems commonsense nowadays that polling is a bad practice and pushing is the way to go when developing mobile applications that require to constantly receive data from a remote server. All major mobile shops provide their version of a push notification service:   * Apple Push Notification Service   * Google Cloud Messaging for Android   * Microsoft Push Notification Service However I'm wondering to what extend this assumption is valid. I mean, if I have an application that polls a remote server only a couple of times a day, and to which "notifications" don't need to be delivered instantly (a large delay is acceptable), then would it be a good decision to poll for data instead of pushing it? Thanks in advance!
