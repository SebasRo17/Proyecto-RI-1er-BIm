So First of all, I did Graduate from a University with a B.S. in Computer Science, and while I feel I got a multitude of programming experience.....I really missed out on the SUPER low level stuff. I know C pretty well as well as C++, but I basically know no assembly. I don't really know what things like Stack traces are......and for that matter I don't really understand the Stack, Stack Overflow or Buffer overflow or anything like that. Basically anything on the low end spectrum (which I really need to learn). Also I find Hacking/Cracking interesting (from an Educational point) that utilize these low level things (Like Stack Overflow). Where would I learn about things like this? What would be a good way to start?
