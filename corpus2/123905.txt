I'm a software engineer - this means that I type all day. I was doing some woodworking with a friend and he remarked off hand to be careful, an accident that cut off a finger or more might be catastrophic for my career. I am sure there are workarounds, but they are probably not as convenient. Is there any way to buy insurance against injury to your hands or wrists? If there is, how much does it cost? Would you recommend it?
