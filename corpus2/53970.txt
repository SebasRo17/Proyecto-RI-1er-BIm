> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Is there a canonical source for learning C# and .NET internals? So I've been programming in C# for 3 years now (been programming in various languages for 3 years before that as well) and most of the stuff I learned I pieced together on the internet. The thing is, I want to understand C# more formally and in depth and so would like to get some books on the subjects. Any books you'd recommend? Also, I've heard good things about "C# 4.0 in a Nutshell", "Pro C# 2010 and the .NET 4 Platform" and "CLR via C#". What do you think of these? (The people at stackoverflow told me to take it here. Please, Please tell me I'm in the right place this time)
