The first I am trying to export animations from _Mathematica_ to a file and then to LaTeX. Don't assume I know anything about what I'm doing. The following definitions defines the still image of a single frame. It is a stick of length $k$ that has two pivot points: one sliding along $x$-axis, $\{\cos u,0\}$, and the other, along the $y$-axis. $\{0,\sin u\}$, so the distance between the two pivots is always equal to $1$ irrespective of the value of the parameter $u$. One end of the stick is at the $y$-axis pivot, and the other is determined by the length of the stick. That other endpoint draws an ellipse, as $u$ increases from $0$ to $2\pi$.               tikku[u_, k_] :=       Show[{ParametricPlot[{k Cos[x], (1 - k) Sin[x]}, {x, 0, u}],         Graphics[{Line[{{k Cos[u] + 0.05 Sin[u], (1 - k) Sin[u] +               0.05 Cos[u]}, {0.05 Sin[u],              Sin[u] + 0.05 Cos[u]}, {-0.05 Sin[u],              Sin[u] - 0.05 Cos[u]}, {k Cos[u] -               0.05 Sin[u], (1 - k) Sin[u] - 0.05 Cos[u]}, {k Cos[u] +               0.05 Sin[u], (1 - k) Sin[u] + 0.05 Cos[u]}}]}],         Graphics[{PointSize[0.02], {Point[{Cos[u], 0}],            Point[{0, Sin[u]}]}}]}, PlotRange -> {{-2.2, 2.2}, {-1.2, 1.2}},        AspectRatio -> Automatic, AxesOrigin -> {0, 0}, Axes -> True]      Then I create an animation with               movie = Animate[tikku[u, 1.8], {u, 0, 2 Pi}, Alignment -> Center]      That is displayed as expected. But when I export that file with the command               Export["Analyysi I/2013/ellipsi.swf", movie]      and open the resulting `.swf` file with _Adobe Reader_ I get the following error message (my translation from Finnish): `"Adobe Reader couldn't open the file "ellipsi.swf", because it is of an unsupported type...."` I can open the `.swf`-file in IE. If I export the animation as an .avi-file instead, then I can also view it in _Windows Media Player_. However, something seems to have gone wrong while exporting, because at the beginning (and also at the end) a frame with _Mathematica_ code is shown instead of the first frame of the animation. Questions:   1. What should I do to make it viewable in _Adobe Reader_? (I just installed flashplayer, but that didn't help) This is kinda crucial for including the animation to a slide set produced by _LaTeX_.   2. What should I do to get rid of that extraneous first frame?
