Let's say I have a build. I need to know if a particular changelist/commit is present in that build. How would I solve this problem? I can think of a couple of possible approaches: 1) Add the changelist number into the binary so that I can look somewhere in the GUI and know what the changelist number is. I can then use this information to determine if the change I'm interested in is within that build. 2) Tag version control using some string that uniquely identifies that build. What unique string would I use? Is either of these two better? Are there any other better approaches? The solution would have to work for both Mac and Windows builds.
