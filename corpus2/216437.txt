I'm creating a question to see if my understanding of MVC separation is correct, I haven't been able to find a clear answer anywhere online. So is this the right way to implement it (in Java): I would have 3 .java files, one each for Model, Controller, View. I would put all the classes related to Model in the Model.java like so:               //Model.java {         public class Model              //class fields              public Model();              public ModelClassA();              public ModelClassB();              public ModelClassC();         }      With the ModelClasses being any class that I consider belonging to the Model. Is it correct to have the classes within the Model Class, as I have read that nested classes should be avoided where possible.
