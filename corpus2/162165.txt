So in a GUI program I have multiple events that trigger a update of a workspace. This update call is costly so I would want it to not happen very often. A user might pick something from a dropdown ( triggers a refresh ) and then put a check in a checkbox (also triggers a refresh ). If he does this in a short time interval this might result in the first refresh to be irrelevant. One way to handle this would be to have a refresh button for the user to press, or a toggle to set whether to automatically refresh. But I wouldn't want to put this in the hands of the user. Is there any other strategy to do this that is proven to be effective and error free? PS. I'm specifically using .Net 4.0 -> C# -> WPF -> Caliburn.Micro but would like to hear of any method that could be reproduced using .net 4
