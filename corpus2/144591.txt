In reference to broken windows, are there times when refactoring is best left for a future activity? For example, if a project to add some new features to an existing internal system is assigned to a team that has not worked with the system until now, and is given a short timeline in which to work with - can it be ever be justifiable to defer major refactorings to existing code for the sake of making the deadline in this scenario?
