According to the documentation, Dynamic Details & Options section, especially: > For interactive mouse operations `Dynamic[expr,{f_start, f, f_end}]` > **typically** evaluates `f_start[val,expr]` once when the mouse is pressed, > then evaluates `f[val,expr]` whenever the mouse is moved, and then evaluates > `f_end[val,expr]` once when the mouse is released. I find the following behaviour a possible bug:               x = {.5, .5};     Graphics[{ Circle[],                Locator[Dynamic[x, {Print[#] &, Automatic, None}]]             }]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/RKkrn.png) As you see `f_start = Print[#]&` is evaluated twice each time. Is this a bug? I've marked **Bold** the word **typically** in the quotation from documentation. Is this reffering to this case? * * * Here's the link to the question where Anon and I have faced this issue for the first time: Moving a locator based on the movement of another
