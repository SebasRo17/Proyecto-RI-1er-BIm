First of all, I'd like to say this is a hardware-level question, which is very closely related to the "in" and "out" command in x86 assembly. I have searched for quite some time, but I still haven't found how they send the addresses and the data. Does the 8086 first send the address, then the data? If so, how does the receiver know if the 8086 is sending a 16-bit address or an 8-bit address? Aside from that, I'd also like to learn how the 8255 works, and how it accepts specific ports such as "port 60H". Thanks for reading! :D
