I am looking for a way for SQL Server Management studio to show me the last SQL query that was run. For example, when I make modifications to a table in the designer mode, I will eventually want to make the same changes to the production DB without recreating the entire table. I'm looking for functionality similar to PHPMyAdmin for MySQL which tells you the last query ran and the results of the query at the top of the page after the modifications are complete.
