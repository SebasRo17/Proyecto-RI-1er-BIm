I've been practicing typing over the past little while, and I'm wondering if there's any tricks to getting further. I started out at ~40 wpm back when I was typing with 6 fingers. It took a little while to learn to use 10 (about a week or so where I was at the ~20 wpm range), but I improved quickly, and I'm now typing at ~65 wpm. That's pretty good, but I seem to have hit a wall there (going from ~40 to ~20 and back up to ~65 took about 3 months of on-and-off practice, but this was 5 months ago and I haven't improved at all since then in terms of accuracy or speed). So far I've been using Klavaro exclusively. Is there anything special you have to practice in order to get into the 80-90wpm range, are there any specific tools I'd need, or does it just take longer to improve at that level? (I'm using a qwerty keyboard, and I don't want to switch to dvorak, but I think I should still be able to crack 80wpm, at least).
