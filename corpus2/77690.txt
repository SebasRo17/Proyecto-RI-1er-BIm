For example, is it better to do:               Pdf pdf = new Pdf();     pdf.Print();      or:               Pdf pdf = new Pdf();     PdfPrinter printer = new PdfPrinter();     printer.Print(pdf);      Another example:               Country m = new Country("Mexico");     double ratio = m.GetDebtToGDPRatio();      or:               Country m = new Country("Mexico");     Country us = new Country("US");     DebtStatistics ds = new DebtStatistics();     double usRatio = ds.GetDebtToGDPRatio(us);     double mRatio = ds.GetDebtToGDPRatio(m);          My concern in the last example is there are potentially endless statistics (but let's say even just 10) you might want to know about a country; do they all belong on the country object? e.g.               Country m = new Country("Mexico");     double ratio = m.GetGDPToMedianIncomeRatio();      These are simple ratios but lets assume the statistics are complicated enough to warrant a method. Where is that line between operations that are intrinsic to an object vs operations that can be performed on an object but are not part of it?
