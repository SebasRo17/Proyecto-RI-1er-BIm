Consider this `Dynamic` list               Slider[Dynamic@i, {Range[2, 10]}]     MapThread[DirectedEdge, Gather[##] & /@ (Range[#] & /@ Dynamic@i)]      The error is > List expected at position 2 in `MapThread[...]` . Although the output given by the function is correct:               MapThread[DirectedEdge, {{1}, {2}}]     (* {1 -> 2} *)      **Edit:** The purpose of the list creating above is to create a list being exploited by `Graph`:               DynamicModule[{p = {{0, 0}, {2, 2}}, i = 2},          Grid[{         {Dynamic[DirectedEdge @@ Range@i],          Dynamic@N@Round[MousePosition["Graphics"], 0.5]},         {(Dynamic@Thread[{{DirectedEdge @@ Range@i}, {p}}]),           EventHandler[Dynamic@Graph[{DirectedEdge @@ Range@i},             VertexCoordinates -> p, PlotRange -> 5, GridLines -> Automatic,             Frame -> True,              FrameTicks -> All], "MouseDown" :>         {(AppendTo[p, N@Round[MousePosition["Graphics"], 0.5]];),++i}]}           }, Frame -> All]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/AUK8F.png) With at the top the construction of the `DirectedEdge` and the location of the mouse, at the bottom my attempt to see what should the list look like in order to be replaced in               Graph[{#1},VertexCoordinates -> #2]      Once again I assume that it's a `Dynamic` issue.
