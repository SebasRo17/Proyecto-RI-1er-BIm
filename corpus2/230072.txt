Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller. It was designed to challenge and amuse programmers, and was not made to be suitable for practical use. But still, it exists and some really cool stuff is written with it. My question is - will learning/practicing Brainfuck increase the depth of my knowledge of programming? For example: as a high-level programmer (using high- level languages) will it improve understanding of low-level methods and operations? Or is it really just a joke used to spend some time and amuse by showing code that really looks like "code" in a sense that's it's hard to read/understand.
