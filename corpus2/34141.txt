Can we display 10 bits per rgb in Mathematica? I'm using a quadro card and 30 bit monitor and can get a smooth gradient using Psychtoolbox in matlab. The following Mathematica should produce a bar with 8 shades of gray with 10 bits per color but I only see two, implying 8bits per color. (Stretch the bar across the full width of the screen and you'll see 8 steps if it is using 10 bits per color and 2 steps if it is only using 8).               n = 1024;     start = 512;     end = 519;     Graphics[Table[{GrayLevel[g], Rectangle[{g, 0}, {g + 1/n, .001}]}, {g,         start 1/1024, end 1/1024, 1/n}]]      I'm interested as I have 16 bit greyscale image data and the staircase effect at low bit depth reduces the ability to interpret the images efficiently without adjusting the window of 256 greys over which the 65535 greys present can be viewed. 1024 greys would be a useful improvement. This has been possible in medical imaging for several years but very expensive (tens of thousands of dollars, i.e. Dome 10MP). Now relatively "cheap" setups (like a \$1k quadro card and \$1k dell u3011 display) are able to do similar so it would be great to be able to achieve the same in Mathematica. I think it is to do with enabling opengl but thats as far as I've got.
