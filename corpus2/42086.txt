I am currently doing particle detection on some images and I wanted to do an Image Background Subtraction similar to what is available on ImageJ so as to even out the background tone. ImageJ uses a Rolling Ball algorithm which I believe is a type of Top-hat transform using a ball as a structuring element. I currently have to do the background subtraction in ImageJ and then import the file to Mathematica to do the rest of the particle detection. Could anyone help me write a rolling ball background subtraction algorithm in Mathematica, or does anyone know another way that I can flatten out/even out the background tone of my image? This is my first question, and I'm not well versed in image processing, so I'd be happy to provide any other information that might be useful if I can. Thanks!
