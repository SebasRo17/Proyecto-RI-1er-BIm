I have been working with Java/web applications in an IT department of a retail company. As much as work goes, there is nothing much to say. Fixing couple of if/else loops, writing some simple business logic etc., is all what I have been doing. Having said that, I feel I have a good technical knowledge, and I am willing to move to companies like Microsoft/Google/Amazon etc., [I want to work in these places, because I feel I am a technical guy, and I am working in a place where most people freak out when the words like 'algorithm' are heard] I can of course prepare algorithms/computer science fundamentals etc.,(I hold a 4 year degree in computer science program) but beyond that, will my experience hold against me ? I doubt I'll even get a call from them seeing my work experience. What kind of questions(apart from the algorithm types) can I expect ?
