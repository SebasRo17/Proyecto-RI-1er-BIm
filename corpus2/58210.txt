To create a table and an interpolation function of 3D data T=f(X,Y) I have the answer here: interpolation of 3D data How to create a table/interpolation function of 4D data T=f(X,Y,R)? If I do               dada = Flatten[Table[{x, r, t, func[x, r, t]}, {x, 0, 1}, {r, 0, 0.12}, {t, 0,       1}], 1];     intfunc=Interpolation[data];      doesn't work. func[x,r,t] is a valid function for this domain. I think it has to do with Flatten.
