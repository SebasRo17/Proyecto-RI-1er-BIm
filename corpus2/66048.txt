I'm currently working on a couple projects in Flash ActionScript, and I've been building up a small library of classes. I've been using a naming convention similar to: `foo.events.Bar` and `foo.controls.Baz`, but I've noticed that many people have released their libraries in the `com` and `org` package/namespace (i.e. `com.foo.events.Bar` and `com.foo.controls.Baz`). I assume the meaning of `com` is `common` or `community`, and that `org` is `organization`. Is there a particular reason to adding an _additional_ namespace? Is this common for namespaced languages (Java, C#, AS3,...)?
