I'm interested in the arguments of `f` in expressions like               f[a]@f[b]@f[c]      By argument I mean what is here `a`, `b` and `c`. I would like to know the arguments and in what order they appear. For example, the order of the arguments in                f[d]@(2 x f[b])@f[c]@f[q]      is                {d, b, c, q}      How can I find this from the above expression? I tried to use `Level[]`, but the Subvalue construction is hindering me.
