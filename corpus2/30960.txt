I would like to (numerically) solve a forward-backward looking recurrence equation in _Mathematica_. The system is something like:               x[n+1] = x[n] + y[n]          y[n]   = 2* y[n+1]      subject to               x[0]=1,y[N]=1      The problem is that the boundary of `x` at the beginning (`n=0`) where the boundary of `y` is at the end (`n=N`) (hence forward-backward looking). The _Mathematica_ command `RecurrenceTable` does not handle this. I would need to obtain a result for an arbitrary level of `n`. Numerical results are fine. What would be the most efficient method to tackle this problem?
