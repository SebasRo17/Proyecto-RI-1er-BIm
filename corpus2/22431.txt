Simple example:               k = 5;     list = {};     For[i = 1, i <= k - 2,      AppendTo[list, 1/(1 + Cos[i Pi/k])];      i = i + 2];     Print[list];          {1/(1+1/4 (1+Sqrt[5])),1/(1+1/4 (1-Sqrt[5]))}      I want the expression to be kept and printed as:               {1/(1 + Cos[Pi/5]), 1/(1 + Cos[3 Pi/5])}      I have tried `Hold` and its several versions, but nothing seems to do the trick.
