I would like to find the absolute value and the argument of the expression: $ x + \sqrt { x^2 + y^2 } $ under the assumption that the absolute values of $ x $ and $ y $ are equal. I have written:               Simplify[ComplexExpand[Abs[x + (x^2 + y^2)^(1/2)], {x, y}, TargetFunctions -> {Abs, Arg}],        Assumptions -> Abs[x] == Abs[y]] // FullSimplify      Why does _Mathematica_ return the un-evaluated expression? I would like to have a solution that will also find a simplified version of my expression when `Arg` is substituted for `Abs`.
