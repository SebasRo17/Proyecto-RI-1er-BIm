I want to set work for my 17 year old calculus students and have access to Mathematica 7. I aim to create a worksheet with rational expressions which they will then decompose into partial fractions. The structure I want to use will rely on some partial fractions appearing on more than one question (i.e. some overlap) So I want to speed the process of adding rational fractions...               1/(2x+7)- 3/(2x-7)      which I was hoping I could resolve in Mathematica into `(-26 - 7 x)/(14 + 11 x + 2 x^2)` without brackets in numerator or denominator. But alas I have work to do in every case, albeit fairly trivial. Instead, using `Together[ ... ]` it yields `(-26 - 7 x)/((2 + x) (7 + 2 x))` `ExpandAll[%]` just splits it up again, though it (horribly) multiplies the brackets in the denominators into `14 + 11 x + 2 x^2`. Surely I can add two or more rational expressions into a fully expanded rational expression in decreasing powers of `x`?
