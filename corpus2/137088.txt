I heard that math can be very important in programming. I am a confident python programmer, and have started C++. So far I have not encountered anything where I need to use any real math.   I have had to use logic and a bit of problem solving, but that's about it. I also wanted to know: does a particular part of coding (software engineering or game development) use maths more?
