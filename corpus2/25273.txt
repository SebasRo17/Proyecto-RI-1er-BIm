I use `Nearest` repeatedly for large data sets. For example               pts = RandomReal[{-1, 1}, {1000, 3}];       Nearest[pts, {0, 0, 0}]      I am interested in the index of the nearest point, so I use               ind = First@Nearest[pts -> Automatic, {0, 0, 0}]      How do I create a `NearestFunction` that can return an index. Returning a point is easy               nf = Nearest[pts];       nf[{0, 0, 0}]      but there is seemingly no option to return the index?
