So I have this command ran to set up the exercise:               require('ggplot2')          load(url('http://www.stolaf.edu/people/olaf/cs125/hw8.RData'))       And it gives a new operator `draw()`, so when I run `draw(p0x,p0y)`, it gives me a sketch as a graph. My question is when I run `draw(p2x,p2y)`, it gives me 4 same sketches as a graph, only that the one on the upper right corner is shifted to the left. My job is to move that part of the drawing to the right, so that the four sketches are symmetrically placed. But the problem is I don't quite understand `p0x,p0y,p2x,p2y` and I don't know how to do it. I was told a single line can solve the problem.
