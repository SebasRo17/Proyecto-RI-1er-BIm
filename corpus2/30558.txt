How do I solve the following simple stochastic differential equation: $$ m x''[t] + \Gamma x'[t] + k x[t] = \sqrt[]{2 kb T/\Gamma)} \eta[t] $$ here $\eta[t]$ is brownian motion , i.e. Wiener process. The equation describes the stochastic motion of a particle in a harmonic potential. I am new to stochastic calculus and almost know nothing. From fiddling around with _Mathematica_ in the last two days I figured that in general the OrnsteinUhlenbeckProcess can be used to simulate $x[t]$. The values are (converting everything in MKS) $$ kb = 1.3806488 * 10 ^{-23}; (*Boltzmanns Constnat*) $$ $$ T = 350.; (*K*); $$ $$ r = 70.*10^{-9}; (*70 nm*); $$ $$ \rho = (2./1000)*100^3; (*Density Of the Particle = 2 gm/cc*) $$ $$ k = (50.*1000*2 \pi )^2 m; (* k = m \Omega^2. Resonant Frequency = 50KHz) $$ $$ m = 4./3 \pi r^3 \rho; (*mass Of The Particle*) $$ $$ \Gamma = 2 \pi 10^{-2}; $$ these are the values I am using.
