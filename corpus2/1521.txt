Please consider :               aboveBox[info_, colors_] :=       Graphics[{colors, EdgeForm[Thick], Rectangle[{0, 0}, {26, 3}],         Text[Style[info, 18, Bold, Black, TextAlignment -> Center],              {26, 3}/2]}, ImageSize -> 300]      ![aboveBox\[\] output](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Hsj0u.png) Now I would like to have a second bit of text aside, with a different style. I know I could use 2 `Text[]`s, but I then struggle with the alignment. Is there a way to have two bits of text with different Style within the same `Text[]` Example of desired output : ![aboveBox\[\] with text in different styles](http://i.stack.imgur.com/611aJ.png)
