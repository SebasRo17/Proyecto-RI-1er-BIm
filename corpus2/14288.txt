Given that there is a set of points, for example, `{{3,4,2},{5,2,-1}}`. How do I go about selecting the point that has the lowest absolute x, y or z-coordinate from the list? In this case, the point selected should be `{{5,2,-1}}` as 1 is the lowest absolute value among all the points. Would the command `Select[{{3,4,2}, {5,2,-1}}, ...]` be good enough to perform such operation? Specifically, my understanding is that `Select[{{3,4,2}, {5,2,-1}}, ...]` is useful for selecting each individual point that satisfies certain condition stated in the command, so the question is whether it would be possible to compare 2 different points to select the desired point under the `Select[...]` operation. Or would there be a better alternative to getting the desired point?
