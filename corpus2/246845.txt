I've used parts of source from an existing Java library project with what appears to be a 3-clause BSD license. I've made significant changes to the library which makes it possible to use it in a new platform, and also added several new features, and new example projects using the modified library. I want to know if any one of these is the correct way to write a license for the project (no change in type of license) Please read both versions and provide a comparative answer: EITHER:               **<New library name for another platform>**          **Copyright (c) 2014     new author name**          **All rights reserved.**          **This project incorporates code from the project titled     <original library name for different platform>      which has its source code repository at     <git repository link> with the following copyright holders:**          **Copyright (c) 200x-200y     original library author name 1     original library author name 2     original library author name 3**          **All rights reserved.**          Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without     modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are     met:              Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice,         this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.
