I did a lot of self-study coding, got some experience with Parallel Programming Models: Actors, Software Transactional Memory, Data Flow. When I am trying to apply these architectures to real life - into high load web application - any model doesn't support durability and persistence for data. Real life tasks requires to save data at the end. This means that still I have to use DB and trapping DB syncs, possible scalability bottle necks etc. Does anybody knows good example of architecture (src or text or diagram or blueprints) that uses _Akka_ Actors **or** Software Transaction Memory and implement persistence at the end? Any good example/idea for Transactional Memory, Actors, Dataflow, Tuple spaces in real life applications is welcome.
