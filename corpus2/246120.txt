In our working group we had a discussion on using git tags in our projects. Some people argumented pro tags and some argumented against using tags. The crux is that we are talking about Magento projects which aren't really using version numbers, hence the tags only consist of `20140624` date references. The pro side was that it is easier to revert to a tag than a normal commit hash and it is part of gitflow, the contra side was that it only creates overhead. What do you think on using git tags only for reverting history?
