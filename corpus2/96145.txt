I was just watching the Jon Skeet (with Tony the Pony) presentation from Dev- Days Although "write a string reverse function" is coding interview 101 - I'm not sure that it's actually possible to write a general string reverse function, certainly not one that works in all localisations and all string types. Apart from detecting if the input string is ascii, UTF8, UTF16 (fixed and variable length) etc.   There is the 'apply accent to next character' (U+0301) code that Jon highlighted. Then there are ligatures that may or may not be displayed, or encoded as double characters. Seems that "reverse a string" is actually one of the harder computer science tasks!
