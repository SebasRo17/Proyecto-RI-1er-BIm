Wikipedia lists 11 cache replacement algorithms. Assuming I know almost nothing about the application I'm going to develop, **what should I use as a "default" cache replacement algorithm?** If I recall correctly from my OS course, LRU is the best general cache replacement algorithm. But maybe I'm mistaken. Also, this is a bit of an academic question, since, generally, main memory is cheap and abundant and I don't really need to worry about cache size too much.
