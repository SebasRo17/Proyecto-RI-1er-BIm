I'm trying to export the following string               "sep = ,"      to a CSV-file, as to be able to define the separation symbol, but when using the following command,               Export["test.csv", Join[{"sep = ,"}, RandomInteger[{-5, 5}, {5, 3}]], "CSV"]      I get the quotes around the string in the first line:               "sep = ,"     -4,5,0     5,-4,-1     0,5,2     -1,2,4     -1,-4,-1      This obviously isn't recognised by Excel and it doesn't open correctly. I've tried changing the string to something like               Style["sep=,", ShowStringCharacters -> False]      and then export again, but then I just get this whole command into the CSV- file. Is there a method to export this string without the quotes attached to them into a CSV-file? Thanks for all help!
