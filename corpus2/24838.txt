I know that in Mathematica a functional programming style is often more efficient than procedural style programming using `For` loops. But the code shown below seems to be an exception, How to explain this?               del[ls_, k_] := Delete[ls, List /@ Range[k, Length@ls, k]]          max = 10^5;     r1 = Range[max];     For[i = 2, i <= Length[r1], i++, r1 = del[r1, i]]; // Timing          r2 = Range[max];     Do[r2 = del[r2, i], {i, 2, Length@r2}]; // Timing          r3 = Fold[del, Range[max], Range[2, max]]; // Timing          r1 == r2 == r3      Out:               {0.031200, Null}          {0.889206, Null}          {0.577204, Null}          True
