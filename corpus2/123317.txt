I am starting a project with following technical environment : .Net 4.0, Entity Framework 4.0, WPF with **MVVM Architecture** I saw lots of examples on the net, some books with this environment. In some of the examples authors had this Idea :   1. Viemodel will have an instance of Model class (Entity Framework Entity e.g. Person)   2. Bind the WPF view controls to the properties of Model While some authors did :   1. Viemodel will expose all the properties of the model.   2. Bind the WPF view controls to the properties of ViewModel rather than to the model directly. So is it a good idea to let the view bind property from model rather than viewmodel exposing it's own? Or which is more preferred?
