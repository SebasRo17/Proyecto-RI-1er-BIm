I'm getting pushback from operations for having a server process listen on a dynamically-assigned port number (i.e. it binds a socket to a port number of 0, triggering a dynamic assignment by the OS, which it retrieves using getsocketname()). The argument was that is "creates all kinds of issues for firewalling, routing, ACL, and security purposes". I haven't run across anything about this. This is CentOS, our applications are in-house and restricted to a set of machines on a LAN that's heavily firewalled from the outer world. Can someone knowledgeable weigh in on the subject? **UPDATE 1** : FTP dynamically assigns a port number, too, although I don't know if it's from the same range of numbers that I've seen elsewhere (32768-61000?). How do firewalls etc. deal with this?
