# Context: There is a list of lists `list` where lists are different length. Using one control I change a part of list to view, and with another one â€” what certain part of part to show at the end. Thought, `Length` could define here number of values in chosen part of `list`.               list = {{1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 3}}; (* for example *)     Manipulate[list[[j, k]], {j, 1, 2, 1}, {k, 1, Length[list[[j]]], 1}]      # Problem: When control of j- _th_ part switches to part of `list` with k- _values_ > then it was before, it leads to a mistake, though when switching in opposite direction slider disposes itself correctly: ![Mistake in an action](http://i.stack.imgur.com/y5Qdh.jpg) # Question: Do I desire that from `Length` in vain, and what is the solution of this problem? Assume, I can somehow set a value of k to 1, when j changes. How can I achieve this? Thanks. I apologize for that the title not corresponding to an issue fully. Had no idea how to name it.
