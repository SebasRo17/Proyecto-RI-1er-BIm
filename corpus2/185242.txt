There is a software we run as a windows service. Its currently not designed to take a huge load. So we kind of need this service to be hosted over http so that multiple clients can make use of it. Its not the whole windows service as such, but some modules it uses. Those modules are currenly not designed to work as "web service" (generic sense). What would be the formal word for this?
