I'm interested in learning Scala. I've been reading a lot about it, but a lot of people value it because it has an actor model which is better for concurrency, it handles xml in a much better way, solves the problem of first class functions. My question is do you need to know Java to understand/appreciate the way things work in Scala? Is it better to first take a stab at Java and then try Scala or you can start Scala with absolutely no java backround?
