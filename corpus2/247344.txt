We have two in-house projects, A and B, developed by different teams with B dependent on A. Since source code for both projects is stored in git, I've included project A as a submodule into project B and configured the build system to build both in right order. An alternative solution would be to consume A via a binary repository manager such as Artifactory or Nexus. I wonder about pros and cons of depending on source code vs depending on binary artifacts. When is one better than the other? So far I managed to come up with following factors, but I am really keen on hearing other opinions. Depending on source code is better   * if you don't have a binary repository manager   * if you need to depend on pre-release version of another project   * if you need to patch another project   * because it is easier to browse dependency source code in IDE Depending on binaries is better   * to minimize build time   * to avoid the hassle of setting up another project's build environment
