"The specified setting for the option FEFloatIterator cannot be used." This an error I am getting in a sizeable interface, containing 138 declarations in an outer `DynamicModule` with one inner `Manipulate`. * * * This undocumented error appeared as a pop-up on a red-boxed control (in this case, an iterator [but not a float iterator!]) where the setting for the control depended on an initialization section which timed out because of a non-terminating computation.
