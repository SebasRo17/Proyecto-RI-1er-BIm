I'm currently working at a quite big Android project (a social network, you can see it here if is useful to answer the question). We decided to restyle the whole app, changing all the UI design. The code I actually have is complex, there are many controllers, and it's a little messy too. Is it "better" in terms of time and code cleanliness to take one controller per time, and rewrite it entirely, or to _modify_ one controller per time? The layout change entirely anyway, so for that I know I've to restart from scratch. Maybe it could seem a stupid question, but with the "time" variable I really can't see the best way.
