I read something on this site saying that Qt's GUI being a big problem that stop programmers from using Qt. They say the problem is that the GUI don't look native, and they are inconsistent. I personally use Windows, and from what I can see (some tree view and table view), they look pretty good and very native-looking too. So I want to know what they are like on Mac, and what are the differences? and what differences there should be between ordinary Mac apps and ordinary Windows apps in terms of user experience?
