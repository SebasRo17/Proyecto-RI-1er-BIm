I am a completely new to Mathematica, so my question and code may look silly. I need to find a equation of motion of a point particle of mass m moving in a potential V(x) = A abs[x]^n. (n=1,2,3,4,5,6. m=1, A=1, x(0)=2, x'(0)=0 ) I tried to find the equation using Euler method, so I made code below. I know somethings wrong with my code, but I have no idea. How can I make one equation with various n values? Can someone help me?               T = 0.5*x'[t]^2;     V = Abs[x[t]];     L = T - V     -Abs[x[t]] + 0.5 Derivative[1][x][t]^2     EulerEquations[%, x[t], t]     -Derivative[1][Abs][x[t]] - 1. (x^\[Prime]\[Prime])[t] == 0     NDSolve[{x''[t] + Abs'[x[t]] == 0, x[0] == 2, x'[0] == 0}, x, {t, 0,10}]     NDSolve::ndnum: Encountered non-numerical value for a derivative at t == 0.`. >>      And, additionally I need to plot the period as a function of n. How can I construct the plot?
