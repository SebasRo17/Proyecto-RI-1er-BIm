I'm trying to plot the function $f(x)=\dfrac{1}{x^2}$, filling the square area from (0,0) to (1,1) with purple and filling the area under the curve from 1 to 4 with red. However, _Mathematica_ is not showing the purple filling, and the red part is not completely filled down to the x-axis. My current code:               Show[Plot[1/(x^2), {x, 0, 4}, PlotStyle -> Blue, AspectRatio -> 1],     Plot[{1/(x^2), 1}, {x, 0, 1}, PlotStyle -> Blue, Filling -> {1 -> {{2}, {Purple, None}}}],     Plot[1/(x^2), {x, 1, 4}, PlotStyle -> Blue, Filling -> Axis, FillingStyle -> Red]]      What _Mathematica_ gives me: ![](http://i.imgur.com/uj1bMHy.jpg?) What's wrong with my code? (I'm also very new to _Mathematica_ , so any suggestions on a more elegant way to fill the curve would be appreciated.)
