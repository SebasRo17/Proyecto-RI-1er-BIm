I am working on a software integrated with the hardware component. I need to create a simple diagram to express that:   1. Certain activity runs in a cycle (the device continously monitor a temperature)    2. When the temperature deviates from the baseline and remains so for 10 seconds, a function is called I am writing a high level document and I am not sure how to capture this - UML diagrams do not seem to be suitable..but maybe an activity diagram?
