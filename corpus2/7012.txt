I am trying to do:               EventHandler[Graphics[{ (*stuff*) }],{{"MouseDragged","p"}:>(*pan the graphics*),       {"KeyDown","z"}:>(*zoom in/out as the mouse moves up/down in the graphics*) }]      This would be similar to what we can do with Graphics3D, except when I "pan" the Graphics I want to change the `PlotRange` rather than move the Graphics around the window. BTW I will be using `"MouseDown"` for custom modification of the Graphics, and that's one of the reasons why I want pan/zoom associated with pressing keys.
