As an experienced web-developer, but a novice "low level" programmer, this stuff is sort of voodoo to me still. I'm curious about how one would even begin to go about finding a memory block, and then reading it (for example, reading the timer in a game of mines)? Is this different by OS / OS version? I've spent quite a bit of time Googling and unfortunately, other than some vague mentions of memory readers and `ReadProcessMemory` in Windows with C/C++, there's not a whole lot out there. Would be very happy if someone could shed some light on this subject so that I could get off on the right foot with respect to memory reading.
