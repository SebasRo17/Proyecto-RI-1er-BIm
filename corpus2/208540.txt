I'm designing the database schema for a new product feature. In my current design I have some related optional data. Rather than have nullable fields I have a separate table with a 0..1:1 relationship to the main table. I chose this design because the queries are simpler* if null data doesn't have to be taken into consideration. The team lead pointed out to me that it will complicate data binding in the UI and suggested that I just use nullable fields. I am wondering what complications the optional table approach will introduce? The obvious thing that comes to mind is the data aware controls can't bind to a closed data set so I'll need to either create a record on the fly when the user attempts to fill in the optional data or create the record at the same time as the main record, negating the purpose of have a separate table. Is there anything else I should be aware of? **Clarification** *Simpler, by which I refer to the dizzying amount of rules and ambiguities concerning null's behavior under different query scenarios in the SQL standard and the fact that no two vendors agree on which of these rules to implement.
