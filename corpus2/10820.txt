The curve is actually oscillating near zero!… but wait, try this:               Plot[1/x^2 + (3 + x)/(6 (1 - Exp[x] + x)), {x, 0, 0.001}, WorkingPrecision -> 30]      Now we see: ![A curve under high presision](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rRVc7.jpg) * * * So all of these turn out to be a story about precision once again (why I always encounter this! ). I also found some resource for this error:               Series[1/x^2 + (3 + x)/(6 (1 - Exp[x] + x)), {x, 0, 10}];     Normal[%] /. x -> 0.00001     (* => 0.0833332 *)          N[1/x^2 + (3 + x)/(6 (1 - Exp[x] + x)) /. x -> 10^-5, 6]     (* => 0.0833332 *)      But, can this problem be solved only with `ReplaceAll` and `Limit`? Also, we see that Mma doesn't give warnings for these great error (while this sort of thing frequently occurs when I use `NDSolve` though the error seems not that big…it's another story), any way to make Mma give a warning message or something?
