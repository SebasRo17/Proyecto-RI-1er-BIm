Why do books say, "the compiler allocates space for variables in memory". Isn't it the executable which does that? I mean, for example, if I write the following program,               #include <iostream>     using namespace std;          int main()     {        int foo;        return 0;     }      and compile it, and get an executable (let it be program.exe), now, if I run program.exe, this executable file will itself command to allocate some space for the variable foo. Won't it ? Please explain why books keep on saying, "the compiler will do this...do that".
