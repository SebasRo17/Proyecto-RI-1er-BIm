I'm coding something for my job to copy directories and then use regex to make all the filenames uniform. I'm an undergrad student programmer for my university and I'm not sure what a professional coder would consider reasonable in this case. My job is mostly to implement mathematical research. The current assignment is outside what I've been doing and seems like it would be really useful to have some of the functions available in case I (most likely) encounter a similar assignment at some point in my career in the future. It's going to be really useful because the current filenames are so screwed right now that the admin assistants can't really keep up (and even trying to do so might just cause more human error). I'm thinking that it may not overall be useful outside the current assignment because the regex will be so customised to the way the file are incorrectly named. I'm wondering if this is simple work for a pro coder, and therefore I'm making this program to be much more important in my head than it actually is, or if this is something that a coder would really want to copyright or otherwise retain the ability to use this whenever and wherever else they feel like. They've already told me that there is no question that I'll be given credit for the work, which I'm excited about. My only concern was whether I should be thinking about reusing this code later or if this task is so generic that a pro coder would laugh about keeping the rights to such code. This thread was interesting but seems different from my situation: How can I reuse generic code for consulting between companies? EDIT: Florida, USA
