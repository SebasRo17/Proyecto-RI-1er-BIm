It appears that _Mathematica_ treats all dates as proleptic Gregorian dates by default, a hypothesis that can be easily tested by using `AbsoluteTime` to compute the Julian Day:               jd[t_] := AbsoluteTime[t]/86400 + 2.4150205*^6      but, while this works for recent dates and for some older ones, it yields results that differ from the correct result for some older dates by exactly a day               jd[{2012, 11, 24, 12}] - 2456256     0     jd[{1100, 11, 24, 12, 0, 0}] - 2123154     0     jd[{-3000, 11, 24, 12, 0, 0}] - 625660     1      notably for the reference date, 12:00 Universal Time on January 1, 4713 BCE in the proleptic Julian calendar (-4713-11-24 in the proleptic Gregorian calendar):               jd[{-4713, 11, 24, 12, 0, 0}]     1      What calendar is _Mathematica_ using for these older dates, if not the proleptic Gregorian calendar? Here, perhaps is another clue:               DateList[{-4713, 11, 24, 12, 0, 0}]     {-4713, 11, 25, 12, 0, 0}     DateList[{-3000, 11, 24, 12, 0, 0}]     {-3000, 11, 25, 12, 0, 0}      I'm no calendar expert, but this "canonicalization" doesn't map to any calendar I'm familiar with. Is this a bug? * * * _Update_ : Version 9, behaves differently:               jd[{2012, 11, 24, 12}] - 2456256     0.     jd[{1100, 11, 24, 12, 0, 0}] - 2123154     0.     jd[{-3000, 11, 24, 12, 0, 0}] - 625660     365.          jd[{-4713, 11, 24, 12, 0, 0}]     366      and               DateList[{-4713, 11, 24, 12, 0, 0}]     {-4713, 11, 24, 12, 0, 0.}     DateList[{-3000, 11, 24, 12, 0, 0}]     {-3000, 11, 24, 12, 0, 0.}
