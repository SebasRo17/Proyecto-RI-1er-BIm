All of the projects that I've had to deal with so far have only required a single database on a single server. I'm interested in learning more about how projects that need to scale move to multiple databases and/or servers to help manage the load. I'm aware of High Scalability, but I'm particularly interested in some code examples or additional resources where I could read more on the subject. For instance:   * How are joins constructed between two tables on multiple databases? (A code example here would be helpful).   * Are there any special strategies for tracking which tables are in which database?   * Does the application code need to know that one or more databases are spread across multiple servers? If not, at what level are the requests filtered?   * When is it time to move beyond a 1 database/1 server setup? How common is it to need to do this?
