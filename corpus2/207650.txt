I'm working on my first ASP.NET project and I'm torn between using asp tags (`<asp:SomeElement`) everywhere or use some regular HTML for simple things that need no code behind, like fixed divs, static text, etc. I think it would be best to use ASP tags only for code behind and other dynamic stuff, whereas static elements can be in vanilla HTML, but that's assuming I won't ever need to turn them into ASP.NET in the future. Is there a best practice/recommended approach for this?
