I like the Node.JS style of JavaScript, where I can write all of my functionalities into smaller files and then require those neatly from within my code. I'm even thinking about trying to write a framework to mimic that behavior in client-side JS. My goal would be to implement the `module loading system` as accurately as possible - See Module docs. For `require()`, I can use things detailed in answers to this question, most notably JQuery's `$.getScript()`. It seems to me that other aspects of the module loading system should be possible as well. So I'm asking more experienced programmers here first, before I waist my time: **Is there something that I'm missing that's going to cause such an attempt to fail miserably, or can this be successfully done?**
