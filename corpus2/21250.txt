This is the CellCenter datapoints and associated Normals data: http://wikisend.com/download/458974/CellCenters-and-Normals.dat The dat file contains data points for x,y coordinates and x,y coordinates of four normal vectors associated with these coordinates. I don't know if I have done this right, so I am trying to plot up my datapoints and the four normals associated with each datapoint. I should be able to plot the datapoints and the four normals emerging from the datapoints ( with the tail of each normal ending at appropriate datapoint) I donÂ´t really know how to scale my vector plots so the arrows will fit to the meshgrid and cell center points.               CellDataNormals =      Import["C:\\Users...\\CellCenters-and-Normals.dat", "Table",      "IgnoreEmptyLines" -> True];          CellCenterx = CellDataNormals[[All, 1]];     CellCentery = CellDataNormals[[All, 2]];     CellCenter = Transpose[{CellCenterx, CellCentery}];          NormalEastx = CellDataNormals[[All, 3]];     NormalEasty = CellDataNormals[[All, 4]];     NormalEast = Transpose[{NormalEastx, NormalEasty}];           NormalNorthx = CellDataNormals[[All, 5]];     NormalNorthy = CellDataNormals[[All, 6]];     NormalNorth = Transpose[{NormalNorthx, NormalNorthy}];          NormalWestx = CellDataNormals[[All, 7]];     NormalWesty = CellDataNormals[[All, 8]];     NormalWest = Transpose[{NormalWestx, NormalWesty}];          NormalSouthx = CellDataNormals[[All, 9]];     NormalSouthy = CellDataNormals[[All, 10]];     NormalSouth = Transpose[{NormalSouthx, NormalSouthy}];           CenterPoints =      ListPlot[CellCenter, PlotRange -> {{-11, 11}, {-11, 11}}];          NEast = ListVectorPlot[Transpose[{CellCenter, NormalEast}]];          NNorth = ListVectorPlot[Transpose[{CellCenter, NormalNorth}]];          NWest = ListVectorPlot[Transpose[{CellCenter, NormalWest}]];          NSouth = ListVectorPlot[Transpose[{CellCenter, NormalSouth}]];          Show[CenterPoints, NEast, NNorth, NWest, NSouth]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jlT67.png) Is there a way I can scale all this and plot it on the same graph so that it looks prettier :) ? I don't really know how to scale the size of my datapoints and vector arrows.
