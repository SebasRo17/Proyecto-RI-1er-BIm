I am interested in obtaining the intermediate steps for rather straightforward symbolic definite integrations (e.g., from an elementary calculus text). As an example, for $\int_0^1 x\,dx$ I'd like output along the lines of $$ \int_0^1 x\,dx={x^2\over 2}\Bigg|_0^1={1\over 2} $$ I have reviewed the responses to this question dealing with WolframAlpha-like step-by-step output as well as this one and this one. The answer in the first link above is in the spirit of what I'm after (especially the last answer given by FDSg), but it focuses on _differentiation_. However, when I try this on even elementary definite integrals like $\int_0^1 x\,dx$ it simply returns the answer without the steps. Perhaps I am overlooking something. I do not intend to duplicate that question and this distinction is key to that. In short, I'd be happy if `ShowSteps` (applied to `Integrate[x,{x,0,1}]`) would simply show the output in the displayed equation above (the emphasis being that I don't need to see _how_ the indefinite integral is computed, just what it is, and then completing the evaluation between limits).
