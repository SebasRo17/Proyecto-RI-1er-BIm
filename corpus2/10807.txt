I'm not sure if it's just me or if this is common in our field. The past year has been a bit intense for me. I've been learning a few different technologies to get some tasks done and sometimes I've had to completely focus on that one new technology I'm learning. What I noticed though when I go back to using everything together in the full project is that I forgot how to do things that I already knew how to do before I started focusing on learning that other new technology. Sometimes I find that I forget even simple things like the syntax for selecting a div in jquery, that I have to go back to old files to get a quick peek. Sometimes I could be coding something that I recognize I did before in another project, but can't quite remember which project it was for, so I have to go through several projects and look through the code to try and remember where I did that. What ways have you invented to prevent yourself from forgetting things you've done before, or to easily access code you've written in the past?
