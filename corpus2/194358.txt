I want to build most of my functionality on the client. However I'm not quite sure which server-side web development framework can provide me with a nice REST endpoint to handle resources, business logic, etc. I come from a JAVA EE world, where JSF is mostly stateful and component based (both have their pros and cons, I'd just rather not keep a component tree, etc).. However... I used to build templates in Facelets, how can I do this now if I don't use JSF/Facelets as my presentation layer? Or how do I create HTML tables iterating over collections, etc? I'm open to using any language/framework. I see a lot of discussion yet not really any valuable input. Perhaps I have yet to look in the right places. There's a lot of people talking about JS + RESTful ws... Is this actually possible for a whole web site? I think that if I drop my component based web framework I'll have to implement so many things by myself, like conditionally rendered portions of the website, iterating over data to build grids, tables, handling multiple-page operations, view scoped data. Maybe someone could also tell me: are you out of your mind? Go hybrid or don't do that. Any directions will help.
