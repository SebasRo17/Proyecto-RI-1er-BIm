I am Localizing my php application. I have a dilemma on choosing best method to accomplish the same. Method 1: Currently am storing words to be localized in an array in a php file               <?php          $values = array (                             'welcome' => 'bienvenida'                     );           ?>      I am using a function to extract and return each word according to requirement Method 2: Should I use a txt file that stores string of the same?               <?php     $welcome = 'bienvenida';      ?>      My question is which is a better method, in terms of speed and effort to develop the same and why? Edit: I would like to know which method out of two is faster in responding and why would that be? also, any improvement on the above code would be appreciated!!
