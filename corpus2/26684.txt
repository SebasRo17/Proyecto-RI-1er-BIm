I'm plotting the equipotential of the potential function: $$\phi(x,y,z):=\frac{1+x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}{[\left(1+x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}\right)^{2}-4z^{2}]^{1/2}}$$ Mathematica code:               Φ[x_, y_, z_] := (1 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2)/((1 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^2 - 4 z^2)^(1/2)      So I write, for example               ContourPlot3D[Φ[x, y, z] == 1, {x, -100, 100}, {y, -100, 100}, {z, -100, 100}]      But, I get this image: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ElmCm.jpg) And, sometimes if I change the plot region, I get absolutely nothing. My **question** is, what did I wrong? I think I should obtain smooth 3D curves, but I don't.
