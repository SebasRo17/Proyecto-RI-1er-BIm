I am interested in building a custom Websocket server for college project. I have a good familiarity about HTTP 1.1 and knows quite well of how it works. I am asking this question assuming that Websocket clients (browsers) have their protocol specification since Websocket clients connects to Websocket server through URL begins with ws://. In addition, can Websocket server implemented without single threaded and event based environment feature of language? Thank you.
