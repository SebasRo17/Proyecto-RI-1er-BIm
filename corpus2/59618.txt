I've a Mathematica notebook for my class notes. When writing plain text in cells, I can dynamically bold and unbold with the ctrl+b shortcut. However, when in a mathematical expression, this shortcut only works when the selection to have its face changed is highlighted first (which slows workflow down). The same thing goes for italicizing and underlining. Is it possible to change face as you type in an expression? To illustrate, with plain text:   * ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CLpZy.png)   * ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0QSvU.png)   * ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GZYhx.png) In an expression, have to type, then highlight text, then press ctrl+b:   * ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KHZn7.png)   * ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/r79GK.png)   * ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3UPTZ.png)
