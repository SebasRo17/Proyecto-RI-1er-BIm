Through some webscraping, I have the following list:               dates={{"<h3>January 18, 2001</h3>"}, {"<h3>February 1, 2001</h3>"},     {"<h3>February 2, 2001</h3>"}, {"<h3>February 24, 2001</h3>"},     {"<h3>February 26, 2001</h3>"}, {"<h3>March 1, 2001</h3>"},     {"<h3>March 2, 2001</h3>"}, {"<h3>March 31, 2001</h3>"}, {"<h3>April     5, 2001</h3>"}, {"<h3>April 18, 2001</h3>"}, {"<h3>May 6, 2001</h3>"}};      I am trying to make this into a `DateList[]` list. I can make it human readable in the following fashion:               datelist = StringReplace[       ToString[dates], "<" ~~ Except[">"] .. ~~ ">" -> ""]      > {{January 18, 2001}, {February 1, 2001}, {February 2, 2001}, \ {February 24, > 2001}, {February 26, 2001}, {March 1, 2001}, {March 2, \ 2001}, {March 31, > 2001}, {April 5, 2001}, {April 18, 2001}, {May 6, \ 2001} This brings up a list of nice dates. The only problem is that they are now a string. The list operations that I have tried to use (Cases, Pick, etc.) all deal with the whole part of a list, rather than sub-sets of each part. Is there a quick way to convert what I have in dates to a Mathematica-readable `DateList[]`?
