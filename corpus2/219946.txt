I have a big collection of strings _a[1], â€¦, a[N]_ where _N_ is about several millions. I am provided a string _m_ and I need to iterate over all the strings _a[i]_ that contain _m_. In other words, I need to find all the strings _a[i]_ having _m_ as substring. What would be the most efficient data structure for that problem? I need to be very careful with memory as I am working with a big number of strings.
