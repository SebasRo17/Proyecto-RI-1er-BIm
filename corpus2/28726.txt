I was wondering if there is a way that I could change the value of a key press such as `Shift`, `Ctrl`, etc. Normally, when nothing is pressed, the `CurrentValue` will return `False`. My hope is that I might be able to change these values to `True` with some sort of controller. For example, it would be great if I could use a check box to tell _Mathematica_ that `Shift` was depressed when it was not, but I understand that this is unlikely as these values are protected and probably fairly low level to change. Intuitively, I would say it can't be done, but was just hoping that by some chance it would be possible.
