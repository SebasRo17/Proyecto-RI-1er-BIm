I have a problem with _Mathematica_ 's symbolic manipulations. As an example, consider the following expression: $$\sum _{i=1}^n -2 x_i \left(-a x_i-b+y_i\right)=0$$ How do I get _Mathematica_ to expand it into this form: $$-\sum _{i=1}^n x_i y_i +a \sum _{i=1}^n x_i^2+b \sum _{i=1}^n x_i=0$$ What I mean is: what functions do I apply to get the product to expand and the summation operator to distribute?
