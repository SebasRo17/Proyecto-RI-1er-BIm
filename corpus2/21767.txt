I want to solve an equation and substitute it into a Plot expression. My code looks something like this               a[b_, x_] := bx + 1;     sol = Solve[(1 + b)x + 1 == 0, b]      I want to use the solution of b and substitute it to get the value of a and then plot it. I expect the result to be -x and I expected to see a plot of `y = -x`.               Plot[a[b /. sol, x], {x, 1, 1000}]      However, I don't get anything. Can anyone please help?
