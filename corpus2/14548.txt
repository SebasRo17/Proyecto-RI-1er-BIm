Say I have matrix tmp1 of size 1000 x 5 (shown is just a small section for illustration purpose), consisting of real numbers![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/f8JFZ.png) and 0: How can I iteratively take every non-zero real number elements and use it as input for another 'For' loop argument limit to calculate another set of matrix values? For example, taking second row, first column value of 4.956 I would like to use it to calculate a 'For' loop like r=0.4; For[i = 0, i < **4.956** , i = i + 0.2, calculate P = Exp[-r i]*i P += P And place this cumulated P result into tmp2 output matrix at same corresponding location as where 4.956 was taken from. Then repeat for the next non-zero element of tmp1, so for row 2, column 2 value of 1.234: For[i = 0, i < **1.234** , i = i + 0.2, calculate P = Exp[-r i]*i P += P and result into tmp2 location row 2, column 2. Any zero elements found in tmp1 will simply be mapped to tmp2 of same location. Thanks.
