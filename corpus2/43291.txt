Consider               e1 = Hold[a = x + x; b = y + y + y];     e2 = Hold[c = a + a + b + b + b; c^2];      How can I obtain the following?               e12 = Hold[a = x + x; b = y + y + y; c = a + a + b + b + b; c^2]      For example,               e1 ~Join~ e2       does not work since it gives one "," sign in the middle. another attempt               With[{e1temp = e1, e2temp = e2}, Hold[e1temp; e2temp]]      gives nested `Hold` calls that at the end do not want to evaluate (and are hard to get rid off): > >     Hold[Hold[a = x + x; b = y + y + y]; Hold[c = a + a + b + b + b; c^2]]] >   I am amazed that such a simple thing is causing me so much pain. :) ### Edit My current solution.               merge[Hold[expr1_], Hold[expr2_]] := Hold[expr1; expr2]     merge[e1, e2]      > >     Hold[(a = x + x; b = y + y + y); (c = a + a + b + b + b; c^2)] >
