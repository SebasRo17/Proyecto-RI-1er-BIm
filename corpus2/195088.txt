Sometimes, I notice typos in articles (blog posts) or books in source code that appears in the body of the article. It may be an indication that the code has been manually copied and pasted (e.g. missing braces ), or that something nasty happened to the text. How may I write an article inside the source code of a project ? I'm targetting Wordpress; I'm basically looking for a parser that would recognize two kinds of region: article and source code, and that would format them to whatever I want (stackoverflow question, LaTeX code or Wordpress article)
