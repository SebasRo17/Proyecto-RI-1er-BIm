My problem is the following: Suppose I have a matrix A which looks the following:               A = {{1, 2, 0, 0, 0}, {2, 3, 0, 1, 0}, {3, 4, 1, 0, 0},          {5, 6, 0, 0, 1}, {6, 7, 0, 0, 0}}      What I want _Mathematica_ to do is to drop or delete an entire row if the sum of columns 3,4&5 of that specific row is equal to zero. E.g. `A[[1]]` should be dropped because the sum of the last three elements of this row is zero. Same for the last row of matrix `A`. I tried the following but it's not working, and I don't know whether it's my fault or whether _Mathematica_ got a problem with that specific case:               hallo2 = Do[       If[Transpose[hallo][[3]][[i]] + Transpose[hallo][[4]][[i]] +           Transpose[hallo][[5]][[i]] = 0, Drop[hallo[[n]]]], {i,         Length[Transpose[hallo][[1]]]}]      This is the error message I get: Set::write: Tag Plus in 0+0+1 is Protected. >> Set::write: Tag Plus in 0+0+1 is Protected. >> General::stop: Further output of Set::write will be suppressed during this calculation. >> value = 0;
