## Question What is a good way to go about visualizing a complex software application? Are recommended software applications that can be used for this purpose? ## Background About 3 years ago, I started building a web data mining application. Started out as just me, but has since grown into a project with 5 developers. I used to be able to keep track of all the parts of the application in my mind, but now it has grown in complexity such that I'm feeling the need for some sort of visual documentation of the application's structure. I'm not really sure where to go from here. I'm thinking something that looks kind of like a flow chart. But I don't have any background, experience, or formal training in software development on this scale. I have also never served on another team where I could observe someone else architecting a complex application or managing a team. Any pointers in the right direction such as books or resources on the subject would be much appreciated!
