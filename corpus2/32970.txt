I'd like to solve the following equation numerically for $a_1$, $a_2$, $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$: $\displaystyle\int_0^{\infty}\Big[L_1\Big(\frac{k^2}{2}\Big)\Big]^2e^{-k^2}L_m(k^2)\ dk=$ $\displaystyle\int_0^{\infty}\bigg(1+\frac{k\cdot a_1}{2\alpha_1}e^{-\frac{k^2}{4\alpha_1}}-\frac{k\cdot a_2}{8\alpha_2}e^{-\frac{k^2}{4\alpha_2}}\Big(\frac{k^2}{\alpha_2}-4\Big)\bigg)e^{-k^2}L_m(k^2)\ dk\ \ \ \text{for}\ \ m=1,3,5,7$ where $L_m(x)$ is the Laguerre polynomial. Is there a nice way to do this in mathematica? Naively I've tried `FindRoot` and `Solve`, but run into all sorts of trouble. I guess looking into some approximations could do it, just wanted to check if there is an (more or less) obvious way first.
