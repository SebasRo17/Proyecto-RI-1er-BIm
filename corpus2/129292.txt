I am looking for the right word to describe a function and its complement. Here I am looking for the proper word to describe a couple of functions when applied in sequence the system reverts to its original state.   * Marshalling and Unmarshalling would be a subset of this   * Add and Remove Idempotence comes to mind though I am not sure if it can apply to more than one operation. Reversible could also do, but it seems a tad bit too general. Is there a right word that would describe this "systemic idempotence".
