When we add .edmx files to a DLL, the physical size of the DLL increases. DLL's are loaded into memory. However, the .NET infrastructure with functionality such as JIT compilation and the GAC complicates things. Is it true that having a larger DLL automatically increase the memory requirements of an application? In other words, are memory concerns a good reason to split generated code such as entity framework into N DLL's?
