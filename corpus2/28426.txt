I need your help in order to solve the following problem: I have a sixth order equation: $ax^6+bx^5+cx^4+dx^3+ex^2+fx+g=0$ and I solved it using `Solve[]` command, so I obtained 6 root objects. Now I would like to evaluate these solutions for different ranges of the equation coefficients (a between a1 and a2, b between b1 and b2, etc), selecting the only one real positive solution (that always exists for each coefficient combination) within the six, and then use the Manipulate command in order to plot the surface corresponding to these real positive solutions as function ofthe other parameters. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Some notes: I solved my Equation with this command line:               soldi = Solve[modqTomb - modqTomx == 0, di]      then I obtained my roots objects that are too long to post here. I then tried to plot the solution selecting only the real positive one with this line                   Plot3D[Select[Evaluate[di /. soldi] /. {csik -> 0.001},FreeQ[di /. #, Real] && (di /. #) > 0 &],{omegao, 50*2*Pi, 5000*2*Pi}, {psiqgamma, 1*10^-6, 3.38*10^8}]      But obviously it did not work. I also tryed too split the different command and a lot of other combination but no one seems to work. I'm sorry but I am a new userof Mathematica. **ADDITIONAL INFORMATION** I defined                omegab = \[Sqrt]((2*(omegao^2 + psiqgamma) +Sqrt[(2*psiqgamma*(psiqgamma+omegaao^2))])/2);      omegap = \[Sqrt](omegao^2 + psiqgamma);         a = -omegab^2 + omegap^2;      b = 2*di*omegap*omegab;      c = omegab^4 - omegao^2*omegab^2 - 4*di*csik*omegao*omegap*omegab^2 -omegap^2*omegab^2 + omegao^2*omegap^2 - psiqgamma*omegab^2;      d = 2*omegab*(-csik*omegao*omegab^2 - di*omegap*omegab^2 +di*omegap*omegao^2 + csik*omegao*omegap^2 + psiqgamma*di*omegap);      modqTomb = ((a*c + b*d)^2 + (c*b - a*d)^2)/(c^2 + d^2)^2;      modqTomx = (4*di^2)/(-4*di*csik*omegao*omegap - psiqgamma)^2;      soldi = Solve[modqTomb - modqTomx == 0, di]      I would like to plot the surface of the real solution as function of the parameters: omegao, csik and psiqgamma (for each triplet I obtain 6 roots of which 1 is positive)
