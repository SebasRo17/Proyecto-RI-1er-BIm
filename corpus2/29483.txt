There are something out of box to generate time expiring in php? For example I need to control the access to the system, I was thinking something to verify every first day of every month, and do this in my code. But it is not 100% safety, since another programmer can remove this line code that verify. Then I thought is it possible, to verify in another server, if the monthly time expire or not? and return the message to the user if the copy expired or not? What is the best to way to create a licensing features for time expiry? or I really need to get inside IonCube (Compiled Code Encoding) for example? What is the best practice?
