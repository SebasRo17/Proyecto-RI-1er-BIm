I picked up Julia Lerman 1st edition book: Entity Framework book 1st Edition I started reading that and it was pretty good, but I'm wondering if there is even a more higher level book for EF? From what I was reading in the 1st edition it was pretty technical. I'm looking for a real high level book. Almost like a precursor to Julia's book (2nd edition). Are there any out there that this group would recommend?
