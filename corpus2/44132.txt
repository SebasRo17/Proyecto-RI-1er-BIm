My question is about `StringCases`. When I use this function, each word is separated by a `,`. But I want some noun phrases like names of a ministry to be considered single words. For example, I would like to count the number of words in the next two sentences.               text= "The Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment is      committed to improving quality of life,access and mobility in a      clean,safe and sustainable environment.The Ministry strives to create      an efficient network of roads,railways,waterways and      airways,effective water management to protect against flooding,and      improved air and water quality"          StringCases[text, WordCharacter ..]      The result of this function is:               {"The", "Ministry", "of", "Infrastructure", "and", "Environment",      "is", "committed", "to", "improving", "quality", "of", "life",      "access", "and", "mobility", "in", "a", "clean", "safe", "and",      "sustainable", "environment", "The", "Ministry", "strives", "to",      "create", "an", "efficient", "network", "of", "roads", "railways",      "waterways", "and", "airways", "effective", "water", "management",      "to", "protect", "against", "flooding", "and", "improved", "air",      "and", "water", "quality"}      Each word is separated by a ','. When I count the number of words I get 50, but there are four noun phrases I want to be considered single words:               "Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment"     "quality of life"     "network of roads"     "water management"      So the word count I would like to get is 41. I can create a reference table with all possible combinations of words. Is there a solution for this problem?
