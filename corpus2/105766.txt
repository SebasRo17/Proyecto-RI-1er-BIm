I have an object oriented programming with c++ course this semester at college and we were learning about friend functions. I instinctively dislike them for their ability to bypass the security that Encapsulation and Data hiding provide, I read a few articles on the internet and some people thought that it was a good idea with some legitimate uses. What would an OOPs expert say about friend fucntions in C++? Should I just skim over it or should I learn more about it?
