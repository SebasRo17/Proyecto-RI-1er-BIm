Is there any way to add scale bar to a image for example. I just need to add a bar and a text on top of it to all my images without having to rewrite               Graphics[{Thick, Thick, Yellow, Line[{{100, 100}, {166, 100}}],              Text[Style["10 Î¼", Yellow, Bold, 25], {120, 110}]}]      for every image. I just want to put this bar and text at left corner of the images I have. ![1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HtLcX.jpg)
