I am implementing a Canny Edge detector for a class which I have based off the code found here. For the first derivative mask that I will convolve with the image, I am using the Sobel mask, although the website uses the Prewitt. As you can see in the samples on the website, the code is perfectly functional. However, I noticed different results when I changed the "orientation" of the Sobel gradient mask as I explain below. The typical mask for taking the derivative in the x direction in my class notes is shown to be:               [-1 0 1]     [-2 0 2]     [-1 0 1]      For the y direction it is:               [-1 -2 -1]     [0 0 0]     [1 2 1]      For an experiment, I changed the orientation for the x direction to:               [1 0 -1]     [2 0 -2]     [1 0 -1]      And for the y direction:               [1 2 1]     [0 0 0]     [-1 -2 -1]      Oddly enough, this gives me two different results, which I did not expect, since I don't think the "direction" that I am using for taking the gradient should give me a different result. First result:   ![Default_mask_orientation](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rFD0y.jpg) Second result:   ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HroFv.jpg) Why am I getting this different result? Where should I investigate next?
