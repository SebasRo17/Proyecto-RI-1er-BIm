Your company wants to patent something you implemented. You do not agree with the concept of patenting software. How do you proceed?   * Would it be acceptable to file the patent, but keep your name off it?   * Would you attempt to convince your company to NOT file the patent? Are there any downsides to having your name on a patent?   * Could you potentially be compelled to appear in court for a patent lawsuit?
