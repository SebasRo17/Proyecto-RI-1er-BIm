I have a couple of questions about the problem I am trying to solve               n = 7;     alpha = 0.01; c = 10;          atable = Table[a[i], {i, 0, n}];      Solu = y^Range[0, n].atable;          Leftequ = Solu;      Rightequ =  A y^2 +  B y + DD + 1/2/alpha Integrate[Solu^2, y];          Lec = CoefficientList[Leftequ, y];     Rec = CoefficientList[Rightequ, y];          Lec = PadRight[Lec, Min[Length[Lec], Length[Rec]]];     Rec = PadRight[Rec, Min[Length[Lec], Length[Rec]]];          eqs = Lec == Rec;          Sol = Solve[eqs, atable]      If I check `a[0]` it will show that `a[0]=a[0]`, but I want to set it to `a[0] = DD`. This is probably a mistake I overlooked, but nevertheless could not find it. Thanks in advance.
