What I'm actually trying to do is to elaborate this question. I'd like to use `Pane` with scrollbars enabled to explore large (sparse) matrices like this one: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/X6rNA.png) Here is what I have so far using some ideas from this answer:               A = ExampleData[{"Matrix", "HB/west0381"}, "Matrix"] // Normal;     {n, m} = Dimensions@A;     mp = MatrixPlot[A, ImageSize -> 9 m, Mesh -> All];     DynamicModule[{trans, ij, mpos},      trans[{x_, y_}] := {Clip[Floor[n - y] + 1, {1, n}],        Clip[Floor@x + 1, {1, m}]};      Pane[       Show[mp, ImagePadding -> {{40, 20}, {20, 20}},        Epilog -> Text[           Framed[            Dynamic[(ij = trans@MousePosition["Graphics", {0, 0}]) ->               A[[Sequence @@ ij]]], Background -> White],           Dynamic[MousePosition["Graphics", {0, 0}]],           {1, -1}           ]~Style~Larger        ],       {500, 500},       Scrollbars -> True]      ]      The result is ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SLaS3.png) * * * **Now about the problems** **1.** The main trouble is that it does not correctly translate coordinates for horizontal scrolling. If we don't touch the horizontal scrollbar everything is fine: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/RP8aZ.png) But if I slide horizontally the label shifts and falls outside the visible area. It looks like a Mma bug. **2.** The second funny thing is that if I remove `//Normal` from the first row then `MatrixPlot` produces the following: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/JIChf.png) which seems to be the second bug. **3.** And finally the issue which is due to my confusion with `Dynamic` things. In the code I use `MousePosition["Graphics", {0, 0}]` twice (can this be the reason for the item 1 from above?). When I tried to save this coordinates in a variable I had no luck. But there must be a way to do this. * * * **SUMMARY** Thanks to Andy for resolving problems number 2 and 3, and to David for nice solution using `MouseAnnotation`. I accept kguler's answer since it resolves the main problem with runaway tooltip by effectively using `CoordinatesToolOptions` option. Here is complete working example with kguler's solution. Try it (to enable the tooltip right-click on the plot and select "Get Coordinates"):               mtrxPlot2[mat_, opts : OptionsPattern[]] :=       With[{dims = Dimensions[mat],        indx = {Clip[Floor[#1[[1]] - #2[[2]]] + 1, {1, #1[[1]]}],            Clip[Floor[#2[[1]]] + 1, {1, #1[[2]]}]} &},        With[{copiedvalues =           "CopiedValueFunction" ->            Function[pt, {indx[dims, pt], Extract[mat, indx[dims, pt]]}],          coordtooltips =           "DisplayFunction" ->            Function[pt,             Row[{"mat[[", Row[indx[dims, pt], ","], "]]  =  ",               Extract[mat, indx[dims, pt]]},             Background -> White,             ImageSize -> {Automatic, 30},             ImageMargins -> {{5, 5}, {10, 10}},             Alignment -> Center]]},        MatrixPlot[mat, opts,          CoordinatesToolOptions -> {coordtooltips, copiedvalues}]        ]       ]          A = ExampleData[{"Matrix", "HB/west0381"}, "Matrix"];     Pane[mtrxPlot2[A, ImageSize -> 3000, Mesh -> All,        MaxPlotPoints -> 500], {500, 500}, Scrollbars -> True]
