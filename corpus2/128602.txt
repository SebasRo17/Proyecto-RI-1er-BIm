I'm trying to really understand how exactly a high-level language is converted into machine code and then executed by the cpu. I understand that the code is compiled into machine code, which is the low level code that a CPU can use. If I have an assignment statement say:               x = x + 5;     y = x - 3;      Does the CPU execute each line one at a time? So it will first execute the x = x + 5; instruction and then the next instruction the CPU will execute is the y = x- 3; I'm really trying to understand the execution process and how the code I write is actually execute by the CPU.
