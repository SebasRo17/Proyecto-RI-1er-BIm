`Reduce the number of #include files in header files. It will reduce build times. Instead, put include files in source code files and use forward declarations in header files.` I read this in here. http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/LinuxTutorialC++CodingStyle.html. So it says if a class (class A) in header file does not need to use the actual definition of some class (class B). At that time we can use the forward declaration instead of including the particular (class B) header file. Question: If the class (class A) in the header if doesn't use actual definition of a particular class (class B), Then how forward declaration helps to reduce the compile time?
