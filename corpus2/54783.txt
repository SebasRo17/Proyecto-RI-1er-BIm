I want to add units to my numbers to display them as the labels of my chart. I tried this:               sizes = {10718, 881, 395, 387, 375, 309, 297};     sizesStr = ToString[sizes] <> " kB";     BarChart[sizes, BarOrigin -> Left, ChartLabels -> Placed[sizesStr, Right]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cTir0.png) So instead of each bar displaying "xxx kB" I get the "kB" after the whole list. Should I blame `StringJoin` for not being listable? How do I get the numbers in each of the bars? Related: for the short bars the text will go beyond the vertical axis. Can I get the labels at the right of the bars, instead of inside them?
