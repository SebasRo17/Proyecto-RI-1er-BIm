I was discussing developing an iOS App with a client and I mentioned that we should ideally have a Universal App that would perform as an iPhone App on an iPhone and as an iPad App on an iPad. The client likes the idea of an iPad-specific version of the App but prefers the idea of a separate App entirely for the iPad version. And not for some "Angry Birds/Angry Birds HD" type of reason (the App in question will be free, so there's nothing to be gained financially) but rather because "other [organizations in his industry] have told him" that "Universal Apps have more compatibility issues with older devices when new versions of the operating system [iOS] are released" and having discrete apps for this alleviates this issue. I believe he may have been referring to the concept of an App requiring a version of iOS that is more recent than the last one available on the phone. Or maybe the concept of releasing an App or an update that requires a version of iOS beyond the last one available on a device (original iPhone is stuck at 3.1.3 forever, iPhone 3G is stuck at 4.2.1 forever). But I presume you can still make a Universal App for 3.1.3 since the original iPad shipped with iOS 3.2 and Universal Apps existed before 4.0. And while I'm having a difficult time finding out what the minimum iOS version is for Apps submitted to the App Store, I presume that the original iPhone can still download and buy Apps or else the one guy in the office here who still has his OG iPhone would probably have complained more by now. But I really don't know. Do Universal Apps have more issues with compatibility on devices (and more specifically older devices) than individually developed separate (but otherwise pretty equivalent) Apps? Has anyone ever run into this?
