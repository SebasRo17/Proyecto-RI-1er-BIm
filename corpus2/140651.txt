I have a set of Python projects which are under the mercurial VCS. I would like to automate the following tasks:   * Run the test suite for every commit (CI).   * Make a source distribution for every commit, which has a tag in mercurial. This is regarded as a new release.   * Copy the distribution to a special repository. There is _Jenkins_ as a proposal for similar questions, but I'm not sure if it can handle the release management like intended.
