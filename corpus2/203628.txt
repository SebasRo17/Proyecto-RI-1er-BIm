The company where I work has a very decent IT department, which provided _almost_ everything we need from an IT department. Anyway because of the nature of the work in my department (not IT related by all means) sometimes we need some apps to make our work easier, these small apps (if to be made by the IT department) will only be used by our department in small scope and with a lot of changes from time to time so the IT department due to these reasons and also due to the fact that they do not know a lot about the nature of our work they are not interested in developing such an apps to our department. Luckily, there are two guys in this department who know how to program (let's say medium skilled), they start making small apps in their free time (while at work) and keep them updated to help the employees of our department in terms of productivity, things are fine and everyone is happy, also that we get some problems from the IT department from time to time (which I think is normal). The only reason why the IT department is not blocking this is the managers who are supporting these apps because they make their lives easier. You can say the IT department is standing neutral towards these apps as long as they are secure enough. Now is this normal in companies? a "mini IT" department (or team) inside a department in a company that does not deal with the main IT department regarding these apps, also these are apps are installed in the company network and generally are assessed by the IT department for security issues. Is this normal? or does it sound weird? Please note: these apps are not something if lost will cause a problem to the company or something like that. They are purely to help in productivity.
