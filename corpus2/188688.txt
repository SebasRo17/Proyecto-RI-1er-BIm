I have read numerous times that programming languages when making games or large software often use multiple languages / scripts together. I'm wondering how that works. How do they compile it? How does it work together? Also, how does this work with web design also, i.e. How does one combine their HTML/CSS with their Javascript code and make it run? I know these are really basic low level questions, but I cannot find information on this on google. I'm probably just not searching well enough.
