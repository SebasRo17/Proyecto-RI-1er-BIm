1) How do I plot the following data in 3D (large data, only a part of it is used here):               {      {"date", "v1", "v2"},      {{2000, 6, 16, 0, 0, 0.}, 10.4324, 11.084},      {{2000, 6, 30, 0, 0, 0.}, 9.75499, 11.02},      {{2000, 7, 14, 0, 0, 0.}, 10.0905, 10.932},      {{2000, 7, 28, 0, 0, 0.}, 10.2406, 11.249},      {{2000, 8, 11, 0, 0, 0.}, 10.1241, 11.411},      {{2000, 8, 25, 0, 0, 0.}, 9.92124, 11.4},      {{2000, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0.}, 8.63775, 11.566},      {{2000, 9, 22, 0, 0, 0.}, 8.52399, 11.507},      {{2000, 10, 6, 0, 0, 0.}, 9.09311, 11.635},      {{2000, 10, 20, 0, 0, 0.}, 8.68255, 11.626},      {{2000, 11, 3, 0, 0, 0.}, 8.19321, 11.696},      {{2000, 11, 17, 0, 0, 0.}, 9.47059, 11.296},      {{2000, 12, 1, 0, 0, 0.}, 9.75926, 11.469},      {{2000, 12, 15, 0, 0, 0.}, 10.0035, 11.343},      {{2000, 12, 29, 0, 0, 0.}, 9.5563, 10.946},      {{2001, 1, 12, 0, 0, 0.}, 9.66618, 10.67},      {{2001, 1, 26, 0, 0, 0.}, 9.57756, 10.57},      {{2001, 2, 9, 0, 0, 0.}, 9.47097, 10.33},      {{2001, 2, 23, 0, 0, 0.}, 8.86714, 10.11}      }       2) I want to see how data evolves as time changes. How do I use `Manipulate` to do this?
