There is a software system that has been with the client for some time now. If is feature-rich, mature, complex enterprise application that client uses in production. Due to the rapid expansion of the client's business the software system in subject cannot handle the volumes efficiently and overall performance does not satisfy the customer anymore. So the customer asks the vendor of the software system for improvements in performance and efficiency of the system. The customer also expects the vendor to prepare a plan and ballpark budget so the cost of such optimizations is roughly known upfront. What do you think is the best approach for such plan and high level budget that one could prepare for the customer? I'm asking the question because I've seen some of this kind of plans before and they are usually very vague and imprecise mainly due to the fact that such exercise is kind of chicken and egg dilemma. In order to know what exactly should be optimized and tuned in complex system the benchmarking, profiling and research is required. And that investigation is also the part of the planned project, so it is impossible to know upfront what efforts can such benchmarking results require to implement improvements.
