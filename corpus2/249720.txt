I'm developing a library for reading/writing a file format of a program created by a certain company. The guys from that company were so kind that they provided me with a documentation for their format, which I'm really grateful for. I'm intending to release the library as open-source under a license "derived" from MIT, the difference being that the library must not be used to create a program that would compete with the original program, as an expression of my gratefulness to the company. What I'm asking: is adding this rule to the license legally possible?
