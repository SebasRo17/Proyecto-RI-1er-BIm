One of the jar files that I use in my code is not in the maven repository(and yes I tried to avoid using it). I have installed it locally so when I build the project it gets picked up by maven. I also put instructions in my `README` so anyone who wants to build my code can see how to add the jar to their local repository. The question is, should I check this jar into my git source control? I know normally you donâ€™t check jars into source when using maven and git but in this case it seems like it might be a better idea than saying, find this jar on the internet. I am the only developer in my group so setting up a company hosted repository for just this single jar is overkill.
