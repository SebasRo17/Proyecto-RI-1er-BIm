The equation $$x^2\cdot\log_2\dfrac{3+x}{10}-x^2\cdot\log_{\frac{1}{2}}(2 + 3x)=x^2 - 4+2\cdot\log_{\sqrt{2}}\dfrac{3x^2+11x+6}{10}$$ has two solutions for x, namely 1 and 2. I tried               Reduce[x^2*Log[2, (3 + x)/10] - x^2*Log[1/2, 2 + 3*x] ==        x^2 - 4 + 2*Log[Sqrt[2], (3*x^2 + 11*x + 6)/10], x]      and               Solve[x^2*Log[2, (3 + x)/10] - x^2*Log[1/2, 2 + 3*x] ==        x^2 - 4 + 2*Log[Sqrt[2], (3*x^2 + 11*x + 6)/10], x]      but I could not get these two solutions. How do I tell _Mathematica_ to do that?
