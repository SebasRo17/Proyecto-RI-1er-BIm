I was wondering if I could speed up `SphericalPlot3D`? I tried editing `PlotPoints`, and `MaxRecursion`, but when I wrap `SphericalPlot3D` with `Manipulate` it fails. I don't want to set `ContinuousAction` to `False`.               Manipulate[ SphericalPlot3D[{r, 0, rmax}, {\[Phi], 0, phi \[Pi]},        {\[Theta], 0, theta \[Pi]}, SphericalRegion -> True, PlotRange -> 4,        Mesh -> 2, Ticks -> None],        {theta, 0.07, 1}, {phi, 0.07, 2}, {rmax, 0.07, 4}, SaveDefinitions -> True]      I wanted to layer a whole bunch of shells together to make a solid. {r, 0,rmax} specifies what range of shells' radii I want to create
