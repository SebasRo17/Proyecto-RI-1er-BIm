I was wondering, **without using any kind of user info** (id, nickname, age, etc), what would be the best way to assure filename uniqueness using php **in a large database with high traffic and most probably simultaneously** between many users? I am using `$file = time()` for example but I would like to know if this should suffice whenever two users might go over this code at the same time (at a large large large scale, 10000 users at the same time and the same function ran 200 at the same time).
