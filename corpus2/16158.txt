I have a Manipulate control, the main element of which is a single slider. Moving the _one_ slider triggers calls to _two_ functions - one which is evaluated very quickly, the other more slowly. I'd like to see 'live' update ( i.e. ContinuousAction->True ) for the fast one, but would only like to update the slow one when the mouse is released. Is there a simple way to achieve this? Thanks in advance!
