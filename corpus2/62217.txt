At my last interview(it was a phone interview) I was asked: "Which is the time period in which you can learn Java?". I've answered that I believe that in 2-3 month I'm able to write good code for non-fancy/regular applications. After that I observed that the employer took a long break and switched to other questions. Now, I'm asking you, what you've answered if you were in my place. PS: I didn't worked a lot with Java(2 weeks), so I don't think that a person who is saying something like "I can learn Java in 2 days" is fair with him/herself.
