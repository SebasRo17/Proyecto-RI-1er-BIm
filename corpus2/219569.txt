There are so many programming language like PHP, Perl, Python, Java, C, C++ and many other. These programming language has some open source license. If i develop application from scratch which is not related the source modification of these languages. Is my application has to be open source license?? There are billions of applications written in these language? All application has be open source? I don't understand that, is there language issue ever existed? I think there should not programming language licensing issue just like spoken language..either i speak in english, french or any other. I can write a book in any language without my book to be open source, is that right???
