I have a Navier-Stokes solution for a flow past a cylinder. I have attached the DAT file. The columns in the DAT file contain the x,y,u,v,p data, respectively. The DAT file can be obtained from our attachment repository here. I am trying to make _Mathematica_ plot a contour plot that looks like this for velocity and pressure ![Velocity field](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1d2RN.png) ![Pressure](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4S2Qd.png) But when I use the following to plot my u,v,p fields, the contours erase my geometry. This is what I have done so far:               Data = Import[        "https://raw.github.com/stackmma/Attachments/master/data_2571_187.txt",        "Table", "IgnoreEmptyLines" -> True];     x = Data[[All, 1]];     y = Data[[All, 2]];     u = Data[[All, 3]];     v = Data[[All, 4]];     p =  Data[[All, 5]];     gridsolution = Transpose[{x, y}];     velocityu = Transpose[{x, y, u}];     velocityv = Transpose[{x, y, v}];     pressure = Transpose[{x, y, p}];     ListContourPlot[velocityu, PlotRange -> All, Contours -> 99,      ContourStyle -> {None}, ColorFunction -> "Rainbow",      PlotLegends -> Automatic, PlotLabel -> "u(x,y)",      AxesLabel -> {"x", "y"}]     ListContourPlot[velocityv, PlotRange -> All, Contours -> 99,      ContourStyle -> {None}, ColorFunction -> "Rainbow",      PlotLegends -> Automatic, PlotLabel -> "v(x,y)",      AxesLabel -> {"x", "y"}]     ListContourPlot[pressure, PlotRange -> All, Contours -> 99,      ContourStyle -> {None}, ColorFunction -> "Rainbow",      PlotLegends -> Automatic, PlotLabel -> "P(x,y)",      AxesLabel -> {"x", "y"} ]      This results in the following figures: ![u](http://i.stack.imgur.com/LapnS.png) ![v](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IoeIS.png) ![pressure](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8ibqX.png) How can I make my velocity and pressure plot look like the COMSOL plots above? _Mathematica_ doesn't understand that there is a cylinder in the middle, but just overwrites the geometry with contours.
