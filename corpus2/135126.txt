I am trying to get an entry-level developer job, but have no relevant experience. I am able to code C#, SQL, HTML, and CSS and understand principles of OOP and have completed a couple of applications both in WinForms and WebForms. I've tried applying to graduate roles, but I get blocked by recruiters who don't like my experience so far. I was thinking about writing a detailed report (like a CV) on what I've done so far, visiting software shops, introducing myself, and ask for an internship. Is this an effective way to get my foot in the door in software development? Should I try cold-calling first, to try and get a formal interview?
