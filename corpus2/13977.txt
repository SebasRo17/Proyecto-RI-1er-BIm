Say I have a matrix A = 1000 x 5, and I want to compare it's first element (uppermost top left) to each of the 5 elements in the first column of matrix B of size 5 x 5. Whenever the first time the equality is flagged to say element of A is less than or equal to the element in B, the corresponding row position of B will be printed, and procedure is repeated with the next element down in A again compared with the same column of B. Similarly, elements in second column A will compare with second column of B, third column of A, compared with third column of B. This is repeated for the whole matrix of 5000 elements in A. So essentially the output matrix C will be of size 1000 x 5, with values ranging from 0 to 5. Or is this easier in VBA or Matlab?
