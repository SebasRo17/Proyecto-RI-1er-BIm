I was reading this Mathworld page on the Josephus problem: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/JosephusProblem.html from what I understood, once we get the _place in execution sequence_ we can apply _inverse permutation_ (which seems simple) to get the order of execution. But I could not make out how to compute the _place in execution sequence_ , given `n, k` i.e, for `n = 4, k = 2`, how to arrive at `{4, 1, 3, 2}` I am mostly interested in _implementing_ the solution (I've done the usual circular-list based etc), but if there are better ways, I want to try/understand.
