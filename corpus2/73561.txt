Is it true that platform independency is more of a myth today? Because programmers look for efficiency and power over portability which have to be compromised to some extent when achieving platform independency. On the other hand architecture neutrality is welcomed because it provides a very powerful way to make a software which can dominate a particular operating system family. My question is: Lets consider a hypothetical situation where we have to pick either one of them.What should be compromised? Portability or Power? I know this question is a bit subjective,but I'm looking for your views in general. Thank you. **EDIT:** Is it right to accept a particular answer just for the sake of it,especially for a question that would be answered according to individual perspectives?
