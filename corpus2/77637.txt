> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  What "version naming convention" do you use? I am currently debating between the traditional versioning convention `[major].[minor].[revision]` and my own, almost whimsical, `[YYYY].[MM].[DD].[hh][mm]` for a new project I am starting. I understand that `[major].[minor].[revision]` is probably the most popular versioning method on the planet and it is indeed pretty straightforward and reasonable, except that determining which changes merit the label "major", "minor" or even "revision" could be... **subjective**. A versioning system based on a _timestamp_ is purely non-subjective and guarantees uniqueness. Which one would you choose for your project and why?
