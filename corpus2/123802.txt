I am employed as a developer, but the only application development tools I have available to me are Access and Excel (i.e., VBA). Fortunately, I have good access to our Oracle DB, but that took some persuasion! It's been a while, but I can write good, albeit vanilla C (amongst other, less relevant things) and am familiar with the OOP model. The problem I've come up against is that VBA with ADO isn't robust enough to suit my needs. So, my question is: how realistic do you think it would be to migrate from this environment to C++ (say, using Visual C++) with Oracle's C++ call interface, given my experience? Would the learning curve (C++, which I've dabbled in briefly, OCCI and, ultimately, Windows GUI coding) be too steep to justify? That is, could I learn this stuff on the job to a production level in a short amount of time?
