In a similar spirit to a question proffered several days back,and as that question stated, > Since the front-end is quite extendable my question is... Does the front end provide any way to use tabs in code? A bit trivial, I admit, but I for one would find it very useful to use tabs to align parts of different expressions or the layout of a `Grid` to make the code easier to read and debug. **Edit to original question follows:** I didn't realize until I saw Leonid's answer that what I thought I had asked and what everyone else thought I asked had little resemblance. What I'd like to do is perhaps simpler and maybe just sillier. A very simple example of a Grid[]                 Grid[{{"First" , "Second" , "Third", "Fourth", "Fifth" },       {"1st" , "2nd" , "3rd" , "4th" , "5th" }}]      What I'd like to see in either a StandardForm or InputForm styled cell would look like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jPJSI.png) I'd like the functionality of using a tab within any given line of code within any longer expression. This draws a bit on one of the useful features of "table oriented programing". I think this could make setting up complex Grid[]s or just reading complex code and functions easier and thereby facilitate more easily finding bugs and inconsistencies. I hope this makes the question clearer.
