Apparently, `BarLegend` in version 10 displays tick legends in scientific notation when they are smaller in magnitude than 0.01. For instance,               BarLegend[{"Rainbow", {-.015, .015}},      LabelStyle -> Directive[Black, Bold, FontSize -> 12]]      creates the object ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/v3640.png) How can I change the tick labels to decimal notation, as they would have appeared in version 9? By the way, the `Bold` directive evidently is being ignored. Is there a work- around for this?
