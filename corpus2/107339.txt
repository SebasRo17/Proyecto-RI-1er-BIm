Is there somewhere some kind of dictionary or book which explains all those modern terms of language concepts like (but not limited to)   * currying    * closure    * lambda function   * type deduction    * dynamic meta-programming    * multiple dispatch    * etc. ? I know that books on programming languages like groovy explain some of these concepts, but I am looking for something more comprehensive and language independent... Update: Yes, I know, I will find explanations for each of those single concepts through google and wikipedia, but I am looking for an overview of all those terms... a dictionary :-) Background: As long as I don't know the term to search for, I can't find it on wikipedia or google... **Bounty:** Since I am still looking for a good overview or list of programming concepts together with an explanation, I now offer a bounty for the best answer. If you don't have a link to an overview, but you know some programming concepts which are not mentioned yet - please feel free to create an answer and name them together with a link to wikipedia or another explaining text. I will collect all these answer and the best one will receive the bounty. **Update:** thanx for all answers. It was hard to decide on the right answer and bounty. Since it seems that there is no such dictionary I was looking for, I decided to collect references by myself in a blog: http://plconcepts.blogspot.com/
