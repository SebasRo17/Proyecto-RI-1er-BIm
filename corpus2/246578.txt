My database is going to store words, so the Word table is the most important. The Rhyme table lists which words a particular word perfectly rhymes with. It consists of three fields:               RhymeID - primary key.     WordID - foreign key linking to Word table     Rhyme - a non key integer which refers to a different record in the Word table.      E.g. 'cat' has WordID 009, 'bat' has WordID 014 and 'fat' has WordID 035, two records in the Rhyme table might look like this               RhymeId - WordId - Rhyme     001 - 009 (cat) - 014 (bat)     002 - 009 (cat) - 035 (fat)      The question is, should I make WordId a primary key to form a composite key with RhymeId? Do I need it to uniquely identify each record? I have no practical experience with databases, this one is still in the planning stage.
