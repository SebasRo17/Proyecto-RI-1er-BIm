I seem to have a never ending stream of more-or-less original, more-or-less cool ideas for software/apps/stuff yet to be written on my mind. Sometimes, I decide to just start implementing my idea. Several hours later, I end up with a decent, more-or-less working prototype of what I'm trying to build. Then, my alarm clock goes ringing and I have to get back to the real world, tired as hell. In most cases, the stuff I started remains unfinished forever. Sometimes, that's okay. Other times, I honestly feel like that's a bummer. But I realize that there are sites like GitHub and there are many other coders out there. Is there a place where one can post ideas, proposals, concepts, or rough-around-the-edges-code in order to find people who are interested in collaborating on projects? **Edit:** I am aware of "the usual way" â€“ keep developing on your own for some period of time, open-source the code, mention your project on dev blogs, IRC or wherever else you go; eventually attracts others. What I'm looking for is a place to connect with other devs (e.g. of different specializations) on the early stages of a project.
