I have a lot of plots like this in Mathematica: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZHnYe.png) And I would like to transform it in something like that: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/S0HeI.png) Where the information between 0 and 7 hours and 18 and 00 hour is "compressed" in the chart. I know about `ScalingFunctions`, but it doesn't work for `DateListPlot`. Here is some toy code to reproduce the original version behavior:               dtIni={2013,1,1,0};     dtFim={2013,1,1,24};     data={#,RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[0,1]]}&/@RandomReal[{AbsoluteTime@dtIni,AbsoluteTime@dtFim},500];          DateListPlot[data         ,FrameTicks->{Automatic,{DateRange[dtIni, dtFim, "Hour"],None}}         ,GridLines -> {If[MemberQ[{0,7,12,18},Last@#],{#,Gray},{#,LightGray}]&/@DateRange[dtIni, dtFim, "Hour"],{#,LightGray}&/@{0.5,1,2,5,10,20}}         ,DateTicksFormat->{"Hour"}     ]      I don't know if the best idea is try to scale the X axis, or join 3 charts, one for each time period using something like this dismembered data:               dataP1 = Select[data, #[[1]] < AbsoluteTime@{2013, 1, 1, 7} &];     dataP3 = Select[data, #[[1]] > AbsoluteTime@{2013, 1, 1, 18} &];     dataP2 = Complement[data, dataP1, dataP3];      I think that the axis scale solution appear to be more elegant, but I don't know how to implement it. 3 Graphics join will be welcome too. Any Clue?
