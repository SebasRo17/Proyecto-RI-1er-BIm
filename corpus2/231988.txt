I am learning to be a web developer and am using rails. I have read lots of advice and books on the subject and am trying to build my own app, so learning by doing. My question is about that learning journey and the path to take. I have been convinced that BDD is a very sensible and helpful way to develop so I am studying this technique. I am using Cucumber and RSpec and am working through the RSpec book and the Cucumber book. I have now reached a point of total frustration though as I try to write features and steps because I don't know how to use rails or write code. I am new to it but wanted to make sure I built in the good habits as I learn. If I make BDD the way I code from the beginning it will be second nature to me once I am an experienced developer, but because of how slowly I am progressing and how lost I am I am thinking I should scrap BDD for now and just learn the framework. But them I am in the habit of not writing tests as I go and getting lazy. What are your experienced feelings on this matter? Should I keep plugging away at the BDD tests to build good habits? Or am I putting to much importance on it? Thank you for advice,
