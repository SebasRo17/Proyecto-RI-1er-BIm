Recently I saw some possibilities of some IDEs (via plugins) to sort members of their classes/modules based on some criteria, sou you could have everything sorted automaticaly no matter where you would put the elements in time of writing it to editor. Do you think that this kind of sorting in class/module may have positive impacts on productivity, readability, comprehensibility etc?
