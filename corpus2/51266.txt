Hello Mathematica experts. I would like to play around with a simple variable transformation, to test some claims about it. I wonder if there is a _Mathematica_ -like way to do this. The specific case I have is a transformation: $$x\mapsto x' \equiv \begin{cases}x; \qquad x\ge 0\\\x+\pi;\, x<0\end{cases}$$ where $x\in[-\pi,\pi]$ gets moved over to $x'\in[0,\pi]$. So far I have found two equivalent ways of representing this:               XPrimed[x_] := If[x < 0, x + π, x]     AnotherXPrimed[x_] := x*HeavisideTheta[x]  + (HeavisideTheta[-x]*(x + π))      Which both seem reasonable.               Plot[XPrimed[phi], {phi, -π, π},          AxesLabel -> {"original variable, x", "transformed variable, x'"},          PlotRange -> {{-π, π}, {0, π}}]      ![Plot of the transformation... works as expected](http://i.stack.imgur.com/618u4.png) So how do I make plots of things like:               Plot[Cos[XPrimed[x]], {x,-π, π},         AxesLabel -> {"original variable, x", "Cos(x')"}]      ![Plot of the transformed variable](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KYY6P.png) ..but over the **transformed** domain, i.e. $\cos(x')$ with $x'$ on the x-axis? I suspect there is a smart way to do this in _Mathematica_ specifying domains or variable maps or a coordinate transformation or the like, I can't seem to find anything.
