To help illustrate my problem, consider the following cell: ![Goal](http://i.stack.imgur.com/F3DvF.png) First thing to notice is that there is syntax highlighting. Second, I can pretty print mathematics; that is, I see $x^2$ instead of `x^2`. Finally, the equal signs are aligned "nicely." I will expand on what I mean by "nicely" in a second. As of now, I have no idea how to create the cell I illustrated above. Let me elucidate what I mean by this. By default the "Style of newly typed cells" is `Input` and the "Format type of new input cells" is `StandardForm` (in V9 you can see this in the Preferences -> Evaluation menu). ![menu](http://i.stack.imgur.com/whMbt.png) To create a cell that is similar, but not exact, to the cell I have shown above, I need to type the following: `variable` `Space` `=` `Space` `1` `;` `Enter` `var` `Space x 13` `=` `Space` `x` `Ctrl + 6` `2` `→` `;` This produces the following. Notice that the equal signs are not quite aligned. ![standardform](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ud7zJ.png) Hitting `Space` 13 times is not what I call a "nice" way of aligning the equal signs. What I expect, is to hit `Space` 6 times to align the equal signs since this is a monospace font. **Question:** Is there a way to modify the FrontEnd so that the sequence of keyboard commands: `variable` `Space` `=` `Space` `1` `;` `Enter` `var` `Space x 6` `=` `Space` `x` `Ctrl + 6` `2` `→` `;` produces the first image above and I am able to evaluate it? Let me explain what I have tried so far. **(Attempt 1)** Changing "Format type of new input cells" to `InputType`. Using the second set of keyboard commands above, I get what is desired, but evaluating the cell gives me an error.               MakeExpression::boxfmt: InputForm in MakeExpression[FormBox[RowBox[{RowBox[{variable,=,1}],;}],InputForm],InputForm] is not a box formatting type. A box formatting type is any member of $BoxForms. >>      **(Attempt 2)** Changing "Format type of new input cells" to `Raw InputType`. I try using the second set of keyboard commands above and can align the equal signs, but I lose the ability to pretty print math and lose syntax highlighting. I am able to evaluate the cell. ![rawinputform](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wEzEU.png) **(Attempt 3)** Keeping "Format type of new input cells" as `StandardForm`. I use the first set of keyboard commands to produce the third image. Then I highlight the cell bracket and convert to `InputForm` (via `Shift + Ctrl + I`). This gives the following. ![converted](http://i.stack.imgur.com/EnqKR.png) I can then add a few spaces to align the equal signs. ![aligned](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9iT4U.png) Then I change the `x^2` to a $x^2$. Unlike in **(Attempt 1)** , I can evaluate this cell. Even though this gives me what I desire, it is a tedious way to go about it.
