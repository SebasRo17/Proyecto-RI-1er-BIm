For the first time I'm in the position where I'm helping interview potential front-end developers. The other interviewer is more business & PM-focused, although he is a former developer. I probe for knowledge and background in CSS, Javascript, and other related technologies, but those questions are really just testing for lingo. I feel that it would be unfair to ask very specific questions about CSS when we're not in front of a computer. I've also been given websites that these web developers have written. Is that enough to go on for interviewing front-ends? We're also looking for general aptitude, rather than a databank of knowledge.
