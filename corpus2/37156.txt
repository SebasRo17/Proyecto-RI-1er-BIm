I need to use an InputField with a generic dynamic variable (not restricted to be Number or String or whatsever) and I don't want to see the quotation marks in the case the input is a string. Here is an example               z="";     InputField[Dynamic[z]]      I know the Cell's option ShowStringCharacter but here doesn't work, for instance see               z = "";     Panel[Column[{Style[InputField[Dynamic[z]],          ShowStringCharacters -> False], Spacer[5],         Row[{"This is the value of variable z", Spacer[5], Dynamic[z]}]}]]      and this one               z = "";     ExpressionCell[      Panel[Column[{Style[InputField[Dynamic[z]],           ShowStringCharacters -> False], Spacer[5],          Row[{"This is the value of variable z", Spacer[5],            Dynamic[z]}]}]], ShowStringCharacters -> False]      Any suggestion? Thanks in advace, Roberto
