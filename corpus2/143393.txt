I have another one of those "is it done in XML" questions (my last one about xml comments hasn't been answered if anyone has a good explanation) I was just wondering if anyone, anywhere would:   1. Use multiple `root` elements in an XML document   2. Put text content outside of a `root` element W3C discourages these practices, Javascript's `DOMParser` doesn't even allow these cases, and I can't think of one sane reason to do either of these things. However, I know how bizarre some implementations of XML have been, so I wouldn't be surprised. Does anyone have any real world examples where this would be done? I will also accept an answer that specifies if other mainstream parsers allow doing either of these.
