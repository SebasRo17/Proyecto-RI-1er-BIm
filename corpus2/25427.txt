I am trying to solve the equation for the quantity r = y/x symbolically:               3/y^4 == 3/x^4 + a/(x + 2 y)^4        with the requirement that we need to perform the substitution y -> r x and use **Thread** to factor both sides of the equation at the same time. Here is my attempt:               In: {3/y^4 == 3/x^4 + a/(x + 2 y)^4} /. y-> r x        > Out: {3/(r^4 x^4) == 3/x^4 + a/(x + 2 r x)^4} But the above method of course is not completely correct. If I used thread, the output does not change:               In: Thread[{3/y^4 == 3/x^4 + a/(x + 2 y)^4} /. y-> r x]        > Out: {3/(r^4 x^4) == 3/x^4 + a/(x + 2 r x)^4} Then I think I have to factor them first by using Thread to both sides:               In: Solve[Thread[Factor[{3/y^4 == 3/x^4 + a/(x + 2 y)^4} /. y -> r x], Equal], r]      > Out: {{r -> Root[-3 - 24 #1 - 72 #1^2 - 96 #1^3 + (-45 + a) #1^4 + 24 #1^5 + > 72 #1^6 + 96 #1^7 + 48 #1^8 &, 1]},   >  {r -> Root[-3 - 24 #1 - 72 #1^2 - 96 #1^3 + (-45 + a) #1^4 + 24 #1^5 + 72 > #1^6 + 96 #1^7 + 48 #1^8 &, 2]},   >  {r -> Root[-3 - 24 #1 - 72 #1^2 - 96 #1^3 + (-45 + a) #1^4 + 24 #1^5 + 72 > #1^6 + 96 #1^7 + 48 #1^8 &, 3]},   >  {r -> Root[-3 - 24 #1 - 72 #1^2 - 96 #1^3 + (-45 + a) #1^4 + 24 #1^5 + 72 > #1^6 + 96 #1^7 + 48 #1^8 &, 4]},   >  {r -> Root[-3 - 24 #1 - 72 #1^2 - 96 #1^3 + (-45 + a) #1^4 + 24 #1^5 + 72 > #1^6 + 96 #1^7 + 48 #1^8 &, 5]},   >  {r -> Root[-3 - 24 #1 - 72 #1^2 - 96 #1^3 + (-45 + a) #1^4 + 24 #1^5 + 72 > #1^6 + 96 #1^7 + 48 #1^8 &, 6]},   >  {r -> Root[-3 - 24 #1 - 72 #1^2 - 96 #1^3 + (-45 + a) #1^4 + 24 #1^5 + 72 > #1^6 + 96 #1^7 + 48 #1^8 &, 7]},   >  {r -> Root[-3 - 24 #1 - 72 #1^2 - 96 #1^3 + (-45 + a) #1^4 + 24 #1^5 + 72 > #1^6 + 96 #1^7 + 48 #1^8 &, 8]}} I am not sure whether my approach is correct. Then if I want to plot the solution for a$\in${-1,1} which is to examine the number of solutions which are real-valued. Here is what I did:               Plot[Table[Solve[Thread[Factor[{3/y^4 == 3/x^4 + a/(x + 2 y)^4} /. y -> r x], Equal], r], {a, -1, 1, 0.02}], {r, -100, 100}]      The output showed error and said ivar is not a valid variable. I am not sure what went wrong and how to fix it. Any helps and comments are greatly welcomed. Many thanks.
