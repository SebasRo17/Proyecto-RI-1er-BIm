I looked at it in my field of work, which is film and pretty much every software we use comes with python as a scripting language: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Python_software That made me assume it's the most popular. How did Python become popular as a scripting language? Especially as an embedded language into standalone applications. What's the reason for this? There are others like Lua, Ruby, etc. but yet it looks like Python came on top. If it's because of a particular thing or just a matter of getting out there at the right time?
