Let's say I am checking a directory for the existence of a file, and then depending on whether or not the file exists, I act accordingly. For example, see the two Python snippets below.               if os.path.isfile(file_name):         # do task A     else:         # do task B      or               if not os.path.isfile(file_name):         # do task B     else:         # do task A      Is there a difference between the two or is it just semantics? While the example I gave uses Python, would the rules apply the same to other languages?
