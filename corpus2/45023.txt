I am attempting to compute the one loop contribution to the Higgs mass, and the one loop integral is somewhat difficult. I decided to try and get Mathematica to do it, to see if the answer can point me in the right direction. I inputted,               Integrate [(k^(d - 1)*(k^2 + p*k + m^2))/(((k - (x - 1) p)^2 +        p^2 (x - x^2 - 1))^2), {k, 0, Infinity}]      where the integration variable is $k$, and the rest are constants. Mathematica outputted, ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Mfrqc.png) i.e. it simply wrote out the integral, and did not even attempt to compute it. Can someone tell me why it behaved like this; it's happened with other integrals in the past? How can I make it perform the integral (if it can)? It didn't even output an error message. PS: Please feel free to edit/improve the tags, the closest I found to integration was 'numerical integration.'
