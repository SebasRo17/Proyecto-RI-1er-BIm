Recently I graduated from university/college and immediately landed myself a job. The company has versions of software it gives to it's clients, however the software is largely, or rather entirely, built on an in-house framework. This in-house framework almost abstracts everything from the 'developer' in terms of lean Java code and instead provides helper methods for almost EVERYTHING. For example, creating a UI and interfacing with the back-end is done entirely on top of their framework using their 'API' if you will. My immediate thoughts are now - Do a year of experience and get out otherwise I will be locked in and too afraid to leave in the future. My questions are: Is this common practice in the industry? Will this stagnate my skills? Should I bail?
