I have a question regarding a graph traversal problem. This is the graph I am working with:               Graph[{1 <-> 2, 1 <-> 3, 2 <-> 3, 2 <-> 4, 3 <-> 4}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/czlOM.jpg) My Problem is following: I want to find a cycle on this graph such that after completion of the cycle I will have traversed each edge of the graph **exactly twice** and will have ended at my starting point. I saw that _Mathematica_ 9 has a built-in function: _FindEulerianCycle[g]_ which does just want I want except that each edge is traversed exactly once. So my idea was to "double" the edges i.e. add a new edge between 2 nodes:               Graph[{       1 <-> 2, 1 <-> 2, 1 <-> 3, 1 <-> 3, 2 <-> 3, 2 <-> 3, 2 <-> 4, 2 <-> 4, 3 <-> 4, 3 <-> 4       }]      But then I get the following error message: > Graph::supp: Mixed graphs and multigraphs are not supported. Apparently Multigraphs are still not supported in _Mathematica_ 8 & 9: Multigraphs in _Mathematica_ 8 Is there a way to implement a solution to the above mentioned problem in _Mathematica_? (I am using _Mathematica_ 9) **Note** : The graph shown above is just a simple example. I need to solve the above mentioned problem on a much bigger undirected graph which has vertices of odd degree.
