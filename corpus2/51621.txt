Very often I'm working on small projects only for myself. I'm working on one machine, but recently I thought about using some kind of version control nevertheless. This would have some benefits as for example:   * I don't have to care anymore for local backup   * Mistakes can easily made undone   * History can be maintained But on the other hand it has also some drawbacks like for example:   * Additional resources required   * Time to setup, get used to it, etc. From your experience, is it a good thing to use revision control when your working alone?
