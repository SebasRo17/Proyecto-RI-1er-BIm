I've come across a job posting that asks for experience with "Scalable Integrated Systems", but honestly that sounds like "generic buzzword," and I'm trying to figure out what the actual work behind "Scalable Integrated Systems" is. What does a "Scalable Integrated System" look like? Is it making distributed computing software? Is it writing APIs between services in a way they "scale", and if so, scale in what way? I don't understand what a Scalable Integrated System is. The company seems competent and I have competent programmer friends working there who say they are a great place to work in. If it was SpammyCoOnCraigslist@yahoo.com, I wouldn't bother asking.
