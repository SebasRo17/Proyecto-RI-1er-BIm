Is there any research into the most common mistakes or conceptual errors that people with no previous exposure to computer programming make when attempting to learn or being taught programming? This question may be a dup, but in order to help reduce that possibility:   * This question is not about people who can't learn to program or find it too difficult, but about problems or mistakes that even the ones who do learn, and perhaps even find easy, are more likely to have or make at first.   * This question is not about errors that programmers who already know how to program make, only about clean slate beginners.   * It is not about teaching or how to teach, it is about what, even after "proper teaching", some percentage of a introductory class's students might, at first, still think or do in (perhaps even surprising to the teacher) contravention to the teaching material. This question is also not about programming style or patterns, but about the type of mental errors in beginners that prevent any code solution, even if not using the current thought in best practices.
