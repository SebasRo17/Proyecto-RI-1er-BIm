Organizations, especially organizations with a recognized brand, have various standards for software. This includes things like security, usability, code quality and readability, UI design, test automation and so forth. In our organization we have a lead for each of these areas. Each lead is a very experienced individual and is trusted by management. Each lead is responsible for the software to meet the standards in the lead's area of expertise. The Scrum Guide says: "Development teams are self-organizing. No one (not even the Scrum Master) tells the Development Team how to turn Product Backlog into Increments of potentially releasable functionality;" My question is how can an organization trust teams to produce a product that meets the various standards mentioned above, if the leads (trusted by the organization) have no ability to enforce the quality in each of the areas?
