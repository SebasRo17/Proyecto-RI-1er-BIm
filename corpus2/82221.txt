I've been programming in Java for quite some time and I always find myself doing very little "planning" (I haven't worked on anything HUGE yet, but im no stranger to big projects) and develop ideas and fix code efficiency as I go. I tend to write a block of code, test it, test it again, try to break it, then make it look nice (visually) and then worry about modifying it to be more efficient (if possible). Is this how most people think/work? I'm wondering if anyone else takes the time to pretty up their code after its done or if they plan how its supposed to look and the most efficient method of writing it before actually coding anything. I'm trying to fine tune my own efficiency and hearing from the community will give me a broader idea of how professional and amateur programmers alike think.
