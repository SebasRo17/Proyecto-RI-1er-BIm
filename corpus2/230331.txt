If the plagiarized code is commented out because I found another way to solve the problem, but I forgot to remove the comments, is that considered plagiarism? I used the copied code to help me debug and compare the output between my own code and the copied code. In the final code, I commented out the copied code. Since comments don't affect how the code runs, can comments be considered plagiarism?
