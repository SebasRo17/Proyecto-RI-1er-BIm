Ruby gems have `LICENSE` file with the license text in each gem. Cocoa[Touch] open source frameworks (say ShareKit, StackKit, etc.) have license at the very beginning of each file (.h and .m). I am not sure about .NET or other interpreted languages (except ruby), but I'm pretty sure there are own choices at hand. I am wondering what are the reasons behind placing license into open source software source packages like this. Why not `LICENSE` file everywhere or at the beginning of every source file?
