This code               Needs["Calendar`"];     days = {Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday};     c = Count[          Flatten[Table[            DayOfWeek[{y, m, 13}], {y, 2000, 2399}, {m, 12}]], #] & /@ days;     TableForm[       { days, c, PaddedForm[#, {6, 4}] & /@ (100. c/Plus @@ c),            ToString //@ Flatten[Position[Sort[c, Greater], #]] & /@ c},              TableDirections -> {Row, Column},                TableHeadings -> {{"day", "numbers of 13s", "percentage", "rank"},                  None}]      will give this table: (counts of 13ths over days of week, using 400 years data) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xksZ8.png) _(this is used as an illustration of interesting fact that 13th is more likely to be Friday than any other day of week)_ How can I obtain a table that counts Fridays over days of month (1st, 2nd, ...) also over 400 years?
