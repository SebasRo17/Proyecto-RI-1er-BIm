In DDD examples it seems the common method for developing the domain model is to sit with domain experts and iterate over versions of the model, say on a whiteboard, continually modifying it and changing it until presumably an agreement is made on how the model looks. On my project I've spent a couple of days with a domain expert, discussing the domain, and now I want to lock myself away and produce a draft model based on my understanding, rather than producing the model collaboratively with the domain expert. He could then review it, and I could update it according to our subsequent discussions. Has anyone else worked like this, or does anyone think its a good / bad idea? I think maybe I just find it easier to think creatively when alone.
