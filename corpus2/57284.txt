I'm experiencing a weird issue. Consider a dataset defined like this:               dataset = Dataset[{<|"a" -> 1, "b" -> 2|>, <|"a" -> 3, "b" -> 4|>}];      Now I would expect `Export["test.json", dataset]` to create a JSON file with these contents:               [{"a": 1, "b": 2}, {"a": 3, "b": 4}].      Instead, the command returns > Export::badval: The element Data contains invalid values. >>. A workaround is to run               Export["test.json", Normal[Normal[dataset]]]       but that seems merely a workaround. Is there anyone here who knows a neat solution?
