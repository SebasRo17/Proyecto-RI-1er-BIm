I've got the following OpenCL function:               __kernel void mergeSort(__global const float * in,__global float * out, __local float *aux)      When I try to call it, I only receive an internal error               OpenCLFunction::invprop: OpenCLLink encountered an invalid property.       I've allocated the memory with               OpenCLMemoryAllocate["Float", 8]      When I remove the "__local", the kernel can be executed. The kernel works fine in a standalone C++ application. Thx
