I have an ugly, six dimensional function that I need to integrate numerically. It works, but it currently take twelve hours to complete the calculation. Is there any good way to parallelize the calculation to run across multiple cores? The best I've managed to come up with is:               Sum[         ParallelTable[             NIntegrate[calc[a,b,c,d,e,f],                        {a,-1,1},                        {b,-1,1},                        {c,-1,1},                        {d,-1,1},                        {e,-1,1},                        {f,-1+i/4,-1+(i+1)/4}],         {i,0,7}]]      **EDIT:** The value for calc is given below:               calc[a,b,c,d,e,f] = (1.97531*10^15 (3. Q Cos[(3 Q)/20000] -           20000. Sin[(3 Q)/20000])^2)/(1.58025*10^24 + 6.32099*10^16 Q^2 +         Q^6 + (-1.58025*10^24 + 7.90123*10^15 Q^2 - 3.55556*10^8 Q^4) Cos[(          3 Q)/10000] + (-4.74074*10^20 Q - 2.96296*10^12 Q^3) Sin[(3 Q)/          10000])*         UnitStep[5/2 - a]^2 UnitStep[5/2 + a]^2 UnitStep[5 - b]^2 UnitStep[           5 + b]^2 UnitStep[5 - a - 1944 c] UnitStep[5 + a + 1944 c] UnitStep[           5 - b - 1944 d] UnitStep[5 + b + 1944 d] UnitStep[           40 + a - 1600 e] UnitStep[40 - a + 1600 e] UnitStep[           45/2 + b - 1600 f] UnitStep[45/2 - b + 1600 f] /. Q-> (8000000 \[Pi] Sin[               1/2 ArcCos[                 1/2 Sqrt[Cos[2 c] + Cos[2 d]] Sqrt[Cos[2 e] + Cos[2 f]] +                   Sin[c] Sin[e] + Sin[d] Sin[f]]])      There are two immediate things to note. First, there's a removable singularity at (c==e && d==f). I've also tried using a piecewise function to plug this discontinuity, but it doesn't seem to have a significant effect on the speed. One other thought that has come to mind is using the UnitSteps to directly find the range of integration. I hadn't done that before mostly out of laziness and the understanding that Mathematica automatically breaks up piecewise functions for integration, anyway.
