i heard that these(say for example Groovy) languages have the capability of changing the variable name or call methods dynamically in runtime! What you meant by **dynamic** languages? And what is the real need for changing any values during runtime? Is that doen't lead to confusion, because at runtime if you change any value(or your programming constriants change anything), then whats the need for compilation(because it decides and confirms these values will be used, then there is no meaning of changing it in dynamically)? And i know there should be something useful, so only people have introduced these concepts! I guess i'm clear about my question! And i need some brief explanation :)
