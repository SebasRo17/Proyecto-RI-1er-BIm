It seems to be both an interesting programming challenge and a very useful practical application to have a Mathematica program which would allow one to pretty-print Mathematica code, so that it is easy to read and understand. Some of the desirable features of such a program:   * Works both on string and box level   * Covers many or most common cases for Mathematica code   * Is robust   * Is customizable   * Is extensible Is this possible?
