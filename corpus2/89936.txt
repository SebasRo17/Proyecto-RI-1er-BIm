Most programmers have their own personal preferences for syntax-highlighting color schemes, but I've been wondering, has anyone ever done an actual scientific study on what the best color scheme would be? I imagine such a study would look at things like the readability of the code, whether the programmer's eyes are drawn to the most important parts, etc. Perhaps this was already done for something like the default Visual Studio theme, but I'd like to know if there are any publicly available studies out there, and what they found.
