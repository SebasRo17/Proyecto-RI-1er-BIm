My question is simple. I'm a developer and work with another developer who's been here for many more years than I have. He has his opinion about implementing stuff; he's more of a do it yourself kind of person. I'm more of a let's not re-invent the wheel kind of person. Recently for example we had a big discussion about how I think we should move to the cloud and how he thinks that we should keep an in-house solution for our servers (to host our websites). Or how I think Java is better suited for what we need, but he likes PHP so that's what we have to use. These are all arguments that people have on the web... some like the cloud, some don't... some like Java, some don't. And I'm totally ok with diverse opinion... however it's come to the point of being unproductive, and without a boss that knows about programming (our boss doesn't know anything about coding, he just manages us) that takes the position of making a decision, it's always a winner towards his opinion, because he's the more experienced developer... which I don't think is productive. Did you ever confront such a team issue? What do you think I should do? What is the best way to create a productive environment?
