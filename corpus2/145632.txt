I have read that doing a select case is often a code smell. There are cases however where an interface cannot solve my problem. For instance, I have a set of date filter objects (last 7 days, last year, ect.) that implement a IDateFilter interface. In another part of the code, I need to determine the type of date filter so that the chart properties can be set. I may want to use a different chart tick interval for instance depending on the date filter. The problem is I do not want to store this information in the date filter object as it is interface related and I do not want to couple the two. How could a select case be avoided in this instance? Other than using select case on gettype or creating some enumeration for all the types and then exposing the type and doing a select case on that, I do not see a clean way to do this? The decorator pattern comes to mind but even then I would still need a select case. Any ideas?               if (type = last 7 days)      set this property      else if (type = last year)      set this property to something different      I'm using asp net c# in case that makes a difference.
