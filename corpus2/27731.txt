I have two lists of $d$-dimensional coordinates, for example setting $d=3$ we might write:               L1 = {{1,2,3},{4,5,6},{7,8,9},{999,999,193}}     L2 = {{80,-10,-12},{1.1,2.4,3.1},{6.99,8.0435,8.999},{4,5.02,6.02}}      Here, some of the elements in $L_2$ are just the elements in $L_1$ perturbed in 3-space by some small amount (a MSD $\leq 0.5$), with the mapping $(1,2,3) \to (2,4,3)$ and where the coordinates at positions four in $L_1$ and one in $L_2$ do not having a mapping (i.e. there's not necessarily a bijection for the lists). Is there a simple "one-liner" in Mathematica 9 that allows us to compare two lists and return a list of points that satisfy some mapping criterion, e.g. Euclidean distance in the above example? Update - For the above example, setting the Euclidean distance to $R=1$ we'd specifically like to output: {{{1,2,3},{1.1,2.4,3.1}},{{4,5,6},{4,5.02,6.02}},{{7,8,9},{6.99,8.0435,8.999}}} (Elements can be in whatever order.) Could we do this for a set of more than two lists?
