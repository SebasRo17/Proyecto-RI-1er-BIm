Given C++('11) has lambdas now, will there be any LINQ like higher order function library officially supported later? Is there any such library now being used in any production level code? Obviously I'm not expecting the SQL-like expression tree based LINQ query syntax in C++. I am talking about the lambda based one. So, no new language feature in needed in C++'11, just a library will do.
