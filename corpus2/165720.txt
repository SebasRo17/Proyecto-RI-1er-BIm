I'm stating to work on a project that I intend to release as open source via the githubs. What are the advantages of putting the code on github from the outset, as opposed to waiting until the project is in a working state before publishing. If it matters, this particular project is a C# app/service, and I have only a free github account (so I can't make it private and then pull back the covers later)
