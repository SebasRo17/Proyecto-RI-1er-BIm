This question is purely from academic point of view. As part of the software engineering lab, a design document is to be created after generating the SRS. Is there any standard for creating the design document. Since we followed IEEE standard for creating the SRS. What all things can be included in the design document from the academic point of view? I am thinking of including different UML diagrams.
