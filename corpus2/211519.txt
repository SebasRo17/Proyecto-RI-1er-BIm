I am new to Branching and Merging but I have been tasked with making future development on an application possible while still allowing bug fixes to production. Usually I am the only developer on the application unless I am on leave. I have watched a Pluralsight video on Branching and done some forum/stack reading. I was hoping someone could take a look at my solution proposal and critique. I am concerned I will cause more problems than solutions if I get this wrong > As of Version 1.1.0.0 I have introduced a branching system for future > development. Version 1.1.0.0 is our production branch. No changes should > appear here except bug fixes. Version 1.2.0.0 is the next version and our > development branch. > > After completing a development, the development branch will merge to the > Application (trunk). The application will be deployed for testing. After > sign off the development branch becomes production, the previous version > branch will be removed. A new branch will be created for the next version. > > For bug fixing, the bugs are fixed against the production branch and merged > to the application so when the development branch merges down it also > obtains those fixes.
