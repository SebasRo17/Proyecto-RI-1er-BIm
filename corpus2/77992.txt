I currently consider myself to be a X language programmer (just using a variable here since this isn't about the language), I've invested time into learning the platform and like working with it. The other day, something dawned on me a bit in that when I go to search for openings (say on a job search engine), I would normall just type in "X language" "my city" and look through those. However, I got to thinking that I also have experience working with cloud infrastructure, for example, and maybe there are companies out there that want someone with cloud experience but who aren't yet decided on a specific language / platform so they could have sort of "open ended" listings that don't mention "X language" even though they may be open to using it if they found the right developer who wanted to work on that platform. I've been trying this method of looking for openings and have found a few so far that seem to fit what I was thinking (that they didn't mention specific languages or did so in a way that seemed non-commital / open-ended), I'm just curious what other's experiences are as to whether there are a number of companies out there that may do this where they are looking for a developer who can build a specific application rather than necessarily having already decided (and listed) the platform they use. The current job I found was where the guy called me and I ended up influencing the platform we use (since it was a greenfield project) so it just makes me wonder sometimes if I am not being open enough when I search. **Clarification:** I think the reason that I am asking this is because when dealing with recruiters they tend to obsessively focus on the language first and foremost, so if I say that I have primary experience in X platform and they want Y then they usually just assume its not a fit and tell you that they will let you know when they have X jobs available
