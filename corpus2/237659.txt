If I add the following in this order into a red-black tree:               tree.Put(7)     tree.Put(3)     tree.Put(1)                   7                  3             /   rotate(3)      / \            3    ----->        1   7           /          1      should I perform a right rotation after the insertion of `1` ? I am reading the algorithms bible but it the pseudocode doesn't indicate what to do.
