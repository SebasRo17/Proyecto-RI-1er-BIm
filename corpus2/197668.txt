I have sets of probing data from an internal monitoring tool which represent the availability of different services (databases, webservices and so on). Now my task is to visualize this data and I reached a point where I should make a decision concerning the data interpretation for the most recent data set. **Quick overall definition** , each data set reflects the given status at the time when it was verified and the probing intervals vary from service to service, so there is no constant time window. Hence if there is an interval of e.g. five minutes between set A and B, for these five minutes (assuming with B there is a change) the status of A is always assumed. So far no problem, my question now however is what should be assumed for the time between **now** and the **most recent** data. I see two solutions   * Only visualize data up until the most recent check, and ignore the passed time since then or   * Assume the status from the most recent check is still valid up until now (like between two given data entries) I could see arguments for both and hope someone can point me in the right direction as to which approach would be the most logical one.
