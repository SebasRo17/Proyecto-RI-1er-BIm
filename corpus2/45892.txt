ListAnimate is fairly similar to Manipulate, but while Manipulate has a simple way to request an initial value for the manipulation parameter, I haven't found a way to tell ListAnimate to start with a certain value. Consider a simple example:               ListAnimate[Table[Plot[Sin[p x], {x, -1, 1}], {p, 1, 4}]]        vs.               Manipulate[Plot[Sin[p x], {x, -1, 1}], {p, Range[1, 4]}]        These simple examples seem virtually the same (I didn't bother to change the Manipulate Control to a slider), but in fact, they are different. ListAnimate is essentially pre-compiled. In my research, I want to do something similar with very complex plots which take a long time to produce. Manipulate re- calculates it's arguments when the manipulator is adjusted. We don't notice it here because Sin[p x] is so trivial. But with a complicated plot, it's no good. Conversely, with ListAnimate, it may take 15 minutes or more to run the code, once and for all, and then I can quickly scan through all the output smoothly. I looked through the options for ListAnimate and, for example, I can begin the output paused with ,AnimationRunning -> False. Is there a way to make the animation begin with not the first element but a chosen one? **TL;DR** Make               ListAnimate[Table[Plot[Sin[p x], {x, -1, 1}], {p, 1, 4}], AnimationRunning -> False]        begin with output of Plot[Sin[ **3** x], {x, -1, 1}]
