I have come across many situations where I had to build a system for a library or a clinic or other popular domains.   The thing is a domain model for a library was probably done 1000 times already with different level of details of course. Here is an example. Is there a popular website or community where one can find ready made domain models for popular systems?   The whole purpose I'm trying to achieve is to quickly get a grasp of the domain I'm modelling and customise it to my needs. Re-inventing the wheel seems really absurd when the same system might have been modelled properly previously. **Note**   I know Google might sound like the perfect source, but it will better if there is a repository out there that people can post there models, so that others can share them.
