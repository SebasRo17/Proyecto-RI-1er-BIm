To many of you this will sound like a ridiculous question, but I am asking because **I have little to no experience with ASP.Net Webforms** \- I went straight to ASP.Net MVC. I am now working on a project where we are limited to .Net 2.0 and Visual Studio 2005. I liked the clean separation of concerns when working with ASP.Net MVC, and am looking for something to make webforms less unbearable. Are there any recommended patterns or practices for people who prefer asp.net MVC, but are stuck on .net 2.0 and visual studio 2005?
