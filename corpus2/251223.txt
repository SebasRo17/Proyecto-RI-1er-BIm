Being a small department of developers, it's not uncommon for us to outsource projects. We have a set of companies that we really like to work with, very reliable and good local people who appreciate the work. This has happened a couple times, most recently today: **We receive a project, set it up in our environment, and notice an issue. Due to them not being able to provide a solution in time, we're forced to find a solve internally. Then the vendor, who we pay very well, will sometimes ask how we solved the problem.** Again, this is a rarity, and we have a great relationship with these guys, but I do have some inkling that I should not be handing out the answers to a resource which we're paying. How should I handle this? Do I set aside my ego and just say "Thanks for doing a great job, here's your $30k and we finished the project for you by doing this one thing your company was unable to do but now can charge us more to do next time"? Is it appropriate to tell them I can't give them "company" code/etc? Would this tarnish our relationship?
