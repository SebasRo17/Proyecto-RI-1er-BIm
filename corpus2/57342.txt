There are a few Mathematica users beside myself that are running it on a Raspberry Pi, and we found out it does not always perform the same as the Desktop version [1][2]. During the testing of the prerelease it became obvious that some of the functions are too complex for the not-very-fast [3][4] Pi. So Wolfram decided to omit them from the Pi release branch. Which functions are omitted is not currently documented, so I'd like to find out this on my own.
