When trying to do symbolic calculations in mathematica involving a space of dimension `n`, which is arbitrary but fixed, I'd often like to work with vectors that have arbitrary but fixed length `n`. So I'd like to have a vector defined like `vec = Array[v,n]`, which of course does only work if `n` has been initialized with an integer value before. I'd then like to apply some differential operators like let's say `D[vec,v[2]]`. Does anybody know an elegant way to do that (maybe using the new Inactive construct in Mathematica 10)? p.s.: Interestingly enough mathematica supports sums of arbitrary length, which for example enables the following kind of symbolic computation:               x /: D[x[i_], x[j_], NonConstants -> {x}] := KroneckerDelta[i, j];     D[Sum[x[i], {i, 1, n}], x[2], NonConstants -> x];      which yields the correct result: > Piecewise[{{1, n > 1}}, 0]
