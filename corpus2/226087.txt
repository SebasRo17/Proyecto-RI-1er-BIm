Imagine you have a tool that's much faster than another one (built-in, alternative). You want to mention this in the description of the tool so people can see the point of your tool existing. By comparison, I mean say 40x faster, and when the data set gets large, the performance gain increases even more, say 70x. I didn't want to use "orders of magnitude faster", because that to me implies it's a few times faster. How can I convey this message in a good, understandable manner? Also I thought of using numbers but then like I said, as the data set becomes larger, so the performance gain. Should I just say mine runs in linear time? Not sure if I can verify that.
