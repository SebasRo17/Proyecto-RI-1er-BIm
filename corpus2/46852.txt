I want to find all non zero elements of a table and I want to create a list that contains the name of the table the element was removed from, the position of the element, and the value of the element. Then to the generated list I would like to apply a replacment rule to the row and the column.               rule = {1 -> "a", 2 -> "b", 3 -> "c"}          { {tablename, row, col, value} }      For example I have tried               dataTable1 = {{1,0,0}, {0,1,0}, {0,0,-1}}           Position[Abs[dataTable1], # > 0 &]      but I am unable to get get the position. I would like the final out put to be                { {"dataTable1", 1,1,1}, {"dataTable1", 2,2,1}, {"dataTable1", 3,3,-1} }      If we apply the replacment.                 { {"dataTable1", 1,1,1}, {"dataTable1", 2,2,1}, {"dataTable1", 3,3,-1} } /. rule       Then the output should be                { {"dataTable1", "a","a",1}, {"dataTable1", "b","b",1}, {"dataTable1", "c","c",-1} }
