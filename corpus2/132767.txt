We've had a lot of success in our company with the iOS apps that we have made that we are now looking at branching out and offering our services to people who want iPhone/iPad applications made for them or their company. What options do we have for deployment scenarios? If they want it up on the app store than this is quite easy and we will just submit it in the normal process. But what clauses do people put on these contracts because I know Apple still holds all the cards and could decline an app in the end if it doesnt suit their guidelines (which can be unclear sometimes). What if the customer does not want to deploy it to the app store but just want an in-house app? Is it on the customer than to purchase an Apple developer/enterprise license allowing them to do Ad hoc deployments to devices and we just supply them the application?
