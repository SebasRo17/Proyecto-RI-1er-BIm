The image below represents a human subject fixations while observing this abstract pattern for 3 seconds. I would like to know how much time they spent looking at the actual disk. That is a red point within a Black Disk. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GcxFx.png) Each fixations (each sublist of "fixations" below is coded as such : {{X,Y},Duration in ms}                fixations=      {{{20.3899, 14.8931}, 238}, {{27.0063, 18.8899},428},        {{25.8113, 24.8679}, 377}, {{24.2579, 22.022},106},        {{25.3208, 24.022}, 130}, {{21.739, 12.1792},175},        {{29.2673, 8.88994}, 295}, {{30.3868, 17.6572},160},        {{31.217, 22.6761}, 145}, {{22.9686, 20.6918},155},        {{19.6321, 20.2704}, 145}}      Each Disk is coded as {X,Y,R}                Disks=      {{22.8176, 19.9696, 0.974938}, {29.5314, 10.7197, 0.974938},        {17.5112,19.7207, 0.974938}, {30.8997, 23.2454, 0.974938},       {28.0588,6.09759, 0.974938}, {30.8524, 17.0661, 1.53205},        {21.0393, 10.7137,1.53205}, {25.451, 25.1336, 1.53205}}      How could I : -Count the number of fixations that are within a disk. -Then how much actual time they spent there.  The only solution I thought about was to compute the EuclideanDistance of each fixation to each disk but I feel there is a smarter faster way to do this. THank You for your attention.
