There are a two main codebase structures that I have seen when it comes to MVC frameworks. The problem is that they both seem to have an organisational bug that goes with them. **Standard MVC**               /controller     /model     /view      _Problem: No separation of related components (forum, blog, user, etc..)_ **Modular MVC**               /blog         /controller         /model         /view     /user         /controller         /model         /view     /forum         /controller         /model         /view      Picking the module-based system leaves you with a problem.   * Long names (Forum_Model_Forum = forum/model/forum.php) (Like Zend)   * File system searches using `is_file()` to find which folder has the forum model? (Like Kohana) **Are their any other MVC structures that work well when trying to separate different modules?** Are there benefits from these structures that I'm missing?
