While tinkering with the code in the Falling Matrix question, I was hoping to improve the rendering speed by making the rasterizations of the text grayscale. I changed the base color of the text to white and left the background black. However, this did not yield a grayscale raster. The problem seems to be that _Mathematica_ tries to help with the readability of text by using special antialiasing schemes. Consider the following test:               GraphicsRow[      Rasterize[#, Background -> Black, RasterSize -> 15,          ImageSize -> 150] & /@ {Style["\[FilledCircle]", White],         Graphics[{White, Disk[]}]}]      ![Antialiased disk test](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wbpaL.png) Interesting and (I think) undocumented, but the relevant question for me is: How can I control or eliminate this behavior? Adding a `ColorConvert[#,"Grayscale"]` or just taking the `Norm`s of the `ImageData` gives an acceptable result but is pretty slow.
