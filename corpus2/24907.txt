Consider a second order differential equation with a potential that diverges at some generic value in the variable. For example: $$-y^{\prime\prime}(s)+\frac1{\mathrm{cn}{(s\mid k^2)}}y(s)=0$$ where $\mathrm{cn}(s\mid k^2)$ is the `JacobiCN[s, k^2]` function. Now, suppose, the differential equation has to be solved on the interval of a full period, namely $s\in[0,2\mathbb{K}]$, where $\mathbb{K}$ is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind `EllipticK[k^2]`, with the initial conditions $y(0)=0$ and $y^\prime(0)=1$. If I just naÃ¯vely start the `NDSolve` function for, say, $k^2=0.7$:               NDSolve[{-y''[s] + y[s]/JacobiCN[s, 0.7] == 0, y[0] == 0, y'[0] == 1},       y[s], {s, 0, 2 EllipticK[0.7]}]      _Mathematica_ rightfully complains that a singularity is detected at half of the evaluation range, namely at the value `s = EllipticK[k^2] = 2.07536`: > NDSolve::ndsz: At s == 2.0753631352632516`, step size is effectively zero; > singularity or stiff system suspected. And also the resulting interpolating function terminates at this value:               {{y[s] -> InterpolatingFunction[{{0., 2.07536}},<>][s]}}      So, evidently, the solution does not overcome the point of singularity and is given only for the half of the required interval. I heard that there are numerical techniques to overcome singularities when solving differential equations. It makes me wonder that _Mathematica_ does not activate these by default. What can I do to solve a differential equation beyond a singularity numerically in _Mathematica_?
