I'm brand new to Mathematica and having trouble finding a solution for Lh based on the first order condition. I'm not sure if it is something I'm doing in Mathematica or something wrong with the equations. Any suggestions?               Utility[x_] = (((x - Eta)^(1 - Theta))/(1 - Theta))     Harvest[Lh_] = (Lh)^Beta     Livestock[Nt_] = Nt*(1 + b - Delta*(T*Nt)/(L - Lh))     constraint = P*Harvest[Lh] - Alpha*Livestock[N]     Langragian = Utility[Livestock[N]] + Lambda*constraint     {FOC1 = D[Langragian, Lh],       FOC2 = D[Langragian, Lambda]}     sols = Solve[{FOC1 == 0, FOC2 == 0}, {Lh, Lambda}]
