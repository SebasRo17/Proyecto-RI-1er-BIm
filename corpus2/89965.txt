From time to time, I realize that files that haven't been modified have been checked out by my Visual Studio. It's either because I changed something and undid it, or just because Visual Studio decided to check out the file for no obvious reasons (eg if you modify the code of a winform, Visual Studio will automatically checkout the associated .Designer.cs for you) Since I have the habit of making a diff of all my checkins, It would be a nice time-saver to be able to spot them at a glance (or event to automatically perform undo checkout on those) Did someone find a solution to this?
