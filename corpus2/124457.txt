I used to develop in Django/Python and Rails/Ruby (and before that C/C++ and C#), and I'm now at a job where we do enterprise Java development (Spring, Hibernate, RESTEasy, Maven, etc.) for web applications and web services. Coming from the Convention over Configuration world, what's the best way to get up to speed doing enterprise Java web services development? I know Java (the language) well, and I've written GUIs in Swing and basic JSP before, but nothing of the kind I'm doing now. Are there any recommended tutorials to get up to speed on popular Java enterprise development tutorials?
