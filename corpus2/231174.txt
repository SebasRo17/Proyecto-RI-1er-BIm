In my test environment we are running the same set of integration (and sometimes unit) tests against different systems that have different capabilities.   Some of the tests cannot be executed against some of the systems because a feature that enables this scenario is missing or we need completely different behavior.   Currently we are using MSTest and have tests with this pattern:               [TestMethod]     public void TestMethod1()     {         if(targetSystem.SupportsFeatureX == false)             Assert.Inconclusive("Not supported by underlying system");         // the code for the actual test follows     }      Should we mark the test as `Inconclusive` or just let it `Pass` if the feature check is not satisfied?   Please note that `targetSystem` is a third party system that we have no control over so we just live with features that are present.
