I'm a tech lead for a small team. One of the major tasks on my plate is communicating with the client. One thing I find particularly difficult is dealing with deadlines because they are mandated by the client and I'm frequently not consulted. Usually, the interaction follows the following pattern. The client comes up with a feature they want to add, Feature X. Feature X would look good in the next week's app release that is about 6 business days away. At this point, the feature request needs to go through approval and there are frequently other dependencies that need to be deal with. Eventually, N days later, the feature request trickles down to my team. Even if the original dead line (that was set by a non-developer manager) was achievable it no longer is. My team is blamed, ~~feels discouraged and there's an overall atmosphere of defeat~~ , I feel discouraged and defeated. Clearly the overall process is broken. Unfortunately, there's not much I can do because I'm not in a position of power here. My current approach is to gently remind the client about our start date versus the deadline, the scope of the Feature, etc. This feels a lot like I am making excuses though. Have you guys been in similar situations? What has/hasn't worked for you?
