In chapter 2 of the book **WPF4 Unleashed** the author shows an example of how XAML processes type conversion. He states that               <SolidColorBrush>White</SolidColorBrush>      is equivalent to               <SolidColorBrush Color="White"/>      , because a string can be converted into a `SolidColorBrush` object. But how is that enough? It doesn't make sense to me. How does XAML know to which property should the value `White` be assigned?
