I want to get the Pixel value of an image.and here is my code               DynamicModule[{p = {50, 50}},       {Show[img, Graphics[Locator[Dynamic[p]]]],                       ImageValue[img, Dynamic[p]]}]      and it came up with a warning that p is with a non integer value, to solve the problem ,I used `Floor` to get an integer value               DynamicModule[{p = {50, 50}},       {Show[img, Graphics[Locator[Dynamic[p]]]],                       ImageValue[img,Floor/@Dynamic[p]]}]      this time it still doesnt work, with a warning:                   ImageValue::imgrng: The specified argument Floor[p$20303] should be a pair of real or      integer numbers or a list of those.      My question is ,can I strict the loactor to Integer Domain?or is there any more elegent way to deal with this problem?
