I'm a programmer but also have worked as an archivist. As archivist it's a lot about keeping data. I often get into arguments with colleagues when it comes to operations on data. I don't like the U and the D in CRUD too much. Rather then update a record I prefer to add a new one and have a reference to the old record. That way you build a history of changes. I also don't like deleting records but rather mark them as inactive. Is there a term for this? Basically only creating and reading data? Are there examples of this approach?
