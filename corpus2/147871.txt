I am aware of the C++ Virtual Table which allows dynamic dispatch for doing things at runtime (although if I am honest I am not completely sure of the full list of things it achieves). I am wondering what other "low level" aspects of C++ are there, which one doesnt usually come across when learning the C++ language? Things like: -How is multithreading and locking on objects performed? -Overloading/overwriting functions -Generics Are there other "structures", similar to the vtable, which assist with these types of things on a lower level? (and if anyone can help with what the VTable actually does it would be most appreciated!)
