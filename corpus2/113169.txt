Ya !! you can say "out of work" people have these thoughts, but then, what can one do :-P . My question is somewhat deep thought. How can someone evaluate himself as a developer and manager to understand whether or not, he is fit for starting a commercial venture on his own. Starting a development company doesn't need too much of an investment and neither it requires a big team. If one is capable developer, then he can definitely get the ball rolling on day one. And may be that's the reason why there are so many freelancers around the world. Doubts are severe thing and once they creep-in, they make travel tough. So, can there be some things or self-assessment kinda test that one must evaluate and pass to boost his idea of development venture.
