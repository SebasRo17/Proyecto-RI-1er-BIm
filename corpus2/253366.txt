Just wanted to ask all you programming pro's these Q's. I am no spring chicken I am 36. I have been learning python and visual basic for about 2 years now and enjoy it a lot. I never got into programming before and regret not doing so as I find I enjoy it a lot. I know if I had found out how much I liked it and took to it years ago I certainly would have pursued it a lot earlier. I have never worked in programming or even IT before I have always worked in manual laboring jobs and am wondering if I could try and get work as a programmer once my programming knowledge is better in 1 or 2 years which will put me in my late 30's. Would this be too old to try and get work in the field? I am really only after anything I can get and know I won't be working for EA Games or something. I hope I could be a 'junior' somewhere despite the embarassement at my age. Starting so late in the field with no experience has me very worried that I would not be taken seriously. My programmer friend says you can start any age as long as you know what you doing, but I have heard different again. As much as I want to work as a programmer I really don't want to spend more time learning more programming only to find myself not even considered by employers because I'm too old and inexperienced and not some young University hotshot. What should I do? others say there is online opportunities which could potentially be used as experience, but is there? please help me out.
