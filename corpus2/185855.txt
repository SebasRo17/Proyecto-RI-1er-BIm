So I have a program I'm worked on back in 2011 and all through 2012, but the last release was in December of _2011_. I've been actively working on it, but feature creep lured its ugly head and now it is filled with tons on unfinished features. The bad part is that as I implement a feature, a new one creeps in. What can I do to avoid feature creep in the future so I can **actually get a release out** in over a _year_? The project is based around iOS and used to have releases around each iOS version update, but the last one was back with 5.1 (2011). I would like to be able to get that steady release cycle back, but it has proven too difficult.
