I am sending my CV to different companies and some of them have replied asking me to complete a test to have an idea of my skills. I wonder if the time to respond to this email is key factor for being selected? I have a job now and I need to take my spare time to answer that questions. So, I don't know if I should take time to respond the questions carefully or try to respond them in the same day, even is that implies not to sleep too much that night.
