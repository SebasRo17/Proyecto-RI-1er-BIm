As stated in the documentation of `GeoRegionValuePlot`: > The _reg_ can be Entity objects such as countries corresponding to extended > geographic regions, or geometric constructs with GeoPosition coordinates. However, the code as follows doesn't work:               GeoRegionValuePlot[{GeoDisk[GeoPosition[{48, 5}], 100000] -> 3.4, GeoDisk[GeoPosition[{49, 6}], 200000] -> 5.4}, Frame -> True]      result: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cCoaz.png) Obviously, _Mathematica_ recognized the GeoDisk as a GeoPosition rather than a geometric construct. Is this a bug? Or is there anything I happened to miss?
