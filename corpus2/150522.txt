I'm going to work on some project that would do a user-action recognition based on what he/she does in the system. As far as I understand there are two main parts here: Intercept the user actions (say http traffic in web/ui interaction in thick- client) analysis of user intentions. While the first part is rather technical and therefor easy to implement, the second one is AI related and can be academic. So I was wondering whether someone knows some third-parties/academic projects that would implement the 'action-recognition' stuff?
