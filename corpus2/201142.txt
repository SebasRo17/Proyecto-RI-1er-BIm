I am an Android developer, while I am developing a new project I often find I need to import a library project, so in every new project I need to to copy my library project and then I can add. Is there any better way to have single copy of my library project which I can then import into every one of my other projects without copying the same (library) project over and over again? I am using BitBucket.org to host my code.
