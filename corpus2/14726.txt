Basically I have a matrix and when I used either `Eigenvalue` or `Eigensystem`, it doesn't output nonreal eigenvalues, instead it leaves it in the form of $$\sqrt{-1}^{1/3}$$ or something in terms of $\sqrt{-1}$ The matrix I have is > >     F = {{-1/4, 1/4 + 1/Sqrt[2], -1/2 + 1/(2  Sqrt[2])}, >          {1/4 - 1/Sqrt[2], -1/4, -1/2 - 1/(2 Sqrt[2])}, >          {-1/2 - 1/(2 Sqrt[2]), -1/2 + 1/(2 Sqrt[2]), 1/2}} >   I am trying to diagonalize this. **EDIT** Adding `Simplify` seems to have solved half of the problem, it displays the eigenvectors in complex numbers, but the eigenvalues still in unsimplified form.
