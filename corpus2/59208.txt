I am working on large datasets of size $10\times 10^6$ and would like to visualize these in _Mathematica_ , but they take lot of time to plot. How can I speed it up? I also want to save the plots as PDFs. Here is the equivalent _MATLAB_ code, which is fast                n=16000000;      x=([-(n/2)+1:1:n/2]*0.5);      y=([-(n/2)+1:1:n/2]*2.5);      plot(x,y)      In _Mathematica_               n = 16000000;     x = Range[-(n/2), n/2]*0.5;     y = Range[-(n/2), n/2]*2.5;     ListLinePlot[{x, y}\[Transpose], PlotRange -> All]
