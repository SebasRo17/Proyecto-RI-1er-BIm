I'm trying to generate a mesh for later use in the Finite Element Method of the `DSolve` command. It is basically a parallelepiped with a spherical indentation. I'm trying to generate the mesh as follows:               Needs["NDSolve`FEM`"]     region = ImplicitRegion[!(Norm[{x, y, z}] < 1), {{x, -5, 5}, {y, -5, 5}, {z, 0, 5}}];     mesh = ToElementMesh[region];     Show[mesh["Wireframe"], PlotRange -> {{-2, 2}, {-2, 2}, {0, 1}}]      However, as you an see on the picture below this produces a really irregular and inaccurate (as I think) mesh for the spherical part. Is there a way to improve it and to generate more and homogeneously distributed elements on the spherical part? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YAC8D.png)
