It always happen to me that if I leave the stuff for 1-2 months I forget the stuff. 5 months back I had symfony project and I did that. At that time I was very much confident that I can do any project in symfony2. Then we got one Python project in django and I worked full time on that for few months. But now when I had to fix the error in symfony2, I completely forgot the structure and I keep mixing python stuff with php symfony. I want to know that how people work with different languages at same time. Should I need to keep studying all languages at same time so that I don't forget? I am confused what should I do. Or whenever I do some project then I keep notes of each and every step so that I can follow that later on how I did it?
