I'm aware of how to align a system of equations on the = sign (or other single alignment point), but I'd like to align a system at multiple points so that each variable stays in its own "column" so to speak. This is especially an issue if some variables have a 0 coefficient in some equations. I'd like to extend this idea to typesetting a linear programming problem such as this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bYcQm.png) I use \alignat in LaTeX for this, but am trying to write more in Mathematica and would like to learn how to do it there. Thanks!
