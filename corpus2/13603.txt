I need to create a simple user interface to choose one file in the notebook directory, import it and execute some functions on the imported data. For the first version I created this code:               Button["get File Path",      fileData = Import@SystemDialogInput["FileOpen", NotebookDirectory[]];      ];      function[fileData]      Now I want it to be a little bit more error proof, so if you cancel your selection, you don't get an error, and the rest of your code is not executed.               Button["get File Path",     fileData=Quiet@Check[Import@SystemDialogInput["FileOpen",NotebookDirectory[]],$Canceled]         ]         If[fileData!=$Canceled,function[fileData]]      I don't feel that it is the best practice for this kind of situation. Some clue to make the code more intelligent? Maybe with `Module`, `DynamicModule`, `Return` or something else?
