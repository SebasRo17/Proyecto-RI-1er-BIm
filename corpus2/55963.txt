Condsider               function = Tan[1 x] + Tan[2 x]     Plot[function, {x, 0, 1.5}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/AxM3L.png) It has a strong discontinuity around 0.8. The problem is , if I want to find `function==0`, Mathematica will not only find the real root `x~1.1` , but also a artifact root `x~0.8` Because I think Mathematica created a line around the discontinuity. A single point the has its y value of all values, which I call "a point that is every point". To make this obvious, let me make a Contour Plot:               ContourPlot[function + 2*y == 0, {x, 0, 1.5}, {y, 0, 1.5}, PlotPoints -> 100]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cQMf0.png) We know that only curved line represents real roots. The constant line is the artifact. In fact, if you plot contour for `function + 2*y == 1` or `function + 2*y == 2`, this artifact line remains. Of course, since it is a point that is every point:               ContourPlot[function + 2*y == 1, {x, 0, 1.5}, {y, 0, 1.5}, PlotPoints -> 100]     ContourPlot[function + 2*y == 2, {x, 0, 1.5}, {y, 0, 1.5}, PlotPoints -> 100]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7CWfd.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Uzfzm.png) So, how to solve the problem in Contour Plot if function to plot has a strong discontinuity that Mathematica tries wrongly (hard) to connect.
