Advanced compilers like `gcc` compile codes into machine readable files according to the language in which the code has been written (e.g. C, C++, etc). In fact, they interpret the meaning of each codes according to library and functions of the corresponding languages. Correct me if I'm wrong. I wish to better understand compilers by writing a very basic compiler (probably in C) to compile a static file (e.g. Hello World in a text file). I tried some tutorials and books, but all of them are for practical cases. They deal with compiling dynamic codes with meanings connected with the corresponding language. How can I write a basic compiler to convert a static text into a machine readable file? The next step will be introducing variables into the compiler; imagine that we want to write a compiler which compile only some functions of a language. Introducing practical tutorials and resources is highly appreciated :-)
