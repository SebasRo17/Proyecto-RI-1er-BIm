I am a final year undergraduate student of Information Technology. My team and I have taken up "Sign Language Recognition" as our Final Year Project. We have just started with it and we are in the phase of information gathering (gathering data). We plan to use Instrumented Gloves as the input device. But we do not have much knowledge in the area. Also, we came across the following methods for training the system for actual recognition of gestures and hence sign language.   1. Neural Networks   2. Symbolic Learning Algorithms   3. Hidden Markov Models   4. Instance Based Learning   5. Grammar based techniques Please tell me which of them I should use for sign recognition. Also, tell me about Instrumented Gloves and is there any specific variety which we should choose for our project?
