I'm a recent graduate with a degree in computer science and I was wondering if I should list a website I created as experience on my resume. The website wasn't technical in nature, mainly just demotivational posters and comedic lists of things. It did, however, garner 2,000 - 4,000 page views a day on average. _**Positives_**   * I personally wrote HTML/CSS/JavaScript for parts of the site   * I acquired some skills involving analytics and advertising, as well as how to reach an audience via social media _**Negatives_**   * General quality and type of content on the site I should probably mention that the site no longer exists. The Wayback Machine is the only way an employer could actually see the site. As far as content goes, I was a bit vague. The best comparison I can come up with is that it had content that would be along the same lines as what Cracked.com has now.
