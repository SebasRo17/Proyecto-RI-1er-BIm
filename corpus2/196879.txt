Is there any possibility to automate/semi-automate deployments of ASP.NET web applications using Jenkins. It can be under controlled or uncontrolled environments, for uncontrolled user needs to enter userid and password. I am looking out for ways to copy the files from target to destination and run sql scripts in web farm scenario. **Edit** Currently we are using bat files to xcopy/configure app pool/sql cmd, etc to deploy the application. But for this to work, production support team needs to download the source code, build the project and run the bat files to deploy the application. Now, we want to automate the deployment without user downloading the source code and end user just needs to visit a url and fill userid and password parameters and select svn tag and it should get deployed. But Jenkins is running under anonymous login, so the existing bat file will not work since it doesn't have permissions to run the script. So, I would like to know if there exists any alternatives for this kind of situation. It will be good if user context is impersonated by using entered userid and password allowing existing batch file to run without further changes. If it is not possible, we would like to explore other ideas too but we don't have flexibility to choose a automated tool like puppet, etc, we should stick around with these batch files.
