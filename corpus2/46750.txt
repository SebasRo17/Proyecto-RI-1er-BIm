I am attempting to re-create a Mathieu stability diagram like the one shown here: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/A2oCf.png) I expected that I could use `MathieuC` to generate this graph by assuming that instability occurs when the function returns a complex number, so I try               Quiet@DiscretePlot[Re@a /. FindRoot[MathieuC[a, q, 1], {a, 0.2}], {q, 0, 1, 0.1}]      which is wrong for two reasons - it produces a plot not even close to the desired output and the output is dependent on what value I use for z (in the example above, 1). For those interested, the impetus behind this problem is to explore how Mathematica can be used to simulate the behavior of a quadrupole mass spectrometer.
