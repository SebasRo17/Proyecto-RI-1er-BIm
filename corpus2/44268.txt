Try this:               DynamicModule[{foo = \[Placeholder]}, foo]      Note how we're able to edit the placeholder in the output, _e.g._ replace it with 42:     ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4BquZ.png) Now, try this:               DynamicModule[{foo = \[Placeholder]}, Dynamic@foo]      This time, I'm only able to edit _one_ character:     ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1ZrG9.png) **What's going on internally, that explains this behavior?** At first, I thought maybe upon the first "touching" of a Dynamic portion of an output expression, the entire expression somehow "locks up." But, that can't be the case—I can edit that "4" as much as I'd like—I just can't remove or add any characters. Next, I compared the two expressions' `FullForm`s, keeping in mind that the very act of typing the first `/` in the output cell might have an effect on the expression:     ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PXOMv.png) But I'm not sure what to make of the difference. Does it have something to do with `ImageSizeCache`? Still, why and how would something enforce the presence of a strictly one-character atom? I'm on $Mathematica$ 9.0.1.0.
