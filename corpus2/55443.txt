IÂ´m trying to obtain the convex hull (with transparent faces) of a small number of points. I would like the Plot to have   * the points shown with small spheres   * numbers 1, 2, 3, ... along the axes  Here is what I have tried.               p = {{2, 1, 6}, {4, 3, 0}, {5, 2, 5}, {3, 5, 4}}     ListPointPlot3D[p, PlotStyle -> {Red, "Sphere", Large},        PlotRange -> {{0, 6}, {0, 6}, {0, 6}}, AxesLabel -> Automatic]      Could you help me.
