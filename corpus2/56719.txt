I have the following equation               eq = Sum[x^2, {x, 0, 10}]      and an image `image = Import["http://creativity103.com/collections/Graphic/rainbowbars.jpg"]`. How might I output a transparent version of the equation above with the image used as a **tile** for the text. For example I'm looking for something similar to this gradient image expect for the text above. **Edit: it wasn't very clear in the question, but I am looking to tile the background image if possible.** ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SXSf7.png)
