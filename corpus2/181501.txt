I presume it's that way so it could be extended with custom algorithms, but wouldn't it be more convenient to apply, let's say, factory method pattern here and avoid the whole `NoSuchAlgorithmException` thing? Something like:               MessageDigest.getMD5Algorithm();      or               MessageDigest.getInstance(DigestAlgorithmFactory.getMD5Algorithm())      I'm guessing there's a bigger picture here, but I just can't see it.
