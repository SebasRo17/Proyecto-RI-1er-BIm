Stability limits for Runge–Kutta methods in the complex ΩΔt-plane are needed to be plotted like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/EQ5hC.png) For example, let `P=1+z` where `z` is complex. Under the stability condition `|P|<=1`, the plot line should be that of RK-1 in the given plot. Similarly, if `P=1+z+1/2*z^2`, then when `|P|<=1` the plotting line is the corresponding of RK-2. I am trying to code `P=1+z` like this:               Clear[yRe, yIm, w, NP, k, ϕ]     a = 1;     zexp = a*(Cos[ϕ] + I*Sin[ϕ]) + 1     xp[ϕ_Real, a_Real] = Abs@zexp*Cos[ϕ];     yp[ϕ_Real, a_Real] = Abs@zexp*Sin[ϕ]     NP = 30;     For[k = 1, k <= NP, k++,      w = 2.*Pi*(k - 1)/NP;      yRe[k] = xp[ϕ, a] /. {ϕ -> w};      yIm[k] = yp[ϕ, a] /. {ϕ -> w};      ]     yRe = Table[yRe[k], {k, 1, NP}];     yIm = Table[yIm[k], {k, 1, NP}];     pointsz = Transpose[{yRe, yIm }];          pic1 = ListPlot[pointsz, AxesOrigin -> {0, 0},        PlotStyle -> Directive[Thick, Black, PointSize[Large]],        AxesStyle -> Directive[Black, 15],        AxesLabel -> {"Re(ωΔt)",          "Im(ωΔt)"}, AspectRatio -> Automatic]      The resulted plot as following is not correct. The truth is like RK-1 in the above figure. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Qyrfs.png) How can i get the correct plot lines of RK-1 and RK-2 using Mathematica? Thanks.
