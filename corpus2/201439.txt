I am not sure if there is an obvious answer to this, but this question has somewhat baffled me from the first time I started thinking about it. My university's IT department educates managers and IT leaders with the slogan that "IT leaders will be able to perform their job better if they have an understanding of how the technology works". This course includes multiple technical classes alongside the typical business related classes. However, what I have started to notice is that the students that apply for this course have either a very lacking understanding of IT, or dislike technological classes such as software engineering and programming, and as thus get very poor exam results. This begs the question: Why would someone with no interest in deeper understanding of technology want to work as an IT leader? Or magnitudes more importantly; Why would anyone working as a developer want to have a boss who has no understanding whatsoever of what they're actually leading? It just feels very wrong to have someone lead you who lacks the experience of understanding why certain things are better done in certain ways. IT leaders who never programmed or cared about it won't understand why concepts such as technical debt really hurts and why it is important to avoid. To quote Uncle Bob: "A system architect should also be a programmer, that way they get to experience the mess they make for everybody else."
