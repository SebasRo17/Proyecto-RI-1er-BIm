How to use the UTM coordinate system (northing, easting) in Mathematica using the built-in functions (`GeoPositionENU`, `GeoGridPosition`, etc.). There are UTM Zones implemented in Mathematica, e.g.:               GeoProjectionData["UTMZone33"]      gives               {"TransverseMercator", {"Centering" -> {0, 15},   "CentralScaleFactor" -> 1, "GridOrigin" -> {0, 0},   "ReferenceModel" -> "WGS84"}}      From N45, E15 one should get Easting 500000 and Northing 4982950.4 (zone 33), but I can't reproduce it.               GeoGridPosition[GeoPosition[{45, 15, 0}, "WGS84"], "UTMZone33"]      gives               GeoGridPosition[{0., 4.98494*10^6, 0}, "UTMZone33"]      (Easting offset 500000 is understandable - default, but Northing is way off.) Any help would be appreciated.
