I'm debating the value of putting remote disable (or destruct) functions into my software before delivering it to clients... As a hypothetical example, consider the development of a Silverlight app where you're worried about the client not paying you. You create a function which when a specific query string is entered it deletes everything in the database. Destroying data might be a bit of an extreme example. Making the application either partially or completely unusable would be another example. What are the benefits and risks of doing this? If you've done it, why did you do it, and how did you go about it?
