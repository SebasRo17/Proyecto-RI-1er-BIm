Over the years I have assigned values to classes and html elements in all sorts of ways:   * myClass   * MyClass   * my_class   * my-class . . .and so on. As I am always trying to hone my craft and make my code more readable for others, I am going to discipline myself to stick to one convention moving forward. I am leaning towards all lower case and hyphenated, but that is a purely subjective choice. So I wanted the input of the SE community--is there a standard or recommended convention already in place? Thanks!
