I'm pulling my hair out with this one. I have two complex functions f and g, ρ is real.               f = (-1)^(2/3) + 3/4 (1 - I Sqrt[3]) ρ -1/2 Sqrt[-(1 + (-1)^(1/3))^2 ρ (-4 + 3 ρ)];     g = (-1)^(2/3) + 3/4 (1 - I Sqrt[3]) ρ + 1/2 Sqrt[-(1 + (-1)^(1/3))^2 ρ (-4 + 3 ρ)];      I wish to simplify both, and specifically factor out the complex term out of the radical.               FullSimplify[ExpToTrig[f], 0 < ρ < 1]      > 1/4 (-2 + 2 I Sqrt[3] + (3 - 3 I Sqrt[3]) ρ + (-3 - I Sqrt[3]) Sqrt[(4 - 3 > ρ) ρ])               FullSimplify[ExpToTrig[g], 0 <= ρ <= 1]      > 1/4 (-2 + 2 I Sqrt[3] + (3 - 3 I Sqrt[3]) ρ + Sqrt[(-6 - 6 I Sqrt[3]) ρ (-4 > + 3 ρ)]) Mathematica does this with f but not with g! Then I try               f1 = -(1/2) Sqrt[-(1 + (-1)^(1/3))^2 ρ (-4 + 3 ρ)];     g1 = +(1/2) Sqrt[-(1 + (-1)^(1/3))^2 ρ (-4 + 3 ρ)];          FullSimplify[ExpToTrig[f1], 0 < ρ < 1]      > -(1/4) I (-3 I + Sqrt[3]) Sqrt[(4 - 3 ρ) ρ]               FullSimplify[ExpToTrig[g1], 0 <= ρ <= 1]      > 1/4 (3 + I Sqrt[3]) Sqrt[(4 - 3 ρ) ρ] How can I get Mathematica to consistently factor out the (3 + I Sqrt[3]) from the radical in both f and g?
