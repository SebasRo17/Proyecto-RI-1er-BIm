Is there a simple way to make a maximum tuple value (similar to python)? For example, in python               max([ (1,2), (1,3), (3,1), (4,0) ])      returns `(4,0)`, using lexicographic order. If I have a tensor in Mathematica, is there a way to take the max without flattening it? i.e. a way to call               Max[ { {1,2}, {1,3}, {3,1}, {4,0} } ]      so that it returns `{4,0}` instead of `4`?
