I want to add feature, to jQuery Terminal, that will allow to execute commands from the server. Right now it only have formatting syntax that look like this:               [[<list of one letter styles> ; <color> ; <background> ; <class>] TEXT ]      and if you want to display bold white text you can use: `[[b;#fff;]Some Text]`. What syntax should I use for executing commands that will not interfere with formatting but will be similar? Maybe something like `[{name}(param1, param2, param3)]` or `[[exec:name(param1, param2, param3)]]` Any suggestions are wellcome.
