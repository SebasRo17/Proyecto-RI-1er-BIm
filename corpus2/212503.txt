I do not understand the following example. It says that a function X will be executed if either of A and B variables will be lower than 5. The go on and explains that there are three valid equivalence classes for inputs:               A<5, B<5     A=>5 B<5     B>=5 A<5      Why there is no class for A>5 and B>5? Is it because this would not be valid class? But why A<5 and B>5 is valid, is it because the function is still dependent on that?
