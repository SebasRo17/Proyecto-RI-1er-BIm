I have code that looks like this:               tr.t.findIndexSmoothed(arg0.getX(), arg0.getY());      "tr" and "t" are objects. Is it bad practice to reach all the way down the object hierarchy to call methods? The only reason I can think of is that is breaks encapsulation, and if that's the case, can anybody tell me why that poses a problem? Also, does this code structure inhibit performance in any way?
