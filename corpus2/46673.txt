I want to create a reusable line of code that I can send a column, table name and criteria to match using the WHERE clause.               colCount[x_, y_, z_] :=  Length[SQLExecute[conn,      "SELECT " && x && " FROM " && y && " WHERE " && x && " = " && y &&       ""]];      When I try to pass a column name to the SELECT statement using the variable x and pass the table name to y, using               colCount[col1,db1,40]      MM doesn't seem to understand. I tried the column and database name in quotes too. Cheers!
