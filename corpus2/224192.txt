When using mindmaps, you order them based on how you think it fits best. So for instance (tab means subtree)               requirements       dinner         food         forks         spoons       breakfast         food         forks      this could be written using               food       at         dinner         breakfast     forks       at         dinner         breakfast     spoons       at         dinner      What would an algorithm look like that finds the best sorting in the manner described. Best means, the least amount of redundancy? (The 2nd example might not actually reduce redundancy but it shows what is meant by sorting/reordering)
