I have some problems with the NonlinearModelFit: `NonlinearModelFit[data, A (1 + Cos[a x]) + B (1 + Cos[b x]) + c , {A, B, a, b, c}, x]` The model should fit my data: ![data plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BmqeC.jpg) I tried all sort of things described in this thread. The best Fit Mathematica gave me was a really noisy horizontal line. Even if I constrain c on a reasonable Value and give a good guess, things don't get much better. I don't know what to try next and hope to find help here in the forum. * * * Thank you again. I can't really give you more data, since this data is the result of a quantum chemical calculation and because of the periodicity I would just get the same data again for the next period (accuracy about 0.0000002). Just if you are interested: The data represents the absolute Energy [Hartree] of a ethylene dichloride molecule as a function of the Dihedral angle Cl-C-C- Cl. I did a little literature research and found that all the models you suggested here were at least once used to fit similar data in some papers. You are doing a great job in this forum, I much appreciate it.
