Is there a direct command in Mathematica that computes the covariance between two random variables? Hence, instead of typing               Expectation[f(x)*g(y),{y~some distribution,x~some distribution}] -      Expectation[f(x),{y~some distribution,x~some distribution}]*     Expectation[g(y),{y~some distribution,x~some distribution}]      Is there a command that archieves the same by typing simply               Covariance[{f(x),g(y)},{y~some distribution,x~some distribution}]      I have tried to use the following function:               CoVar[RVfuncs_, dist_] :=      Expectation[RVfuncs[[1]]*RVfuncs[[2]],      dist] - (Expectation[RVfuncs[[1]], dist]*Expectation[RVfuncs[[2]], dist])      It works, but it is much slower than writing out the three "Expectation" parts.
