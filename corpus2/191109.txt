In planning poker/scrum poker, when an estimate is made, should the estimate be made based on the assumption that only a single developer is assigned to that task, or a group of developers? If the latter, how large is that group? The reason this is relevant is that the time estimates would probably be different if a single person works on the problem compared to having several people. I've read several descriptions of how planning poker is supposed to work, but this basic information seems to be omitted, as if it should be inferred from the procedure in some way. In other words: If I give an estimate, should my estimate be how long I think a single developer in the group needs to spend to solve the problem, or how long the whole group would spend to solve the problem?
