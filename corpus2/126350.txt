I'm finishing up my app for iPad, and the file extension (used mostly so that Mail and Dropbox know what program to open the files in) is 12 characters long. The only file extension that is anywhere near as long is `tax2010`. Why is there so little variation on this topic, and **what kind of problems can I expect by using a long file extension for my app?** These files will be mailed, copied, and shared*. In all tests, it works perfectly. * I hope.
