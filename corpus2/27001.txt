I was thinking if there is something like Find and Replace (`Crtl`+`F`) functionality adapted to work with patterns. Probably not, but it seems possible to create this with some effort and skills in `low-level-notebook-programming`. **My question is:** if there is not such functionality bulid in, maybe someone have worked on this? Example of what I'm thinking it should be able to do:               Text["test string"]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rdai1.png)               Style["test string", Bold]
