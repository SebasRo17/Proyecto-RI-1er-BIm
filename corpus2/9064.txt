In Mathematica 8, whenever I enter "hello" into a cell of style "text", the quote marks are automatically converted to special characters: `\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]hello\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]` This automatic substitution does not happen in a cell of style "input" (good!). Because I use Mathematica notebooks as a front-end to LaTeX, for me this substitution is a disaster, no matter where it occurs. What is the preferred idiom for turning-off this smart-quote feature (and all similar automatic character substitution features) for all cells in a Notebook? The ASCII characters that I type, are precisely the characters that I want in the notebook! The Mathematica documentation is unhelpful ... or possibly I am not looking in the correct place.
