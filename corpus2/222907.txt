I am using a LGPL v3 library and have made upgrades to it. Before using these upgrades, I understand I have to publish them. That's al-right.   1. Is it legal if I perform upgrades that use a commercial library of my own (upgrades will be published, but not my commercial library)? Note: usually, questions are the other side: commercial applications that want to use GPL libraries.   2. If yes to (1), is there some restrictions on the build of the upgraded LGPL library ? Shall the commercial library be dynamically or statically linked, or whatever ?
