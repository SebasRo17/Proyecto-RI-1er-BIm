The code below crashes the Mathematica kernel in version 10 (not in V9) every time I run it on Windows and on Mac OS. I've sent it to WRI, but was told that they could not reproduce the crash. Does this really only crash on my computers? Could somebody else test it with Mathematica 10?               pts = Flatten[        Table[Through[{Cos, Sin}[α]] r, {α, 0.,           360 ° - 10^-5, 60 °}, {r, 1, 2}], 1];          LocatorPane[Dynamic[pts],       Dynamic@Show[        Graphics[{Arrow /@ Partition[pts, 2]}], {a, b} =          Transpose[Map[Module[{p1, p2, d}, {p1, p2} = #;             d = p2 - p1;             {d, p1.d}] &, Partition[pts, 2]]];        RegionPlot[And @@ Thread[a.{x, y} < b], {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2}]]]          ContourPlot[      Total[Log[Clip[b - a.{x, y}, {10^-10, ∞}]]], {x, -2,        2}, {y, -2, 2}, PlotRange -> {-10, 0}]
