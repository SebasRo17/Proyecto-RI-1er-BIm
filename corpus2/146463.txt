The question that bothers me is whether it is possible/feasible/reasonable to expect for an open-source app to sell well on the mobile market? Should I believe that my users will use my app, rather than build the checked- out version, and, more important, how can I deal with the competition if I make my app available under an OSS license? So far the only link on the subject I've found is http://blog.zachwaugh.com/post/17554643060/selling-open-source-apps however it deals with a Mac OS X app. I should mention my question does not focus on iOS, Android or another OS, it's about mobile applications in general. EDIT: The very reasonable question of whether my users are programmers has been asked.   I do not expect most of my users to be even remotely familiar with programming.
