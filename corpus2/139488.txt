I currently have a web application and I would like to add a messaging feature to it. In order to do that, I use JMS(actually OpenMQ, the implementation provided with Glassfish 3). The problem is that I do not know how to get the message notification from the background(from the listener) to the foreground. I am using JSF as a framework, if it does have an importance. Could you please tell me how should I notify the user about a received message(like a chat). Any suggestions are welcomed.
