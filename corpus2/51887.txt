If you have a number of years experience in working with Java and a number of years experience in working with C# and .NET, I would value your opinion on software development productivity differences between these two environments. One of our customers is considering replacing their existing software solution. As the replacement will require approx. 10 - 15 man years work, a choice for Java or .NET, based on productivity differences between the them, may significantly influence the investment required and time-to-market. Would you be able to provide us, an indication of software development productivity differences between Java and C#/.NET? I would prefer to receive an answer as follows: > My experience is based on X years experience working with Java and X years > experience working with C#/.NET. Java is X% more productive then C#.NET or > C#/.NET is X% more productive than Java if you take the the following into > account.
