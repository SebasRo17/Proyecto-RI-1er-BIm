I want to compare two matrices. For this I use the mean squared error between them with the following code               mse[mat1_, mat2_] :=(mat1 - mat2)^2 // Flatten // Mean       Is this code correct? Are there other methods to compare two matrices? **update** Thank you all for your answers! Actually, I want to determine an unknown parmeter by comparing model and data. The matrix 1 contains empirical data, whereas matrix 2 is calculated from a model which has an unknown parmeter. My idea was to calculate a set of theoretical matrices with different values of the parameter $\Theta$ and compute the mean squared difference between empirical and theoretical matrices for each $\Theta$. The best $\Theta$ is the one for each the mean squared difference is minimum. Does this make sense? Are there better ways to do that?
