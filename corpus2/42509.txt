I've just installed Mathematica 9.0.1 Student Edition on my Laptop and my Home PC. On my Laptop, it works just fine. But on my Home PC I get this weird issue of the pop-up command autocomplete window having some weird graphical issues as seen in the attached picture. I've already tried resetting and reinstalling it. It didn't help. When I click on the arrow and scroll through the list, the whole thing goes black. PC is running Windows 7 Ultimate (x64) CPU: i7 870 GPU: Nvidia GTX-470 (Drivers are up-to-date) Thanks, for your help! ![The described problem](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SKdxG.png)
