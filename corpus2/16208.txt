I like to group the 2 parts of the `If` statement and others like it by using `()` to help me be able to still understand what my code is doing the next day I look at it. I started to use 2D math in input cells, and it is a nice feature of Mathematica. But noticed that `()` changes size depending on what is inside them. So I end up with non-symmetrical (different size) parentheses within the same logical grouping. An example will help show this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/l4Z0U.png) Notice how the top `()` are small compared to the lower `()`. The code will look better on the screen if the sizes of these `()` are kept the same. (either both large, or both small, is not important, as long as the size is the same) This happens with `With` and any other such command. I know the `()` are not needed. I just use them to make the code easy to read. When I have complicated logic, these help me see the parts more clearly. Here is the actual code that generated the above converted to `InputForm` in order to paste it here               Clear["Global`*"]     If[x == 1, x = 0, x = Sqrt[y^2] ];       Question is: Is there a way to control this aspect of the display in input cells for 2D math so that parentheses are the same even if using 2D math?
