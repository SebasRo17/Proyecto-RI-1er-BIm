I am performing a finite-precision operation on a matrix `A` which I know precisely; call the result `B`. The operation is taking the square root by `B = MatrixPower[A,1/2]`, but it's not quite relevant. The point is that the form of `A` is such that the output will contain a lot of entries equal to `0`, simply because `A` has a lot of invariant subspaces spanned by the standard base vectors. I would like to see resulting matrix is like: in the first approximation it interests me how many non-zero entries it has and where. The problem is, the entries of `B` which are supposed to be `0` come out as small reals of the type $1.234...\times 10^{-10}$. I've tried applying `N` to `B` with some modest requirement on precision, but this does not seem to help. Ideally, I would like to set all entries of `B` which are approximately `0` to precisely `0`. Any help would be appreciated. P.S. It just occurred to me that I can take a function `f` that maps small numbers to `0`, and is identity otherwise, and apply it to `B` element-wise. But there should be a more elegant solution, it seems to me.
