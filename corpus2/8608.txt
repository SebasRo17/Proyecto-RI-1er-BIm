It seems to me that this is a clear-cut case of Mathematica actually producing the wrong answer (with no warnings). I'm trying to express the fact that for any integer, there exists a factorization (even if that factorization is just n = n * 1). But Mathematica says no. If I replace the domain with Reals or Complexes, then it says True. Is this a bug or am I using these functions incorrectly?               Resolve[ForAll[n, Exists[{p, q}, p*q == n]], Integers]          (*Out[1]= False*)          Reduce[ForAll[n, Exists[{p, q}, p*q == n]], {n, p, q}, Integers]          (*Out[2]= False*)
