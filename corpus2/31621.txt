I am learning about quaternions right now, and I wanted to play around with some concepts I am learning. e.g. take rotation of a point about an axis with specified angle.               th = 3.4;     v  = Sqrt[1/3.0]*(i + j + k)     q    = Cos[th] + Sin[th]*v;     qinv =  Cos[th] - Sin[th]*v;          p = 2*i + 3*j + 4*k;          r = q * p *qinv // Expand     r = r//.{ i*i->-1, j*j->-1,k*k->-1,                i*j->k , j*i->-k,                j*k->i,  k*j->-i,                k*i->j,  i*k->-j}      Here I want to rotate the point _p_ in three dimensions by the angle _th_ with the axis given by the unit vector _v_. So for that I basically just need to use replacement rules like did above. The result I get is               0.391808 + 2.26121 i - 0.0435342 i^3 + 3.1959 j - 0.0653013 j^3 +       4.1306 k - 0.0870683 k^3      How do I tell Mathematica to replace **'i^3'** etc. by **'-i'**? I would have thought Mathematica would be smart enough to use my 'i^2=-1' rule to figure this out. Generalizing this question, if I am manipulating symbols (not just quaternions) how do I specify replacements so that the final answer is as 'simple' as possible?
