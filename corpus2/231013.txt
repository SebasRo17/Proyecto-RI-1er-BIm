For decimal numbers, obviously I want to localise everything. Whatever programming language I'm working in, there will tend to be tools for this, so it's also easy to do. In my application, I happen to be formatting numbers as hexadecimal quite often. This leads me to wonder:   * Are there locales which group hexadecimal numbers into different groupings to me?   * Are there locales which use a separator other than space for the groupings?   * Are A-F used as the extra six digits even in locales which don't use a Latin script? I guess in general - do I have to internationalise this, or does everyone in the world look at the same hexadecimal value and intrinsically understand it the same way?
