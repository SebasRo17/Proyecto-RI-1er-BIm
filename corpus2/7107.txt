On windows the kernels launched with `LaunchKernels` are starred with "Below Normal" priority. **Is there a way to start them with even lower priority (eg. "Idle")?** I'm doing some intensive numerical analysis on my computer, which becomes really unresposive while the analysis is running. If I manually lower the priority of the kernels (eg from ProcessExplorer) then I'm able to work normally. But manually finding the processes every 10 minutes becomes tedious. Of course I could just launch fewer kernels than I have cores, but that seems inelegant. Bonus points for a cross-platform solution:)
