My question is: How can you verify the users' requirements early in the software creation process? I show the user specifications, prototypes, demos... but still users forget to share some "insignificant details" about the process or business rules and data. Which pops up after the final test as some "really small and rare exceptions" - which are turned into change request and accumulate a lot of work. So how do you prototype (or verify) users requirements early in the project?
