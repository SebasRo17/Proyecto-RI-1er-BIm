I am writing a Windows Phone application which I intend to release into the public domain (the source code and releated resources, that is). My application does, however, use a few third party open source libraries (statically linking to them). Does releasing my code into the public domain make any difference regarding the licenses of the open source libraries I use or would I have to make sure my (un)license is compatible with the open source licenses, the same way I would have to if I released the source code using an open source license (or kept the code closed source, for that matter)? I releasing my code into the public domain doesn't make any difference, how do I know if an open source license is usable with code released into the public domain?
