Say I have a model written in php whose properties are the columns of a table in a db and each instance of the model represents a row in the table. I also have a page ('view') where I display the contents of each column one row at a time, starting with the first row (id=1). Above this display are two buttons, one which when clicked displays the contents of the next row, and the other displays the contents of the previous row. I want the change of display to occur without reloading the page or going to a new page. My question is simply would I need to use AJAX for this?
