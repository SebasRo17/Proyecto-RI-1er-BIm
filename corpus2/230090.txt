As I can read in this tutorial, "There is a limitation that namespaces be exactly one level deep â€“ that is, we can't use a namespace like nmk.foo". What isn't clear to me (and something I was unable to find an explanation for in any documentation) is the _why_ behind this reasoning. Coming from languages like Java and C#, the possibility to further subdivide namespaces seems almost blatantly obvious, yet in the `Widget Factory`, this is limited by design, so reserving namespaces to implement some sort of logical separation in types of widgets is not possible. Can someone provide some insight into this limitation? Is there a technical reason for it?
