Let's say I start and develop some project under open-source license, and accept some community contributions. How shaky is the ground I stand on if I decide to take the project commercial and closed-source (or split license)? This question doesn't directly address the issue of a project with community contributions, which feels like different territory, at least as far as ethics are concerned. Legally, this might be iffy as well, because I'm not sure whether contributions fall under my copyright, or whether the contributor hold the copyright to the part of the project he added. Am I safe (ethically and legally) as long as I'm up front with the possibility that I may take the project commercial in the future?
