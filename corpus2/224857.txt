I currently work as a .net developer and have coming up to 3 years experience in the industry as well as a degree in computer science specifically software engineering (I know that means nothing but just wanted to explain that I'm not your general back bedroom programmer). When I finished Uni, I started contracting for a company. I wont mention their name but some of you may have heard of them just by the description. Basically they take in fresh graduates and in return for training and contracting experience you have to go to the clients they say for a minimum of two years. I cant say this was great but I do feel I know more than people with the same years of experience as me. The problem is that I've now started heading down the route of web development because of the lack of choice in clients. How difficult is it to change from a .net field to embedded/low level programming? I have the enthusiasm for it and the strive but I'm not quite sure how to go about moving. Unlike application development, knowing the language and having some business etiquette doesn't seem to be enough. > For example hardware wise I can set-up a computer but wouldn't know how to > manually attached wires and program these systems.

Also if anyone has similar experience of swapping, should I? tl;dr Developer that doesn't know how to get from web development roles into embedded systems. Edit:: Thank you all for the advice.
