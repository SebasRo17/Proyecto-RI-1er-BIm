I'd like to write a function, that would take a matrix as an input parameter and would change it by multiplying one of its rows by a factor. I try to do it in the following way:               matrix=Table[i*j,{i,Range@2},{j,Range@2}]     MultiplyRowByFactor[m_,factor_,iRow_]:=Module[{},m[[All,iRow]]*=factor;m]     MultiplyRowByFactor[matrix,2,1]      and get an error message               Set::setps: "{{1,2},{2,4}} in the part assignment is not a symbol. "      Of course, if I change the matrix outside of the function:               matrix[[All,1]]*=2;     matrix      everything works as expected. What is the problem and how can I write a function to modify a matrix "in place"?
