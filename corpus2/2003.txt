I use some custom shortcut keys in `KeyEventTranslations.tr`. One is for the `Delete All Output` function:               Item[KeyEvent["w", Modifiers -> {Control}],          FrontEnd`FrontEndExecute[FrontEnd`FrontEndToken["DeleteGeneratedCells"]]]      or simply:               Item[KeyEvent["w", Modifiers -> {Control}], "DeleteGeneratedCells"]      This works as expected, putting up the dialog: "Do you really want to delete all the output cells in the notebook?". Is there any way to set up `KeyEventTranslations.tr` that when I hit `Ctrl`+`w` the dialog is automatically acknowledged and I don't have to hit `Enter`? The same goes for the `Quit kernel` function, that also puts up a dialog.
