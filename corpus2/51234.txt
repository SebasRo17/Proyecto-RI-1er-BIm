I would like to calculate the distribution function from the characteristic function. There is a formula given as $$F_X(x)=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^\infty \frac{e^{i w x}\phi(-w)-e^{-i w x}\phi(w)}{i w}\mbox{d}w$$ Actually, I want to evaluate $F_X(x)$ at some real number $b<0$. I wrote some codes in Mathematica with unfortunately no success. The codes give some results but they seem to be incorrect. Here are my codes:               opts = {Method -> {Automatic, "SymbolicProcessing" -> None}, AccuracyGoal -> 8}     b = -2;     f1[x_] := PDF[NormalDistribution[2, 2], x]     ff1[\[Omega]_] := InverseFourierTransform[f1[x], x, \[Omega]]     qn1 =1/2 + 1/(2*Pi) NIntegrate[(Exp[I \[Omega] b]*ff1[-\[Omega]] -Exp[-I \[Omega] b]*ff1[\[Omega]])/(I \[Omega]), {\[Omega], 0,Infinity}, Evaluate@opts]     NIntegrate[f1[x], {x, -Infinity, b}]      What I expect is $qn1$ to be equal to the last line of my code. But it just $0$. I cannot see the problem. Perhaps someone can? Thanks in advance
