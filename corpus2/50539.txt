I have this matrix               A = {{17/25, 3/25, 5/25, 0, 0}, {5/18, 5/18, 7/18,1/18, 0}, {4/21, 9/21, 4/21, 0, 4/21},         {0, 0, 3/4, 1/4, 0}, {3/4,1/4, 0, 0, 0}}      And i would like to have this matrix binarize, i wanted it to be like this               {{1, 1, 1, 0, 0}, {1, 1, 1,1, 0}, {1, 1, 1, 0, 1}, {0, 0, 1, 1, 0}, {1, 1, 0, 0, 0}}      Is any function in mathematica that does that? Or I have to programmate it? If so can un help me please? Thanks (:
