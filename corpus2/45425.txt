I stumbled upon this quote from Bill Gates: "You should definitely send me a resume if you can read the whole thing." He was talking about _The Art of Programming_ books. So I was pretty curious and want to read it all. But honestly, I don't understand it. I'm really not that intellectual. So this should be the reason why I can't understand it, but I am eager to learn. I'm currently reading Volume 1 about fundamental algorithms. Are there any books out there that are friendly for novices/slow people like me, which would help to build up my knowledge so that I can read Knuth's book with ease in the future?
