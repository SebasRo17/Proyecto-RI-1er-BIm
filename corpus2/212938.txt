I built a web-applicationg using struts2. Then I built a small admin interface in the same war. With time the webapp grew and so the admin-interface. Now, I'm thinking to separate the admin interface from the rest of the app in a separate war Is it a good idea ? Is there any performance benefit that I can get due to separation of the admin war and the rest of the webapp. The admin part is mostly about making changes/updations/settings in the database, so it's not affecting the UI of the rest of the app directly. Separating it also ensures that I can make updations to both parts without affecting the other. [UPDATE] I cannot put admin part on local machine. It's a web-app. `Do they use the same classes?` Nope, the entire package is different for admin actions and view is also separate. `How do you update them?` upload war `Do you use application session?` yes of course, although different sessions are used for admin & normal-user.
