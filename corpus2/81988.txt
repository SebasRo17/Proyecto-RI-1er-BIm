What are the symptoms in a code base that indicate that an event-listener approach is required? It seems to me that when there are classes that need to be called by multiple, not defined at design-time set of other classes, you need some sort of signaling framework, but I would like to hear what other situations are there that would be improved by changing to an event-based model.
