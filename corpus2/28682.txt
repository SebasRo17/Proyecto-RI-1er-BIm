I want to solve two coupled equations with `NDSolve`,               t x'[t] == -x[t] + y[t], t y'[t] == -5 t^2/x[t]^2 + x[t] - y[t],      x[0] == y[0], x[1] == 1      It's easy to see that at `t = 0` the derivative is undetermined, so `NDSolve` fails. The _Mathematica_ help center told me one possibility is to start at a small `Îµ > 0` instead of 0, and another possibility is to use the option `SolveDelayed -> True` to avoid the singularity in the solved form of the equations. Unfortunately neither of the methods worked for me. What should I do?
