I have around five years of experience in PHP development and around one year of experience with ExpressionEngine. I use PHP 5, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other web technologies. I decided to create a portfolio site and include hundreds of (if time permits) little examples to prove my skills. Then at the interview if the interviewer asks me to show my work I am going to show my portfolio site. Is this a good approach? If yes, can you suggest to me some great, creative projects to include in my portfolio? I am thinking: 1. Model View Controller 2\. Simple e-commerce site 3\. Content Manage System (CMS)
