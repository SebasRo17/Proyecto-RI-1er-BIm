There is list containing some $(i,j)$ values of indices. Now i want to create a matrix of dimension n $\times$ m whose entries are 1 for the indices corresponding to the given list otherwise its zero. For e.g if the list is as given below               list = {{1, 1}, {1, 2}, {2, 1}, {3, 3}};      And if $n=m=3$ then the output should be                {{1, 1, 0}, {1, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 1}}      I was able to do this as shown below but i believe this could be achieved with a shorter and a more elegant code. Maybe a one liner.                     cHeck[n1_, n2_] := Module[{flag = 0, list, i},                              list = {{1, 1}, {1, 2}, {2, 1}, {3, 3}};                              For[i = 1, i <= Length[list], i++,                                Which[{n1, n2} === list[[i]], flag = 1]                                  ];                             flag                                 ]      A[n_, m_] := Table[cHeck[i, j], {i, 1, n}, {j, 1, m}]           A[3, 3]       (*{{1, 1, 0}, {1, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 1}}*)
