I'm an independent IT consultant in the US, and I just completed some work for a German company, all done remotely from the US. I've sent them an invoice, but they are now asking if I have a VAT registration ID, which I don't have of course not being in Europe. Do I have to do anything about the German VAT tax? Is it up to the company I worked for to sort this out?
