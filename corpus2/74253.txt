I don't want any tools, but more methods to help us manage our passwords. I know this question has been closed, but I think this one, even if it's related, is more a programmers problem than a super user problem. We are using some database schema, each with a password. These schemas exist in our 4 different environments (DEV, TEST, INTEGRATION, UAT) There are corporate rules about passwords, so we need to change them often. Wrong passwords result in locked accounts. This happens quite often and takes countless hours to be solved by dbas... The rules are also quite drastic about how to change a password. No re-use, some word forbidden... The result of this setting is a very often unusable database for our dev. And lots of frustration too. Do you know any 'deterministic' way of creating passwords that can help us to avoid total mess?
