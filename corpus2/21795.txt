I just started working with _Mathematica_ 8 and I'm having trouble revolving a function the way I want. I have to revolve the function $x^2/4 +2$ and $y= 0$ around $y=6$ to form an ashtray, but I can't find how to do it. EDIT: So far I've got :               RevolutionPlot3D[{{f[x] - 6}, {-6}}, {x, 0, 6}, RevolutionAxis -> x]      And for clarification, this is the complete surface I'm revolving (Or trying to) https://www.dropbox.com/s/irpaw37nayox414/Capture.PNG Now I just need to revolve the explicit functions "x=0" from 0 to 2 and "x=5" 0 t0 6
