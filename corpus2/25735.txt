Using _Mathematica_ , is it possible to pull data directly from Google Analytics? Unfortunately, GA exports messy `csv` files, and I was wondering if there was a direct way of receiving this data. A quick Google search has shown that at one point Patrick Collison had devised a way, though perhaps due to copyright or other legal infringements, that knowledge has disappeared off the web. I'm very new to using _Mathematica_ , so any tips would be greatly appreciated. EDIT: As suggested, here is an example of the messy `csv` files:               All Web Site Data     Browser & OS     20130421-20130521               Browser,Visits,Pages / Visit,Avg.
