Part of one of my applications has `contracts` and `contract_types` tables, wherein a type may have many contracts but a contract may only be of one type. Now a new wrinkle has been introduced: a contract may change type over time (although it can, thankfully, still only be of one type at any one time). The simplest solution appears to be to introduce a new table with columns something like this:               contract_id     contract_type_id     from_date     to_date      But what to call the new table? `contract_type_allocations` is the best I can do so far and I can't say I'm impressed with myself. Suggestions gratefully received.
