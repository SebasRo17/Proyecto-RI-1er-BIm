I have been stuck wondering what the best solution to the problem below: I am developing a form like GUI with quite a few places for input. Currently, I am storing each UI element in an ArrayList representing each modular component of the form (Seperate layouts containing UI elements relevant to one another) I then pass these ArrayLists into a new class that will then handle gathering the data entered by the user after a submit button has been clicked. I feel as though this method of passing the UI elements by ArrayList is not very good practice. If anyone has any better suggestions, I would love to hear them, as I feel this method is somewhat unclean.
