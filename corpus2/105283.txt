> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Weeding out real agile from buzzword agile in an interview I went for an interview. The company really wants to take me on. However my sticking point is that I have not received clear information on whether they are using Agile and Scrum methodologies. I have arranged a telephone chat with the consultant there... what questions do I ask to test to see if they are really serious about agile and scrum? I was thinking:   * Can you build and release your software in one step?   * Do you use continuous integration? Can anybody give me advice to really get the truth out of them I will only get this one chance to quiz them. Regards, Pete
