I am attempting to understand what UML models/diagrams can be used to communicate a websites architecture. The model or models' purpose is to communicate the architecture and functionality of a website to technical people (other software developers and engineers). Website Features:   \- The website is a recipe search engine   \- Server side code is Python. Client side uses HTML, CSS, JQuery and AJAX.   \- The website will have a Web Crawler/Indexer   \- Infinite Scrolling is utilised when viewing search results so I will need to model asynchronous requests (both GET and POST). The diagrams I am tending towards are Component Diagram (to communicate the architecture) and Sequence Diagram (to communicate the functionality of a HTTP request). What diagrams have you used in the past to communicate the architecture and functionality of a website to technical people?
