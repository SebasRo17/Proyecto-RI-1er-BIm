I am using `SimulatedAnnealing` method for a simulation based optimization problem and was wondering if someone can enlighten me on the following features:   1. Is there some guidelines on optimal size of `"SearchPoints"` based on the size of the solution space knowing that the objective function is non-linear?   2. It is intuitive that the number of iterations will depend on the objective function, but I have noticed that the number of iterations seem to be a multiple of number of variables. is this true? Sample code is provided in Simulated Annealing Convergence   3. I think it is difficult to prove global optimization results, but was wondering if any one has ideas on alternative ways to do that.
