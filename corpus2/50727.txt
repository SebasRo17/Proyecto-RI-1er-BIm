I'm brushing up my CV/resume and trying to think of responsibilities and achievements from my past jobs and projects. It seems there aren't many, but probably there're some that I just don't identify as worth mentioning to a employer. What kind of responsibilities and achievements does your job include and which of them do you list on your CV/resume?
