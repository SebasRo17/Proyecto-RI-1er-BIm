I have different data modules, which take a couple of parameters from a configuration list. Do you think it's ok to pass a configuration object as a whole `module1(config)` and let the module pick what it needs, or should I rather pass the individual parameters `module1(config.a, config.c, config.f)`? The first case doesn't require change interfaces in case I need more configuration parameters, but the second case encapsules more?
