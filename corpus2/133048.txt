Which is the best book and what are the best tools for C programming in Windows 7? Would using C in any way hinder me when it comes to using the Windows API as opposed to using C++ or C#? I would like to use C, because it seems to me that object-oriented programming is bad for performance and the abstraction seems only counter-productive if the right people are doing the programming. I will mostly do GUIs and background services that do a lot of networking, possibly at OSI Layer 2, and public key + cascaded symmetric key cryptograpy. Also, the core of the programs (excluding any that deal directly with OSI Layer 2) should be portable to Android.
