I am a RoR developer and want to clarify some doubt about ruby variable assignment. In ruby we have two ways for variable assignment.               str, arr, num = "Hi", [1, 2], 3      and               str = "Hi"     arr = [1, 2]     num = 3      I know that the first way will go slower than second way but, I want to know that as per ruby language, which way is preferable and performance reliable?
