This is a known issue for me with Mathematica. When I export a notebook to HTML, Mathematica loses some decorations such as Grid Frame lines (in grid and like objects). For example, creating this small notebook:               Grid[{       {Text@Style["Wolfram pages"]},       {Hyperlink["http://www.wolfram.com"]},       {Hyperlink["http://demonstrations.wolfram.com"]}       }, Frame -> All      ]      Then I do SAVE AS and select HTML. When I look at the HTML, the frame is lost: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/LUm1N.png) Here is a link to a post of mine at Math group asking on this in march of last year (link) I got one response, and I followed advice given in the response above, but nothing came out of it. I thought I ask again, may be some experts here would have a simple solution or a trick to this. I am thinking of using Mathematica notebook to save my URL's into instead of Microsoft word where I have them now, since I think I can organize them better with Grid and frames and such and it would look better, but if I can't get frames to show up, then there is no point of even trying. My other option would be to use Latex and generate HTML from Latex using Latex2html which I know pretty well. I find it strange that such a basic thing does not work, given that what this page says http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/guide/CreatingWebPages.html               Mathematica supports industrial-strength automatic creation of      full-featured web pages.       Well, if Grid frames and Dividers and items like these do not show up in the final exported HTML, then I do not think I would call it a full-featured web pages? Or Am I missing something here? I hope this is resolved in version 9, but I'd like to use Mathematica for this if it works. **note(1)** Thanks for all the responses. It seems editing the css will work ok for me now. It is not a big problem, since I keep the css commands in a small text file and just paste them each time I update my HTML. One nice thing about using Mathematica for this, is that now I can automate some things, like counters for html links and such, as the final grid is computed with whatever variables in it. Here is a small example, where the html link number is a simple counter. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/R7PLR.png) I can now move all my saved URL's (have 100's of them) from word to the notebook and use this method. I need small help on something, could not figure how to do: Any one knows how to align all rows below the first row to the LEFT? I wanted to keep the top row centered and all the rows below LEFT aligned. Should I make a new question for this part since it is not related to my main question? I tried, but Grid alignment of separate entries has always been like black magic to me, I read the help many times, and can't decipher the description at all. thanks everyone for the help. **edit(2)** Please ignore my question above about `Grid` alignment. I gave up trying to figure how to use `Alignment` option to do this, and used the `Item` trick. This is much simpler. So each row I want to align in the center, I just use Item on it, and since Item has it own `Alignment` option, then I can use that instead. Here is how it works now. I like it now, and I think this will work well for me. I am a happy camper now. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/q78an.png)
