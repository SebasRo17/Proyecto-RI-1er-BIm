I have a plot and a table that I am trying to plot in a single file together. I have a "working" example, but it is not perfect. I export a list, but it keeps the commas and brackets, that is the only problem so far. Export[dir, {plot, table}]; I have tried using CreateDocument, but this comes with formatting issues that are unacceptable. Plot being cut off etc. I know a way that works, but it is not automated. Manually merging the output cells for plot and table, then saving the selection as. **Update w/ solution:** As per mfvonh's suggestion I used row and it solved my problem. Export[dir, Row[{plot, table}]]
