I like that companies like Twitter and Facebook can push the boundaries of technology. But I wonder, what is the purpose of Twitter and Facebook? Why did they write that software and not something more useful? Do you think developers have some kind of responsibility to work on technology that could further human progress or should they just develop anything that some users want? For example, a bridge engineer or architect build things that may solve a tough problem and maybe there is an explicit need. But no one needs a Facebook account. Note: Some have acknowledged that Twitter and Facebook can be used in emergency situations like with the Japan crisis. But this is after the fact that twitter became popular. I don't think the main purpose of Twitter is to facilitate finding missing people during a crisis.
