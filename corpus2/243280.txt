I'm working in an Android project with multithreading. Basically I have to wait to the server to respond before sending more data. The data sending task is delimited by the flag `boolean hasServerResponded` so the `Thread` will loop infinitely without doing anything until the flag becomes `true`. Since this `boolean` isn't declared as `volatile` (yet), and also looping without doing anything wastes resources, I thought maybe I should use `AtomicBoolean` and also implement `wait() / notify()` mechanism. Should I use the `AtomicBoolean` object `notify()` and `wait()` methods or should I create a lock `Object`?
