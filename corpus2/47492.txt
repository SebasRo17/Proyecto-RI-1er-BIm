To interpret electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) results, inverse pole figures are used. A three dimensional space of directions ([100], [110] and [111] for those who know about crystallography) is projected to a color map, such that purely [100] oriented points are colores red, [110] green and [111] blue, respectively. Mixtures of orientations are colored in mixed colors. Usually, a legend like this one is used: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Kfwkc.jpg) I want to recreate the legend in Mathematica, but unfortunately I don't know how exactly the thre dimensional orientation space is projected to the two dimensional wedge. Obviously, the colors used in the legend are those from half the surface of the $(r,g,b)$ color space, as shown in this plot:               RegionPlot3D[       And @@ Thread[0 <= {x, y, z} <= 1] && x + y + z > 1,       {x, 0, 1}, {y, 0, 1}, {z, 0, 1},       ColorFunction -> (RGBColor[#1, #2, #3] &),       Mesh -> None,        ViewPoint -> {20,20,20},       Lighting -> {{"Ambient", White}},       Boxed -> False     ]      > ![\(r,g,b\) color space](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gzei1.jpg) Since I dont't know how to project that surface onto the wedge, I tried to recreate the legend by hand. The wedge shape was easy, but I can't seem to get the `ColorFunction` right. Here's what I tried:               myColorFunction =        RGBColor[         Piecewise[{{1, #3 <= 0.5}, {(2*(1 - #3))^2, True}}],          Piecewise[{{1, #3 >= 0.5 && #4 < 0.5}, {(2*(1 - #4))^2, #3 >= 0.5 && #4 >= 0.5},           {(2*#3)^2, #3 < 0.5 && #4 < 0.5}, {(4*#3*(1 - #4))^2, True}}],         Piecewise[{{(2*#4)^2, #3 >= 0.5 && #4 < 0.5}, {1, #3 >= 0.5 && #4 >= 0.5},           {(4*#3*#4)^2, #3 < 0.5 && #4 < 0.5}, {(2*#3)^2, True}}]] &;          With[{rstart = 1, rend = 1.15, phi = 42 \[Degree]},        ParametricPlot[         r (1 + (p/phi)^2 (rend - rstart)) {Cos[p], Sin[p]}, {r, 0, rend}, {p, 0, phi},          ColorFunction -> myColorFunction,         Mesh -> None,         Frame -> False,          Axes -> False]]      > ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DqmSs.jpg) I already like the outer part, but i can't reproduce the three triangular whitish lines in the middle (which obviously correspond with the edges of the $(r,g,b)$ box). How do I have to change my `ColorFunction` accordingly? Or even better: how can I project the colors from the surface of the box above to my two dimensional wedge?
