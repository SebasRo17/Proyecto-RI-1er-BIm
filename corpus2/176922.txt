We have a large project that has nearly 20 modules on it. We want to use WCF for the business layer. We have thought of three ways to implement WCF our project:   1. Use only one datacontract and one operation contract. Send ClassName, MethodName to operation and create class by reflection then invoke the method in WCF side.   2. Put all the modules in one wcf application, and create their data contracts, operation contracts.   3. Create a seperate wcf application for each module and host them seperatly. We use web services because, we need call business layer in java and c#. Which one is the best way? I need your ideas.
