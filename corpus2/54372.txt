I am planning a project to develop and enhance an information architecture for a website. This will include navigation structures, content classification, metadata etc.   * Where is the best place to start planning this?   * What software can be used to create this (apart from MS Word?)   * Any tips on how to go about designing a structure?   * What should/should not be included? Hoping you can help.
