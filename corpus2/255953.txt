My socket program hangs at clientsocket, address) = serversocket.accept() and doesn't spit our an error or anything. I followed directions on https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sockets.html I've been trying to figure it out for an hour now, but to no avail. I'm using python3 btw. What am i doing wrong? EDIT: My intedentation is all screwed up because I pasted it wrong, but other than that my code is as I have it in my file.                   #import socket module         import socket         #creates an inet streaming socket.         serversocket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)         print('socket created')         #binds socket to a public host, and a well known port         serversocket.bind(('127.0.0.1', 1024))         #print(socket.gethostname())# on desktop prints 'myname-PC')         #become a server socket         serversocket.listen(5) # listens for up to 5 requests              while True:             #accept connections from outside             #print('In while true loop') This works, but we never get to the next print    statement. Why the hell is it catching at line 20?             (clientsocket, address) = serversocket.accept()             #clientsocket = serversocket.accept()          print('Ready to serve')     #now we do something with client socket...     try:         message = clientsocket.recv(1024)         filename = message.split()[1]         f = open(filename[1:])         outputdata = f.read()         #send an http header line         clientsocket.send('HTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/html\n\n')              for i in range(0, len(outputdata)):             clientsocket.send(outputdata[i])         clientsocket.close()          except IOERROR:         clientsocket.send('HTTP/1.1 404 File not found!')         clientsocket.close()
