I have an image of polygons built from a polar function (see below). I'd like to color each triangle or quadrilateral a random color. Firstly, I'm not sure how to separate the simple shapes. Secondly, I can't think of a simple way to color each a random color (only 3 different colors result with `Colorize`).               sunflower = 2 Pi (1 - 1/GoldenRatio);     PolarCoordinate[r_, theta_] := r {Cos[theta], Sin[theta]}     Graphics[Polygon[        Table[PolarCoordinate[i^10, i*sunflower], {i, 1, 1000}]],        AspectRatio -> 1] // Colorize      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YxLL0.jpg)
