I program in Java and it doesn't make sense to me to think about learning a Java library or a framework without knowing the actual language the thing is built with. Same goes for C. I always avoided JavaScript simply because I wasn't interested in the client side of things but that has changed now. I'm confused as to how and why do people avoid learning JavaScript and instead jump right ahead with a library like JQuery ? How can I program without knowing the features of JS, what is a prototype based language, functions as first class citizens, OOP, closures, etc. Also, are most of the things today in the client-side world built with the help of third party libraries?
