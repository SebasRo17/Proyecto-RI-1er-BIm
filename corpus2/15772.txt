It's now possible to import photographs into _Mathematica_ and import the EXIF data at the same time:               i = Import["ExampleData/coneflower.jpg", "ImageWithExif"]      ![coneflower](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wvzxz.png) You can now look at all the metadata:               Options[i, MetaInformation]      > {MetaInformation -> {"Exif" -> {"ImageDescription" -> " ", "Make" -> > "NIKON", "Model" -> "E950", "Orientation" -> 1, "XResolution" -> 300, > "YResolution" -> 300, "ResolutionUnit" -> 2, "Software" -> "Adobe Photoshop > CS3 Macintosh", "DateTime" -> "2008:08:19 11:29:05", etc... So how would I extract - say - the exposure time ("ExposureTime")? I was trying something like this:               "ExposureTime" /. Options[i, MetaInformation] ...      but I don't know enough about the structure of the stored metainformation. Can you do this without knowing that structure?
