Here is a simple test function               test[n_] :=       Module[{i = 0}, Total[Nest[{++i, #}&, {0}, n], -1]]      On my system V9.0.1 running OS X 10.6.8 and with a clean kernel, the following works               Timing[test[26198]]      > >     {0.106564, 343180701} >   but then immediately evaluating               Timing[test[26199]]      fails. I get a beep and Help > Why the Beep?... shows ![alert.png](http://i.stack.imgur.com/o0elR.png) Can anybody verify this on another system different from mine? Can you cast any light on why it happens? I will submit a bug report to WRI if this is not just peculiar to my system.
