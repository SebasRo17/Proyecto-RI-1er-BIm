How could I show many lines with data, usin Manipulate??               Manipulate[      Print["Number...Square...Cube"];      Do[Print[z, "...", z^2, "....", z^3], {z, 1, zmax}];      PieChart[Table[i^3, {i, 1, zmax}], ChartLabels -> Range[zmax]]      , {zmax, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16}}]      I see the PieChart inside the CDF-place, but the data is showed outside, after the Square of CDF. IÂ´m interesetd too in Show the text of the PieChart greater, and with a label of the data, for example 9 and under the 9.... (21%)
