I've started using gitflow for a project, and I have an outstanding feature branch as well as a newly created hotfix. Per the gitflow workflow, the hotfix gets applied to both the _master_ and _develop_ branches, but nothing is said or done about extant feature branches. Nevertheless, I'd like to incorporate the hotfix changes back into my feature branch, which as near as I can tell leaves three options:   1. Don't incorporate the changes. If the changes were needed for the feature branch, it should've been part of the feature branch.   2. Merge _develop_ back into the feature branch. This seems to follow the gitflow workflow the best, but would cause out-of-order commits.    3. Rebase the feature branch onto _develop_. This would preserve commit order but rebasing seems to be completely absent from the general gitflow workflow. What's the best practice here?
