I have equations depending on one or more parameters and I want to find and plot regions in the parameter space in which there is a specific number of solutions. For definiteness let's consider a simple case               -3 + 3 mu2 - 6 q mu2 - 8 q^3 mu4 + 4 q^4 mu4 + q^2 (3 mu2+ 4 mu4) == 0      where I want to find and/or plot regions in the space `(mu2,mu4)` in which the equation has `0, 1,...,4` solutions with `0 < q < 1`. Note that I want to use the same method also for non-polynomial equations (and possibly systems of equations).
