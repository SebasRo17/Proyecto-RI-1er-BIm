So I went through all the grunt work of solving a PDE in discrete form for a research project. Now I have a Temperature solution as a function of time and space: $$ T_{i}^{n+1}=\left( \dfrac {\lambda _{1}} {\rho_{1}c_{1}}\right)\left( \dfrac {\Delta t} {\Delta r^{2}}\right)\left( 1-\dfrac {\Delta r} {r}\right) T_{i-1}^{n}+\left( 1-2\left( \dfrac {\lambda _{1}} {\rho _{1}c_{1}}\right) \left( \dfrac {\Delta t} {\Delta r^{2}}\right) \right) T_{i}^{n}+\left( \dfrac {\lambda _{1}} {\rho_{1}c_{1}}\right)\left( \dfrac {\Delta t} {\Delta r^{2}}\right)\left( 1+\dfrac {\Delta r} {r}\right) T_{i+1}^{n}+\dfrac {\Delta t} {\rho_{1}c_{1}}\omega_{b1}c_{b}(\left( T_{b}-T_{i}^{n}\right)+\dfrac {\left( P\lambda _{1}\right) } {\omega_{b_{1}}c_{1}}) $$ But my problem now is I don't know how to plot this in mathematica. I'm looking to plot this Temperature as a function of time online (for fixed radius). As you can see, I have delta t and delta r increments and the variable n is my time variable while i is my space variable. I also have initial conditions for when t = 0 (n = 0). I also have another solution just for i = 0 but I didn't write it out here. Is this just a matter of creating a recursive function and then using plot? Because I tried that and it isn't working for me. Any ideas on how to go about plotting this in mathematica would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! Mathematica Code (with dummy numbers for coefficients):               T[n_, i_] := T[n + 1, i] = 3*T[n, i - 1] + 2*T[n, i] +                   3*T[n, i + 1] + 4 ((300 - T[n, i]) + 8)          T[n + 1, 0] = 5*T[n, 0] + 6*(3 + 2 (300 - T[n, 0])) + 10     T[0, i] = 300      Everytime I run this, I get a recursion depth of 256 exceeded.
