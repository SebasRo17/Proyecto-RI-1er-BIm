For some weird reason, they apparently changed the styling of contours in ContourPlot for 10.0. Here is a comparison of the results for V9 and V10 (first 9, then 10):               ContourPlot[Sin[x y], {x, 0, 3}, {y, 0, 3},          ContourShading -> None,  ContourStyle -> {{Red, Thickness[0.008]}}]      ![Mathematica 9 output](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UUxhg.png) Version 9 ![Mathematica 10 output](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QxZ3N.png) Version 10 Firstly, can I override the coloring? I would like to keep the solid colors that were in V9. And secondly, where do those dark spots come from? Is this a bug? Edit: yes, this does look like a bug. The dark spots are only visible in the Mac version. Interestingly enough, for about half a second after the output appears, what I see on the screen is similar to what `Export` produces (shown below). The only difference is that the lines are thinner in the exported .png (another bug?). After those 0.5 seconds, another level of transparency kicks in and I see what is shown in the top picture below.               ContourPlot[Sin[x y], {x, 0, 3}, {y, 0, 3},          Contours -> {.9}, ContourShading -> None,          ContourStyle -> {{Red, Thickness[0.17]}}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3pz2e.png) <\- What I see. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9HQzI.png) <\- What `Export` produces.
