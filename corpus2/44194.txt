I tried solving following partial difference equation in _Mathematica_ by typing               RSolve[{C[n, k] == C[n-1, k] + C[n-1, k-1], C[n, 0] == 1, C[n, n] == 1}, C[n, k], {n, k}]      but returns the following error message > RSolve::conarg: The arguments should be ordered consistently. >> but it does not work, please someone help me in this regard. Thanks and regards in advance.
