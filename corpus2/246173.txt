I am working on an application with over one million lines of code. OPTION STRICT is set to off!. I want to set it to ON during the next work iteration. I believe the only reason OPTION STRICT should be OFF is when converting a legacy system e.g. VB6 to .NET. You should then set OPTION STRICT to ON ASAP. Am I right in this thought or do developers leave OPTION STRICT to OFF permanently? Is there any guidance. I have looked here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zcd4xwzs.aspx, but I cannot find an answer to my specific question.
