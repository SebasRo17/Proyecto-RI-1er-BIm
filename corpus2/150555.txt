I've got a job interview a few days from today (and yeah, I'm dreading it). The job is based in PHP web development. I have 3 years experience with PHP and a few other languages, but I'm only 17 so this is my first computer/programming related interview I've ever had. To be honest, it's not like a huge organization/company so I don't think the interviewer(s) expectations are going to be too high (right?).. The employer did mention on the phone that I will be asked to write some code in the interview. I've had a look around and came across the famous FizzBuzz question, which I found quite easy to do. I'm really nervous about this interview and don't want to mess it up. Can anyone give me some example questions that you would ask a PHP programmer, in an interview. Or even better, if you've been in the same situation, what kind of task(s) were you set?
