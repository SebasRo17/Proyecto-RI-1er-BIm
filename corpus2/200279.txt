When consideringen whether to use sonar or not, it would be great to see both good code as well as bad code that use sonar for static code analysis. I have browsed http://nemo.sonarsource.org/ looking for projects that have bad metrics. Unfortunately, I think that the really bad ones will probably not use code analysis at all. I have managed to find a few, but they are not as bad looking as I wanted to find. If one can find a really bad looking one and then compare it to a project with good metrics, then it would be easier to make a case as to why to use sonar in the first place. Are there any horror example projects with really bad metrics out there? I would prefer java projects. I found one with worse metrics than most, but even that isnt all that bad to me: http://nemo.sonarsource.org/dashboard/index/351728?did=1 BRs
