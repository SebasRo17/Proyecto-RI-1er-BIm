Currently I have some code like this:               OntologyGenerator generator = new OntologyGenerator();     generator.AddOntologyHeader("Testing");     generator.AddClassDeclaration(owlBuilder);     generator.AddSubClass(owlBuilder);     generator.AddAnnotationAssertions(owlBuilder);      where that OwlBuilder param you see being passed has collections of objects like this:               public class OwlLBuilder: IOwlLBuilder     {            private ICollection<IOwlClass> owlClasses = new Collection<IOwlClass>();            private ICollection<IOwlRelation>  owlRelations = new Collection<IOwlRelation> ();     }      so for example when I say generator.AddClassDeclaration(owlBuilder); it will be looping through owlClasses collection of that owlBuilder param and do some stuff to it... I feel it is an ugly design. Do you have any other better design suggestions, well with some code sample so I can have the big picture of what I should do in my head!
