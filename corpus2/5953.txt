Compare the following two code snippets : Version 1                 pts = {{1, 1}, {0.2, 0.3}, {0.5, .3}}       locpts = pts;       Panel[        LocatorPane[         Dynamic[locpts,          {(locpts = #; pts = #             ) &}],         Dynamic@          Graphics[{Point[locpts], Dynamic[Polygon[locpts]]},             PlotRange -> {{0, 1}, {0, 1}}],         LocatorAutoCreate -> All]]      Version 2                 pts = {{1, 1}, {0.2, 0.3}, {0.5, .3}}       locpts = pts;       Panel[        LocatorPane[         Dynamic[locpts,          {(locpts = #; pts = #             ) &}],             Dynamic@          Graphics[{Point[locpts], Dynamic[Polygon[pts]]},            PlotRange -> {{0, 1}, {0, 1}}],         LocatorAutoCreate -> All]]      Both versions are the same except for the third line from below where `Polygon[locpts]` was changed to `Polygon[pts]`. In the first version a delete of a locator is immediately propagated in the graphic while this is not the case in the second version. I would expect no difference since I set both `pts` and `locpts` to `#`. **Question: what is the explanation of this behavior?**
