I have been struggling lately with the whole subject of documentation at my current position. I am at a point in my programming career in which I feel I have just been birthed into the whole world of proper and effective documentation. Currently there is very little to be found in any database or source code at the company. User spec documents are generally developed in email threads, on a good day. I wonder, am I to blame for having not been strict with myself on this issue? Is it the responsibility of the programmer to maintain this and update where needed or found lacking? I have come to the realization that the best way to approach documenting is to pretend that you have one foot out the door, and another soul will have to take over your work. Thoughts?
