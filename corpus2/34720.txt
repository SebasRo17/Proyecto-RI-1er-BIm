What I'm trying to find are the 4 letter words in the _mathematica dictionary_ that have the most anagrams and the amount of anagrams these have each. But I can't seem to find all the 4 letter words in the mathematica dictionary. My output only results in 3-8 letter words. Input is below                wordperms =Flatten[Map[DictionaryLookup,Map[StringJoin, Permutations[Characters[#]]]]] &;      words = DictionaryLookup[];      sorted = Sort[Map[Sort, Map[Characters, words]]];      Part[Select[Tally@sorted, Part[#, 2] > 4 &], All, 1];      found = Part[Select[Tally@sorted, Part[#, 2] > 4 &], All, 1];      Map[wordperms, found]
