I have integro-differential equations like this:               γ = 0.1;     κ = 0.15;     g = 0.2;     δ = 0.2 + 0.6 I;          eqns = {        x'[t] == -γ x[t] - g Re@z[t],        y'[t] == -κ y[t] + g Re@z[t],        z[t] ==          Integrate[(x[τ] -              y[τ]) Exp[ -δ (t - τ)], {τ, 0, t}]        };          ints = {        x[0] == 1,        y[0] == 0        };          NDSolve[Join[eqns, ints], {x, y}, {t, 0, 10}]      I don't know how to use _Mathematica_ to solve it or if it can be solved at all using some combinations of built-in functions? To solve integro-differential equations in _Mathematica_ is important to me for studying some special physical models.
