We have a one-variable equation $\rho(R)$ where               œÅ = (14656.4+277.526*R^2)/(45.9225+R^2)^{5/2} + 0.370036/(R*(0.25+R)^3)      This equations describes the evolution of a density distribution, and as the following plot shows, the value of $\rho$ decreases rapidly with increasing $R$. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HIAny.jpg) Usually density distributions drop following a law $R^{-k}$. So, is it possible to use _Mathematica_ in order to determine the falling law at large radii $R$ in this case? In other words, to determine the values of $k$. **EDIT** Following @Vitaliy Kaurov solution I got the desired value of $k$. At the following plot, the red line corresponds to $277.526/R^3$ and as we can see it fully coincides with $\rho(R)$. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Jkcue.jpg)
