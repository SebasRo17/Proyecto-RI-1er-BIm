I've written a Mathlink program that is called from Mathematica 9. It works very well but currently uses double precision numbers in the C++ function. I've already replaced them with floats in C++ and corrected the .tm files ArgumentTypes to `:ArgumentTypes: { Real32List, Integer, Real32 }` But when calling the function within Mathematica like `MyFunction[{1.,2.,3.},100,99.]` it just returns the input - therefor a data type missmatch occurs. Can anyone tell me how to pass the numbers as Real32? It's quite important to use 32 bit floating point numbers since I am doing calculations on a GPU that has a significatly better single precision performance. Thanks //template file:               void calc P((float *, int, int, float));          :Begin:     :Function:       calc     :Pattern:        Calc[a_List, b_Integer, c_Real32]     :Arguments:      { a, b, c}     :ArgumentTypes:  { Real32List, Integer, Real32 }     :ReturnType:     Manual     :End:
