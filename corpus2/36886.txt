I use a list of variables `{x1, x2, x3}` to `Solve` a particular set of equations. I am now trying to generalise this depending on the number of equations. I need something along the lines of `Table[{"x" i}, {i,1,Length[equations]}]` which prints `{x1, x2, x3, x4,...}` etc. However, `"x" i` obviously does not work. Nor does `x[[i]]` as `{x[[1]], x[[2]], x[[3]]}` won't work in `Solve`. Any quick thoughts? Thank you.
