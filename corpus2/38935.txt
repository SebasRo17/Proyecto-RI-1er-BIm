The command `Export["filename.jpg", graphic]` will export the graphic object `graphic` to the file `filename.jpg` in versions > 8 (at least). TIFF's are also used. I am interested in georeferenced bitmaps which can be used with various GIS's, and the default export command does not produce appropriate files. Has anybody found a way of exporting graphics in such a way that they are georeferenced?
