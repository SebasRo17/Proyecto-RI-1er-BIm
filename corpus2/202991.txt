Microsoft employees commonly describe Windows 8 as having both a Render thread and UI thread. Typically they say the Render thread performs animations and the UI thread handles most other operations: parsing, layout, applying templates, data binding, input processing, most app callbacks, etc. > Animations can be calculated from beginning to end when they are created. > Sometimes the changes to the property being animated donâ€™t affect rest of > the objects in a scene. These are called independent animations and they are > run on the **composition thread instead of the UI thread**. This guarantees > that they remain smooth because the composition thread is updated at a > consistent cadence... Is this a common architecture or unique to Windows 8? What about Windows Phone 8? Android? iOS?
