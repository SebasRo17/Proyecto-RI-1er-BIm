My current organization has stated clearly that I should not work on any freelancing projects in the fields where the company offers their service. I agreed to that and joined the organization. At the time of joining, I also mentioned that I am a member of an NGO for last two years, not as a programmer but giving my social services there. They agreed to that and everything is working smoothly. But recently my NGO has decided to build their site. I was called to be a part of programming team but I refused because of that condition. The NGO agreed and excluded me from the programming team. But they insisted on me being a translator and requested that I arrange for translators from other languages. I had managed to bring a team of translators. Now my NGO is planning to make me head of translation team because they felt being a programmer and translator both I can be a bridge between two teams. Here is dilemma begins, my company is in website development business but they don't offer translation service. For the NGO website I am going to be credited for translation. Here my company is very strict on freelancing rules. But I am bit optimistic that they will allow me to be part of the NGO project which in sense not going to compete with any of their products. They are strict in freelancing and I am sure that they are not going to allow me. If anything goes wrong, on the other side, I don't see any legal problems in doing this and am excited to be a part of the website. What would you do if you faced this situation?
