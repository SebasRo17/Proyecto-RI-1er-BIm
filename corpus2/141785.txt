A few times in the past I've hit a major wall and simply couldn't progress with a certain aspect of an app as Im a beginner and still learning the ropes (Objective-C specifically). I was curious if anyone knows of any services which support programmers in real time, paid or free and will over video, audio or text chat sit and work a problem out till its fixed and look through your code? I understand Stackoverflow does a super job at this! However Im in need of something a little more tailored where someone can spend a little time to sit and look and what Im dealing with and delve into my a code if need be. Thanks.
