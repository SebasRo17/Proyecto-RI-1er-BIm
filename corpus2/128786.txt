I was recently assigned a task of managing a small project. The project has some technological aspects but the job is mainly doing managerial things: scheduling, making sure people do what they are suppose to, going to a lot of meetings, etc. Basically, it's not how the average programmer or even a team leader would like to spend his time. Since I am not going to sneak out of this, I have found myself wishing I could teleport myself to some point of time after the project has ended. After pondering about it some more, I reached the conclusion that **I hate working like that** and I can't allow myself to work on a project that makes me think this way. **I have to make the most out of this project.** So my goal is to make the most out of this unwanted project. How do I do that? I thought about writing every day a "What I have learned today" list, that will help me see clearly that I am learning from this and not wasting my skills. Do you have any recommendations on what can I do?
