> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  What to plan before starting development on a project? I was wondering when you start developing a software what process should you generally go through to do it? By this I mean after you get an idea, do you just sit down and start pushing out code directly, or is there some planning process that you should generally go through first? (i.e. flowcharts, diagrams etc.) Just wondering because I just had an idea and am about to embark on my first "real" application but have no idea where to begin. What would you suggest is the steps that should be taken to have a successful developmental cycle?
