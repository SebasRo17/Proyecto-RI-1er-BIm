My java code is just like below:               public void check()throws  MissingParamException{         ......     }     public static void main(){         PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();         try {             check();         } catch (MissingParamException e) {             // TODO Auto-generated catch block             out.println("message:"+e.getMessage());             e.printStackTrace();             out.close();         }finally{             out.close();         }         //out.close();     }      Then, my confusion is: what the difference if I put `out.close()` in a finally code block or if I just remove finally code block and put `out.close()` behind catch clause (which has been commented in the code). I know that in both ways, the `out.close()` will be executed because I know that whether the exception happened, the code behind the catch clause will always be executed.
