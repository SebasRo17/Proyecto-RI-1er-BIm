So, I'm preparing to consider the outcome of training a lot of people (>25) to use **Mercurial** coming from a centralized mindset. I've done it with **individuals** and had success with it, although the time invested in each one has been different and most of them have been both proactive and open to trying something new. I was wondering if there was someone here with experience giving such training to a large group of people **as I would like to find out what are the do's and don'ts... of course, this would be more oriented towards dealing with those resistant to change** , and a don't I can come to think of is telling them to avoid cheat-sheets mapping commands, as Joel Spolsky suggests.
