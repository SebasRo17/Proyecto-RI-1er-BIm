I know what I'm doing can be done with `Total`:               a = Range@3;     Total@a      And if I simply choose `Sum`, nothing wrong will happen:               a = Range@3;     Sum[a[[i]], {i, 3}]      `N@Sum` is still OK:               a = Range@3;     N@Sum[a[[i]], {i, 3}]      But when it's changed to `NSum`, a warning message comes out though I still get the correct result:               a = Range@3;     NSum[a[[i]], {i, 3}]      > Part::pspec: Part specification i is neither an integer nor a list of > integers. I found if I add a `Hold`, I can avoid the warning:               a = Range@3;     NSum[Hold@a[[i]], {i, 3}]      But I still want to know the exact reason.
