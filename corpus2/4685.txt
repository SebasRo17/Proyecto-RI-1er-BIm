Consider the following `InputField`               InputField[Dynamic[h2,       If[# === Null, h2 = h2, h2 = Round[#, 0.001]] &], Number]      The purpose of the second argument of Dynamic is to avoid someone entering a value with more than 3 decimal places (or emptying the field after some value has been assigned). For example, entering 0.4691 immediately reassigns the `InputField` to 0.469. The problem is that entering the number 0.468 renders 0.4680000000000001. I imagine itâ€™s something to do with the representation of 0.468 in binary, etc. How can I avoid this after rounding action? **EDIT:** After some more testings, I see that it is the `Number` part that is causing the problem. This works "badly":               InputField[Dynamic[h2], Number]      This works OK:               InputField[Dynamic[h2]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OsCUs.gif) If you do `Do[h2 = i; Pause[0.1], {i, 0.04, 0.08, 0.001}]`, you can get a good picture of the problem: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Rgx0h.gif) How can I avoid this `Number` side effect?
