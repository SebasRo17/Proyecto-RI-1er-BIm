I have to write a decent size database, 1GB more or less. I have only taken an introductory semester regarding SQL databases. During the course we learned that the relational model under SQL has no implied order and that therefore when querying we should always have a variable that sets the correspondant order in the table. However, when doing practical work I find 'convenient' to make already ordered small, infinite number of tables. For example, lets say that you have 5 clients and that their info will never join their data together. Is it admissible to have a potentially infinite number of tables with a table per client? For example, I append new rows already ordered to the database. The database is already ordered. Is it admissible to make an unordered query and just assume that is implicitly ordered? All this violates the principles that I know. My boss, who does not know about databases says that if it works it works and that speed is important. What shall answer to him?
