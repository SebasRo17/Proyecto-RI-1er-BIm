_**UPDATE_** While the self-posted answer below (`TickLabelStyle->TraditionalForm`) works for most things, it also has the following effect: Integers are given periods in the label. That is, if the ticks would be at `{1,2,3,4}`, the labels are given as `{"1.","2.","3.","4."}` instead of the more pleasing `{"1","2","3","4"}`. Is there a better form or formatting function to use in this case? * * * I'm using the CustomTicks package from LevelScheme, and am having problems with displaying things when the range is very small ($10^{-11}$). For example, with default Mathematica:               ListPlot[{RandomReal[#], RandomReal[#]} & /@ (Range[100] 10^-10),       Frame -> True, Axes -> False]      Gives ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gjGe4.png) While the equivalent, reproducible CustomTicks equivalent is:               ListPlot[{RandomReal[#], RandomReal[#]} & /@ (Range[100] 10^-10),       Frame -> True, Axes -> False,       FrameTicks -> {LinTicks, LinTicks, StripTickLabels@LinTicks,         StripTickLabels@LinTicks}]      which gives: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/67jnI.png) Erk. I must be missing something from the documentation, but I can't seem to find the right options. I want to eventually set more options for LinTicks (such as Tick length, etc), but this is a minimal example, and once this is solved, I can work on adding those options. I can also double check that the range is set correctly by doing things slightly more by hand:               In[11]:= data = {RandomReal[#],           RandomReal[#]} & /@ (Range[100] 10^-10);     xRange = {Min@data[[All, 1]], Max@data[[All, 1]]}     yRange = {Min@data[[All, 2]], Max@data[[All, 2]]}          Out[12]= {3.82894*10^-11, 9.18792*10^-9}          Out[13]= {5.96584*10^-12, 9.54224*10^-9}               In[14]:= ticks = FrameTicks -> {         LinTicks[xRange[[1]], xRange[[2]], MajorTickLength -> {0, 0.015},      MinorTickLength -> {0, 0.005}],         LinTicks[yRange[[1]], yRange[[2]], MajorTickLength -> {0, 0.015},      MinorTickLength -> {0, 0.005}],         StripTickLabels@LinTicks[xRange[[1]], xRange[[2]]],         StripTickLabels@LinTicks[yRange[[1]], yRange[[2]]]     }      Output omitted, but the range from LinTicks is correct. The x axis is $2\times 10^{-9}$ to $9\times 10^{-9}$, so they should output fine.               ListPlot[data, Frame -> True, Axes -> False, ticks]      Gives ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7GZPW.png) Any ideas?
