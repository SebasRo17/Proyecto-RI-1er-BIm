I am trying to make a legend for my plot. Actually, I made one, but I cannot understand why there are such big spaces between the legend positions.               Graphics[Legend[{        {Graphics[{CapForm[None], Red, Thickness -> 0.05,            Line[{{0, 1}, {1, 1}}]}], "A"},        {Graphics[{CapForm[None], Blue, Thickness -> 0.05,            Line[{{0, 1}, {1, 1}}]}], "B"},        {Graphics[{CapForm[None], Green, Thickness -> 0.1,            Line[{{0, 1}, {1, 1}}]}], "C"}        }, LegendTextSpace -> 0.25]]      Results in: ![wrong legend](http://i.stack.imgur.com/kBdpQ.png)
