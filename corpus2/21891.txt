Dr Bjarne Stroustrup in his book D&E says > Several reviewers asked me to compare C++ to other languages. This I have > decided against doing. Thereby, I have reaffirmed a long-standing and > strongly held view: "Language comparisons are rarely meaningful and even > less often fair" . A good comparison of major programming languages requires > more effort than most people are willing to spend, experience in a wide > range of application areas, a rigid maintenance of a detached and impartial > point of view, and a sense of fairness. I do not have the time, and as the > designer of C++, my impartiality would never be fully credible. > > -- The Design and Evolution of C++(Bjarne Stroustrup) Do you people agree with his this statement "`Language comparisons are rarely meaningful and even less often fair`"? Personally I think that comparing a language X with Y makes sense because it gives many more reasons to love/despise X/Y `:-P` What do you people think?
