The problem is `0(TAB)0` interpreted falsely as a dark red square although it should be a dark red square surrounded by zeroes/ones. Import has different data-formats such as Data and Matrix but I don't know which one this is: ASCII? So how can I import the below type data as a text-file to Mathematica and get the goal-style matrixplot? Is there some format command to specify the structure of the data for importing? **Goal** ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/sUi6E.jpg) **Failure** ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Mj5P7.png) **Data**               0,0,1,1,1,1,0   0,1,1,1,1,1,0     0,0,1,1,1,1,0   0,0,1,1,1,1,0     0,0,0,0,1,1,0   0,0,0,1,1,1,0     0,0,0,0,1,1,0   0,0,0,0,1,1,0     0,0,0,0,0,1,0   0,0,0,0,0,0,0     0,0,0,0,0,0,0   0,0,0,0,0,0,0     1,1,1,1,1,1,0   1,1,1,1,1,1,0      > ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Zc8x1.png)
