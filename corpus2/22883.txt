I would like to take the acetone $((CH_3)_2CO)$ and chloroform $(HCl_3)$ molecules that Mathematica's chemical data provides, and plot them together. I want to show how chloroform can hydrogen bond to acetone. Right now I have them plotted on top of each other :/               Show[ChemicalData["Chloroform", "MoleculePlot"],       ChemicalData["Acetone", "MoleculePlot"]]      ![acetone and chloroform](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FhGDS.jpg)
