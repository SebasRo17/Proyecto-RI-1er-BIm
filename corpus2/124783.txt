I've read here on P.SE more questions in which beginner programmers are advised to pick Python as their first programming language. Don't get me wrong, I like Python. I like it a lot! But its philosophy revolves around "We are all consenting adults here". From an experience/knowledge point of view, a beginner programmer is not an adult. Which then kinda means it is easier to shoot yourself in the foot and pick up some bad habits even if you survive the wound. I'm thinking that in a "more static" language it would be harder to shoot yourself in the foot as it will be more restrictive. Back to my question. Why is Python recommended as an entry level programming language? What are the points that make it good for teaching a programming language. Or... is it personal preference of the adviser?
