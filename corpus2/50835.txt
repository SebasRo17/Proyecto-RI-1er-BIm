I have a number of foss tools I have written and have released but under aliases. I guess I am worried that the code is not my absolute best and is not the most robust code around. So I have always thought it was best to keep it hidden and away from my name. Though I now am wondering if having any code at all puts you about those who have none in this competitive job market? My code is not bad, it works and works well. But lets just say every circumstance may not be handled in a robust way. Some parts are well written while others are hacked together. So is it better to have something while it may not be your absolute best rather than nothing?
