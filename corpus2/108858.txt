Did a search for Patchers and didn't find anything. But seriously Patchers: How do they work? I've done some googling, and i've gotten mixed results. I mean it seems they probably have some way of going in and changing the files (maybe comparing what is different between the files) but it seems like there is probably more going on than that. Or is it really as simple as running a diff. vs another file....and then applying the changes?
