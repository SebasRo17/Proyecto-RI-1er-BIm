I'm using DatabaseLink to query MS SQL Server with SQLExecute which works totaly fine, for ex.:               SQLExecute[conn, "declare @dt date;     select * from ttable where date=@dt"]      However the problem starts when i try to use table variable and try to return it, for ex.:               SQLExecute[conn, "declare @dt date;     declare @tab table(     var1 int     date date)     insert into @tab     select * from ttable where date=@dt;     select * from @tab"]      It returns the number of rows and not the table. Is there a way to solve that? It seems that Mathematica returns results for the 'insert' statement, not the final results.
