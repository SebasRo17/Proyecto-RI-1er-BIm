I'm trying to re-write a backend interface doohickey for a calendar, a todo list and another sort of calendar and found that they all were programmed to have subtly different formats for patterns of dates that could be used to configure certain properties in them. I have three screens that have different ways of essentially doing the same thing:   1. ![Calendar](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mtAdU.png)   2. ![Scheduler](http://i.stack.imgur.com/63x5L.png)   3. ![Todo](http://i.stack.imgur.com/M3Lw8.png) and they essentially have the same information. I've got objects for all these, but what I'd like to do is serialize the objects, not to bytecode, but to a semi-human readable format that could be transferred between not only these three screens, but stored as one field in a database and XML.
