We are in the process of building a stock market simulation game. The frontend design is ready but we are clueless about how exactly the back-end algorithms are to be designed. What algorithms should we be looking at implementing in order to get this working? We're coding in PHP/RoR/Python. If there's an open source system that already exists that we could look at that would be an added bonus.
