I've rolled out a few CDF's to end users. See earlier posts: suppress message and which player platform. Now, an end user reports that they can't open more than one CDF document at a time. The player just switches documents instead of showing a second window. I use a iMac and I can run two CDF documents at a time side by side without any problem. This might not deliver the most objective test because I do have a full version of Mathematica running on the machine, which could affect how may CDF documents one can run at one time. The end user runs a Windows machine. Has anyone else run up against this? Does anyone know of a work around? * * * Some additional information: My end user runs Windows 7 professional version 6.1.
