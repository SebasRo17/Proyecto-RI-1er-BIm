I am working on a program with two views, html and ajax (which will be html transmitted via json). The HTML view is the standard, and by default the ajax should look the same. However, the ajax view is also meant to have options configurable on the client side for which components of the page should be displayed. I'm having trouble wrapping my head around making an elegant way to handle this requirement. Is there a standard way to handle related views like this?
