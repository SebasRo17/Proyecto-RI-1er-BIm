What is the best way to populate an upper triangular (or alternatively: lower triangular or symmetric) matrix from a vector of elements? This example input:               {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}      should give               {{0, 1, 2, 3},      {0, 0, 4, 5},      {0, 0, 0, 6},      {0, 0, 0, 0}}      or alternatively               {{0, 1, 2, 3},       {1, 0, 4, 5},       {2, 4, 0, 6},       {3, 5, 6, 0}}      or even               {{0, 0, 0, 0},      {1, 0, 0, 0},      {2, 3, 0, 0},      {4, 5, 6, 0}}      This problem has many solutions of course. I'm looking for the best (criteria: most elegant/readable, shortest, fastest) ones. The input has length $\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$. Consider $n$ known. Feel free to use any version 10 functionality.
