There's been a buzz in my local tech community about being an 'Efficient Java Programmer' can someone explain to me what is an Efficient Java Programmer? what is their difference between average java programmers? how can you be an Efficient Java Programmer? (I am still in college, I want to get acustomed to doing the proper practices when it comes to programming) and how can you tell someone is an efficient java programmer?
