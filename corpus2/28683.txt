I am new to _Mathematica_ and there is a behavior that I don't understand. When I insert the code:               Solve[-(x - 2)^3 + 10 x - 10 == 0, x]      I obtain: > >     {{x -> 2 + (2 5^(2/3))/(3 (9 + I Sqrt[39]))^(1/3) + (5 (9 + I > Sqrt[39]))^(1/3)/3^(2/3)},   >     {x -> 2 - (5^(2/3) (1 + I Sqrt[3]))/   >       (3 (9 + I Sqrt[39]))^(1/3) - ((1 - I Sqrt[3]) (5 (9 + I > Sqrt[39]))^(1/3))/(2 3^(2/3))},   >     {x ->  2 - (5^(2/3) (1 - I Sqrt[3]))/ >       (3 (9 + I Sqrt[39]))^(1/3) - ((1 + I Sqrt[3]) (5 (9 + I > Sqrt[39]))^(1/3))/(2 3^(2/3))}} >   These are complex roots, but this polynomial has real roots, that in fact I can correctly find when I use Root. Why are this complex roots being displayed? Are these supposed to be approximations? **Edit:** Thanks for the answer, now I understand better the underlying process and that Solve is in fact finding exact solutions. The "approximate zero" in the imaginary component comes from the numerical solution to the exact root, not from Solve. It can removed by using `Chop` as described here.
