How might I detect when an `InputField` comes into focus? For example ideally something like this would work.               EventHandler[      InputField["default", String], {       "FocusGained" :> (MessageDialog["Focus"]),       "FocusLost" :> (MessageDialog["unFocus"]),       "Focus" :> (MessageDialog["Focus"])       }      ]      After reading this question I assumed "FocusGained,FocusLost or Focus" would do something but I haven't had any luck just yet.
