Few days ago I stopped on some PHP's developers quide (for contributors to particular project) and it stated, that `elseif` must be strictly used instead of `else if` \-- without giving any reason, why? Can someone clarify this? I don't see neither much difference nor any argument supporting this. Info: _I believe, there are more languages, than just PHP, that this problem strikes, that's why I asked here, not on Stack Overflow. Feel free to migrate, if necessary._
