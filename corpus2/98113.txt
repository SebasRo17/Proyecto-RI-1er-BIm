my friend has developed a CAD program in C, here it is http://web2coders.jrcw3.com/ i have convinced him to go open source, but we have some concerns:   * if you upload a project to sourceforge or github would you be able to know who's participating and if his version is good?    * if you have many versions being developed by other programmers, how to know which is the best version, which has too many bugs and so on, do you have to read every version or is there a faster way? I really hope that this question will not be closed, because i have asked it in other places and no one answered, so stackoverflow is my last chance to get an answer
