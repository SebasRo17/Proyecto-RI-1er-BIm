There might be a situation where one of my clients won't pay for the web site that I've made. So I am wondering if it is possible to sell a web site? It is an internet shop, so there is no content that comes with it, but the source code is fully available, and it has a decent design. I've seen people trying to sell web site templates, and I've seen people who try to sell already running web sites, and there are plenty of commercial web site engines out there. But what about raw empty web sites, is there a market for them?
