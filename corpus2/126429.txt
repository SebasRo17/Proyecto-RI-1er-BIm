I'm hoping that this is the right place to ask this question, but my company has recently started a process to look at how we build software, from the tools we use to the methodology. As you can imagine we have the kind of endless meetings where we sit around a table and split hairs. In an effort to actually get something done I've suggested we hire in a professional to take a look at how we do what we do and maybe guide us into a more agile approach to delivering software. My problem is that I'm not sure how to find a consultant we could bring in and get us started? I was thinking of approaching someone like ThoughtWorks, but I think finding someone who isn't going to push an agenda or product on us would be better. In the meantime I've picked up a few books and will do a bit of reading on the beach over the holiday vacation.
