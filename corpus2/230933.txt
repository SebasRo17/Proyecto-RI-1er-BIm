I'm currently programming Java, I have played around with C++ before, but I have never touched GUI as I feel "cheat-like" when using its drag and drop system. I feel good and enjoy programming my own GUI like I do in Java, it feels much more rewarding. Is there any way I can program the GUI for C#/C++ like in Java, without the drag and drop system, and if so could someone possibly recommend me a tutorial (A lot of the tutorials are using the drag and drop system)? So far I have tried researching this and really can't find much explaining how I would do it.
