I am creating a widget for rotating topics. The functionality is as follows:   * Each topic is displayed one by one on the homepage and has a duration of 30 seconds.   * A countdown timer is displayed on the page. When it reaches zero the current topic gets marked as "shown" and the next topic is displayed.   * Users can choose to "like" topics, in which case the topic gets an additional 5 seconds duration (the countdown timer needs to update itself at this point).   * The countdown timer always needs to display the current allocated duration for the topic, so for example if a user "likes" a topic then people accessing the site should instantly see the updated duration for that topic. Basically everything needs to be shown in "realtime". The topics are stored in a MySQL database. I am having trouble with the last two points in the above. The way I have tried to do it so far is to have an AJAX request which is sent every second to deduct 1 second from the current topic duration. The request response is the current topic duration. The problem with this is that it will only work so long as somebody is accessing the site. I know I can probably create a CRON script to run this process in the background, but for it to run every second would be a bit crazy. There has got to a be a much simpler solution to this problem. What would be the most efficient way to go about this?
