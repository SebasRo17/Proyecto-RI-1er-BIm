I started working for a start-up company. Generally the pace is very fast and have a lot of expectations. This is different for me since I used to work for a big company with a lot of structure and the pace was not that high.   From discussions with other collegues (not within the new company of course), my conclusion is that it is easy to lose your job in a start-up. I guess this makes some sense since the company "struggles" to survive.   What I would like to know is if in general, if indeed this is the case and it is easy to get laid off, is one usually warned if he is up to the expectations or not in order for him to improve? Or there is no such warnings?   Well if they are not satisfied do they tell you? Would it be possible to not be satisfied and hide it? And then just let you go?   Is constant/adequate feedback of employee's performance part of a start up's mentality?   I am looking for advice from colleagues with more experience on this.   Any input/advice is highly appreciated.
