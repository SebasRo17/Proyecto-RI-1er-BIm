I want to `LogPlot` a function, but I have the trouble in the number format in the ticks. For example,               LogPlot[Abs[BesselJ[1, x] Sin[x]^2], {x, -10, 10},        Frame -> True, FrameTicks -> {{Automatic, None}, {None, None}}]      The output is ![Plot output](http://i.stack.imgur.com/NRMnW.jpg) If I use the command               LogPlot[Abs[BesselJ[1, x] Sin[x]^2], {x, -10, 10}, Frame -> True,         FrameTicks -> {         {{#, HoldForm[#]} & /@ {10^0, 10^-1, 10^-2, 10^-3, 10^-4, 10^-5}, None},         {None, None}        }     ]      I can get ![Plot output](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zoMBJ.jpg) Actually, I prefer the all the ticks in the form of `10^n`, and none of the commands shown above works. Is there any simple and clever way to cope with it? I'll be grateful for your reply.
