I have two matrices a = m x 5 and b =m x 5 (m is large, say 1,000) which are already sorted as below: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BRXlm.png) How to generate a new matrix c = m x 5 which consists: Column 1: exact replica of Column 1 of matrix a.   Column 2: Depends on non-zero elements of b as shown   so that it is adjusted by it's left hand side row of a - b + present row.   Zeros are not evaluated. (example: 3.7107 - 2.96856 + 23.2988 = 24.0409 ) Columns 3 4 and 5, not sure yet so maybe start off with a SparseArray of m x 5? But most likely to be an extension of Column 2. i.e. Column 3,4 and 5 will be also adjusted once I have worked out how they need to adjusted by. EDITED 31/12/2012 03:25am UK time: Solution from @halirutan is partially correct because my input matrix a: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/q0Xli.png) and matrix b: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qBEU2.png) gives matrix c: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4yvYy.png) Not sure how to do conditional check for column b to be non-zero before evaluating?
