Can DI/IoC be used for a simplified, local SOA? I have been reading up on SOA (examples: here, here and here) and it seems that at first a lot of the attention was at interoperability and enabeling distribution of tasks by using standard message-formats and transfer-protocols (web- _services_ ). Later the crux has been to achieve loose coupling: To find principles for partitioning business-logic, manage dependencies and how and when to share data between parts. Is this a correct description? How is this related to DI/IoC? For a system with low performance requirements would it be a simplification to use DI as a "message broker", and asynchronous events to do "pub/sub" and only break out a service and go across an ESB or such as required by integrations?
