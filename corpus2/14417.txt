I tried to compute $$\int_{-1}^1 d x_1 \int_{-1}^1 d x_2 \int_{-1}^1 d y_1 \int_{-1}^1 d y_2 \theta(x_1 x_2 + y_1 y_2)\,$$ where $\theta$ is Heaviside's step function, by using               Integrate[HeavisideTheta[x1 x2+y1 y2],{x1,-1,1},{x2,-1,1},{y1,-1,1},{y2,-1,1}]      but it took forever to evaluate. I didn't have the patience to wait until the end. However,               Integrate[Boole[x1 x2+y1 y2 >= 0],{x1,-1,1},{x2,-1,1},{y1,-1,1},{y2,-1,1}]      was very quick. Can anybody explain this strange behavior?
