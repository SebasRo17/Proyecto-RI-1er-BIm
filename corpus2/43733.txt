After reading http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2326609/how-to-organize- matlab-cod, I had a follow up question. If you work in a group of MATLAB programmers, who enforces the organization of the shared MATLAB code and project matfiles? For example do you have a dedicated MATLAB IT person, or does the most senior programmer issue guidelines that everyone must follow, or does everyone agree to follow a system? In my small group, each person has their own 'system'. MATLAB code and project matfiles are either piled into a shared drive or tucked away on people's own computers. Hard to recreate work done by another person, or even to locate their code. There were lots of good suggestions on how to get organized. But it seems like someone has to make the trains run on time. Who does it in your group?
