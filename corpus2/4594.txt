I would like to open an Excel file and manipulate it as a COM object. While I'm able to open an instance of excel with               Needs["NETLink`"]     InstallNET[]     excel = CreateCOMObject["Excel.Application"]      This doesn't work for me:                wb = excel@Workbooks@Open["D:\\prices.csv"]      Producing these errors:               NET::netexcptn: A .NET exception occurred: System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException (0x80028018): Old format or invalid type library. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80028018 (TYPE_E_INVDATAREAD))        at Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Workbooks.Open(String Filename, Object UpdateLinks, Object ReadOnly, Object Format, Object Password, Object WriteResPassword, Object IgnoreReadOnlyRecommended, Object Origin, Object Delimiter, Object Editable, Object Notify, Object Converter, Object AddToMru, Object Local, Object CorruptLoad). Is this a known problem? I would very much appreciate any ideas on how to open an excel file with Mathematica as a COM object.
