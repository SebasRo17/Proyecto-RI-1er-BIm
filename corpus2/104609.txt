I'd like to build a bitmap during runtime. The bitmap should be scalable on all sides and pixel access should be quiet efficient. ![Some illustration](http://img546.imageshack.us/img546/4995/maptm.jpg) Between and after the commands shown in the picture, Map.setPixel() and Map.getPixel() should set/return data saved in the bitmap. I don't expect an implementation just a concept how to allocate memory in such a way that the setPixel()/getPixel is as fast as possible.
