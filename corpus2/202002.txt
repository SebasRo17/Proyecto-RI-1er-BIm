I am reading a Binary file, it has several blocks, each block has different names/data. Some of this data is string value, date, datetime, time but most of them are integer value. Previously I code a struct for each Block and create public member to hold each property of that block, and then I make a Wrapper class this wrapper class has Object of each Block Class and we assign values within this wrapper class to keep complete file in one object. Now, I am looking for more efficient way of doing it as our previous code was not very efficient and I have to rewrite all Block classes, but just thought if there is easy and more efficient way of doing it. Maybe I should use List or Dictionary object instead ? What you think is best of doing it. Btw my files are 100MB + and hence it is lot of data as file is binary when it is 100MB :).
