I have a dynamic plot. I want to set an initial image size and then be able to resize it by dragging with the mouse. When the image is updated, I want to maintain the "dragged" size. A naive attempt with a simplified example:               Slider[Dynamic[n], {0, 5}]     Dynamic[Plot[n (x - n)^2, {x, 0, 5}, ImageSize -> Large]]      It sets ImageSize->Large. I can resize the plot by select and dragging, but as soon as I change n with the slider, the plot is evaluated and the size reverts to Large. So how can I apply setting ImageSize->Large only as an initial condition and keep the "dragged" size as n changes? Thanks in advance for your expert help!
