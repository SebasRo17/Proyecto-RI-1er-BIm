I am working on a graph, and I am using _Mathematica_ function `FindGraphCommunities` to analyze the properties of this graph, but I have no idea about the algorithm used by _Mathematica_ , and the documentation center is not clear enough. So I decide to look at the defintion of this function to better understand it. I have found a serialized package called "network"(\Mathematica\9.0\SystemFiles\Kernel\SystemResources\Windows\Network) containing files with the MX extension. I opened it with `Import`, but I can not read the files and the defintion of function. My goal is to understand how this function is coded to improve my understanding of what I do with my graph. Hope this is clear.
