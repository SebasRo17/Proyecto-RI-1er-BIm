I am trying to design an algorithm for _optimal sensor placement_ in a given area. After doing some research I found the _Art Gallery Problem_. However, this problem assumes that the guards can see all the way to the perimeter from their positions, which is not the case with sensors (sensors have a range). Is it possible to solve the optimal sensor placement problem by mapping it to an art gallery problem, and trying some recursive solution? I would be grateful if someone could throw some light on this question or guide me to appropriate resource.
