I've been doing web development, and backend Java development, professionally for about 5 years now. My passion has always been closer to the metal though. Applying to embedded jobs has not been successful, and I believe it's because I lack experience. Perhaps there are open source projects I should undertake to show that I'm serious? How does one make a transition from being a web developer to an embedded developer?
