(I'm hoping this question is not hopelessly naive...) My understanding is that `Plot`'s strategy is to generate a list of abscissas, evaluate the argument expression at those abscissas, and from that point on behave pretty much like ListPlot with the list of abscissa-ordinate pairs as input. (More or less.) Assuming that the sketch above is not fantastically off-base, what algorithm does `Plot` use to compute the list of abscissas to use?
