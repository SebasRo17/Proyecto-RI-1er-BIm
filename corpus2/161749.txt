We are a team of developers working on multiple small projects - a developer could have 3 or more 1 man projects to work on and keep moving. It can feel like your time is pretty fragmented & interrupted moving between project to project. Sometimes frustrating, stressful & overwhelming. In an ideal world it wouldn't be this way but it appears to be very common. When you are in a setup where it can't be avoided, how do you make the best of it? I'm looking for ideas/tips/methods that will help increase productivity & reduce stress specifically in multi-tasking environments. DOs and DON'Ts etc. What boundaries, limits should be in place? Which development methodologies will & won't work? What do you know that does WORK? Is there any good way to organise this kind of environment to be maximum productive?
