This is a re-post of Blueplastic's question from SO, which was closed. I think this is a excellent question and I would like to hear what people thinks. To expand this further, look at the patent that Yahoo is suing Facebook for: http://paidcontent.org/article/419-meet-the-10-patents-yahoo-is-using-to-sue- facebook/ Some of these patent are so broad and I wouldn't be surprised that many developers could inadvertently developed their application to function in such a way. I understand that patent is supposed to protect intellectual property and promote innovation. However, it seems that if certain popular techniques are patented, it will become a hindrance to innovation.   * What if there is a patent on URL shortening?   * What if there is a patent on WYSIWYG editor?   * What if GO4 patented their design patterns? I am not a lawyer so these items may not be patent-able, but that's also part of the question I guess. **Edit** Anothe excellent article discussing the issue: http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2012/03/opinion-baio-yahoo-patent-lie/ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6052154/what-does-facebooks-new-photo- tagging-patent-mean-for-developers > Yesterday it was published that Facebook has gotten a patent for tagging > people in pictures: http://www.insidefacebook.com/2011/05/17/facebook- > patent-photo-tagging/ > > What does this mean for other developers? > > So, if I want to make a web-based photo sharing application where I want to > let users tag their friends, does it mean that I have to give Facebook > royalties? > > I believe iPhoto and Picasa also have people tagging features.
