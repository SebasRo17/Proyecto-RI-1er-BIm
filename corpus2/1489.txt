If I'm generating a table from a slow function, like this:               foo = Table[SuperSlowExpression, {1000}]      is there a way to determine _after submission_ (so it is too late to instrument the call) to find out how many values already have been generated (so that when it takes longer than expected I can find out whether to wait a bit longer or to abort the calculation)? So is there still a way to get at the information? Note that there is no iteration variable in the call which I could read. Optimally, I'd also want to get the already calculated values, of course. **Edit:** Since this seems to have been consistently overlooked: **This is about a calculation which is already running. It is no longer possible to make changes to the call of`Table` or to the expression inside.**
