I was just learning about sqlite in android programming from the New Boston Travis videos and I have come across something strange: It is said that if the database does not already exists, onCreate() method is called to create it. so far, so good. But, if the database already exists, then onUpgrade() method is called which simply drops the database and then re- creates it. What is the sense behind such an update? why not just leave the database alone?
