How can one a software developer learn about how to provide business solution? including but not limited to, implement business applications in decent software architectural style? CRM, ERP, MDM, SOA etc... are they really strictly reserved for _enterprise_? Where to learn about their...   * common features   * software / data architecture of such system in general   * complexity involved   * latest trend   * no silver bullets, then what are the options?   * popular open source projects that one can build on?   * commercial option if money is not an issue? I searched on Safari Books Online and most of the books are manual for how to customize Vendor X's CRM / ERP for your needs, or wordy and boring written for business students (not for software dev's) Any good resource to learn those listed above? Or is working at a software firm that writes that kind of software the only way to learn the in and out's of writing business application? **update:** bold assumption - large enterprises would go with a vendor like SAP without thinking of building one themselves. Thanks.
