Let's say you know of an anonymous noobie that wants to be lead upon the path of righteousness. This noobie wants to use some sort of source control tools simply for the experience of using source control tools (and possibly for whatever benefits they bring along with them). To constrain things further (and to make this possibly even more noobie- tastic), let's say they're stuck in windows developing in visual studio. How would you guide your neophyte?
