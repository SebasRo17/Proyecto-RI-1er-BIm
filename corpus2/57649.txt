I am thinking about using GPU programming with Mathematica using a MacBook Pro with a NVIDIA GPU. At this page, the Mathematica documentation says "Programming OpenCL in the Wolfram Language is simple since the user need not write C wrapper code -- which can be quite verbose, difficult to understand, and hard to debug. Using _OpenCLLink_ also guarantees compatibility as new versions of the standard are released." So what advantages might there be to programming in CUDA instead of OpenCL?
