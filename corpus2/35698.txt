Lately I've been noticing my keyboard usage more and more and how it affects my productivity. It brought to mind a question/problem that I believe has not been truly solved in the programming community (partially based on individual preferences). **Are all/most keyboard layouts inherently flawed for programmers?** What changes to your keyboard layout do you feel would increase your productivity most? _Edit_ Remember when answering that there are a number of different factors that could make a keyboard layout flawed. For instance, if you type as fast as you believe you need to, but hitting common keys is uncomfortable, said keyboard layout could be considered flawed.
