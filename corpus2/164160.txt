My wife is a high school maths teacher, and is considering starting a programming club for 13-17 years olds who show an interest. Their interest seems to be around Apps and Android which I have little experience of. The kids would be (presumably) interested in programming, and have a fairly high level of computing knowledge. We would provide them with resources and some knowledge, but hopefully a lot would be self guided. I'm hoping stack overflow'ers can provide some tips or starting points. Specific things I think I'll need are;   * A development Environment; Currently I'm looking towards Java and Android, developed in Eclipse, probably installed on donated older hardware   * Some initial direction; There seem to be a plethora or 'start android' tutorials, so some recommendations for good ones are valuable, as are recommended paper books    * A Target; Some final project they should be shooting for   * A Route; This is where I'm most stuck, how to lead them through the required Java concepts and learning they would need Some related questions already out there   Language+IDE for teaching high school students?   Teaching "web design/development" to high-school home-school group. Good sources?   How can I bootstrap a software development community at my school?
