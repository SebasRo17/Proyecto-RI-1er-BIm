I'm working on a Canvas object in HTML5, and I am attempting to make some photos look "better". I tried VintageJS, an existing photo-retouching Javascript library, and Picozu, a web application cloning some Adobe Photoshop functionalities, but I'm still not happy. Can you help me with an algorithm or point to an existing Javascript library that would allow me to make my photos look like the following example? http://i46.photobucket.com/albums/f137/thanhtu_zx/Untitled-1.jpg ![example of a "vintage" look](http://i.stack.imgur.com/59Uee.jpg)
