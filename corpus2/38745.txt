Graphics elements do not always line up perfectly in exported PDFs using "Save As..." method. Take, for example:                Graphics[{Point[{0, 1}], Line[{{0, 0}, {0, 1}}]}, AspectRatio -> Automatic]      It looks like this on screen: ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Nf0uX.png) Notice that the dot isn't centred on the end of the line. Now let's export to PDF (hoping that what we saw displayed in the Mathematica GUI is just a rendering problem). Right click the graphic, and choose Save As... -> PDF. The PDF looks like this when magnified in a viewer: ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/oTYCz.png) There is clearly a very serious misalignment. Is there a workaround? Note: this seems to be a new problem in version 9. Version 7 and 8 are not affected.
