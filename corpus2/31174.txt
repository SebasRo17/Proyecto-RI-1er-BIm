If I have a list of rules associated with indexed variables like:               solution = {a[1] -> 1, a[2] -> 10, a[3] -> 100}      I would like to be able to extract all of the values associated with the rules. Although this problem is simple with a small number of variables, I am not sure how to generalize it. For instance, I can use pattern matching to obtain 1 and 10, respectively:               a[1]/.solution     a[2]/.solution      However, I can't seem to generalize this to extract a[n] values from a list of rules. What is proper pattern to do this?
