Lets say you've got a list `l = [0, 2..]` and you want to get the `n`th number when `n` is pretty large, say `n=123456789`. So you call `l !! 123456789`. On my machine, this results in `out of memory`. So why aren't Haskell capable of realizing that the number at index `n` is `2n`, and making a call such as `l !! 1230981237` trivial? Or a more extreme example, `[1..] !! 123456789`. Shouldn't Haskell be able to realize that every number in `[1,1..]` is `1`?
