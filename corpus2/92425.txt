I'm looking for a way to take my experiences (and the experiences of others), and provide a more active approach to an apprenticeship for CS college students or young developers. It seems to me that Programmers Stack Exchange does this to some degree in a passive fashion, but have you ever seen a program that actively seeks out these individuals and gives them an opportunity to pick your brain (besides your run of the mill internship).
