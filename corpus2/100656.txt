> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  How old is "too old"? I'm about to start CS next year. I love both the coding and the mathematical aspects of programming. However, recently I encountered multiple rants about how it's impossible to actually be a programmer over 45, unless you're in a managing position or filling a very specific niche. Any advice? I'm seriously questioning my career choice here, and would be grateful for some input.
