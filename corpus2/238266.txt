I am starting with AngularJS. The back end will be Web API (which is new to me as well) and I'd like to use just one IDE, so I'm trying to figure out how to setup a project in Visual Studio 2013 for AngularJS. I'd like to keep it as a separate project, to keep it loosely coupled to the API (or keep the UI decoupled from the Web API). I'm having a hard time figuring out how to get this setup. So....   * What project type is best for a pure AngularJS (pure HTML 5) project?   * Is is suggested to use Grunt? Or is MS Build better to handle build tasks? I thinking here linting, minify, concatenating files into a single distribution file, maybe copying to a web server.   * How do you run tests? Is there a plugin to run Jasmin tests? Do you just run Karma separately?    * Are there any good templates for AngularJS? Any that use ngBoilerplate? Any help would be appreciated.
