I'm trying to create a simulation of a set of lists with `Manipulate[]` and `ListLinePlot[]`. However, as my simulation starts **with** the $x$-axis pre- defined (`DataRange -> {1, 500}`), the lists behave strangely, i.e., they are not plotted as intended. The lists **do not obbey** the $x$-axis (which is correctly plotted), but instead of that they are always at the right edge of the plot. My code is:               randomWalk[x_]:=Accumulate[Prepend[RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[0, 1], x], 0]]     exchange=Table[Subscript[asset, i] = randomWalk[500], {i, 1, 5}];     Manipulate[ListLinePlot[exchange[[All, 1 ;; n]], DataRange -> {1, 500}], {n, 3,500, 1}]      Could someone give me a hint to solve this problem?
