I'm looking to take my Actionscript knowledge to the next level and I've been having trouble finding what it takes to become a senior level AS developer. From my searching this has what I've come up with so far:   * Component Creation   * Memory Usage Debugging/Profiling   * AS specific usage of OOP    * Correct Use of Code-behind    * Accessing remote data   * Flex architecture frameworks   * Component lifecycle Those are just the topics I've been able to find. Resources on mastering those topics have been very hard to come by(i.e. what are common AS design patterns, etc). I may just not be searching correctly, but any help here would be greatly appreciated. My focus is on Flex specific AS development. Currently I've found here and here are the most similar SO questions I've been able to find. Any help would be appreciated, though I'm looking for specific examples. * _this question was first asked onstackoverflow and asked to be moved here_
