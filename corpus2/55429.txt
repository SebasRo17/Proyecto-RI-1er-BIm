The Dataset documentation doesn't indicate how to label a Histogram with the key.               titanic =        ExampleData[{"Dataset", "Titanic"}][All, {"survived" ->(# /. {True -> 1, False -> 0} &)}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4L6Bm.png)               titanic[Histogram, #] & /@ {"age", "survived"}      gives: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Vp8il.png) (Note, unlike functions such as Counts, which can operate on tuples of keys (ie, counts the products), it doesn't seem possible to use the syntax: `titanic[Histogram, {"age", "survived"}]`). How can a Key be passed programmatically as argument to Histogram (or other operators) in order to label it, eg "age", "survived" ? Of course it's possible to project individual columns with KeyTake and then histogram but that's not the same as operating on the data.
