Are there any canonical sources for learning how to structure multi-threaded programs? Even with all the concurrency utility classes that Java provides I'm having a hard time properly structuring multi-threaded programs. Whenever threads are involved my code becomes very brittle, any little change can potentially break the program because the code that jumps back and forth between the threads tends to be very convoluted.
