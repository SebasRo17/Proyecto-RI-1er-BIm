A very extensive application began as an Access-based system (for database storage). Forms were written in VB5 and/or VB6. As .Net became a fixture in the development community, certain modules have been rewritten. This seems very awkward and potentially costly just to maintain because of the cross- technologies and extra work to keep the two technologies happy with each other. Of course, the application uses a mix of ~~ODBC~~ OleDb and MySql. ~~Would you think spending the time and resources to completely re-develop the application under .Net would be more cost effective?~~ In an effort to develop a more stable application, wouldn't it make sense to use .Net? Or continue chasing Access bugs, adding new features in .Net (which may or may not create new bugs between .Net and Access), and rewriting old Access modules into .Net modules under time constraints that prevent proper design and development? **Update** The application uses OleDb and MySql - I corrected my previous statement. Also, to lend further support to rewriting: I have since found out that when the _"porting"_ to .Net began, the VBA/VB6 code that existed was basically translated to the .Net equivalent. From my understanding, nothing was done to improve performance, or take advantage of new libraries or technologies. In my opinion, this creates a very fragile and unstable application. With every new update, this becomes more and more visible. As a help desk technician, I have noticed an increase in problems reported. The customers using the software have noticed an increase in problems and are commenting on it.
