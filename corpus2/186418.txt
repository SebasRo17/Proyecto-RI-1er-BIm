I've noticed that a coworker and I have opposite practices regarding the ordering of methods in our Java classes. One of us begins a class with its major public methods, and then put all of the private helpers afterwards. The other one of us makes sure that public methods are at the very end. Clearly, this is just a style issue and there is no right answer. However, before we decide that this matter is just another Yooks vs Zooks fight and just pick one or the other arbitrarily, I was wondering if perhaps there was a standard Java style guide recommendation or some practical reason why one approach is better than the other.
