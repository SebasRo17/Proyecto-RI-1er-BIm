Suppose I have a task that keeps things organized using contexts, so:               windowLength = 10;     Begin["chocolate`"];     data = RandomReal[NormalDistribution[], 100];     ListPlot[MovingAverage[data, windowLength]]     End[]     Begin["vanilla`"];     data = RandomReal[StudentTDistribution[1], 100];     ListPlot[MovingAverage[data, windowLength]]     End[]      Now, if I want to go back and do something in the `chocolate` context, I have to remember to re-run the line that enters that context or things can get very confusing and mistakes can easily be made. It would be really neat to instead use wiggle-4 to create a Section called "Chocolate" and for everything in that section to run in the `chocolate` context. Is there a way to set the context automatically based on the section of the notebook a cell is in?
