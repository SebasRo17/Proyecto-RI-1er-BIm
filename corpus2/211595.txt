I know about Simple Factory Idiom, Factory Method and Abstract Factory Design patterns. But I have two situations that I'm not sure how to call (PHP code example) :               class User {       public static function LoadUserById($id) {         $objUser = new User();         //load details from DB         return $objUser;       }     }          class UserFactory {        public function Create($id) {         $objUser = new User();         //load details from DB         return $objUser;        }     }      What are these two situations? Simple Factories (programming idiom) or are they called something else? Is a good practice to name the class UserFactory? Isn't this something that might get confused with the A factory design pattern? Should I use different name for it like UserFinder? When I think of the Factory Design Pattern I always think of examples where there are families of components derived from a parent class but it is clearly not the case here.
