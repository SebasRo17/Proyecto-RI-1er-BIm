I have written an elaborate code that contains a collection of functions for the user and a bunch of auxiliary functions whose existence I would like to hide away from the user. I've written my code in a separate .nb file which I run. I intend the user to do work on a separate clean notebook. But in v9, when I (the user) starts typing something that resembles one of these auxiliary functions, it appears in Mathematica's autocompletion bar. Is there a way for me to 'hide' these functions, while keeping the ones that are intended for the user? For example, I have defined:               fooAuxiliary[n_] := (-1)^n*HarmonicNumber[n+1];          foo[x_] := fooAuxiliary[Floor[x]]*Sin[x]      with the user given access to call `foo` but not `fooAuxiliary`.
