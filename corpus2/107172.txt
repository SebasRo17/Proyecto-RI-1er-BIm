I would like to know how people approach with developing their websites that are in production. For example:-   1. How do you manage versions, etc.   2. Also, do you create a subdirectory within the production server and work there or do you use any other environment and roll the updates there   3. Do you have any special management software where you keep notes, tips, deadlines, etc. I am asking this because I have a website which I would like to add new features to. But that website is in production. So, what are your suggestions on how you would update your websites and add new features? I use PHP with Apache on CentOS
