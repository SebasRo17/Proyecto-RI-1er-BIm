Are there any guidelines for placing methods in API when the placement isn't obvious? Example: I have classes `A` and `B` and a method `X`. The work being carried out can be phrased in two ways:   1. `A does X with B`   2. `B does X to A` Given the two ways of phrasing this, it's unclear whether `X` belongs in `A` or `B`. **Are there guidelines for placing the method in this scenario?** * * * For a more concrete example, consider think of a user (`A`), an event (`B`) and a sign-up action (`X`). A user can sign up to an event (`A does X with B` ), or an event can add a user to the sign-up list (`B does X to A`).
