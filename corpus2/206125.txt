I was going through the answers to this question: What information must never appear in logs? And noticed that nobody mentioned this particular attribute. It's something I find useful- whenever any logging is added to the system as a result of tracing a particular issue raised in the bug tracker, or adding a feature, **_I tend to include the ticket number of the related helpdesk element._** This means that when going through the log, any programmer can cross reference each log message with the associated ticket number. Now I understand that using proper VCS/helpdesk integration means most commits are attached to a ticket number anyway- but over time it makes it easy for us to diagnose problems on inspection whenever a log message comes up. However it still makes me a bit uneasy leaving this in the logs. The problem is, I can't think of a scenario where this could become a problem. I'm hoping SE can help me out. By the way- I'm talking about the "verbose" log level. This is never done in a logging level that will appear in production.
