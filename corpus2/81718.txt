I have been asked to develop a client-server application (requires database) for a company. I am very handy with java so would like to go with it. Its up to me how I develop the application. It may be an JSP web application or Java Swing GUI based application. I have following queries/doubts. So if I go on to develop a web application, I have to teach the company personnel     1. How to install Tomcat   2. How to load the web application Tomcat   3. How to start the server to start the application. If I go on to develop a Java Swing GUI based application,   1. It should start when the computer starts up. i.e it should be auto added into the service start-up of the OS on installation   2. Have application shortcut in quick launch, tray bar on installation. On Database Part: I would like to have MS-access like DB but free one. This is because,   1. No need to worry about installation of DB engine (like we have to take care in-case of MySQL).   2. DB would maintained in some Drive (like .mdb file in case of MS-Acess) unharmed even if their OS crashes. Please guide me how should I approach in developing the software.
