On my machine (Windows 8.1) and M10 the following two lines, that must be run on an already saved notebook,               Manipulate[Plot[a x^2, {x, -4, 4}, PlotRange -> {-4, 4}], {{a, 1}, -10, 10}]     Export[NotebookFileName[] <> "~", EvaluationNotebook[], "NB"];      cause a strange error message, saying:               INTERNAL SELF-TEST ERROR: Files2|c|1713     Click here to find out if this problem is known, and to help improve     the Wolfram System by reporting it to Wolfram Research.      (the "here" link redirect me to this page, with my license data attached to the link). The error message is generated when the Export command is executed, **but only** if the first Manipulate command was previously executed (so that there is a dynamic output graphics object). If there's no dynamic output the export command works as expected. Disabling _Dynamic updating_ in the _Evaluation Menu_ has no effect. In **M9** the Export command **works fine** (no error messages) also with the presence of some dynamic output. The message is rather annoying, but, anyway, the export command succeeds. I need a fix for this because the Export command is used in the " ** _Mathematica Notebook Auto Backup Package_** " by Josh Burkart (available here: https://github.com/joshburkart/mathematica-autobackup). This package is very useful to create backups of the current notebook at user-defined intervals and with other configurable options. Furthermore I really don't like the alternative route of enabling the _NotebookAutoSave_ option since with that procedure you lose the safe and last "deliberately saved" version of the notebook. It is even more necessary now that, before the next maintenance release, M10 may run into some crashes (not infrequent, at least in some system, and that's the main reason why I searched and found that package). Can somebody check if the two code lines above give the error also with other machines? (Note that the notebook must be saved before running the Export command). Any possible advice to avoid that annoying error message?
