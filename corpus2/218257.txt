Well, the thing is that I am just about to create a Desktop App (with .NET windows forms) And now I just wonder if it would be really a wise choise to use any IoC (StructureMap,Ninject,Spring .Net), I have used them before for Asp.Net web applications but what makes me doubt now is the fact that working with windows forms my business entities will persist when I navigate through tabs and unlike than web forms or mvc apps where it would be necesary to inject my business entity for every new request that is performed, I mean this because of the Asp.Net page life cycle where is performed the initialization and controls instantiation. Maybe I am misunderstanding the point of using an IoC, so please tell me what do you think would be a better choise?
