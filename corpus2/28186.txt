I am running Windows XP Professional (Service Pack 3). I am a graduate student, and my institution has a license for _Mathematica for Students_. Back when Mathematica 8 was released, I was worried that (for whatever reason) I would not like it or that it would not run properly on Windows XP Professional, which is quite old by Windows standards. So, I tried to install Mathematica 8 in addition to Mathematica 7 which was also on the same computer. As it turned out, this worked fine; Mathematica 7 and Mathematica 8 simply peacefully coexist in different installation directories (`$InstallationDirectory` gives `"C:\\Program Files\\Wolfram Research\\Mathematica\\7.0"` in Mathematica 7, and `$InstallationDirectory` gives `"C:\\Program Files\\Wolfram Research\\Mathematica\\8.0"` in Mathematica 8; these are the default installation directories). Now Mathematica 9 for Students is out and offered by my institution, and I am eager to try it because of the `PlotLegends` feature that has supposedly been much improved. But I would be very, very sad if installing Mathematica 9 somehow corrupted my existing Mathematica 8 installation, because there is a chance that my computer will be too slow to handle Mathematica 9, especially its supposedly "beefed up" front end, and I will need to revert to 8. Do you have any experience with installing version 9 on the same computer as version 8? This previous question by another user discusses problems with installing a trial version of 9 next to genuine 8, which was apparently due to a bug. I am just curious if you have experience with installing genuine 9 next to genuine 8, and whether there is likely to be any overlap between system files/directories used by these two versions. (I'm really only interested in version 9 because of the new `PlotLegends`, and that is the only reason I would like to try it. I would like to use Mathematica to generate publication-quality plots, but I can't really do this without some reasonably easy-to-use and easily reproducible `PlotLegends`.)
