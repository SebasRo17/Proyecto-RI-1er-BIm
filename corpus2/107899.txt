After a year programming a web based business management system, I got my idea divided into two differents ways to do what I'm doing... I will try to explain in follow lines: **First I will describe my enviroment:**   * Webserver: _apache, ngynx_   * Programming Language: _PHP, Shell Script, Java Script, SQL_   * Database: _Mysql_   * Operating System: _Linux, UNIX (All Distros) (If manually configured works on windows)_   * Authentication Server: _FreeRadius_ **First situation** I have my application running on this enviroment that I had just described before, as my application is a SaaS app, then I have my own server to run it all and customers pay to use it as a service accessed by webbrowser. **Second Situation** The same as before but with one big difference, everything (environment) is installed in the customer, then I need to cryptography all my codes (It includes PHP and Shell Scripts). I think this situation is most difficulty, but I would like to hear it from different points of view.
