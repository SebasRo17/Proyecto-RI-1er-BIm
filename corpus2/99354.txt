I am building a website that will allow companies to sign up and post information and have an internal network, but what is the best way to verify that the person that is filling in the sign up form really belongs to the company they say they do, as I don't want Joe Bloggs signing up saying he works for company XYZ when really he doesn't. Is there a logical way of doing this or is it an impossible task?
