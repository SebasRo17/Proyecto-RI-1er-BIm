I recently purchased a Samsung Galaxy Tab as a reference implementation (phone and first gen Android tablet), of Android 2.x for app development. I have noticed a slew of Android 3.0 slates being talked about at CES 2011 (Motorola XOOM, etc.). If I had a multitouch PC with the Android SDK/Emulator on it, would this allow me to more closely approximate device simulation by allowing user input via the multitouch screen ? Would it work via touch just like Windows 7 recognizes touch as mouse style input ? Has anyone done this ?
