I am in the early stages of creating an open source C# library that would allow developers to drop in the open SRD (http://www.d20srd.org/) into an existing project. Abstracted it is a complex set of tightly coupled business rules. Having previously worked on an adaptive object model project for health care risk management I began with that pattern in mind. Due to the high coupling of rules it is becoming apparent that the project may require some kind of scripting. Have started researching DSL implementation I am now considering scrapping the adaptive object model for a domain specific language. I have not work with domain specific languages so my question is it reasonable to assume a domain specific language can be used to representing the open SRD?
