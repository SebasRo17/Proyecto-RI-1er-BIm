Very frequently, I am stuck when choosing the best design decision. Even for small details, such as function definitions, control flow, and variable names, I spend unusually long periods perusing the benefits and trade-offs of my choices. I feel like I am losing a lot of efficiency by spending my hours on insignificant details like these. Even though, I know in the back of my mind that I can change these things if my current design doesn't work out, I have trouble deciding firmly on one choice. What should I do to combat this problem?
