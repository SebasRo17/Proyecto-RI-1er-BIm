For my app that I'm about to release, I have used a bunch of 3rd party classes found for free online. I checked all the liscenses before using the code and each one said I could use the code commercially So now what I'm concerned about is do I have to give credit somewhere in my app to the creater of that class? Also, I plan on having my app be free, but if in the future I charge for it, does that change things?

Is it enough for this license to be at the top of the class file embedded in the binary, or do I have to make it literally accessible to the user? Of course I'm not asking for expert legal advice, but any help would be appreciated.
