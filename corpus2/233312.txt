So far my best ideas have been as fallows A) Represent a "card" in one structure and have a "deck" in another a deck being an array of 52 cards and a card being 2 chars one for and rank one for suit. B) The second seems like it might be easier to manage but less obvious in code. Creating an array of ints each with a different value ranging from 1-52. Then crating a conversion function that would translate the value to a card structure that would have a string for the suit and a string for the rank. The value of zero could indicate a card that has not been "dealt". Just trying to find a better way of doing this.
