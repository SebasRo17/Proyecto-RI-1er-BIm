I'm starting to introduce myself in CQRS concepts, but I get stucked with the following situation: Supouse you have an entity that must have an unique name. In order to verify that, prior to create the entity you must make a query, thus you are verifing against the query subsystem. But what happens if the syncronization has not been happened between the command system and the query system yet? Other client just had sent the same name before you. What happens in that case?
