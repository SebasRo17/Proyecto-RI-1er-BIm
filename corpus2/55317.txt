I am trying to implement a slider whose control range varies depending on the current value:               {Dynamic@asd,      Slider[Dynamic[asd],      Dynamic @Which[asd < 10, {1, 10}, asd >= 10 , {9, 50, 1}]]}      However I now have the problem that the slider remains in place once the control scales change and thus the value "leaps" as soon as the scales change. To Illustrate: once i reach ten the scale changes but the slider remains in place and thus the value goes immediately to 50 (the "new" ten). Is it possible to have the slider jump instead of the value? Perhaps by briefly locking the value at ten?
