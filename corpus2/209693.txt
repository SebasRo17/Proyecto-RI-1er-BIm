I'm working on an enterprise project which will be deployed in many SMBs and Enterprises.   The support for this project would be struggling and so I want to create a coding pattern for errors ( _Like HTTP status Codes_ ). This will enable help desk people to refer to documents and troubleshoot the problems as soon as possible. **What are the best practices and recommendations to do this?**   Any help to do this will be useful.
