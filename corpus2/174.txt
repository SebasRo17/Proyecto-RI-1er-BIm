I have a problem that I am working on that requires that I compare several lists of overlapping data points. As I traverse one of the lists, I'd like to only compare those data to the other lists, and not itself. So, how does one efficiently do this, especially if it must be done potentially hundreds of times? Obviously, if I can control the order in which I make the comparisons, any method would work as I can limit the number of times this has to be done. But, I can't necessarily guarantee the order. Now both `Drop` and `Take` could be used for this, but I'm interested to know if they are the fastest methods to do this, or is there something else?
