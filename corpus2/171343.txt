I have been evaluating architecture solutions for a mobile project that will have a web-service/app in addition to native apps and have been looking at various libraries, frameworks, and stacks like Meteor, this being a sort of "open stack package framework", is tightly bound with Node.js. There is a lot of talk about the benefits of using the same language both client and server side, and I'm not getting it. I could understand if you want to mirror the entire state of a web application on both client and server but struggling to find other wins... Workflow efficiency? I'm trying to understand why client/server language parity is considered to be a holy grail. Why does client/server language parity matter in software development?
