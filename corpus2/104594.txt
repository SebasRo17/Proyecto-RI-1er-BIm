Curious how other developers feel about this. I come across some pretty nasty sql joins, as we all do I'm sure. I would prefer making more database calls for the sake of readability and simplicity rather than have a large SQL statement to maintain; about 3 - 4 joins. For the performance argument, I will give up a little performance for readability. For example: make the first call, filter the data, and then query the second table, and so on What is your preference?
