I am rendering a world environment simulation in _Mathematica_ with `Graphics3D` code:               Show[{     Graphics3D[{     Lighting -> "Neutral",     Green,      Polygon[{{-10, -10, 0}, {-10, 10, 0}, {10, 10, 0}, {10, -10,         0}}],     Red, Cone[{{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, .1}}, 1/2],     White,      Table[Sphere[        Table[{0, 0, 10} + {rx, ry, rz} + {r, r, r/3} /.           r :> RandomReal[]*4, {5}],         2] /. {rx -> RandomReal[{-20, 20}],         ry -> RandomReal[{-20, 20}], rz -> RandomReal[{-1, 3}]}, {30}]     }, Boxed -> False, Background -> Blue,      ImageSize -> {900, 900*41/54}, SphericalRegion -> True],     ContourPlot3D[     x^2 + y^2 == 10^2, {x, -10, 10}, {y, -10, 10}, {z, 0, .6},      Mesh -> None, Lighting -> "Neutral",      ContourStyle -> Darker[Green]]     }]      If the camera is positioned far away from the scene so that everything is in view range, it renders fine: ![somewhat cloudy](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rtbM4.png) However, when I specify the desired camera parameters:               ViewVector -> {{0, 0, .1}, {0, 1, .1}}, ViewAngle -> 54 \[Degree]      The rendering becomes weird: ![weird rendering](http://i.stack.imgur.com/q02aw.png) The bottom part of the green rectangle is cut off and the blue background is displayed instead, and the red cone is very weird as well. Is there a way to display this scene properly? edit: **Solved** with               ViewRange -> {0.1, 100}      This is not optimal, because it does not take `0` or `Automatic` for a minimum value, `All` causes the cut-off in the above example, and it does not take `Infinity` or `Automatic` for a maximum value.
