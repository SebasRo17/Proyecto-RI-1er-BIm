Soon, I'm going to take a course in ASP.NET. But "unfortunately" the course is based on ASP.NET 3.5 using Murach ASP.NET 3.5 as textbook. I'm a bit concern since the current latest version is ASP.NET 4.0. There's a chance that the course will upgrade to 4.0 next semester, should I do it now or wait until next semester for version 4.0? My long term goal is to get a MCPD WEb developer cert. Thanks
