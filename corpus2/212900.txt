## The Software Setup: I am currently planning on creating a new software product. I have never commercially launched an application, nor am I doing this for a company. It's more for fun than anything, but it _may_ bring in some cash too. :P Anyway, there are going to be two "core parts" of the software:   * **Part Number One:** This one I am going to release open source. It's basically an installer/launcher/patcher that automatically checks for updates, it can handle error reporting, etc. Blah, blah, blah.    * **Part Number Two:** This is going to be the actual software. Closed source, but freeware. It's linked to an account, which can be either free or paid. * * * ## The Problem: So that's all fine above... until I realise my development computer has a lot of "freeware for non-businesses and paid for businesses" software. (Office, antivirus, and who knows what else?) I know I will _definitely_ have to do something about the software for the for-profit part, but **how about the open source part?** It is free, but the whole intention of developing it is for adding it to a bigger, paid software.
