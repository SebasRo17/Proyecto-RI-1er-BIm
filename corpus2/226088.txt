I have been asked to be the SCM (Software Configuration Manager) in my company. I've read online documentation to learn what SCM is, what SCM does, etc. Currently, the company works with a version control system (Bazaar), so the software is versioned correctly, but there are old programs that are not well versioned (some of them not versioned at all), some of them are in CVS, the old version control system used at first, but they are not updated. I'm asking for your help, based on experience more than theoretical information, to know how to deal with this, how to be a good SCM even with all these issues.
