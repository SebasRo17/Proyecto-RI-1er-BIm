Since I started learning C a few years ago, I have never been a part of a team that worked on a project. I am very interested to know what are the best practices for writing large projects in C. One of the things I want to know, is when (not how) do I split my project into different source files? My previous experience is with writing a header-source duo (the functions defined in the header are written in the source). I want to know what are the best practices for splitting a project, and some pointers on important things when writing a project as part of a team?
