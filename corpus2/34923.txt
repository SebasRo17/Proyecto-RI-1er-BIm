If I plot the following graph with an `EdgeRenderingFunction`, the position of both the labels are at dead center, and with a large graph I have the labels completely overlapping each other:               GraphPlot[{{1 -> 2, "a"}, {2 -> 1, "b"}},        DirectedEdges -> True, VertexCoordinateRules -> Automatic, VertexLabeling -> True,        EdgeRenderingFunction -> ({Blue, Arrow[#1, 0.1],          If[#3 =!= None, Text[Style[#3, Medium], Mean[#1], Background -> White], {}]} &)]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ueOBx.png) Is there a way to position the labels, say, at 60% down the edge instead of dead center, so that the labels don't have a chance to overlap? I've been toggling with `Mean[#1]` above but can't get this right positioning. Edit: improved formatting
