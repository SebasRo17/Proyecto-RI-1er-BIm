Doing some refactoring, I noticed an unusual pattern I'm not familiar with. Properties and variables that do not yet have a value are initiated with `undefined` declared explicitly, despite the fact that value-less variables and object properties would evaluate to `undefined` anyways:               var foo = undefined;     this.prop = undefined;      **Is there a reason to do this?**
