I'm a software developer, currently working on web development. We are a small company a team with 2 persons, a developer and a designer and we have no-one to test our applications. From the last week I was somehow rushed to finish a task within a project programmed by someone else and I released it with a bug which I did not see. Today I got the last warning and if there is a release with a bug I will be fired. So is this fair enough to get fired because releases with bugs without any testers around or should I really improve my skills on testing?
