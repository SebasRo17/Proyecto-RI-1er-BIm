I created and maintain an open source Android app. Recently someone offered to translate my app into several other languages. At the same time, development continues on the app which can sometimes add string resources which need to be translated. How can I ensure that the additional string resources are translated with as little pain as possible? In particular, the translator doesn't seems to have very minimal technical skills. I think that teaching him version control won't be very helpful. Also asking him to manually comb through the updated English resources for changes can be error prone. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
