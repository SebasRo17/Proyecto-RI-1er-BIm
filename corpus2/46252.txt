I have used ListLinePlot to generate this grid of plots: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/P4KfG.png) and I want to add a legend in Row Layout below this grid. My code, has as follows:               graphs = Table[        ListLinePlot[         Table[Transpose@{vdd, power[[i, j, All]]}, {j, 1, Wl}],         PlotLabel -> "T=" <> ToString[T[[i]]] <> "\[Degree]C",         Frame -> {{True, False}, {True, False}},         FrameLabel -> {"\!\(\*SubscriptBox[\(V\), \(DD\)]\)(V)","P(nW)"},         AspectRatio -> 1/GoldenRatio,         ImageSize -> Medium         ],        {i, 1, Tl}];     a = {graphs[[1 ;; 3]], graphs[[4 ;; 6]]};     grid = GraphicsGrid[a, Spacings -> Scaled[0],         AspectRatio -> 0.6/GoldenRatio];      where vdd[[...]], W[[...]], T[[...]],power[[...,...,...]] are lists with the measured values and each colored curve in the above plots, corresponds for a different (but known) value of W. I was thinking to use               Column[{grid,        LineLegend[{...colors...}, Table[ToString[W[[n]]]<>"nm",{n,1,Wl}],         LegendLayout -> "Row"]}]      but I cannot generate the default colour pallete, which Mathematica uses. Also, I need the legend to be justified to the center (presentation purposes, as you can see). Any help please?
