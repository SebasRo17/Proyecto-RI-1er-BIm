I would like to find a permutation of $\quad S=\\{\frac{1}{10}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{4}{7}, \frac{3}{5}, \frac{2}{3} \\}\quad$ that maximizes the sum of theses elements raised to unique powers: $\;\\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$.   I think it is \begin{align}\biggr(\frac{1}{10}\biggr)^0 + \biggr(\frac{4}{7}\biggr)^1 + \biggr(\frac{2}{3}\biggr)^2 + \biggr(\frac{3}{5}\biggr)^3 + \biggr(\frac{1}{2}\biggr)^4&\approx 2.294373016\end{align} but I would like to verify that this is the case via computation. Also it would be useful to know how to perform general operations on sets.
