I am not sure if both terms can be used interchangeably. Maybe there is some academic distinction in computer science which is not relevant for day-to-day programming? Or can I use both term interchangeably without being wrong? Maybe it depends on the context in which I use both terms? Edit: On reason why I find both terms possibly interchangeable is a Wikipedia entry about Abstraction layer. There you can find David Wheelers quote 'All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection.'
