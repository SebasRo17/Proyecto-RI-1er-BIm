What is the best way to return multiple inhomogeneous results from a LibraryLink function? Imagine that the result of a single computation is several tensors of different dimensions and several numbers. They should all be returned at the same time. I see two ways:   1. Get a MathLink connection and use MathLink API functions to return the results. Is there any advantage at all to using LibraryLink (instead of pure MathLink) in this case? Did anyone compare LibraryLink/MathLink data transfer performance so I can more easily assess what the performance hit would be?   2. Have several LibraryLink functions: one will send the input, do the computation and store the result; there would be separate functions for retrieving each result; finally there would be a function to free up the library memory used to store those results. I'm not particularly keen on doing this. It seems more trouble and it forces me to manually manage memory from Mathematica. Are there any better options?
