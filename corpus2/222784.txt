I am using **Microsoft ASP.NET Web API 2** and one of my end points has to internally invoke a legacy non-Microsoft web service (not `asmx` or `svc`) . Which layer should I invoke this in? I currently have : **Repository layer:** where all the CRUD calls to DB are done now. **Domain Manager:** where respective manager classes invoke the `Repository Layer` methods. And my **Web API Controller** methods invoke the respective Domain Manager methods. Should I just have another method in my **Repository Layer** which invokes the web service? And follow the usual pattern above?
