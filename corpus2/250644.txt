I am working on adding existing SQL scripts to version control. I have Team Foundation Server 2012 set up with Visual Studio 2008 and SQL Server Management Studio 2008 R2 with the MSSCCI. I am fairly new to TFS so I do not know if I am missing an easier way of doing things. Managing SSIS projects and even SSRS projects makes perfect sense with TFS, as a project is needed to use or modify it in Visual Studio/BIDS. You add the project to source control then check in much like saving a solution/project normally on your local machine. SQL scripts seem a little more cumbersome to use with TFS. It seems like I have to create SQL Server solutions to add any sort of sql script to my source control from SQL Server Management Studio (the add to source control functionality). While I can create new solutions in SSMS and add them to source control quite easily, it is a little annoying to have to add all of my existing scripts, which are simply .sql files, to new solutions. Ideally I would like some way to just add the scripts to source control, be able to modify them in SSMS, then check them back in somewhat easily. If this were subversion, I could just commit and check in the single file in Windows Explorer and be done with it, managing and modifying the file however I want. Is there an equivalent in TFS to this?
