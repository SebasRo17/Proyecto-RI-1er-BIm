Should there be a "data hygiene" index for software - to indicate how clean the program is? not creating unused temp files, registry entries, environment variables, etc. For example, look in your users folder in Windows, you'll see all manner of work space files used by your applications. For example, this makes it hard to know what needs to be backed up and what can be discarded as being machine-generated.
