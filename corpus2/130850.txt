What is the difference between Development Operations and Software Configuration Management? For me it seems to be the same as long as both DevOps and Software Configuration Management are focused on:   1. Establishing **development infrastructure** \- being in charge of version _control, build management, deployment management, dependencies management, continuous integration and delivery_ , etc.    2. Using best practices for organizing **developers environment**.   3. **Quality Assurance** of development processes - gathering metrics of development effectiveness, working on eliminating bottlenecks of development process (running unit-tests, evaluating unit-tests coverage, running inspections, etc)   4. **Infrastructure management** \- target platforms and its specifics.   5. **Release management** \- making sure release has been delivered to customer/client in time. Maybe I'm missing something? This link shows that usage of term 'Software Configuration Management' prevails. But still, what word combination would you rather use to describe listed range of activities: **Development Operations** or **Software Configuration Management**?
