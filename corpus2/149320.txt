I am implementing a server in C for a course project. The server should serve more than one client simultaneously. The description of the project states that `fork()` should be used to serve more than one client. Each children should write something to a common file. How do I handle this synchronously? Is there any mechanism like in Java where only one thread can use a function at the same time?
