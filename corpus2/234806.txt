I'm currently developing an app in Ruby on Rails with a social network side, and have several different models including users, groups and pages. I would like to allow users to be group/page admins, which seems relatively straight forward, however I would also like users to be able to message groups/pages directly, rather than having to state the group/page admin. This is what is done in Facebook. However, I am unsure how this would be done. In order to 'take over' a group/page, would I need to destroy the session and start a new one as the group/page in order to read messages and edit the profile, etc? Another option is just give each admin an extra mailbox and admin rights to edit groups/pages, but this seems like it could get over complicated if a user admins several groups/pages.
