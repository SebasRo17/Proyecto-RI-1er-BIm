Why go agile? This is the first question that comes to my mind when I think of going agile. What are the possible financial benefits one can achieve from going agile? Most of us certainly like to think of customers and clients as someone who doesn't know what they wants. So why help them at all? Why not suck their money being a parasitic company and make them stupider by the day. Traditional software development isn't bad and are probably (mostly as far as I have seen) a lot easier environment to work in rather than agile projects. So why go agile at all? What can agile give extra (I mean financially) that traditional software development can't?
