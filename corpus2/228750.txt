I have a C# application (Desktop based application for Windows OS), which I wanted to use from Web browser. The application is a kind of analyzing tool, which takes some input values and performs set of calculations over it then displays an animation of the results. Since the application can't be coded again in a new language, Can anyone suggest me, how I can view and interact with this C# application from browser (like the way we interact with Java Applets)? Also the application can be used by more than one user at a time, so there must be multiple views for this web application.
