I'm figuring how to implement a function behavior based on the Head of its argument. I mean               Unprotect@Head;     Head[p_[x]]:= Kind;     Protect@Head;     function[h_]:= 0;     function[p_Kind]:= 1;          Head[f[x]]     function[f[x]]     function[f]      the first instance of `function` should evaluate to `1` whereas the second instance should evaluate to `0`. However, both evaluate to `0`. Notice that `Head[f[x]]` evaluate to `Kind` as expected. Where am I doing mistake(s)? Thank you very much
