I had 3 years full time work experience in web development. I had to leave the job and come to overseas (my home) for 1.5 years due to personal problem, but I did some free lance work in web development and maintaining a Linux VPS server. I did some certifications like CCNA, CCNP, RHCE during that time. I am going back and getting ready to apply for jobs. Now I am confused how can I fill that 1.5 year gap. Can I write free lancing there? How should I write it? Did my worth degrade as I had to leave full time job for 1.5 years? Or do I really need to write that I was away? Can I write that I was doing free lancing and now I want a permanent job?
