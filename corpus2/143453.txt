I'm beginning Javascript development and as a beginner in JavaScript I make a lot of mistakes. The way I'm developing is very counter-productive because every mistake I fix I have to shutdown Glassfish, re-build the app and re- deploy it. My app is a Java back-end with REST services and the Html, JavaScript, CSS for the frontend. Everything is packed in a .ear file. As of right now, I'm just working with the frontend but I do have to make this whole process to update the files. My question is ... is there a better way of doing this? Can somebody tell how do you guys work in a similar setup to do the everyday development?
