I want to solve the following equation               y == (1/(1/4 + y) - 1/(3/4 - y))/((1/4 + y) + 1/(3/4 - y))      I tried               Simplify[y == (1/(1/4 + y) - 1/(3/4 - y))/((1/4 + y) + 1/(3/4 - y)), y]      which gave me > Solve[0.166667] Then I tried               Solve[y == (1/(1/4 + y) - 1/(3/4 - y))/((1/4 + y) + 1/(3/4 - y)), y]      which gave me > {{y -> 1.70683179538858`}, {y -> -0.82623525169495` \+ 0.902601424800742`I},   >  {y -> -0.82623525169495` \- 0.902601424800742`I}, {y -> > 0.195638708001323`}} I guess `Simplify` deletes potential roots, but `Solve` and `Simplify` didn't even have an overlap in the roots. Any idea?
