I've developed an importer and exporter for FreeSurfer's `MGH`/`MGZ` file format; the specific format isn't important, but I was wondering if there is a 'correct' way to tell _Mathematica_ that file names ending with ".mgh" should be automatically imported using my MGH importer? _Mathematica_ obviously does this for its built-in importers (e.g., `Import["abc.csv"]` is equivalent to `Import["abc.csv", "CSV"]`), so it seems like it should be possible, but I haven't been able to find any information about this in _Mathematica_ 's documentation. One solution, which seems inelegant to me, is this:               Unprotect[Import];     Import[name_String /; StringMatchQ[name, __ ~~ ".mgh" ~~ EndOfString]] :=        Import[name, "MGH"];     Import[name_String /; StringMatchQ[name, __ ~~ ".mgz" ~~ EndOfString]] :=        Import[name, {"GZip", "MGH"}];     Protect[Import];      Is there a more principled way of going about this?
