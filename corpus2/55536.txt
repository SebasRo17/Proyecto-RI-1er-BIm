I have _several hundreds_ of .csv files that are _not logically named_ (contains numbers, characters, and special characters), all _stored in a directory_. Each file has large but _unequal number of rows and columns_. I do not need any information other than the last line of each file. What would be an efficient way to use _Mathematica_ to get the last line from each file, and summarize them to a new .csv file with the file name as the tag ? @WReach suggested this, but I am not sure how to proceed, especially given the irregular titles.
