What is the best way to allow for dynamic fields/database columns? For example, let's say we have a payroll system that allows a user to create unique salary structures for each employee. How could/should one handle this scenario? I thought of using a "salary" table that hold the salary component fields and joining these columns to a "salary_values" table that hold the actual values. Does this make sense? **Example Salary Structures:** Notice how the components of the salary can be shared or unique. \-- Jon's Salary --               Basic           100        Annual Bonus    25        Tel.
