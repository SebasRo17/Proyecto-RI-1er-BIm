I currently code with C, C++, and Python. I'm wanting to pick up a functional programming language, and right now I'm leaning toward Haskell. I do NOT want to start a "Haskell vs Lisp" war here; what I want to know is this: **if I learn Haskell primarily for exposure to functional programming, what benefits, if any, will I gain from later learning Lisp?** * * * Update: Thanks everyone for your answers. Now all I need to do is pick a dialect of Lisp, but _that's_ a question for another time.
