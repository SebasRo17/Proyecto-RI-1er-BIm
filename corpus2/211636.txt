This question focuses on _user_ documentation, not on code documentation. I just finished my software project, and the people I work for are expecting me to write user documentation, describing everything the software does. All the documentation they had until now (about the rest of the software they use) is full of screenshots, and sometimes barely contains any text. I think it's awful. I've been struggling for hours to understand how screenshots were connected, and most of the time I had to ask for help from someone else. I wrote a Java desktop application, and its appearance is likely to depend on the current Windows theme and Java update. I don't think screenshots can form reliable, definitive reference. Taking hundreds of screenshots and annotating them will take forever, and I don't believe it will help more than accurate, plain text documentation. **How should I approach putting the user documentation together? What guidelines should I follow regarding the use of screenshots versus explaining in text with user documentation?**
