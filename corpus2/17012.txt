I have tried the following code:               ParametricPlot[{Sin[12 u] Cos[u], Sin[12 u] Sin[u]}, {u, 0, 2 Pi}]      and it produced the following image: ![Flower](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0ZgdU.png) MATLAB has a `comet` command that will draw this parametric plot in real time, allowing the viewer to watch as the particle traces out the plot. Is there a way to do this in _Mathematica_?
