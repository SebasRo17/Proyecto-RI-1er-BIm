I am trying to save the following plot as a pdf, so that I can import it into LaTeX:               Grid[{{RegionPlot[{x<y,x>y},{x,-2-1/10,2+1/10},{y,-1/10,3+1/10},PlotPoints->20,PlotStyle->{Texture[Graphics[Table[Circle[{i,j},1/4],{i,20},{j,20}]]],Texture[Graphics[Table[Polygon[{{1+i,0+j},{0+i,Sqrt[3]+j},{-1+i,0+j}}],{i,2,80,4},{j,2,80,4}]]]},BoundaryStyle->Black,PlotRange->{{-2,2},{0,3}},ImageSize->350],Grid[{{Graphics[Table[Circle[{i,j},1/4],{i,3},{j,3}],ImageSize->30,Frame->True,FrameTicks->None],"(Min, Min) & (Mix, Max)"},{Graphics[Table[Polygon[{{1+i,0+j},{0+i,Sqrt[3]+j},{-1+i,0+j}}],{i,2,10,4},{j,2,10,4}],ImageSize->30,Frame->True,FrameTicks->None],"(Mix, Max)"}},Spacings->{1,1/2}]}},Spacings->{2,1}]      However, if I right-click on the output and click 'save selection as', the pdf I get changes the `RegionPlot` into a image (probably jpeg). However, it does manage to keep the `Graphics`, to the right of the `RegionPlot`, as a non- image pdf code. I believe this is due to the function `Texture`, which turns the `Graphics` inside `Texture` into an image. How can I get the full output into non-image pdf code?
