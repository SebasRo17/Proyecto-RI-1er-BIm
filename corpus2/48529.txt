This equation: $(\frac{-a}{x})^2=\sqrt{\frac{1}{x}}$ at $a > 0$ and $x > 0$ has a clear solution $x=a^{4/3}$, doesn't it? However,               Reduce[(-(a/x))^2 == (1/x)^(1/2) && x > 0 && a > 0] // ToRadicals      yields > >     a > 0 && x == (-1)^(2/3) a^(4/3) >   where                ComplexExpand[(-1)^(2/3)]      > >     -(1/2) + (I Sqrt[3])/2 >   is a complex number, numerically `N @ %` yields `-0.5 + 0.866025 I`. Why?
