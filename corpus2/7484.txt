I am working on a research problem in discrete geometry to do with sphere packings, and believe it or not, I have been able to reduce it to finding the solutions to the Diophantine equation, $$n = \frac{x + 2y + 3z}{2}, \text{ where $n,x,y,z \in \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$}$$ In _Mathematica 8_ I have attempted to use the "FindInstance" command in order to find these solutions (there are a finite number of them), but I have no way to define the domain $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$, it only accepts "Reals", "Integers", etc. as a domain. Is there any way around this?               FindInstance[(x + 2 y + 3 z)/2 == 4, {x, y, z}, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, 10]      My idea would be to use that to find 10 instances of the solution, but the domain is undefined.
