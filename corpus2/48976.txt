This question is directed more toward employers and graduate student advisors/professors but all opinions are welcome. What do you find is a common weakness of new hires and/or new grad students? Is it entirely variable dependent on the student and his or her university? Is there a particular skill or skillset that you wish new hires/researchers had expertise in and how can we remedey this deficiency? I realize that this question is general and really encapsulates two questions, one more about the weaknesses of new software engineers and one about the weaknesses of new researchers. However, both types of people tend to come from similar courses of study so I'm wondering if there is any overlap. Note: I am not a professor but I'm interested in how best to revise the undergraduate curriculum in CS.
