In a new notebook, I can illustrate how the action of `Magnify` is cut off by the window width:               SetOptions[EvaluationNotebook[], WindowSize -> {600, 1000}]     p = Plot[x^2, {x, -1, 1}]     Magnify[p, 4]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SaEXX.png) At this point, the plot shows only the axis labels enlarged, whereas the documentation states that `Magnify` scales all aspects of the graphic. The expected behavior is recovered if we enlarge the window:               SetOptions[EvaluationNotebook[], WindowSize -> {1700, 1000}]      Notice how the previous plot is now scaled to twice the original size in all aspects. Is there a way to use `Magnify` in windows of arbitrary size and always get a consistent result with all aspects of a graphic scaled by the same factor, as the documentation states?
