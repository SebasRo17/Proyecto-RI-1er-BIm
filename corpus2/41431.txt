I used to be able to connect to a SQL Server database. I haven't run this program for a few months. I tried it today and it failed, so I went back to try OpenSQLConnection[] and got the following error:               StringJoin::string: String expected at position 2 in server:1433/<>database.      I began my program with:               Needs["DatabaseLink`"]     Needs["JLink`"];      I tried to connect to my database anyway, but that returned:               OpenSQLConnection[JDBC[Microsoft SQL Server(jTDS),     server:1433/ <> database],  "Catalog" -> TOA_DW,     Description -> The reinsurance data warehouse.  Connection     created on September 5, 2013., Location->     C:\Users\mkaplan\AppData\Roaming\Mathematica\     DatabaseResources\warehouse.m, Name -> warehouse,      Password ->  , Properties -> {},      ReadOnly -> False, RelativePath -> False, Timeout -> Automatic,     TransactionIsolationLevel -> ReadUncommitted,      UseConnectionPool -> False, Username -> , Version -> 2.]      When I ran SQLConnections[] I got nothing. Then I tried to connect to the demo database. Got the same initial error when I executed OpenSQLConnection[]. I manually tried to connect to demo through the UI and got a bunch more of the same "StringJoin" errors. However when I ran SQLConnections[] I did get:               {SQLConnection["demo", 1, Open, TransactionIsolationLevel -> ReadCommitted]}      Which I think means that it connected. There **have** been some changes to permissions that were put into place since the last time I ran this successfully. However OpenSQLConnections[] isn't specifying anything, so I wonder why I got that initial "StringJoin" error. Also, I **can** connect to my database using the SQL Management Studio. Can anyone suggest where to start looking for the problem?
