I'm on a shared hosting account which runs cPanel, pretty standard unless you have your own VM. cPanel currently doesn't support Rails 3. My flat mate who has been working with ROR for the last year strongly suggests I set up my own development VM on my machine and learn ROR with Rails 3, and when it comes to putting stuff live on my hosting, work round any issues with Rails versions. I'm not 100% convinced by this, as I don't really want to maintain a local VM myself due to limited experience / time. I still haven't really started looking at ROR and have only done a few simple interactive on-line tutorials. What are your thoughts / feelings / suggestions on this? If I stick with my hosts version of Ruby and Rails, will I be at a major disadvantage when it comes to working in industry or should it not make a huge amount of difference? Background: I'm still a uni student.
