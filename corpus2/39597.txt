I want to get the coordinates of the bisection points for a given line segment to a specified resolution. For example, when the line is given by {0,0} and {1,0}, the output coordinates should be {0.5,0} for the first iteration, and then {0.25,0} and {0.75,0} for the second iteration, and so on, until the distances between those points are less than some resolution, say 1/16. Is there a convenient way?
