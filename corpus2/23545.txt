I am developing a package and would like to be able to test it without having to copy the package file to my `$UserBaseDirectory/Applications` folder for each change, so it would be convenient for me to just create a Finder link or symlink pointing back to my working file. So far I have not been able to convince Mathematica to treat the link as a package file. Am I missing a subtle technique that may make this possible?
