I'm focusing on trying to understand UML diagrams and learning to interpret them in order to implement the designs they describe. In the following diagram, I am not clear on what the implementation for `Port Operation` should be. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IMimV.png) It looks like it should be a class/entity the same as the others in the diagram. I understand the relationship between Leg and `Port Operation` is bidirectional. But it seems that it does not make sense to have a class just for port operations, and having Load() and Unload() methods in Leg doesn't make much sense since a Leg class does not represent a port or its' operations. When reading UML diagrams, is it expected that there are multiple ways for someone to implement it? i.e some ways are better than others, and it's a judgement call as to how someone implements it? What would be the recommened implementation for the above diagram with regards to Port Operation?
