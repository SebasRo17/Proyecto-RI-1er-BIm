Definite integrals from `0` to `Infinity` over a product of two hypergeometric (including exponential, trigonometric, hyperbolic, Bessel, etc) functions (optionally times a power of the integration variable) always result in a hygergeometric function (`HypergeometricPFQ` or `MeijerG`). With some experience, many important properties such as the asymptotic behavior at small or large argument can be immediately seen from the hypergeometric notation. Unfortunately, _Mathematica_ takes this nice, compact and very informative output and "simplifies" it into a combination of simpler functions, often resulting in rather lengthy outputs where all the useful information contained in the original hypergeometric notation is lost. How can I prevent this simplification?   Integrate should result in a `HypergeometricPFQ` or `MeijerG` without further simplification unless explicitly requested via `Simplify` or `FullSimplify`.
