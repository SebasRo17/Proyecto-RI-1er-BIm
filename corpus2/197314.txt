I'm jumping back into ASP.NET development after spending the past 7 years playing manager, dba, and winforms developer. I've dabbled with a few things web related, primarily maintenance of existing webforms apps, but I haven't done anything with newer technologies. My, how things have changed! After watching a lot of videos, reading a lot of articles, and messing around with some of the new tools, I think I must be looking at things the wrong way. I tend to think in terms of writing web apps using C# and server-side processing rather than client-side processing. I never used much JavaScript and depended on things like Infragistics NetAdvantage controls and their asynchronous refresh panel. Is it reasonable to assume that "modern" web developers think in terms of JavaScript and client-side coding, only hitting the server via a service for data processing, retrieveal, and storage?
