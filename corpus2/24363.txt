I imported pictures into _Mathematica_ , and used names for them that follow the easy scheme "name" string joined with an integer, ranging from 14 to 20. Printing these images on screen works nicely:               Do[Print[ToExpression[StringJoin["name", ToString[i]]]], {i, 14, 20}]      However, applying operations like `ColorNegate[]` or `ColorReplace[]` instead of `Print[]` will result in neither any output nor error message. Is it possible to process several images at once?
