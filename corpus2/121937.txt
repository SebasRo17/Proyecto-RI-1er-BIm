So I am trying to develop an activity feed for my site. Basically If I `UNION` a bunch of activities into a feed I would end up with something like the following. > **Chris** is now friends with **Mark** > > **Chris** is now friends with **Dave** What I want though is a neater way of grouping these similar posts so the feed doesn't give information overload... E.g. > **Chris** is now friends with **Mark** , **Dave** and **4 Others** Any ideas on how I can approach this logically? I am using Classic ASP on SQL server. Here is the `UNION` statement I have so far:               SELECT          U.UserID As UserID, L.UN As UN,Left(U.UID,13) As ProfilePic,U.Fname          + ' '          + U.Sname As FullName, 'said '          + WP.Post AS Activity, WP.Ctime     FROM         Users AS U LEFT JOIN Logins L ON L.userID = U.UserID      LEFT OUTER JOIN          WallPosts AS WP ON WP.userID = U.userID WHERE WP.Ctime IS NOT NULL     UNION SELECT         U.UserID As UserID, L.UN As UN,Left(U.UID,13) As ProfilePic,U.Fname          + ' '          + U.Sname As FullName, 'commented '          + C.Comment AS Activity, C.Ctime     FROM Users AS U      LEFT JOIN Logins L ON L.userID = U.UserID      LEFT OUTER JOIN         Comments AS C ON C.UserID = U.userID WHERE C.Ctime IS NOT NULL     UNION SELECT          U.UserID As UserID, L.UN As UN,Left(U.UID,13) As ProfilePic, U.Fname          + ' '          + U.Sname As FullName, 'connected with <a href="/profile.asp?un='+(SELECT Logins.un FROM Logins WHERE Logins.userID = Cn.ToUserID)+'">'          + (SELECT Users.Fname          + ' '          + Users.Sname FROM Users WHERE userID = Cn.ToUserID)          + '</a>' AS Activity, Cn.Ctime     FROM          Users AS U      LEFT JOIN          Logins L ON L.userID = U.UserID      LEFT OUTER JOIN         Connections AS Cn ON Cn.UserID = U.userID WHERE CN.Ctime IS NOT NULL
