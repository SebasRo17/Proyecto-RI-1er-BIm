One may observe that `MakeBoxes` does not give the actual Box form of various expressions:               MakeBoxes[{1*^4, 000123, a*b c}]      > >     RowBox[{"{", RowBox[{"10000", ",", "123", ",", RowBox[{"a", " ", "b", " > ", "c"}]}], "}"}] >   The `1*^4` was expanded, the leading zeros of `000123` were stripped, and the distinction between `*` and (space) was lost. Also, `MakeBoxes` doesn't like syntactically invalid or incomplete strings:               MakeBoxes[0001+`1,*^6*a b]      > Syntax::sntxi: Incomplete expression; more input is needed. How can one get the actual Box form visible with Show Expression (`Ctrl`+`Shift`+`E`) without copy & paste?
