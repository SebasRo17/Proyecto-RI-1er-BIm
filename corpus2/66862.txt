I am considering open sourcing some software, but when I read the answers on this questions, it seems like the penalty of ignoring a GPL license is rather small, compared to the costs of the suing party to document that the other party has included GPL code in their proprietary code and the costs of suing. Therefore, I would like to know if there is a way to make a license or some kind of contract before source code is accessed, which is stricter than GPL. What I want to achieve is that a company including GPL code in their proprietary code have to GPL their whole code, and not just rewrite the GPL code. Is this possible?
