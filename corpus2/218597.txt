I am trying to understand object oriented code better and I decided to start at abstraction. If I am not incorrect, abstraction means that you hide information that isn't relevant to what task you want to perform, i.e. If I turn on the TV I would not need to know the internal that is going on. Or If I have a class that handles Orders, and I would like to get the Total cost of a couple of Products, a getTotal() method would be the only thing that the User needs to know about to get the total sum of the products, and not how it's actually calculated. So per se, by using a class I am abstracting data?
