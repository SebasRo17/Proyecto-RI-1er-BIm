I would like to smooth out the jagged edges in the outermost contours in the following plot: ![Plot with jagged edges.](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bSsYx.jpg) I have data of values as a function of variables (x,y) in the form               data = {{{x1,y1},z1},{{x2,y2},z2},...};      The figure is produced by               data = << "data.dat";     fnct = Interpolation[data];         RegionPlot[{fnct[x, y] > 2, fnct[x, y] > 100, fnct[x, y] > 140}, {x, 10^-2, 10^1}, {y, 0, 3},MaxRecursion->5]      The outer edges seem jagged I guess because the data is not very good there. I need to fit a smooth contour instead. I've looked at some other questions like Smoothing ListContourPlot contours but that uses ListContourPlot which for me takes ages and produces a bad result even for the original figure. Any help appreciated. The data can be found here: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/34796693/data.dat
