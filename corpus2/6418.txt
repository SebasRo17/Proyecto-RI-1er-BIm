I am considering using Mathematica with Wolfram Workbench as a standard platform for calculations and programs in a large engineering department. I am looking for a solution that would provide better validation, documentation and revision control than Excel spreadsheets with VisualBasic macros. Additional benefits would be to use built-in functionality to reduce development effort and to allow engineers to use code interactively instead of in a black-box mode. I have used Mathematica and WebMathematica for individual projects in the past, and am familiar with the various customer examples that Wolfram advertises. However, I don't have experience or examples of using Mathematica across a large engineering department. I expect that we would develop packages for various back end functionality (likely on the order of 20,000+ lines of code), and users would access it either directly in the notebook, through CDF applications or through WebMathematica depending on the application. Is Mathematica suitable for this type of use? Can average users learn Mathematica without too much trouble and become productive quickly? Is there a better solution you would suggest evaluating?
