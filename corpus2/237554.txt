After studying HTML 5, I learnt that HTML is purely for defining semantics of data. And it has provided various tag for each purpose. Although we can create our own tags, can provide styling and it will work still we use standard tags because they are known at global level. And all search engines can understand them. JS frameworks like AngularJS provide the way of creating own directive/tags. Which are non-standard tags. Moreover, I believe that programming logic should be kept apart from HTML :ng- if, ng-repeat etc. It makes HTML page very difficult to understand by a pure UI designer. I would say these frameworks make a HTML page developer friendly not designer friendly. If we put all the logic on a HTML page, there would not be any difference between a server side page & a HTML page. I believe **there should not be any non-standard tag and no programming logic** (like conditional or looping statements) **presents on HTML page**. Instead JS should handle/control HTML from outside. Please tell me if I am incorrect somewhere. Or give me some positives views So I can think about using such frameworks.
