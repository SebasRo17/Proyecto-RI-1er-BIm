I am currently reading some material by Jeff Patton regarding Agile and UX. http://www.agileproductdesign.com/presentations/index.html I was interested to find out from the community what UX design and testing behaviors seemed MOST helpful to their scrum teams to create GREAT and delightful products.   1. hallway usability?   2. paper prototypes?   3. seeing how users actually use the software?   4. others? Thanks!
