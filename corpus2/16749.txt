I wanted to remove the `Ticks` in my coding but i can't. Here when i try to remove the `Ticks` the number also gone. I need numbers without `Ticks`, `Ticks` and `GridLines` should be automatic and don't use`PlotRange` .               BarChart[{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}}, ImageSize -> 400, BarOrigin -> Left,       ChartLayout -> "Stacked", ImageSize -> {500, 300},       GridLines -> {Automatic, None}, Ticks -> {{Automatic}, None},       LabelStyle ->        Directive[Bold, Opacity[1], Thick, Black,         FontFamily -> "Helvetica"],       TicksStyle -> Directive[20, Opacity[.3]], Axes -> {True, False},       AxesStyle -> Opacity[.0],       ChartStyle -> {RGBColor[.06, .29, .66], RGBColor[.01, .56, .61],         RGBColor[1, .58, 0]},      ChartBaseStyle -> EdgeForm[GrayLevel[.6]]]
