For given dataset               data = Re[Zeta[1/2 + I Range[0, 100, 0.01]]];      It is nice that Mathematica can plot data in both Cartesian and Polar coordinates.               SetOptions[ListPolarPlot, Joined -> True];     #[data] & /@ {ListLinePlot, ListPolarPlot}      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TKZFN.png) WaveletScalogram is an insightful glance in temporal data:               cwd = ContinuousWaveletTransform[data, GaborWavelet[6], {4, 12}, WaveletScale -> 100];     ws = WaveletScalogram[cwd, All, Re, ColorFunction -> "CherryTones"]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/M3KD9.png) **Is it possible to somehow visualize it in Polar coordinates?** I would try to extract the data from underlying Graphics, but it is a raster               ws[[1]] // Head     ws[[1, 1]] // Dimensions      > >     Raster >     {48, 5001} >   The only thing that comes to mind is ImageTransformation but I donâ€™t think it is an efficient way (will be hard to scale the axis, etc.). Any advice is appreciated.
