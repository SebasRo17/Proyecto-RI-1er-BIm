Even as a student I am asked to review the code of programmers who have (not) passed a test (create a list of Fibonacci numbers on android). While I am very strict on coding style I just read about the "block" style someone used (read the comments!). In my position I would recommend to not hire a guy using this kind of style. The code is completely the opposite of the coding style used in my firm. While searching for coding style and how to deal with a lack of it I am curious about one thing: Should I hire a guy that will have ~~serious trouble~~ adapting the coding style used in the firm? Please: This should _not_ be a discussion about coding style in general and which is better. Its about the importance of coding style for the decision to hire someone! **More information:** I am not the guy that makes the decision, I just give my opinion based on code. The guy has to pass an interview where our head of whatever checks the soft skills. If he passed this, he have to pass our little skill test and thats where sometimes I was asked to review the written code. I am not in the position to say yes or no. I just want to know how important coding style should be for my review...
