In Mathematica, producing a color based on its RGB parameters is easy; one can use (for example)               Graphics[{RGBColor[0.8, 0.6, 0.5], Rectangle[]}, ImageSize -> 100]      or               Image[{{{0.8, 0.6, 0.5}}}, Automatic, ColorSpace -> "RGB", ImageSize -> 100]      This produces a square as follows: ![RGB Color Sample](http://i.stack.imgur.com/F3OJ9.png) The range of values for each of the `r, g, b` parameters are from `0 to 1`, as listed in the documentation. Any value of out of this range will be clipped. However, if I would like to produce a color based on its CIE XYZ color, I can still do as follows               Image[{{{0.8, 0.6, 0.5}}}, Automatic, ColorSpace -> "XYZ", ImageSize -> 100]      ![XYZ Color Sample](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6Smmo.png) Note that the color produced will be visually different since the `XYZ` color space is different from that of the `RGB` color space. My question is, do you know what are the range of values for each of the `X, Y, Z` parameters? I can't find this in the existing documentation. I was thinking of checking the range of values by trial and error (changing one parameter and seeing whether the values are clipped by comparing the results visually), but I hope there's a better way to do this or that there was some documentation that I missed. **Note** : The online EasyRGB calculator limits the `X, Y, Z` parameters from `0 to 95.047, 0 to 100, 0 to 108.883` respectively, and I'm suspecting that the limits for Mathematica would be simply 1/100 of these limits. Would like some verification on this if possible, though.
