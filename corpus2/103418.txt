Our scrum teams are split geographically (not ideal I know!) due to specific knowledge only being available in certain countries. So one team of say 7 members, has the business person in one city, 2 devs in another, 2 other devs in another and 2 qa's in another. Any suggestions for how to manage this type of graphically dispersed team? Any best practices? How do you do standups? via skype video? do we ensure that people travel every 6 weeks (the half time of trust apparently)? how do we do the task board? Virtually or via video? would kanban work better in this setup?
