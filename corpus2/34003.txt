So I find the velocity profile for Pressure driven pipe flow and it looks like: $$u = \frac{h^2}{2 \mu} \frac{\mathrm{d}P}{\mathrm{d}x}\left[1 - \left(\frac{y}{h}\right)^2\right]$$ Here, a fluid flows between two walls separated by a distance $h$. The pressure gradient $\mathrm{d}P/\mathrm{d}X$ drives the flow. The vertical coordinate axis is $y$. How do I plot this as a velocity profile (`VelocityPlot`)? When I try do plot this with               μ = 0.02; Px = -0.5; h = 1.0;     VectorPlot[{(h^2/(2 μ)) Px (1 - (y/h)^2), 0}, {x, 0, 3}, {y, -3, 3}]      I get the following figure: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9kLPr.jpg) However, the velocity profile is parabolic and should look like: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xBl12.png) I apologize for the low quality vector plot from ansys but what went wrong with my `VectorPlot[...]` definition?
