I want to know what is more standard way to call regular expression in short way. I have seen both, regex and regexp. Google says regex has almost 2 as much hits that regexp, but it depends on way I search it (when I add "regular expression" after the word, "regex" becomes "regex regular expression", the result is differend). And on stackexchange there is regex tag. :) What is more proper way to shorten it? Perhaps it does not matter. :) But thanks for answer.
