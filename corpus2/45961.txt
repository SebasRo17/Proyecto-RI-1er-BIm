**Related (math.SE):** How does the base of a group determine the “sort” of the elements in the group The help page for `GroupActionBase` says: >   * A base of a group is a list of points of its domain of action such that > the only element in the group fixing them all is the identity. >   * Reordering the points in a base gives a different base. >   * The choice of base affects the ordering of group elements in the > functions `GroupElements` and `GroupElementPosition`. >   * If the list of points given is not a base, Mathematica will add more > points until obtaining a base. In particular, `GroupActionBase -> {}` will > make Mathematica choose an appropriate base. > It doesn't explain **how** the order of points in a base affects the order of the elements in a group. Since this is pretty much exactly what you need to know in order to use `GroupActionBase`, at a minimum should have been included in the help file. ;-) They do include a single example (that wasn't very illuminating for me), which I'll include below for easy reference. So bullet 1 specifies that a base needs enough points such that only the group identity will fix all the points in the base, and bullet 4 says if you don't provide a full base, Mathematica will add points (via some unspecified methodology) until it's a base, but this doesn't explain how the order of the points in the base relates to the order of the elements of the group. From bullet 1 and the example, it's apparent that a base is a flat list of the same positive integers that the `Cycles` notation operates on. However, the group $S_n$ (the example below is contained inside $S_4$) operates on a set of $n$ elements, and there are $n!$ ways to order them in a base. But $S_n$ itself has $n!$ group elements, meaning there are $(n!)!$ ways to order the elements of the group. **Can anyone clarify how specification of a base via`GroupActionBase` effects the order of the group elements reported by `GroupElements` and `GroupElementPosition`?**    **Basic Examples (1)**               Elements of a group in standard order:          In[1] := GroupElements[PermutationGroup[{Cycles[{{1, 2}, {3, 4}}], Cycles[{{1, 3}}]}]]     Out[1]:= {Cycles[{}], Cycles[{{2, 4}}], Cycles[{{1, 2}, {3, 4}}],               Cycles[{{1, 2, 3, 4}}], Cycles[{{1, 3}}], Cycles[{{1, 3}, {2, 4}}],               Cycles[{{1, 4, 3, 2}}], Cycles[{{1, 4}, {2, 3}}]}          In[2] := OrderedQ[%, Less]     Out[2]:= True          Sort them, specifying different priorities with a base:          In[3] := GroupElements[PermutationGroup[{Cycles[{{1, 2}, {3, 4}}], Cycles[{{1, 3}}]}],                GroupActionBase -> {4, 2}]     Out[3]:= {Cycles[{}], Cycles[{{1, 3}}], Cycles[{{2, 4}}],                Cycles[{{1, 3}, {2, 4}}], Cycles[{{1, 4}, {2, 3}}],                Cycles[{{1, 2, 3, 4}}], Cycles[{{1, 4, 3, 2}}],                Cycles[{{1, 2}, {3, 4}}]}
