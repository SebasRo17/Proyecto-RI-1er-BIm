I am trying to format some text based on some patterns.               Clear[highlight];     SetAttributes[highlight, HoldAll];     highlight[pattern_, style_] :=        s_String :> Row[List @@ StringReplace[s, t : pattern :> style[t]]]      This works fine and dandy if a match is found:               "foo bar baz" /. highlight["foo", Style[#, Red] &]      But doesn't if no match is found:               "fu bar baz" /. highlight["foo", Style[#, Red] &]      > `Row["fu bar baz"]` The failure to match has left us with an ugly `Row`. I'm having a bit of trouble fixing this case, perhaps you can help?
