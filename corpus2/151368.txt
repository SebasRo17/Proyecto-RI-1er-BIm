I am starting to develop a WCF API, which should serve some specific clients. We don't know which devices will be using the API so I thought that using a RESTful API will be the most flexible choice. All devices using the API would be authenticated using an SSL certificate (client side certificate), and our API will have a certificate as well ( so its a 2 Way SSL) I was reading this question over SO, and I saw the answers about authentication using Basic-HTTP or OAuth, but I was thinking that in my case these are not needed, I can already trust the client because it possesses the client-side certificate. Is this design ok? Am I missing anything? Maybe there's a better way of doing this?
