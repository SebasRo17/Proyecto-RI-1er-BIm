I would to match a pattern                p1 = 0,0,1,0,0      to the elements in listA. The elements are a boolean sequence that may look like this                {{0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0}}      Every where p1 matches the sequence I want to change that part into                p2 = .5, .5, 1, .5, .5      that will change listA into                {{.5, .5, 1, .5, .5, 1, 0, 1, 1, .5, .5, 1, .5, .5},   {0, 0, .5, .5, 1, .5, .5, .5, .5, 1, .5, .5, 0, 0}}      Thanks!
