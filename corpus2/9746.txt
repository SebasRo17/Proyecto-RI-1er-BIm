For some reason the option `DirectedEdges->True`, albeit working internally with grid graph, does not appear in the visualisation for 1D and 2D graphs. It also changes the drawing scheme for 3D grids. **1D Grid-Graphs** Using               g1 = GridGraph[{2}, VertexLabels -> "Name", ImagePadding -> 20, DirectedEdges -> True]      prints: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fIVfq.jpg) which shows no directed edges, even though the incidence matrix is modified correctly: \begin{equation} \text{IncidenceMatrix[g1]} = \left( \begin{array}{c} -1 \\\ 1 \end{array} \right) \end{equation} Conversely, issuing the command               GridGraph[{1,2}, VertexLabels -> "Name", ImagePadding -> 20, DirectedEdges -> True]      prints ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/LN8hI.jpg) ie, with the directed edges correctly drawn. **2D Grid-Graphs** For 2D graphs, small dimensions print as a directed edge whereas higher dimensions do not. For instance               g = GridGraph[{2, 2}, VertexLabels -> "Name", ImagePadding -> 20, DirectedEdges -> True]      produces: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7Xy9i.jpg) For dimensions {4,2} the graph is: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/z2DHz.jpg) where some very tiny arrows can in fact be observed. Conversely, for dimensions {2,4} it produces ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KNsC5.jpg) It thence seems like a problem in adjusting the size of the arrows. But this seems unrelated to the 1D graph since there, no arrow can be seen in any dimension (unless drawn horizontally, in which case a 2D Grid-Graph is actually being called). **3D Grid-Graphs** Apparently, the arrows are drawn correctly for dimensions 3 and larger. However, the drawing scheme is affected, which is not the case in 2D graphs. For instance                GridGraph[{4, 2, 2}, VertexLabels -> "Name", ImagePadding -> 20]      produces ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/RBvkP.jpg) whereas adding `DirectedEdges->True` yields ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cLOkx.jpg) In summary: odd stuff. Any thoughts? Thank you in advance for the attention.
