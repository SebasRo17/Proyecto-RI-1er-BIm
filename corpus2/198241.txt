When you have basedir/url constants or variables, do you put a trailing slash? In theory I think ultimately one should, since /path/to/dir/ is a dir while with /path/to/dir if I'm not mistaken the server checks if there's a file called 'dir', and then adds a trailing slash for you. However, I think `$my_url = BASE_URL . '/my/dir/'` looks better than this: `$my_url = BASE_URL . 'my/dir/'` Better yet, this: `<img src="<?php echo BASE_URL; ?>/my/dir/">` looks a lot more readable to me than `<img src="<?php echo BASE_URL; ?>my/dir">`. Obviously this might be personal preference, and fine as long as one is consistent, but what is most common? What approach do you prefer? Any opinion appreciated.
