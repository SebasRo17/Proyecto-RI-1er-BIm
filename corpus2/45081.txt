Continuing the question How to extract the edge from a set of points and its answer by Simon Woods, I would like to ask if there is a way to extract the boundary of ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/h2Ewf.png) obtained as               ToExpression@Import@"http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=741qaDt2";     boundary = Complement[spiel, Intersection @@          Outer[Plus, {{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}}, spiel, 1]];      ordered in such a way that               ListPlot[boundary,Joined->True]      would give a polygon outlining the shape? The points extracted the way they are in the answer are not ordered along the boundary: ![not ordered points](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vY31D.png) It would be even better to know if it is possible with `MorphometricComponents[]`, because images I am working on look like that: ![typical image](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tmKw2.png) With `MorphometricComponents[]` one can extract perimeter lenghts, baricenters and whatever he likes for the components, but not the ordered perimeter points themselves. So the question is if there is a way to do that? Just to be clear: for each region in the picture, I would like to have the ordered coordinates of the points of the boundary `boundary={{x1,y1},{x2,y2},...}` such that `ListPlot[boundary,Joined->True]` would give polygons outlining the shapes.
