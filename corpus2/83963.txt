If you were tasked with performing due diligence for a software product/IP you/your company was considering buying. What would be your steps to make sure the purchase was acceptable from a technical risk level? The scenario is one company has a product you or your company is interested in buying in it's entirety (IP and code) so that your company can now sell that product or it's services. The upfront assumption is the product has some value, but you want to assess the technical foundation of the product to ensure it's not a complete hack and nightmare to support. Examples of this might include   * Compile/Build and install the software on a clean computer to verify the build and deploy cycle.   * Run a code profiling tool against the code base to get an idea of overall code quality. What else? Are there any resources/checklists on the web which might help?
