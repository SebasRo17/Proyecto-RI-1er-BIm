Can one explain the specifics and details of a netplay framework for a game that optimizes connection through a "prediction / rollback" mechanic, as seen in games where speed is a priority (first-person shooters, modern fighting games since Street Fighter IV, etc)? I have previously studied this article as an example: Source Multiplayer Networking, which describes Valve's techniques used in their shooters on a high, abstract level. However, it is simply too high-level and theoretical to be of use to me. Other similar articles follow this same pattern; none offer code samples or working examples. I have previously crafted netplay systems that use unoptimized TCP/IP, which is obviously horrendously slow and non-useful for anything except LAN play. Although I have taken a college course on network programming, I am only confident and experienced enough to have made this system through approximate copying of other pre-existing code.
