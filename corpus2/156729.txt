_I posted a similar question on the PHP section of stackoverflow and was told that this might be a better forum in which to submit my question._ Without any programming experience whatsoever, I started studying PHP beginning in the second quarter of this year with the goal of slowly building my dream website starting later this summer. Just as I was wrapping my head around PHP and beginning--I felt-- to truly understand the different concepts and how the code works (this is why I prefaced my post with my non-experience--I've really had to bang and cram it all in my head), I come across Object Oriented PHP. I've taken the approach of of mastering (trying, as much as possible, at least) as many of the concepts and ideas before diving in to try and create my own scripts; much like learning how to dribble, throw a baseball or football well, before playing a single game. (of course I've played around with and done some code -drills). My question to the experts is this: Should or must I learn and delve deep into Object-Oriented-PHP, thus delaying my "start-to-code" date? Or will procedural PHP Programming suffice if one would like to build good E-commerce, forum/comment-type (like PHP Help) or basic social networking websites? How far will procedural programming take me? A site with 1,000; tens-of- thousands; hundred thousand visitors? Thanks in advance for your expert insights.
