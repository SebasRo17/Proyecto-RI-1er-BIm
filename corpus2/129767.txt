I have just joined a company where the major projects, including the one i have landed on, use Guice. I have never used Guice. I am familiar with dependency injection, in the shape of CDI (a bit) and the obscure but decent Nucleus (part of ATG). We just completed a successful iteration, so tomorrow (friday the 13th!) is a day that developers have to spend on things they think are valuable. I have some meetings during the day, but i will have about four or five hours to do this. I have a machine to myself, with Eclipse installed and configured to my liking. I would like to spend my day learning about Guice. How should i spend my time? (I'm not entirely sure this is an appropriate question for Programmers, but there's only one way to find out)
