**Background:** This is the third question in a row of questions about how to make editing packages in the front-end much more bearable (the other two are here and here). It seems that the front end is quite extensible, so I may not have to start using Workbench yet :) When writing long blocks of code, proper indentation is invaluable. This is why most programming editors preserve the white space indentation when you enter a new line. So if you have three white spaces at the current line and press `Enter` to move to a new line, it will also have three white spaces. ![Example image](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Xm8wC.png) So my question is: **Is there a way to make the front-end preserve the white space indentation (when editing a package)?**
