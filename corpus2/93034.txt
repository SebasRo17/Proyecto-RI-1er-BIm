I'm looking for a book that explains functional programming in an accessible manner. Also I would prefer one that isn't too dull, and doesn't use an esoteric language. Ideally it will use examples that demonstrate situations where functional programming leads to more elegant or simpler solutions than imperative approaches. I have a reasonable amount of programming experience, but no knowledge of functional programming. Thanks for any suggestions
