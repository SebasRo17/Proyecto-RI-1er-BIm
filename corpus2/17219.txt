I have a list:               list = {{1,1,0.05,0.05}, {2,2,0.05,0.05}};      and I want to do this change               Replace[#[[1]], #[[1]] -> (#[[1]] + #[[3]])]& /@ list         Replace[#[[2]], #[[2]] -> (#[[2]] + #[[4]])]& /@ list       The problem is that the initial list doesn't change. My list represents $\{\{x, y, v_x, v_y\}, \{x, y, v_x, v_y\}\} $ and I want to use a replacement rule to change the position of the objects and thereby represent movement.
