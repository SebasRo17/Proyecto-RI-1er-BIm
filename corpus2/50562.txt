I am trying to combine two graphics objects using `Show`. The first one is an isosurface:               data = Import["/PATH/furan-ks.sdat", "Table"];     ALEE = Nearest[data[[All, {1, 2, 3}]] -> Rescale[data[[All, 4]]]];     cfALEE = ColorData["Rainbow"]@First@ALEE[{#1, #2, #3}] &;     isosurface=ListSurfacePlot3D[data[[All, {1, 2, 3}]], BoxRatios -> Automatic,      ColorFunction -> cfALEE, ColorFunctionScaling -> False,      Boxed -> False, Axes -> False, Mesh -> None, MaxPlotPoints -> 25,      ImageSize -> 500]      ![isosurface](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2KBWW.jpg) The second one is a sequence of points:                geom = Import["/PATH/furan.geom", "Table"];      AngToAu = 1.88971616463;      Function[x, x*AngToAu];      geom = Map[%, geom, {2}];      Show[Graphics3D[{Black, PointSize[0.05], Point[geom]}, Boxed -> False]]      ![points](http://i.stack.imgur.com/T7jes.jpg) I want the points to appear on the same plot as the surface and be plotted at the appropriate scale. A command I am using:               Show[isosurface, Graphics3D[{Black, PointSize[0.05], Point[geom]}, Boxed -> False]]      The catch is that the points effectively appear inside the surface and are NOT visible. I need to somehow project them on the surface or make them visible through the surface. How do I deal with this? Any suggestions? **EDIT** : attached the files isosurface geom
