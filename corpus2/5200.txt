I just installed Mathematica 8.0.4.0, which has a CDF Deployment Wizard. This is supposed to make it easy to post a CDF file on a WordPress blog. I tried it, and it indeed was easy; the problem is that when I Previewed the post, the CDF logo showed up and created a rectangle that quickly turned solid gray. This is the entire code I used in my blog:               <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>The example</strong></p> <div> <script     type="text/javascript"     src="http://www.wolfram.com/cdf-player/plugin/v2.1/cdfplugin.js"></script>     <script type="text/javascript"> var cdf = new cdfplugin();     cdf.embed('http://www.abstractmath.org/Mathematica/Elaborate Riemann     Example.cdf', 427, 536); </script>     </div>      The two scripts were created by the Wizard and pasted into the post. You can download the file Elaborate Riemann Example.cdf yourself from the URL above, and, if you have CDF Player on your computer, you can run it. It works fine on my computer. But it won't appear within the post. Any ideas why?
