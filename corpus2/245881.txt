If I have server with 256 Gb of ram. I was wondering can I create a C# application which has a 100 GB of memory footprint? I want to create a dictionary like               Dictionary<DateTime,Dictionary<string,Dictionary<string,DataClass>>                    Fist dictionary     DateTime - Max 40 distinct values          Second Dictionary     string : 2000 distinct values          Third dictionary     string : 100 distinct values      Object will be removed from the DateTime part (after every say 1 hour), till 1 hour, various internal members are populated. With Java I am told even if the server has large memory, JVM will stall because of GC.
