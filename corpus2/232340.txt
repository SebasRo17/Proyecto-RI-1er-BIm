Commitment is a promise, and we all have been taught that you need to keep your promises. But is it realistic to keep the commitment for each Sprint? Sometimes people get sick, sometimes the technical approach is proven wrong and you have to rethink everything, sometimes during further discussions with the product owner or the users you understand that the feature should be very different from what was originally thought. I know that the official Scrum Guide now uses the word "forecast" rather than commitment, probably to address these problems. So my question is how often do teams in your organizations keep their commitment and whether you like this approach or you want to change it. Thank you.
