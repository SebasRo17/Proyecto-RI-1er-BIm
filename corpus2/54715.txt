EDIT: Lets assume a random matrix:               m = RandomInteger[25, {5, 5}] // MatrixForm     m= {{8, 23, 1, 3, 19}, {25, 4, 21, 7, 15}, {5, 9, 17, 21, 12}, {10, 3, 5,15, 15}, {17, 15, 10, 16, 11}}      The wanted algorithm should do the following: Pick a random element from the given table and change the order of the matrixelements that small gaussian- like clusters are generated. The constraint is that either the row-wise or the coloumn-wise sum should remain constant upon swapping the elements. Suggestions are very welcome!
