I am building an online social network. I have finished writing RESTful API service using Django. This will return only JSON response (No HTML will be generated from server side) so that this JSON response can be used to build native smartphone apps. API service being common to all clients. My question is, since there is no HTML response from server side, can the MV* Javascript Frameworks like Angular / Backbone / Ember take care of complete Front-end, right from generating HTML page with CSS?
