I once in my childhood read a SF story in which it was assumed that the capital letter `'P'` would be a good representation for a question mark, if you cannot use that character directly, eg. in variable names. However the story is quite old and things may have changed :) **Is this a good practice?** BTW: The story was called 'Enter P' or something like that. * * * ### Edit Additional questions that are answered below.   **Is this only writer's phantasy or is it based on an actual language's habit?**   **If yes, which language would that be?**
