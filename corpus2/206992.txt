I found one JAVA project useful to our commercial software which is developed using C#. The JAVA project is under LGPL. My understanding is (please correct me if I am wrong) if I use one compiled LGPL library (for example, .dll in Windows), I don't even need to disclaim the license information. But if I need to make some modifications in the source code, I need to include the LGPL license, and make my modification part which uses the library also under LGPL. Since our software is in .NET, I clearly need to modify from the JAVA source code (starting by converting using Sharpen in Eclipse and then make some manual modification). So my question is, if I convert it to a C# project and compile as a library, and include the license when we are distributing it, is it enough? Do I need to make the source code of the whole new project available (upon request)?
