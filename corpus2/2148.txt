`CurrentImage[]` will capture an image from the webcam. It is even possible to create a live video in the notebook using               Dynamic@CurrentImage[]      After using this function even a single time, Mathematica will not switch off or release the webcam any more, making it impossible to use the webcam from other programs on some systems. How can I switch off / release the webcam from Mathematica, without quitting Mathematica completely?
