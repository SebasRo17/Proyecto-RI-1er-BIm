If I have a horrifically long expression and output it to TeX using TeXForm, I get a long equation which needs to be split up into multiple lines. But splitting it up manually can be quite cumbersome. Is there a solution to this within Mathematica, i.e., a way to output an equation in multiline format? I'm sure I'd need to put in some input about the size of the page, but that's fine.
