I have a PDE problem that I can't solve. and I wonder if you could help me with it. I have a Terzaghi Consolidation equation (similar to the heat equation) that is written as follows: $\frac{du}{dt}=c\frac{d^2u}{dt^2}$ $u$ is pore water pressure $z$ is depth $t$ is time $c$ is a constant pore water pressure is equal at all depth at $t = 0$, but it becomes $0$ at top and bottom directly after that. `u = u[z,t]` ($z$ is depth and $t$ is time) with boundary conditions as follows: `u[z, 0] = 100` ($u$ at all depth when $t = 0$) `u[2, t] = 0` ($u$ at top of the layer; in this case, $2$ is the height of the top layer) `u[0, t] = 0` ($u$ at bottom of the layer) I have solved this kind of problem before using a finite difference technique in a spread sheet, I wanted to find out whether _Mathematica_ can solve this problem directly, but unfortunately I failed. This is what I entered into _Mathematica_ :               NDSolve[{Derivative[0, 1][u][z ,t] == Derivative[2, 0][u][z, t],      u[0, t > 0] == 0, u[2,t > 0] == 0, u[2 > z > 0, 0] == 100}, u, {z, 0, 2},{t, 0, 100}]      Unfortunately, evaluating this expression leads gives the error: > DSolve::litarg: > > "To avoid possible ambiguity, the arguments of the dependent variable in > u[0,t>0]==0; should literally match the independent variables" I dont understand why I'm getting this message. I found a heat problem similar to this. I tried to use the that equation but changed the boundary problem, but that did not work. Can you help me detect which part of equation is wrong, and how I can fix the boundary values?
