Just like the title says, are there any PHP web application frameworks that don't use a front controller? > The Front Controller Pattern is a software design pattern listed in several > pattern catalogs. The pattern relates to the design of web applications. It > "provides a centralized entry point for handling requests." > > The front controller may be implemented as a Java object, or as a script in > a script language like PHP, ASP, CFML or JSP that is called on every request > of a web session. This script, for example an index.php, would handle all > tasks that are common to the application or the framework, such as session > handling, caching, and input filtering. Based on the specific request it > would then instantiate further objects and call methods to handle the > particular task(s) required. > > The alternative to a front controller would be individual scripts like > login.php and order.php that would each then satisfy the type of request. > Each script would have to duplicate code or objects that are common to all > tasks. But each script might also have more flexibility to implement the > particular task required.
