I'm trying to use Mathematica units more often, but I've run into the following problem:                   (*Define some unitful constants*)         q = UnitConvert[Quantity["elementary charge"]];         k = UnitConvert[Quantity["Boltzmann Constant"]];         T = Quantity[300, "Kelvin"];         V = Quantity[5, "Volt"];         (*Do a simple calculation*)         UnitConvert[(q V)/(k T)]      The above code outputs                   Quantity[193.409, ("Kelvins")/("KelvinsDifference")]      which really should just be 193.409, since the units cancel, but Mathematica insists on a distinction between absolute temperature and temperature differences. I understand that such a distinction is useful in conversions, but the above is quite a nuisance. Is there a way to prevent this? I'd rather not have to put in `QuantityMagnitude` calls every time I need to cancel some `Kelvins`. Thanks!
