I just got a trial version of _Mathematica_. I want to experiment with using it for data analysis. I have a CSV file here that I would like to import into Mathematica so that the data is represented as a matrix (2D array) where the columns are represented as column vectors rather than each cell representing a row. I also need to chop off the headers, too. Here's what I've got so far:               data = Import["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/camenergydatalab/EnergyDataSimulationChallenge/master/challenge1/data/dataset_500.csv"]
