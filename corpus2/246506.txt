I have created an app that manages a Data cleansing workflow. Each row imported needs to store an arbitrary number of key value pairs in addition to our standard mysql schema. The key values need to be searchable. I am using rails + mysql currently. What are my options? As of now, I am just adding a new fields to the rails schema as new requirements arise, I need a way to store extra data for each row that might not apply to any other rows.
