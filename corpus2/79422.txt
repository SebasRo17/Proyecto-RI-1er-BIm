I would like to find a job that combines Computer Science with Marketing, ideally in a position where you get to meet a lot of people and travel a fair bit. After having worked as a Front/Back Web App Developer I am getting a degree in Management of Technology, which also includes an element of Marketing. How can I combine my two interests, Computer Science and Marketing, professionally, in a sensible way? Which positions should I be aiming for?
