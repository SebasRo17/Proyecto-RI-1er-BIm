I'm a quite new programmer to Rails (about a year) always trying to discover new gems, new ways of thinking, I just love this framework. The only thing that's kind of disturbing me is testing. I know the major part of the RoR programmers are testing addicts and I understand the advantages of a large testing suite but when I start testing, I never get such a large suite and I always wonder "Am I testing the right way ? Are there really efficient ?". I'm often dealing with integration tests testing only the way the application behave... So I have some questions to improve myself as a Rails programmer. First, is testing really worth it ? I mean, is the time spent on writing tests really worth it ? Then, I use RSpec, I've recently discovered Cucumber, used it for a while but I don't know if writing all these steps is really worth the trouble ? I know I can reuse steps but I never know if these steps are too complete or not : For instance, I've been using a `Given I am logged in as (.+)` but I don't know if I must say in its definition `Given there's a user called $1` because it can duplicate the user if ever created but that's not worthwhile always having a step before `Given I am logged in as (.+)`. It's quite a lot of code that will maybe rarely be useful. I guess there are not new bugs on the parts tested every day... So is Cucumber really worthwhile compared to RSpec ? I really want to thank you for having read me because that's the first message I post that's really long and to thank you in advance for all your answers, hoping it could help other Rails newbies just like me in the future.
