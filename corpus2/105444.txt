We've hit an application issue with an Oracle table Primary Key exceeding the limits used by a Java Integer (2 ^ 32) and one of the suggestions is to reset this to 1000 and let it start again. OR change the code to use Java Long (2 ^ 64) instead. This has a ripple effect since this key is used as ID by a lot of other systems as well. And there can be future duplication (in the far future) Are there any suggestions on good and bad outcomes in this approach?
