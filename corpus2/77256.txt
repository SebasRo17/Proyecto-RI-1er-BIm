I'm going to be giving a presentation to a group of neuroscientists on the use of git to manage their matlab/r/xppaut/etc files. Some of these folks have an extensive software engineering background, some don't know what CVS is. The main goals of the talk are as follows:   * Inform how git can increase collaboration and save everyone time (5-10 min)   * Introduce git as a concept in graph theory, a familiar topic to the crowd (5-10 min)   * Introduce the practicals of git: (rest of time)      * Download & install     * Set up new project (`add`, `difftool`, `commit`, `checkout` & `branch`, `merge`, remotes (maybe), generate & commit patches, `stash`, rollback to previous head, ...?)     * If have time, show them github, specifically how to use it to fork and submit pull requests (I hope to have them set up github accounts to share scripts in the future) I hope to have everyone bring their laptops to follow along on the tutorial. This talk is supposed to be about an hour long, max is about 1.5 hours. My question to you guys is two-fold:   1. In general, what do you think about the proposed outline?   2. Is anyone familiar with slides that I can use for this sort of talk? I want to model the intro part around Joel Spolsky's mercurial tutorial, tone-wise, but I can work with other material if necessary.
