> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Jobs that use programming which aren't in the technology sector I have programming skills, but i don't want to sit in front of a computer 8 hours a day. Is there other career choices that I can consider, that also utilize my existing skills? And what I should do to get those jobs? I am open to anything that doesn't require extensive use of computer, also something that perform routine rather than going through projects (i don't like keep thinking about a project in my free time, because no one's paying me for that, i believe that's where stress comes from). Also it would be nice if the job doesn't require a CS degree, because I don't have one.
