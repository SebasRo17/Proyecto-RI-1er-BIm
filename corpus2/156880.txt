**Edit** : I admit to being unclear when I first wrote the question. I suppose I wasn't sure of the issue myself, the comments and answers provided up to now helped me focus on the issue, thank you to all involved. This edit is a total rewrite of the question. **End editorial comment** On a dynamic website we have two systems - content management, and user interface (trivial). We are trying to decide if the two should have separate authentication systems (being two systems, this might increase security [or not - @GlenH7?]), each having its own hierarchy of permissions etc. Or is it better to have a single system (it's the same database, after all... plus easier maintenance) and only play around with permissions (regular, jumbo, power, super nova, admin, Q)?
