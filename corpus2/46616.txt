What function could I use to solve this equation for x:               E^(-x^2) = 1 - Cos[x]      I tried `Solve`, `Reduce`, `Root`... None of them worked. `FindInstance` gave me an imaginary answer. Adding `Reals`, gave me:               {{x -> Root[{-1 + E^-#1^2 + Cos[#1] &, -6.28318531096301494721675292506}]}}      but this is not the answer I wanted, which would be between 0 and 1. How would I solve this? As a side note, WolframAlpha got it.
