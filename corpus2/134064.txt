Sometimes I find in the source code files comments have quotation marks like these ,notice the ` :               `help'     ``help"      For example, these are comments from GNU cat source code file, cat.c:                 /* Plain cat.  Copies the file behind `input_desc' to STDOUT_FILENO.  */      >                 /* Select which version of `cat' to use. If any options (more than -u,          --version, or --help) were specified, use `cat', otherwise use          `simple_cat'.  */      >               /* Suppress `used before initialized' warning.  */      While in other parts, "" is used :                 /* Determines how many consecutive newlines there have been in the          input.  0 newlines makes NEWLINES -1, 1 newline makes NEWLINES 1,          etc.  Initially 0 to indicate that we are at the beginning of a          new line.  The "state" of the procedure is determined by          NEWLINES.  */      What does ` mean? and what is it used for?
