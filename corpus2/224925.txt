After reading this article I realized that I really didn't read any "serious" source code during my 3-years as a professional developer. Recently I started a new web-project which makes heavy use of AngularJS, so I decided to start my reading - or, better, _decoding_ [as the blogger wrote] - activity from something that is both challenging and professionally useful. Now I just need to be pointed in the right direction. Should I just start from the start of the source code or is there a better starting point?
