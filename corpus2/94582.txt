I'm pretty comfortable with high-level languages and application development. However, although I have learned about low level topics such as the ones listed below, I have never done anything with that knowledge outside of school. Some examples:   * bit twiddling   * dealing with little vs big endian   * memory management (stuff relating to the stack/heap/malloc, etc)   * multi-threading with mutexes and semaphores What are some ways that I can practice these in my spare time, while working at a company that writes managed code?
