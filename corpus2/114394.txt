My team and I are very keen on doing Scrum "manual"-style (with paper and scissors). Though, we are struggling to find a tool to manage our backlog. The main requirements are:   * To be able to print the backlog in cards to stick to the whiteboard   * To be able to assign backlog items to the releases manually So far we have not found anything that matches these criteria. Suggestions?
