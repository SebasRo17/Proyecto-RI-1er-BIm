I've been programming for a while now, and I've covered a lot of languages. And this trend that I noticed is that all HDL languages have so painful IDEs! In general, any development environment having some Hardware related development has very crappy UI. I'm talking about uVision, ModelSim, VHDL Simili, Xilinx etc, compared with Netbeans, Eclipse, Visual Studio etc. Why do hardware-guys hate their developers? NOTE: There are exceptions (LABView is awsome!). Can you think of any more?
