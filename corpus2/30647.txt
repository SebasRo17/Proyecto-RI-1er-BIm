I would like to take the following data:               insertvalues = {r, x};     insertpositions = {{1}, {5}};     origlist = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g};      and generate output that looks like this:               {r,a,b,c,d,x,e,f,g}      Mathematica's `Insert` command seems limited in that it does not allow you to insert multiple elements simultaneously into different positions in a list. I wrote an ugly While loop to accomplish this, and it works, but seems inappropriate for Mathematica's functional approach to coding. Is there a "simpler" way to accomplish this goal with a functional approach? Thank you.               insertvalues = {r, x};     insertpositions = {{1}, {5}};     origlist = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g};          loopcounter = 0; poscounter = 0; final = origlist;     While[loopcounter < Length[insertvalues],       final =         Insert[final,          insertvalues[[loopcounter +             1]], (insertpositions[[loopcounter + 1]] + poscounter)];        loopcounter++; poscounter++];
