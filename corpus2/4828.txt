I was wondering how to approximate or tabulate values for this numeric approximation: It is the following: The confusing part is how to implement the subscripts in mathematica. $y_{i+1} = (t_i - y_i)h + y_i$ I want to do something of the following for this numeric solution.               x[t_] = t/(1 + t^4);     data = N[Table[{t, x[t]}, {t, -5, 5}], 2];     tableofcontents = Prepend[data, {"t", "x(t)"}];     Text@Grid[tableofcontents, Alignment -> Right, Dividers -> {Center, {False, True}},        Spacings -> 1]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rFWjP.png)
