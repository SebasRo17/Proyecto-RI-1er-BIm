Two common phrasings for the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) are "each module should be responsible for a single feature or functionality in a system", and "each module should have only one reason to change". My questions is: is this something that we should absolutely strive for in every class of a system, or should it be relaxed when we combine lower-level modules to compose the more abstract modules? At the extreme case, the top-level module in a system will be responsible for the entire gamut of system functions, so it looks like it may not be possible to respect the SRP in this kind of module.
