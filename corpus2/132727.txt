I currently have a Java class called "node" which has a number of fields. Which fields in the class are used depends on a field called "type". There are close to 10 (this can grow) different types of "nodes". I was wondering if it is good to have a single class to handle all types or have different class for each type. What is the best programming practice in these cases? I would like to know (or a link to similar question/tutorials) how the performance will be affected (like memory etc.) if I use a single class?
