One of the great new function in V10 is PeakDetect. It can detect peaks according to desired sharpness as shown in this example:               data = Table[{x, (Sin[10 x] + 2) Exp[-x^2]}, {x, -4, 4, .01}];     peaks = Pick[data, PeakDetect[data[[;; , 2]], .01, .0005], 1];     ListPlot[{data, peaks},       PlotStyle -> {Automatic, Directive[Red, PointSize[0.02]]}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3taDV.jpg) The question is how to find valleys of the such data using this new function?
