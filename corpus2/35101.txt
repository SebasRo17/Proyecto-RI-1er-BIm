I'm importing some data from a file. However, the file was created by an unreliable instrument, such that the data looks like this:               in: data = Import["D:\\6000s.txt", "Table"]       out: {...{5,0,46.4109},{6,0,46.6017},{7,0,No,Data},{8,0,45.7324}...}      The lines containing "No Data" can be safely deleted, but I don't know how to do this well. How can I efficiently map over my table and erase all rows that contain a string? Thanks in advance for your help. Edit: An example of my data is  here . Also, a closely related question is here Edit 2: @RunnyKine's and @MikeHoneyChurch's answers in the comments did the trick. I ended up doing the following:               data = Import["my_data.txt", "Table"];     data = DeleteCases[data, {__, _String, _String}]      This is _much faster_ than the ugly for loops I had used previously. Thanks for your help!
