Is saving an animation as simple as clicking "Save Graphic As..." in the right-click context menu of the animation? It doesn't seem to work for me--the file naming dialog comes up and I click "Save" but no file seems to be created. I read about using `Manipulate` and `Export`, but keep running into errors going this route (like the kernel hanging and Dynamic Update disabling). I'll keep playing with the code, but was hoping there'd be an easier way to save the animation, "WYSIWYG"-style. ![Can't save graphic as...](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xcsAr.png) The full code is below:               prices = FinancialData["QCOM", All][[All, 2]]     S[x_] := MovingAverage[prices, x];     F[x_] := MovingAverage[prices, x];     Animate[si = Interpolation[S[s]]; fi = Interpolation[F[f]];       Show[ListPlot[{prices, S[s], F[f]},         PlotStyle -> {RGBColor[0.7, 0.7, 0.7], Blue, Red},         Joined -> {True, True, True}, PlotStyle -> {Thin, Thin, Thin}],        Plot[{si[x], fi[x]}, {x, 1, Length[S[s]]},         MeshFunctions -> {(si[#] - fi[#]) &}, Mesh -> {{0}},         MeshStyle -> Directive[Red, PointSize[Large]]],        ImageSize -> {480, 300}], {{s, 150}, 150, 1000, 1}, {{f, 79}, 79,        460, 1}, AutorunSequencing -> All, AnimationDirection -> Backward]      I'm new to Mathematica; I apologize if I'm missing something obvious... * * * I tried @Nasser's code, but keep getting this every 10 or so seconds: ![Continue waiting](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5YVOk.png)
