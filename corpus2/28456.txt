I built a `Graph` based on the permutations of city's connections from :               largUSCities =      Select[CityData[{All, "USA"}], CityData[#, "Population"] > 600000 &];     uScityCoords = CityData[#, "Coordinates"] & /@ largUSCities;     Graph[#[[1]] -> #[[2]] & /@ Permutations[largUSCities, {2}] ,      VertexCoordinates -> Reverse[uScityCoords, 2], VertexStyle -> Red,      Prolog -> {LightBrown, CountryData["USA", "FullPolygon"]},ImageSize -> 650]      It looks like this: ![graph](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1ea6c.png) My question, is there any way to have the Graph like this? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ajwOT.png)
