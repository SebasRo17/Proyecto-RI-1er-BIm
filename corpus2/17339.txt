I always have difficulty in writing a non-trivial compiled function. I'm using _Mathematica_ 9\. Please see the following code               Clear[longtermCompiled];      longtermCompiled =       Compile[{{M, _Real, 2}},        Module[{len = Length[M]},         ReplacePart[Transpose[M] - IdentityMatrix[len], {len, i_} -> Table[1, {len}]]]];      where `M` is expected to be a matrix (two-dimensional). Upon executing the above definition, it complained:               ReplacePart::argrx: ReplacePart called with 2 arguments; 3 arguments are expected.      I don't understand this error message, because the following code works without any problems:               Clear[longtermX];      longtermX[M_] :=       Module[{len = Length[M]},        ReplacePart[Transpose[M] - IdentityMatrix[len], {len, i_} -> Table[1, {len}]]];      What's wrong?
