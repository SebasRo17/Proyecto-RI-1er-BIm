Well, I have some problems with procrastination and whatnot, but those get infinitely worse, when I cannot remember what I should be doing. I mean, I know my project, I wrote 100% of the code so far, and I knew more or less what I was doing, but I don't remember exactly what, I don't remember what file I was editing and why. How I get back on track? (because right now my technique of opening the source code and staring at it is not working)
