I'm drawing a communication diagram for an application where you can buy books. I'm using domain-driven design and have a 'shop' object, a 'cart' object, and a 'book' object. My **first communication diagram** , for when the user first comes to the site, is **straightforward**. I generate all HTML (to show all books and an empty cart) back end with the help of PHP. I use an MVC pattern; so first I send a message to a 'controller' which creates a 'shop' with 'book's and an empty 'cart' before sending these to the view. My **second communication diagram** is where I run into **problem** : It is about adding a book from the shop to the cart. I already have all the information I need to add the book to the 'cart' on the client side; since all book information is already in the shop. So when writing the communication diagram, should my first message, that is, AddBookToCart(bookId:int), be to a JavaScript object called 'shop' which gets the book info and send a message 'AddBookToCart(bookinfo:object) to 'cart' which in turn update the page? I have never done communication diagrams with JavaScript in mind before, so I'm really confused about how to deal with the front end. (I have been searching for over five hours, but I didn't find anything on this topic. It's like it's not even an issue to people. Am I viewing this problem completely wrong? Otherwise any resources, or even search terms to use to learn about how to model (and code) these kind of things would be much appreciated)
