I want to set 2 decimal places, whether it's real Number or anything.for that purpose I wrote the following function.                decimalPlaces[number_]:=SetPrecision[number, 3]      case 1: If you pass `3`as a argument,it should returns `3.00`. case 2: if you pass `3.98967465684` as a argument,it should returns `3.98`. case 3: if you pass `394` as a argument,it should returns `394.00`.But it returns `394`. case 4: if you pass `394.985674` as a argument,it should returns `394.98`.But it returns `394`. finally,my function was not satisfying the case 3,4 testcases How can I solve this. Fell free,If you want to edit my question. Thank you.
