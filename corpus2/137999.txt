I frequently use a pattern where I using method chaining to setup an object, similar to a `Builder` or `Prototype` pattern, but not creating new objects with each method call, instead modifying the original object. **Example:**               new Menu().withItem("Eggs").withItem("Hash Browns").withStyle("Diner");      Just wondering if there is a name for this pattern and whether it is considered an anti-pattern, because although it can read more fluently, it can lead to long method chains.
