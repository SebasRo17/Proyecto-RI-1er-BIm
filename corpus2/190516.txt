I do a lot of c# development work. Recently, our company decided it was important for webservices to be able to run on Unix machines, and decided that we should write new services in Java as a result. We've got licenses to IntelliJ, so I'll probably start with that as an IDE. I've found it pretty easy to find resources about the Java language and the standard libraries. There are several low level details that are harder to find.   * How do I (how should I?) setup a new project with unit tests?   * How do you manage references? (I spent hours trying to figure out classpath stuff in eclipse a couple years ago)   * How do you setup something equivalent to a .sln file? So I need pretty low-level help, but without it focusing on code (I don't need help learning to write Hello World, or a for loop).
