In OO programming, what's the preferred way of handling multiple instances (objects) of a single class? Say you want to write a program where a random number of circles get drawn on screen, where every circle is an instance of a Circle class, and when you click a button, every circle changes color. How would you do that? I see two ways, either to use a static variable (array) in the class holding all instances, along with a static function which loops through that array and calls a recolor method on each instance. Or to use the same variable and method, but instead put it in a separate class, maybe called CircleManager.
