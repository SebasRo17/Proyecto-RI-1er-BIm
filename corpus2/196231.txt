On that competition, you gain access to a system with gcc, vim, emacs and Java. You can't take any file with you and there's no internet access, but you can do whatever you want inside that system. You're presented a set of problems and have some ours to send the results. I wonder if there's any way I can hack a higher level language into it? Maybe there's something useful hidden within Java default libs, or linux? Or maybe I can take a paper (not illegal) and type a compressed lightweight JS/Scheme/Clojure/Whatever interpretator and running it? Or anything really. Ideas?
