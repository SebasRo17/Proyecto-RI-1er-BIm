I am starting working on a web project using django. While researching whether to use Sqlalchemy or raw sql when django orm is not sufficient which is also a question I asked here Raw Sql vs SqlAlchemy when Django ORM is not enough One question bugged me. As the load on the website increases and we find out that sql queries ran by ORM needs tuning. But we have no control on how does an ORM executes queries. In that case we have to use raw sql queries because they give us the best control. But if we start using raw sql queries, all the benefits of using an ORM in first place are gone. We are stuck with both sql and orm code which will surely mess up the reading and maintainability of the code. It feels to me that we are opting for easy code in lieu of many problems later. No doubt our initial code will be fast and easy maintainable but this can cause later problems. I would like to know thoughts of others on it. I am not starting a question comparing orms and sql but I would like to know what are the options when we have created web app using ORM and comes the situation when its clear that ORM is not supporting our cause?
