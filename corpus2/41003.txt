I have two lists, `v1` and `v2`. Each element of the lists may be positive or negative. I want to create a list `v3` whose entry `i` is `v1[[i]]` if `v1[[i]]` is posive, but otherwise is `v2[[i]]`. The trivial way to implement this is to use a `For`-loop with `If`. Is there any faster way? I tried using logical operator:               vP = Boole[Positive[v1]];      vN = Boole[Negative[v2]];     v3 = vP v1 + vN v2;      I tought that using logical operations would be faster than going through indices, but instead it is slower. What would be a fast way to do this?
