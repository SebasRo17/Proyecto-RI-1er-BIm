I'm trying to find a research answering a question: "How much time developers spend on development vs debugging?". I found several interesting links on the Net but they are little too old. This 2002 RTI study states that software bugs cost U.S. economy $59.6 billion annually. And in this book Beizer (1990) reports that of the labor expended to develop a working program, 50% is typically spent on testing and debugging activities. I've seen this number is 80% but can't find the link.
