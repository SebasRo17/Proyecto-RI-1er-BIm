Can someone explain how to do the Fast fourier transform based multiplication algorithm in very large numbers more clearly? I've been searching for this a lot and I'm having a very hard time because all explanations I get have mathematical notation represented in figures or images and my screen reader can't read it. Can someone explain this clearer? And with examples if possible. Preferable in java.
