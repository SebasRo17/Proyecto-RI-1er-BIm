I may soon begin teaching a "web design and development" class for a home- school co-op group. **Any suggestions for "course" material?** My first thought was to work through the Opera Web Standards Curriculum, but am interested in hearing about possible alternatives or suggestions that better cover the "very basics" of getting started with designing and developing web pages. Not necessarily looking for topics, so much as existing resources. Thanks so much for your input!
