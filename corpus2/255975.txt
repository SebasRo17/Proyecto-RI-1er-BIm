we work with Scrum in TFS2013, with one main project and multiple teams. What I want to do is make the homepage for the project display each teams burndown chart, so management can easily see all teams progress. Currently it rolls up all the burndown charts into a single burndown, and if I create charts I can only get line / bar / pie charts that are far less effective at displaying the same information. Is it possible to pin burn down charts to home pages? Thanks.
