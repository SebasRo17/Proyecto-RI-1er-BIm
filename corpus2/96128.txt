This question is about databases but I prefer to post it here and not in dba.stackexchange. The reason is that I have concerns with the application as well as database design. Programmers can better assist in this regard. My four year old .NET application is using MySQL 5.1 database server as back- end. The database is running well. There are no performance issues to make us worry about. But I want to try out advanced database features like Partitioning, Replication and Clusters. I have never used these concepts before and I can definitely give these features a try on existing database, but I have some other plans. I want to use IBM DB2 express-C as an experimental database. Records from MySQL need to be synchronized into DB2 database and I want to use the DB2 database for reports in my application. Is there any free tool to synchronize the two databases? Do I need to use two connection strings, the first one involving MySQL for Inserts/Updates/Deletes and the second one involving DB2 for Reporting? Is this type of foolish approach used in real world in certain scenarios?
