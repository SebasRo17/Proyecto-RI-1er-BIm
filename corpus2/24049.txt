I found this scant description of `StandardDeviationFilter` in the documentation, implying one could use it to generate a moving standard deviation: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6nfMi.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TBagj.png) I've got a need for this sort of thing so it looked interesting. I tried the following comparision:               data = RandomReal[{-10, 10}, 1000];     sd1 = StandardDeviation[#] & /@ Partition[data, 50, 1];     sd2 = StandardDeviationFilter[data, 50];           ListLinePlot[{sd1, sd2[[-Length[sd1] ;;]]}, AspectRatio -> 0.25, ImageSize -> 600]     Length[#] & /@ {sd1, sd2}     sd1==sd2      which gives me the following output: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Gy7tB.png) I'd have guessed that the two approaches would give me the same output. Clearly not. Can anyone explain what `StandardDeviationFilter` does or doesn't do and why it differs from the expected? I may have missed something in setting up this comparison (it happens ;-), any ideas appreciated.
