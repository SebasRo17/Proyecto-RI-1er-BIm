For example, I have a list of lists:               l = {{a,b,c},{a,b,d},{d,e},{d},{a},{a,b},{f}};      And I want to remove all the lists that are contained in other lists:               lafter = {{a,b,c},{a,b,d},{d,e},{f}};      What is the most efficient way of doing this? I know I could look at all the different sub lists, compare them to every other sublist and then select the ones that I want... but that seems inelegant. Is there a "right way" to do this in Mathematica? What is this called?
