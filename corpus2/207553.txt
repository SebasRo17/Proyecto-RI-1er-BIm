I use JavaScript with JQuery for a Rails application. I have some dynamic behaviour in this one. As a Ruby developper, I like TDD/BDD, specialy with RSpec. For the moment, I test my JavaScript manualy. It's not the best way because a change, somewhere, can break the code somewhere else. The is a lot of avantages of using TDD. Testing in javascript seems to be complicated because it should test a lot of user interaction. I can test the behaviour in complete integration, with Capybara for example, but my tests will be very slow. For example, I have a form with dynamic behaviour. In this form, I have 5 or 6 dynamic fields which change if I select an option, choose a radio button or check a checkbox. In some cases, there is ajax calls. For this form, I think I can make about 20 tests just for a form. Is it really usefull to have this tests? So, what's your rules for a standard web application?
