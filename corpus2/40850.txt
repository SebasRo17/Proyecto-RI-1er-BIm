Is it possible, and if so, how, to initialize the value of h when the value of g is changed, in the following Manipulate:               Manipulate[      h = t^2;      Grid@{{"t =", t},        {"h =", h}}      , {{t, 2}, {2, 3, 5, 10}}      , Button["give h", {}]      ]      At the moment, when changing the value of t, the value of h is automatically updated. I now wish to initialize the value of h to, let's say, 0, when the value of t is changed. The value of h should be updated when clicked on the `Button`, which is at this moment inactive. What am I missing to accomplish this? Thanks for all help, as always!
