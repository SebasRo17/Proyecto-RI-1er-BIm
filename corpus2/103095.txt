> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Why to let / not let developers test their own work Developers develop the code and software. Ya that means they know very well of what they have done. But why there is always a separate department in IT companies called as Testing department? (Mainly for testing developers outcome) Why a developer is not doing **Testing** his or her own code? Is it Testing department knows very well about developers code, if so how come? Thanks in advance.
