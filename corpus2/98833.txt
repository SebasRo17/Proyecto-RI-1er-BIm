I am computer engineering student. I've been thinking about how I can handle a big project. What should be my first step to reach my goal in a more efficient and effective way? When I come up with a project, I don't know how I should start working on it. Many times, I just ignore it. However, I don't want to ignore my project ideas anymore. Now, I am asking to all of you, can anyone share his/her experiences? How should I start a project when all I have is an idea?
