I (am just a developer) am tasked with training my team on a technique or technology. I zeroed upon System Interfaces, IComparable and IEquatable to be specific. How does one go about teaching (even if it is 1 hour), what an IComparable is and where we can use it by giving them an example. However, I am not entirely sure whether that would make my team to understand and start using IComparable. In my project, however, I do have a Discount class and there are instances where I have to merge two lists of Discounts. Now, that would be a really good instance of where IEquatable would be helpful when I do the merge wouldn't it? I had the following template for training.   * Introduction: Why does one need IComparable? (And, I could not get an answer that I can use for teaching).    * Structure of IComparable (Again, what else can I talk about other than CompareTo method).    * Sample Code   * Where we can use that in our project   * Questions.
