In various open source CMS, I have noticed that there is a separate table for mapping two relational tables. Like for categories and products, there is a separate `product_category_mapping` table. This table just has a primary key and two foreign keys from the categories and product tables. My question is what are the benefits of this database design rather than just linking the tables directly by defining a foreign key in either table? Is it just matter of convenience?
