Is there a way to create a cell with no form? Usually a cell is either an input cell or an output cell, for example if you do `NotebookWrite[InputNotebook, "test"]` and hit Ctrl+E, the cell is in the input form `Cell["test", "Input"]`. However, if you do `CreateDocument["test"]`, there is no form related to the cell, i.e., `Cell["test"]`. Is there a way to create a cell with no form using `NotebookWrite[]`?
