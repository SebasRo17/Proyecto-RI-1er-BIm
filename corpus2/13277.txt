At the moment I am trying to construct a bifurcation diagram of the iterative function $f(x)=$ $ax-1.1975x^3$. I've scoured the internet for pre-made bifurcation diagrams and found many (mostly of the logistic map). However, as the code is quite complicated I am not sure how to edit the code so that it deals with my function instead of the logistic one. Would anyone have a general template for the code to create a bifurcation diagram of a function? Ideally, I would like to have $a$ on the x-axis and equilibrium values on the y-axis.
