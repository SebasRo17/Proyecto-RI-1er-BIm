Recently I wrote some (I hope) useful application. I would like to share it with every person on the world, making it open source. I would like to publish the source code as well as binary files (both for Windows and Linux). I used only free tools to write my application: Code::Blocks, MinGW, gcc/g++, Linux Ubuntu/Linux Mint, Windows 7 with the license I bought. I read about different types of licences but still have some doubts. I looked into the source code of some open source software, for example, here: https://polarssl.org/aes-source-code or here: http://qt- project.org/doc/qt-5/qtnetwork-blockingfortuneclient-blockingclient-h.html. Those files have some header, where you can find the license as a comment. Here are my questions:   1. Is there any place in the internet where I can read about these things? Licensing, how to publish my code?   2. Should I copy the license to every file of my source code when I want to publish it? From where I can take the license to copy it? (meaning should I copy it both in `*.h` and `*.cpp` file?)   3. For Windows version of my application I used Visual Studio Express Edition and Qt. To make an `*.exe` which will run out of the box with no additional installations, I need to redistribute with my `*.exe` file some files from Qt and Visual (`*.dll` files). How and where can I check if its free to redistribute those files with my application?   4. Which license would be the best for my needs? I did a little research and found that license: http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause. Is it 100% good for my needs, any advices?
