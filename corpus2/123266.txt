I am a Java developer and most of my experience is on Java. But sometimes I have face some database related questions in the interviews. Hence I wanted to ask that from the interview point of view, which questions a Software Developer/Sr. Software Developer (non-DBA, non-Database Enigneer) should be able to answer about databases? I know that this is a very subjective question with no definite answer. But I have come across a similar question about J2EE with some really great answers. Hence some constructive suggestions like specific topics, areas, questions, even links to resources will be greatly appreciated.
