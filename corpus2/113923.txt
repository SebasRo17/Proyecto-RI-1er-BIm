I just finished a technical interview yesterday and the interviewer asked about graph theory, data structure, and traversals. This has nothing to do with iOS stuff. So I came un-prepared. This was actually for a social mobile gaming company, is this the reason why they ask these kind of stuff instead of iOS stuff? Now it seems to me that I am just overwhelmed by the materials to review and study for future interviews, I have to review the whole data structure/traversal/searching algorithm and at the same time iOS/objective-C fundamentals as well. Can someone guide me on how to prepare? Is my past experience just a special case as it was a gaming company?
