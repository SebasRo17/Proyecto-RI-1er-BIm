We have several application servers (and different applications) running on Amazon AWS and our main method of logging is a combination of statsd, carbon/graphite, and an alert system based off of the metrics coming into carbon. This has been working great for a lot of different situations but I feel we need something else to complement this type of logging. Something that is not as much for streaming or visualization like graphite, but allows easy lookup by time/date, error type, etc... What are some techniques that make reviewing your logs quick and effective? My initial thought is to UDP all logging messages to a central server and insert them into a database (likely MongoDB). Is this a reasonable approach?
