Bloom filters look really great when you consider you can determine if an Int is in a set with 99% certainty in constant time. But so can hashes, with the only difference that, in a hash, most of the time you are accessing the memory only once. With bloom filters, you need to access them ~7 times per request in **completely distant places** , so you'd have several cache misses per request. Am I missing something?
