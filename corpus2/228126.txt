It's a basic application - nothing majorly fancy (i.e. not a game) I have the option to buy iPhone 5 iPhone 5c iPhone 5s Just wondering if it matters which iPhone I buy to test out my App or should I just go for the most common? I guess the real question is do people see any bugs based on the phone type (less so the OS type).
