There are some situations where I have no internet connection and so I am forced to work offline. Usually it would look like this: I get connected, do a checkout from source control server, and move out of office. The NuGet packages stay on the server, because I have enabled Package Restore and should have opened Visual Studio and fired a build at least once, to download them. Before using NuGet we had the package management integrated using SVN externals. The required assemblies were automatically downloaded during checkout. But this system has some limitations, I'd like to get rid off. The prefered way to use Package Restore would be to execute it on checkout or update. Is there a way doing so, using hooks for SVN (TortoiseSVN) or GIT (TortoiseGIT, Github for Windows) as version control system?
