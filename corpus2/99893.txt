I know that looking and dressing good is of vast importance in fields like sales, marketing, and human resources. But is it really important for developers, even when they aren't directly contacting clients or third parties? Can a developer get away with dressing shabbily, and still get the raises he deserves on the sole basis of his coding skills?
