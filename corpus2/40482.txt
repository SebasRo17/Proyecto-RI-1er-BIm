I'm looking for a very efficient method for randomizing graph of a given size (N nodes, L links), but keeping them connected. Assume you have the adjacency matrix A of a given connected graph. You want to generate R (usually a big number) random adjacency matrices Aran1,Aran2,...AranR, with the same N, L, AND connected. I did the following code, I'm looking for a more efficient one.               randomization[Q_] :=        Module[{Aran = {0, 0}},         While[           Length[Select[Total[Aran], # == 0 &]]> 0,            Aran = Partition[Nest[RandomSample, Flatten[Q], 10], Dimensions[Q][[2]]]         ]     ];      Thanks!
