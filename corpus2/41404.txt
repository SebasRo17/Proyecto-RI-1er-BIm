I would like to obtain the number of transitions from each state in a Markov Chain simulation to other states, including back to itself so I can compare the simulation results to the transition matrix. Iâ€™m fairly new to Markov Analysis so please be gentle. From the help we have this relatively simple example involving weather.               weather = DiscreteMarkovProcess[1, {{0.7, 0.3}, {0.4, 0.6}}];     Graph[weather, VertexLabels -> {1 -> "rain", 2 -> "no rain"},      VertexSize -> Small,      EdgeLabels ->      With[{sm = MarkovProcessProperties[weather, "TransitionMatrix"]},      Flatten@Table[DirectedEdge[i, j] -> sm[[i, j]], {i, 2}, {j, 2}]],      ImageSize -> Medium]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/clget.png) The transition matrix is obtained by               transitionmatrix =      MarkovProcessProperties[weather, "TransitionMatrix"] // MatrixForm      Now I simulate and plot 1000 days of behavior.               days = 1000;     data = RandomFunction[weather, {1, days}]     ListPlot[data, Filling -> Axis, Ticks -> {Automatic, {1, 2}},      PlotRange -> {{0, days + 200}, {0, 2.5}}, Frame -> True,      FrameLabel -> {"Time (days)", "Weather Condition"},      FrameTicks -> {Automatic, {1, 2}, None, None},      PlotLabel -> "Simulation Results",      Epilog -> {Text["Rain", {days + 100, 1}],      Text["No Rain", {days + 100, 2}]}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3JibY.png) So far, so good (I think). I can also determine the number of times we arrived in a state of rain (State 1) or in a state of no rain (State 2)               rainstates = Count[data["PathStates"], 1]     norainstates = Count[data["PathStates"], 2]      But from the simulation data, how can I determine a) the number of times we arrived to State 1 from State 1 ? b) the number of times we arrived to State 1 from State 2 ? c) the number of times we arrived to State 2 from State 1 ? d) the number of times we arrived to State 2 from State 2 ?
