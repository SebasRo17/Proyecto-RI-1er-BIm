I'm trying to do the following: I have a table:               w = Table[ToExpression[ToString[h] <> ToString[i]], {i, 1, Length[c]}]      This table is suposed to generate variables, like the following list:               {h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, h7, h8, h9, h10, h11}      I'm trying to create a table of vertical sliders with this by adding this to the code:               w = Table[VerticalSlider[Dynamic[ToExpression[ToString[h] <> ToString[i]]]], {i, 1, Length[c]}]      It create a it gives me an error:               Set::write: "Tag ToExpression in \!\(ToExpression[\"hi\"]\) is Protected.      I'm aware that this may not be the best way todo this but it's all I can imagine, I guess the other feasible way would be with loops, I don't know. Can you help me?
