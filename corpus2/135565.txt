I'm going to develop a Kakuro (Cross-Sums) game for Android, and have got the algorithm right. But I can't seem to get the user-interaction part right- i.e. The puzzle is very large. So only a portion is shown at a time to a user _depending_ on their device (eg: HVGA smartphone vs XGA tablet). It should be scrollable. To make it more clear, see the images below: ![Grid as rendered on a smartphone](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4FuiJ.png) ![Grid as rendered on a tablet](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rZPWy.png) So what I'm asking for: Do you know a suitable method to approach this? I mean, like a design or a structure that will achieve this kind of behavior? Please note that I'm completely new to game programming and do not know anything about canvases, etc (but have got experience in application development). So any help really appreciated.
