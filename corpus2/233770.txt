We are developing a desktop application and I am responsible for GUI testing. Currently we have around 500 tests which take 8 hours to complete. The tests are testing almost every button/menu/field etc. in the application. Some functions are taking 3 - 15 minutes because the application is actually measuring something, but most of the tests takes around 2 minutes. The biggest problem I see is that a lot of tests are doing same steps before the "main test action" can proceed, for instance start with import of documents to use for testing, which takes several seconds. How to reduce this time? Parallel testing or some fancy execution environment is probably not a solution or what I ask for. I am more interested in the design of the test or some tips for decreasing the repetition of work.
