I'm trying to solve the following when `n -> ∞`:               RSolve[{        a[n + 1] == a[n] + x (1 - a[n] - b[n]),        b[n + 1] == b[n] + y (1 - a[n] - b[n]),        a[0] == 0, b[0] == 0},        {a[n], b[n]}, n]      After a FullSimplify, I get the following for `a[n]` (and similarly for `b[n]`): ![http://i.imgur.com/gIGir7a.png](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gU4Kd.png) It's clear that as `n` gets larger that this expression converges so long as `0 < x < 1` and `0 < y < 1`, but simply plugging in `n = ∞` I get "Sum does not converge" as an error. For instance when I set `n = 20` and `x = 1/3` and `y = 1/4` I get the following:               547679985297149068793/     958439998111868780544      For `n = 50`:               130006259285744996749134383652034872751260675268341857/     227510953750053744333189631883564158123178815081414656      In floating point notation these both are ~0.571429, which is approximately 4/7 (thanks @hftf), suggesting the answer is `(1/y)(1/x + 1/y)`. How does one get RSolve to return this result?
