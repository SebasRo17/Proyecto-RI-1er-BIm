How might I construct a function of the form `Rep[defs,code]`, `graphic[code]` and `display[code]` Such that the following outputs can occur?               Rep[      y[a__] := Graphics[{Circle[],         Inset[          graphic[a]          , Scaled[{0.498, 0.5020000000000002}], Center,           Scaled[{0.5, 0.5}]]}, ImagePadding -> 0,        PlotRangePadding -> 0];      Times[a_, b_] := Graphics[{RGBColor[1, 0, 0], Rectangle[{0, 0}],         Black, Inset[          display[a*b]          , Scaled[{0.498, 0.5020000000000002}], Center, Scaled[{0.5, 0.5}]]         }, ImagePadding -> 0, ImageSize -> {85., Automatic},         PlotRangePadding -> 0];      , graphic[y[y[a*b]]]      ]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Yb2sq.png)               Rep[       Sum[f_, {i_, max_}] :=       Graphics[{Circle[],         Inset[          Sum[f, {i, max}]          , Scaled[{0.498, 0.5020000000000002}], Center,          Scaled[{0.5, 0.5}]]}, ImagePadding -> 0,        PlotRangePadding -> 0],      graphic[Sum[x^2 , {x, 10}]]      ]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/RDXQb.png) Here is my current attempt of creating `Rep[funs,code]`. The biggest problem that I have currently, is that I am trying to define custom functions on top of System attributes(`Times` & `Plus`). In addition I was originally going to add a namespace `Gr` to the passed in variables but I feel that there is likely a better way. Questions are welcome around the current implementation or a slightly better/different implementation. My question: **How can I construct the functions above such that they satisfy the graphic outputs?**
