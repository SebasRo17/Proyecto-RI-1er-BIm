test = OutputResponse[TransferFunctionModel[1/(1 + s), s], Exp[-(1/t)], {t, 0, 10}]      does not evaluate. If `Exp[-(1/t)]` is replaced by `Exp[-t]`, it's fine. Starting the numerical evaluation at `t>0` does not help, either. (v9.0.1.0 on Mac OS). Thanks. The same issue occurs with NDSolve:               NDSolve[{y'[t] + y[t] == Exp[-1/t], y[0] == 0}, y, {t, 0, 10}]      does not generate an interpolating function. Replacing `Exp[-(1/t)]` by `Exp[-t]` does.
