I need to find or create a tool that analyzes the audio spectrum of a sound file (like a .wav or .mp3). I need to output the "volume" or power of x number of frequency bands and output the data as text. This will be used to produce a visualization, a graphic equalizer like you'd see on a stereo. I am currently looking at python to do it. My question is are there some tools out there that would do this (signal processing), like math works or others? I don't have any experience with them so any advice would be appreciated.
