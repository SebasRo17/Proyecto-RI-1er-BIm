In web development, you often hear the terms "element" and "control". The term "element" is often associated with HTML, and you hear the term "control" most often in Asp.NET development... but the w3c refers to controls in the Forms in HTML documents recommendation, blurring the lines a little. What is a control and what is an element? How are they the same and how are they different? Is one a generalization of the other?
