I was researching on statically typed and dynamically typed concepts and found out there is another type system called gradually typed. From wikipedia > Gradual typing is a type system in which variables may be typed either at > compile-time (static typing) or at run-time (dynamic typing), allowing > software developers to choose either type paradigm as appropriate, from > within a single language. > > In particular, gradual typing uses a special type named dynamic to represent > statically-unknown types and gradual typing replaces the notion of type > equality with a new relation called consistency (aka. compatibility) that > relates the dynamic type to every other type. The consistency relation is > symmetric but not transitive If I understand those concepts correctly, "Javascript" is a gradually typed language. Am I correct?
