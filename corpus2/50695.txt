Using 9.0.1 on OS 10.9.3, I evaluated               Limit[(1 + t/Sqrt[n])^-n, n -> Infinity]      at the start of a session and it caused an error that made the kernel quit. But I don't see any warning or error message. On the other hand, evaluating a very similar expression               Limit[(1 + t/n)^-n, n -> Infinity]      generates no such warning. Can anyone reproduce this issue?
