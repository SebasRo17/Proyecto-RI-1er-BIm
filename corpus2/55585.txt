I am trying to make a physics application and it requires that the eigenvectors be taken for a 3x3 matrix. It is my intention that Mathematica never have to deal with the matrices symbolically. Therefore, because the element I am plotting by is in the matrices, I have used set delay in my code to make sure that when the functions are called all parameters have numerical values. Nonetheless, Mathematica continuous to return the error that not all the eigenvectors can be found though I have `SynchronousUpdating -> False`, and what I also find strange is that having a set delay inside the manipulate function causes the application to continuously update even when nothing is changing. The code below is a simplified case of how the code runs. Does anyone have ideas to how to make this code run so that it is not continuously updating and athematica never has to deal with things symbolically.                Manipulate[      g[e_] := ( {     {e, ρ, 11},     {1, e, ρ},     {1, 1, e}} );          U[e_] := (Transpose[Eigenvectors[g[e]]]).( {      {0, 0, 1},      {0, 1, 0},      {1, 0, 0}     } );      LogLinearPlot[(\!\(     \*UnderoverscriptBox[\(\[Sum]\), \(l = 1\), \(3\)]\(\(U[e]\)[\([1,        l]\)]\)\)), {e, .01, 50},        AxesLabel -> {"Disrance (Km)", "Probability"},        PlotRange -> All], {{ρ, 9.6,         "\!\(\*FractionBox[\(g\), SuperscriptBox[\(cm\), \(3\)]]\)"}, 0.,        120.}, ControlPlacement -> Left, SynchronousUpdating -> False,       ContinuousAction -> False]
