Given a two-variable function `f[x,y]`, how to get the contour plots corresponding to several values of the integral of the original function. For example, I would like to plot the contours $C_j$ of the domains $S_j$, in the $xy$ plane, such that $$ \int_{S_j} dxdy f(x,y) = \alpha_j $$ for $\alpha_j = \alpha_{j-1} + \epsilon$, with a fixed step $\epsilon$. Additionally, I would like to be able to choose a value of $\alpha$ and plot the contour of the corresponding domain. **My difficulty is the following.** I don't know how to make a condition inside `ContourPlot` such that it tells that the contours should correspond to the values of the integrals. A possible application would be to determine the region corresponding to 68.3% of the events of a two-variable Gaussian distribution. This is called a 1-sigma region.
