According to this page on MSDN the sql language used on Sql Azure is called **transact-sql** (the same as on sql server). But is this the only way to refer to programming on Sql Azure? The Sql Azure variant of transact-sql doesn't support a bunch of features including global temporary tables, distributed queries and system tables; and has partial support for other areas. So is calling it transact-sql appropriate and does anyone know if another name has taken unofficial hold (azure-sql, a-sql ...)?
