> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Writing a Software Requirement Specification   >  How to make a great functional specification I am starting to write more tech specs and design documents. However, I don't have a lot of time in school writing these, and don't have a lot of access to other people's examples. I have found a few good examples of how to structure these documents for example: Define the project goals Define the system architecture/infrastructure Define the user dialogs and the control flow Define the background tasks Define the database model Define the interfaces to other systems Define the non functional requirements (response times, security, ...) But I am looking for maybe a little more on best practices of actually writing the contents of these types of sections. I am not sure this is a dumb question or not since it is just documenting what is there but I get kind of a block with a blank canvas and start to just over think things
