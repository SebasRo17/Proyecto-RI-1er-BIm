I'm starting to develop a mobile app, and have a first choice name I'd like to use. However the .com domain of the name has already been taken. Is it actually worth it buying it, or would you tempted to go with CoolNameApp.com or CoolName.net instead? If you couldn't afford the .com domain name, would you use a different name for the actual app?    Also just to let you know I'm a student with not much money.    Am fascinated to hear your ideas and opinions on the importance of .com domains for mobile apps :-)
