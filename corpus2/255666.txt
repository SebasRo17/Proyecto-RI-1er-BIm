I have written a trigger which prevent duplicate name. please refer following condition. " **Test** " and " **Te st** " are same name (which mean don't need to consider any in between spaces.) " **TEST** " and " **test** " are same name (which mean ignore uppercases and lower cases.) My Question : If I have already one record inserted in system with name " **Te st** ". and Now I am trying to insert a new record with name " **test** "(which is obvious not correct as per duplication). How can i handle this exception? Thank you in advance.
