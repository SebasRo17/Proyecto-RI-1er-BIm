Suppose I have this equation: $$ z^2 + 3z + (x^2 + y^2) = 0 $$ I want the real and complex contour plot of $z(x,y)$. Analytically, the real/imaginary boundary is separated by condition $x^2 + y^2 \leq \frac{9}{4}$ The regular contour plot only plots the real parts when I use findRoot:               eqn[x_, y_, z_] := z^2 + 3 z + x^2 + y^2 == 0     ContourPlot[       z /. FindRoot[eqn[x, y, z], {z, 1}], {x, 0, 2}, {y, 0, 2},       PlotLegends -> Automatic]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wS7gg.png) The darkest purple represents the complex area. How do I obtain contour plots of real roots of z, imaginary roots of z? Also, if possible combine them into a single graph. Tried this different approach of letting $z = a + bi$, but doesn't work.                z = a + b I;      eqn[x_, y_, z_] := z^2 + 3 z + x^2 + y^2 == 0         ContourPlot[           z /. FindRoot[Im[eqn[x, y, z]], {b, 1}], {x, 0, 2}, {y, 0, 2},           PlotLegends -> Automatic]      Plots from **difficult problem** : First one is real, second one is imaginary root contour plot. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xZEJF.jpg) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/817Qb.jpg)
