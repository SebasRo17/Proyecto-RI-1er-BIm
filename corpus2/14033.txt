I have hosted my latest project, a JVM-based MIDI processor/API called Mjdj MIDI Morph, on Github (here and here). Now I need to bring some interest to it, even if it's negative interest (so I can improve it). I've looked up open source list on Google and end up with such things as this page on Wikipedia, which makes it quite clear that they don't want your project if it's new. Where should I list my project? Short of adwords and talking it up in forums and trade shows, where should I submit my URLs?
