I was wondering if I can use the aac codec in my commercial app for free (through lgpl ffmpeg). It says on the wiki: > No licenses or payments are required to be able to stream or distribute > content in AAC format.[36] This reason alone makes AAC a much more > attractive format to distribute content than MP3, particularly for streaming > content (such as Internet radio). However, a patent license is required for > all manufacturers or developers of AAC codecs.> For this reason free and > open source software implementations such as FFmpeg and FAAC may be > distributed in source form only, in order to avoid patent infringement. (See > below under Products that support AAC, Software.) But the xSplit program had to cancel the AAC for free members because they have to pay royalties per person. Is this true (that you have to pay per each person that uses aac)? If you do have to pay, which company do you pay to and how does one apply?
