I would like to know how to extract data from plots in a paper and, also, how to do that in a way that include **error bars**. I know there are specific softwares to do that, e.g. Plot Digitizer, which also work for scanned graphs. But I want to "digitize" inside Mathematica, so I don't need external softwares. Furthermore, the plots in a paper can be a bit polluted. An example of a graph to digitize follows below. The desired points are the black points including **error bars**. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/hoeHR.jpg)
