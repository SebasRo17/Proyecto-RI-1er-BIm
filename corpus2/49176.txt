I need to make .svg file that contains an array of black circles that all have radii of 5 units ad are evenly spaced apart from each other 32 units. The difficulty in creating this design is the sheer number of circles necessary. I will need a 3175 by 3175 array. At first I tried doing this manually in Adobe Illustrator, but then it occurred to me that I could write a code to do it for me in Mathematica.               n = 50;     mat = Flatten[Table[{32 i, 32 j}, {i, 0, n - 1, 1}, {j, 0, n - 1, 1}], 1];     g = Disk[#, 5] & /@ mat;     Export["circle_array.svg", Graphics[g], "SVG"];      Above is the code I wrote, and it for a small number of rows/columns, it works just fine. After it's created, I open it up in Adobe Illustrator, and it looks just fine. However, when I try to increase the number of rows much greater than 100 X 100, after it's exported and I open it up in Adobe Illustrator. I notice that not all the circles are evenly spaced away from each other, and I don't understand why. If anyone could help, it would be greatly appreciated.
