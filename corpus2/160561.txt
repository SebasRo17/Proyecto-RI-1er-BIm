I am contemplating writing a programming language. Most grammars define expressions as being a kind of a statement. But really I cannot come up with a single example of any useful expression that would pass as a statement. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19132/expression-versus-statement for an easy definition of expression vs statement. EDIT: Why are so many grammars making the distinction between expr and stmt when as noted in the answers, it makes no sense.
