I am trying to develop a small tool and I am stuck on a very simple problem. This how I want it to look: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/LPh6y.png) I have               minValue = steps = 100.000     valueRange = 500.000.000 - 100.000     newPercent = where the circle is right now (0-100%)     newValue = minValue + (valueRange * newPercent / 100.0);      The range is very big, and it is very hard to set the right value at the beginning, but when the value is above 200 million, I don't care about 100000. So I wont to make it exponential; e.g., $x=y^2$ That what I was thinking. http://www.wolframalpha.com/share/clip?f=d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e9onr7i6926 I want to make the first steps with 100.000 and them more and more. Maybe like this? http://www.wolframalpha.com/share/clip?f=d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427ev8h6m2vulq Maybe I am totally wrong. Any suggestions?
