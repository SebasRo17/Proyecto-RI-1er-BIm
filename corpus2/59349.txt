Suppose I want to Save["filename", foo] under Windows. Ordinarily, the way to deal with file names under windows is to open the Insert dialogue and find a file path, but in this use case, the file is new, so it does not exist (yet). Unlike every other windows program I am familiar with, Mathematica is unwilling to create a new file (that is, once you locate the relevant folder, you type in "mynewfile.m", Mma balks. This seems like a bug (sorry, Dan Lichtblau, a misfeature :)), but is there any reasonable workaround? Am I missing something obvious?
