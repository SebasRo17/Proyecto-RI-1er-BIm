I know there are those out there who have read a slurry of books on a specific technology and only code in that one particular language, but this question is aimed at those who need bounce around between using multiple technologies and yet still manage to be productive. What is the most efficient way to study multiple languages, frameworks, and APIs as a developer without becoming a cheap swiss army knife? And how much time should one dedicate to a particular subject before moving to another?
