#include<stdio.h>     void main()     {     char ***p="hello";     printf("%c",++*p++);     }      I haven't understand the concept of (*) indirection uses here **three times**.               When i compiled this program then the output was "j".     But actually hear the p is a pointer to pointer to pointer to Array of character.      Then why i getting the output as j.      I didn't understand what's the logic behind this.      please help me to understand the actual logic behind this. and the confusion increase more when I only use one indirection and get complied the program .then the output is i.means               void main()     {       char *p="hello";       printf("%c",++*p++);     }      **this gives output as i.** What is the difference between these two program?
