suppose I have a custom function such as               def greater(a, b):         if (a % b) % 2 == 0:             return 1         return 0      It defines how to compare two numbers and determine which is greater. In this case, if the function returns 1 a > b else, a < b. Can I use inbuilt `<built- in function sorted> or`to create a sorted array of numbers with respect to this definition?
