I need to add a feature to some code in a big project and due to the complexity I find it very helpful to add detailed comments to many lines to keep track of what's happening. This is only for my own understanding however and I will delete the comments before pushing the code. The problem however is that if I do private commits during my development, when I push to the main server, I guess git will show the lines that I commented and then uncommented (but didn't otherwise modify) as being modified by me, making "blame" more opaque. I suppose the only way to do this cleanly is to have 2 private branches, one for development and one for commenting, or can anyone recommend a better way?
