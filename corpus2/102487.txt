Version control for ladder logic (LL) programs for programmable logic controllers (PLCs) seems to be virtually non-existent. It may be because LL is a visual language and tends to be stored in binary files, or it may be because source code control hasn't "caught on" in process control engineering circles - or perhaps my Google-Fu is weak tonight. Do you know of any realistic and useful solutions for version control for such systems? Definitions:   * realistic = changes to the programs are tracked by user and subject to reversion and merges   * useful = the system integrates with visual LL designers, is not limited to LL from a single PLC manufacturer, and does not cost a ridiculous amount of money? Note: I have heard of people using SVN or Mercurial et al to track the binary files, but I don't think the diff/merge capabilities would display readable differences. ADDENDUM: At first we only had to support Allen-Bradley PLCs. Now we also have Siemens and MicroLogix PLCs. Still searching for a viable solution...
