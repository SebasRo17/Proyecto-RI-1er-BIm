It's not clear how data consistency is provided for different branches. We have a large knowledgebase which is filled by the experts and delivered as updates to our clients. This data is also used for testing the product.   But if we have quite a few feature branches (being developed in parallel) and each feature requires its own slightly different db schema won't it be a hell? Definitely some way of populating all DBs from one centralized store must exist. And here comes the question? What are these methods? Now the only solution I see is to create some mapping mechanism and to save mappings in the corresponding DB, yet I believe more elegant approaches exist. **Update:** To clarify the problem.   We have one (let's call it master db). And N databases with slightly 'narrower' schemas comparing to the chema of master. I.e. master is has the richest schema: other dbs have fewer tables/columns.
