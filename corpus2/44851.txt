Suppose we have a regionplot as follows:               mpion = 0.137;     meta = 0.548;     metap = 0.958;     con1 = Sqrt[meta^2 + w1^2 + w2^2 - 2  mpion^2 + 2 Sqrt[w1^2 - mpion^2]  Sqrt[w2^2 - mpion^2]];     con2 = Sqrt[meta^2 + w1^2 + w2^2 - 2  mpion^2 -2 Sqrt[w1^2 - mpion^2]  Sqrt[w2^2 -mpion^2]];          RegionPlot[      Re[con2] < metap - w1 - w2 < Re[con1], {w1, .13, .27}, {w2, .13, .27},        BoundaryStyle -> Directive[Red, Thick], FrameLabel -> {"w1", "w2"},       PlotStyle -> None, BaseStyle -> FontSize -> 16]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wLNKO.jpg) Which we can plot it in x-y plane (x and y are defined as w1 and w2 functions):                Q = metap - meta - 2*mpion;     solw = Solve[x == Sqrt[3]/Q*(w1 - w2) && y == -(2 + meta/mpion)/Q*(w1 + w2) -            1 +  (2 + meta/mpion)/Q*(metap - meta), {w1, w2}];     w1funxy = w1 /. solw[[1]];     w2funxy = w2 /. solw[[1]];               RegionPlot[(Re[con2] < metap - w1 - w2 < Re[con1]) /.         w1 -> w1funxy /. w2 -> w2funxy, {x, -1.4, 1.4}, {y, -1.1, 1.2},        BoundaryStyle -> Directive[Blue, Thick], FrameLabel -> {"x", "y"},       BaseStyle -> FontSize -> 16, PlotStyle -> None]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/VUKZL.jpg) How can I make the boundary of the region in x-y plane smaller? just like this graph (The blue and green boundaries). I need the points in blue and green regions around x=y=0 point. I couldn't change the inequality equation of the region in the way that it gives what I want. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tHZUK.jpg)
