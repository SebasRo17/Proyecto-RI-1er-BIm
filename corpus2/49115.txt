I am trying to Integrate the following Integral : $\int_1^{\infty } \dfrac{\left(x^2-1\right)^{13/2} e^{-ax} }{x^{10}} \, dx \,\, \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(a=\textrm{real>0})$ Mathematica didn't calculate this integral. Maybe it is too complicated to be done. In Mathematica input form:               Integrate[Exp[-a x] (x^2 - 1)^(13/2)/x^10, {x,1,Infinity}]      If I simply enter that into Mathematica, it instantly returns the same expression. How do I go about this? Is there any tricks that can be applied? Thank's.
