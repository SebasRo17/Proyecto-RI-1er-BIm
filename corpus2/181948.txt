I'm fairly new to the MVVM concept but like a lot of the flexibility it gives me so far. However, I'm struggling to find a good way to manage my code. I have several classes that are just sitting in a folder in my solution such as `xxxView.cs`, `xxxViewModel.cs`, `yyyView.cs`, `yyyViewModel.cs`, `zzzView.cs`, `zzzViewModel.cs` you get the idea. It has started to crowd my solution, making it harder to find the files I'm looking for. Is there some standard way to organize these files? Do I create a **View** and **ViewModel** folder to separate and clean up the solution or have people found a better way?
