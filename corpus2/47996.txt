First off, I apologize that I can't come up with a simpler working example, but I only seem to have this problem with the larger examples. I am trying to make animations, using functions like the ones listed here. In order to make an animation, I need for the resulting 3D image to have a stationary camera. Here are two examples that I can't get this to work on. My apologies on the filesize, both of the images are 14MB when put into a text file.               img1 = Import["https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/8878c5m3cjv2zmv/img1.m"];     img2 = Import["https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/qbyx4t7yexoerqc/img2.m"];         GraphicsRow[{img1, img2}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XtewQ.png) If it isn't obvious that the two images have a different orientation, then try this:                   Manipulate[Show[{img1, img2}[[n]], ImageSize -> 500], {n, {1, 2}}]      I have even tried to make sure that they have the same options for `ViewPoint`, `ViewVertical`, and `ViewCenter`. This can be verified by a function I made,               Quiet[viewpoint[graphics_] :=          Evaluate[          FilterRules[{AbsoluteOptions[graphics]}, {ViewPoint,             ViewVertical, ViewCenter}]];];     viewpoint /@ {img1, img2}      which returns               (*{{ViewCenter -> {0.5, 0.5, 0.5}, ViewPoint -> {0.141, 0.19199, -3.37},        ViewVertical -> {0.0417, 0.0978, -2.0278}}, {ViewCenter -> {0.5,          0.5, 0.5}, ViewPoint -> {0.141, 0.19199, -3.37},        ViewVertical -> {0.0417, 0.0978, -2.0278}}}*)      So what am I missing? How can I make sure that every single time I create a 3D image that the view is identical? Is there another important viewing option besides those 3? Thanks in advance.
