So I want to plot two graphs (on the same plot). One which is the $\frac{\sum_{i=0}^n x_i}{n}$ and the other $\frac{\sum_{i=0}^n x_i}{n-1}$ where x is a set created by `RandomInteger[{a,b},n]` and then have n slowly increase. I was wondering if this would be a sort of nice convergence plot over a large interval. The problem is as seen I want all of them to use the one {n,c,d} table for their iteration but Sum wants a copy, Plot wants a copy and RandomInteger wants the length of it. How can I use one of it for all of those?
