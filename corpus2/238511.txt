In my project I am dynamically creating table by giving table name (ex. student) and adding fields to that table and then save table. Now, my table is created in SQL Server database. Assume table has data and I want to show the data of table (ex student) on WebGrid. But, the problem is I have no model for that table (ex. student). So, how I can create model for newly created table or how I can show the the data on WebGrid?
