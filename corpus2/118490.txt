I am trying to understand a few aspects of applying for jobs such as the following: Android Developer - Front-end Experience Required - 3 month contract - London - Â£300 per day - Immediate start I have several questions and am particularly interested in the UK.   1. What is the reason for the high daily rate? Is this because it's short term and thus is less attractive to many people, or because it requires a higher level of skill/higher workload than the average permanent job?   2. How often to these contracts usually pay? Someone told me that they will pay every two weeks.   3. Just how essential are the skills listed in the job listing? For example, I have experience with Android and Java SE, but no experience with Java EE - would this put me out of the running for a Java EE contract?
