I've read through the previous posts on freelance websites and used most of them. I'm looking for a website dedicated to high-end professionals and high- end work. Such as writing software compilers, designing database engines, etc. Probably no such website exists (there would have to be some kind of moderation), but I'm really hoping there is one, both as an employer and as a developer.
