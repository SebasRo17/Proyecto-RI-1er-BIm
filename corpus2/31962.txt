I have a graph `G`, and I wish to individually highlight and color the different connected components of a graph. It is simple enough to do this for one component:               HighlightGraph[G, ConnectedComponents[G][[2]]]      But how does one do this for multiple components? I'd ideally like to be able to pass a color string to specify each highlighted component, something like `componentColorString = { Blue, Green, Red,...}`. Is this possible?
