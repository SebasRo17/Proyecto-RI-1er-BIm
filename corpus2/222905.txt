I am writing a client server application. I wanted to fully separate the server logic, from the view. The first thing I wanted to to, is to make a sort of a message log. The server itself should not know if the messages will be shown at a GUI, or on the console. What I was thinking, would be to have a handler method, that would be called every time a new message was posted. So a GUI app would have it's own method to maybe add to a listView, while the console would have a simple printf. Is there a better way to do this?
