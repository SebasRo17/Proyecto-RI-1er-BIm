Lets say I'm building community that uses some webapp. These webapp uses a a modified version a a GPLv2 licensed theme. Additionally the community uses a donation mechanism to fund itself. Donation overheads will be given back to the community in some form, so there is no commercial goal behind it. Questions:   1. Am I required to publish the modified version of the theme if I only use it?   2. Is this "commercial use" in terms of the GPL? (I'm not sure it this is the right SE site)
