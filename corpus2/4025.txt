So I have a graph with multiple lists, for e.g.               data = {{1,2}, {3,4}, {3,5}, {2,3} . . .}      If I then do `ListLinePlot[Table[{#1,Log[b,#2]}&@@@data, {b,1,10,2}]]` I have no way to generate a legend for it, that I see anyway. I cannot put anything inside the `Table` which contains the iterator. Would I do something alone the lines of `Legend-> Log[Range[1,10,2,x]]`?
