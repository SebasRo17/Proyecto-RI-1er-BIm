I am new to Mathematica and wanted to generate undirected graph for data sets that show the relationships of organizations with each other. The data is in a square matrix. The cells of the matrix provide information about the relationships between each pair of organization (0 if no relationship exists; 1 if there is some relationship; 2 if the organizations work as partners; 3 if any of the board members serve in the paired organization). There are 81 organizations in the study, so the matrix is 81x81. The data data structure in CSV looks like the following. ![example of data structure](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6IlMw.jpg) I would very much appreciate if anyone would provide me the steps for generating the social network graph for the stated scenario using Mathematica 9. Thanks! -Brian
