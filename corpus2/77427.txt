I found the "Extension method" concept of C# just wonderful. It enables us to do things like:   * More flexible alternative to Abstract Classes.   * Provide missing Java-like functionalities to C# `enum`. And The coolest thing about it IMHO is that **adding a method doesn't break backward compatibility**. However, I found almost no extension methods in the .NET BCL. And it's very common that, I see a static method and extension methods come in mind. When the BCL was designed, extension methods were not there. But why are they not converted to extension methods now? Specially when it does break backward compatibility? Any reasons?
