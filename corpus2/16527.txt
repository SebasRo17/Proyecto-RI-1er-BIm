I have just started learning struts 2. I have purchased the book named Struts 2 in action. But I want to use an IDE for developing Struts 2 applications. I basically use netbeans. Please tell me how can i develop applications using netbeans. Also, it would be great if somebody can point out a few tutorials on the same. regards P.S. I haven't used eclipse. Is it advisable to switch to it for struts 2, (if it is better than netbeans in this case)?
