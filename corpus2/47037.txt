I have just read that Mathematica 9 for Mac does not support Citation Management. Any ideas of a poor's man replacement so I can still use Mathematica on Mac for editing? I mean, have someone written a script to "import" a .bib into a notebook or something like that? I took the time to put all my references in a .bib file. I also imported them into EndNote. If this is of any help... regards, Mr. Disappointed
