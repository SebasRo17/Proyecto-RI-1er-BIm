Is it possible to know when Mathematica is done writing a file? I'm looking to automate something and I'm wanting to have Mathematica put it in a file using `Put[]`, and maybe also `Export[]`. I need to know that the file is complete before dealing with it outside Mathematica, but I don't want to have to exit Mathematica first. How can I be **_sure_** that Mathematica is done writing the file? Any solution is on the table, from waiting for Mathematica to reprompt, to relying on a metafile. I'd like to avoid writing additional data to the file if at all possible, though.
