I will explain the context of the problem first. For a University project I'm going to implement an Android application. The Android application (and others) will be able to send data to a remote source, that remote source will also be able to send messages to the Android applications. For example the messages may be "apply configuration x", "what is your status". I want the remote source to be able to send these messages to:   1. Reduce overhead. I don't want the Android devices sending data when its not necessary. This uses data and power.   2. So that I can scale it, for example version 1 might allow you to check what value x is on the Android applications, version 2 might let you check what y is etc. I have looked at implementing this using Sockets in Java. Having the Android application talk to the remote source is easy. I configure the router (port forward) and everything is OK. The problem is having the remote source to talk to the Android application. They may be using public WiFi hotspots, have their 3G on etc, I wouldn't be able to address the device directly via sockets right? The approach to solving the problem is not that common I believe, which makes me believe I'm trying to do something that shouldn't be done. Can anyone shed some light on this and offer me some guidance? Many thanks.
