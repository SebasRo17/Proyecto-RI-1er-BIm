We have to extend a huge java project that makes use of frameworks like maven, spring, struts, freemarker and closure templates. We do have access to source code but barely any documentation, and we have to extend this system. Our only solution is to find the place in the existing code, where something similar is already done. To find this place, we try to start from the action that is called and then with the help of the debugger try to find out which classes and Spring beans are involved. The stack traces from the debugger are quite hard to understand, since a lot of reflection is being used. Does anybody had a similiar setup and could provide a few tipps how to manage such a complicated setup?
