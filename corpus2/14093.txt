I dropped out of college half way through my final year due to personal reasons. I have 6 modules to repeat but unfortunately I cant afford to go back and finish them for at least another year. Im wondering if i put this down on my resume will it pass the HR filter?               Bachelor of Science in Computing in Software Development     2007 - present
