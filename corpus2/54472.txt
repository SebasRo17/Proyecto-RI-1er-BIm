I'm using FindRoot to solve a nonlinear system. I'd like to see what FindRoot is doing while computation, something like the _display_ option for Matlab _fsolve_. At the end of the day, I want the number of iterations and the residual at each step. Is there an option like that? I found this link, but if I use FindRootPlot the execution is 3 times slower, and since I'm using a vector input, it does not display any plot. My code:               SYS1[X_, U_?VectorQ, RHS_, fun_] := Module[...]          t1 = Timing[            U1 = UU /. Flatten[FindRoot[SYS1[XX, UU, F1, fun1] == 0, {UU, U0}]]        ];      or               << Optimization`UnconstrainedProblems`          t1 = Timing[            U1 = UU /. Flatten[FindRootPlot[SYS1[XX, UU, F1, fun1] == 0, {UU, U0}]]        ];      Thanks in advance for any suggestions. Petrus
