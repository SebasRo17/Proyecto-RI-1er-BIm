For the sake of readability I often find myself defining temporary variables while calling functions, such as the following code               var preventUndo = true;     doSomething(preventUndo);      The shorter version of this to this would be,               doSomething(true);      But when I come back to the code I often wonder what `true` refers to. Is there a convention for this kind of conundrum?
