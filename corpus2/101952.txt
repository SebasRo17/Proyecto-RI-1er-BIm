I am doing unit testing. I am trying to test one function. I call it from my test component. But If remote function cannot handle the exception then my tester component will also get exception, I guess. So should I worry about getting exception in my tester component? Thanks. **EDIT:** PS: Throwing an error is good, but only for other functions, not to end users until its a last option! OMG I wrote a programming quote!!
