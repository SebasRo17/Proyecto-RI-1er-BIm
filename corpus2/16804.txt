I know a workaround, where one calculates sizes of all files and then you subtract this from your default space, but is there any direct way to do it? Simplicity and speed are important. There's the way to calculate free RAM with external call               ReadList["!typeperf \"\\Memory\\Available Bytes\" -sc 1", Word,     RecordLists -> True, WordSeparators -> {","}] //      ToExpression@Part[#, 2, 2] &      Is there any way to do the same but for disk space? SOLVED               StringJoin[     ReadList["!dir c:\ ", Word, RecordLists -> True,      WordSeparators -> {" ", ","}][[-1, 3 ;; -3]]] // ToExpression      gives the amount of free memory on disk C in bytes)
