In Android source code, we see files like MODULE_LICENSE_APACHE2, MODULE_LICENSE_BSD_LIKE, MODULE_LICENSE_W3C. An outside observer would think that these specify the intended license that applies to the source code tree where this file resides. Take the JSON module, for instance. It has an empty file MODULE_LICENSE_BSD_LIKE, which might indicate that the JSON module is licensed under one of BSD licenses. However, sources themselves say that they are licensed under Apache License 2.0, as seen in JSON.java. Packagers of this library for Fedora, as well as other operating systems like Debian, consider the library to be licensed as Apache License 2.0. This seems reasonable, as an empty file bears no legal weight. However, MODULE_LICENSE_BSD_LIKE is apparently there for a purpose. What is that purpose?
