I am working on a PHP script that I plan to sell without giving the user the ability to distribute it to anyone else. I have heard about GPL being viral and I have quite a few libraries that are being used in my script that are under the GPL. (for example : jquery, phpthumb etc) Does this mean that if a user who has bought my code can freely distribute it because a part of my code is under GPL so it becomes viral and my whole project becomes GPL ? **Can i not use any GPL code in my project ?** Thanks for any help.
