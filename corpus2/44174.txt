My eyes are weary and my sight grows dim, so I used the zoom control bottom- right in the palette. Unfortunately, having zoomed in the palette window cannot be resized - so I can't see the rhs - _and_ there is no horizontal scrollbar. I'm also bemused by the fact that I can expand and collapse sections within palettes, but the overall palette size still doesn't change. What's the point of a "palette" in which everything you choose to be visible isn't? (screen limitations aside? Is there a way to resize palettes? (Mma 9 BTW) **Update & followup question to my own answer** Palettes can be made to respond as desired, but the Options dialog settings don't persist. How might I ensure that the options are reset each time I start Mma? **Update 2** I intended place copies of the relevant palette files in $USerBaseDirectory\SystemFiles\FrontEnd\Palettes and edit them in the hope that they would override the installed palettes. To check that the override works, I restarted without any mnodifications and found that lo-and-behold the zoom control works as it should do - and no editing seems to be required. The failure of the zoom control previously therefore _seems_ linked to the palette files' location. Hmmmmmm. **Eh?** And then it _doesn't_ work as I just described and I've edited all the relevant palette notebooks in $UserBaseDirector to make them editable, saveable, etc. Clearly I am missing something or this is very strange... probably the former, but palettes now come back where I left them (Screen 2) with the previous zoom (mostly, apart form Special Characters (?)
