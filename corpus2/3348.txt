I want to create the following two graphs. ![Two Feed-Forward Loops](http://i.stack.imgur.com/01uHE.png) So far I tried the following Code               GraphPlot[{"X" -> "Y", "Y" -> "Z", "X" -> "Z"},       VertexCoordinateRules -> {"X" -> {0, 0}, "Y" -> {1, 0},         "Z" -> {2, 0}},       EdgeRenderingFunction -> (If[          Last[#2] == "Z", {Red, Arrow[#1]}, {GrayLevel[0.5],            Arrow[#1]}] &), VertexLabeling -> True, DirectedEdges -> True]      The Output was the following Graphic ![Try of an FFL](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8qOQC.png) My Questions are:   1. How do I get the arrow from X to Z as in the first Picture?   2. How can I add the wavy arrows for $S_X$ and $S_Y$?   3. How can I change the arrow head into an inhibitor sign as required for the Ic1-FFL?
