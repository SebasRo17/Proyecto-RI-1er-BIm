Firstly sorry for my English. I'm coding new site. Ä°t's like StackExchange, a social site and a blog. Whatever, I try to create multilanguage, however I can't decide how to do it. I have to use modules, so, I must use OOP, while having multilanguage interface. How can I do that? There are two language options (Turkish and English), used continuously (example: home page etc.) or not (some errors; example : "please enter your mail" etc.)   1. I can use a class and I use array (for used continuously),   2. I can use a class and an XML page (for errors), or I can have a class and three language pages: Turkish, English and errors. Which one gives the best performance? * * * Other problem is php-mysql security. I'm using mysqli. Of course I block html characters and I use mysqli_real_escape_string. But they are not enough. So, I use stored procedures. What else can I do? what is your advice?
