I would like to run SVN server on my local machine along with WAMP. All SVN server binaries include Apache. Whereas I don't need Apache as I'm already running WAMP. Please let me know if there are any installs available that includes only the SVN server. If there are none available, shall I go ahead with what's available? And how would I do that without breaking anything. PS: I tried CollabNet and VisualSVNServer. Both includes Apache.
