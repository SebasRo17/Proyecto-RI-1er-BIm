I am currently learning Java in college. I have noticed a problem I have when I am starting to code to solve problem. The problem is that I don't know exactly how to start. For instance, if I try to think about the question and a way of coding the solution then I always say to my self "what about this case.. and this case..." and don't know where to start. So my question for people with experience in programming, is how do you start?   * Do you think about a solution for all the cases first, then start to write the code?   * Or maybe first you try to write the steps in your own language and then go and write the code?    * Or maybe you go ahead from the start, start typing some code and at the same time think about all the options and fixing and changing what you wrote?
