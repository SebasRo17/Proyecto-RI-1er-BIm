### Matrix inverse in mathematica If $A$ is an invertible $n \times n$ matrix, then $A\cdot A^{-1} = I$. To get this statement in Mathematica, you need the assumption   `MatrixPower[A, 0] = IdentityMatrix[n]`               $Assumptions = {Element[A, Matrices[{n, n}]],                      Det[A] != 0, ForAll[{A}, MatrixPower[A, 0] == IdentityMatrix[n]]}     TensorExpand[Inverse[A].A] // Simplify      `Out[1]= IdentityMatrix[n]`. ### Matrix as a tensor A matrix can also be seen as a tensor of rank 2; i.e. a list with two levels, on for the columns and one for the rows. The tensor product $A \otimes A^{-1}$ corresponds in Mathematica with the outer product of the two lists. In this case it is a list with four levels, a four-tensor. When matrices are viewed as tensors, the dot product is the same as a tensor product followed by a contraction. In Mathematica the matrix product $A\cdot A^{-1}$ can also be written as               TensorContract[Inverse[A]\[TensorProduct]A, {2, 3}]       **Question 1** How can I let Mathematica evaluate the above expression to IdentityMatrix[n]? ### Involving more tensors Suppose there is a second $n \times n$ matrix $B$. In that case one can think of more complex tensor products, for example $B \otimes A \otimes A^{-a}$. This is a rank 6 tensor. Contracting slots 3 and 4 of the 6-tensor gives 4-tensor $B \otimes I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix. In Mathematica, this contraction can be written as               TensorContract[B\[TensorProduct]A\[TensorProduct]Inverse[A], {3, 4}]       **Question 2**   Also for the above contraction, I would like Mathematica to use the idenity $A\cdot A^{-1} = I$. It should evaluate to               B\[TensorProduct]A\[TensorProduct]Inverse[A], {3, 4}]       More over, I want Mathematica to use the same identity in more complicated tensor products, like $ B \otimes A \otimes B \otimes A^{-1} $. The last example should evaluate to               TensorTranspose[B \otimes I \otimes B, {{4, 5}]      How can this be realized with Mathematica 9? ### Generalizations Ihe above, there was allays only one invertible matrix which was called $A$.   **Question 3**   Can you take identity relations are into account for any invertible matrix, irrespectively of the names or number of invertible matrices?
