I regularly want to test if a certain function, here foo, gives the expected result when mapping it over n - level - matrices. My naive approach is to write:               m1 = Range@3;     m2 = {m1, m1};     m3 = {m2, m2};     m4 = {m3, m3};      Then I test:               Map[foo, m1, {ArrayDepth@m1 - 1}];     (* ... *)     Map[foo, m4, {ArrayDepth@m4 - 1}];      The m1-case correctly gives:               foo[{1, 2, 3}],      and the m4-case correctly gives:               {{{foo[{1, 2, 3}], foo[{1, 2, 3}]}, {foo[{1, 2, 3}],         foo[{1, 2, 3}]}}, {{foo[{1, 2, 3}],         foo[{1, 2, 3}]}, {foo[{1, 2, 3}], foo[{1, 2, 3}]}}}      (foo should always map over the innermost level). I am now looking for a more elegant and automated solution, possibly a oneliner like:               (m[#] = BuildLevels[Range@3,4]) & /@ Range@4      but don' t know how to implement it in a short and efficient way. Thanks in advance for your help.
