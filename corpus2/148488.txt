We are looking at revamping documentation across our product line. Part of that includes **reference manuals** for a **programming language** used as part of the system. When writing a reference manual for a programming language, what is the best way to structure it for maximum usability to those new to the language? What are the **key aspects** for each keyword documented?   * Syntax   * Description   * Arguments - if applicable   * Return values - if applicable   * Example of usage?   * Any others I'm missing? **Should concepts** (such as locking strategies, performance related details) be also documented in this reference manual, or is that a separate document? * * * This is for external consumption. We already have full doc sets (see: http://www.rocketsoftware.com/u2/resources/technical-resources). Working out what we should do different - I already have my ideas, but as always, I try not to rely solely my my opinion. Audience: Technical developers using our database(s) & tools to produce software across many industries.
