I have some data set which i would like to partition into 3 groups a:set 1 b: set 2 c: background. I use `FindClusters[]` function but as you can see (after evaluating the commands) the result is not what I am looking for.   Can someone help?               data1 = RandomReal[{-0.1, 0.1}, {10^2, 2}];     data2 = RandomReal[{-1, 1}, {2*10^2, 2}];     data3 = RandomReal[{-0.3, -0.2}, {2*10^2, 2}];     data5 = Join[data1, data2, data3];     ListPlot[FindClusters[data5, 3]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/faXuR.png)
