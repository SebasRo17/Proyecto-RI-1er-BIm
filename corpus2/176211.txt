Being a student in a small school, there aren't a lot of people _(well, there aren't any)_ that share the same passion or skill of programming that I have. I have been learning to program myself since the age of 9, and I believe I have reached the level where I am ready to do something more ambitious, as opposed to the little scripts and personal web design I do at the moment. The point is: would having a small group - or just another person - allow us to achieve greater things? If so, how would I begin building a team?
