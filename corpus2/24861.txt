folowing is the content my test nb File: pdfTest.nb, contain some chinese characters:               SampleCode1:pdf输入不正常。      After Save as or Export, pdf file looks well for the Chinese content. But when Import, it seems become WindowsANSI Encoding. When I Import the pdf file               Import["E:\\Users\\Quaternions\\Desktop\\pdfTest.pdf","Plaintext",CharacterEncoding->"CP936"]      Show this               SampleCode2:pdfÊäÈë\.b2»Õý\.b3£¡£      When I Export and Re-Import the .txt file, it works fine.               Import[Export["temp1.txt",%,CharacterEncoding->"WindowsANSI"],CharacterEncoding->"CP936"]      good result:               pdf输入不正常。      my-enviroment is windows 8 mathematica 9.0 chinese version.               $CharacterEncoding     CP936      Maybe someone is hard to test. My question is: 1: How to directly import the pdf file contain chinese characters and show well. 2: if the solution for question 1 is not possible, is it necessary to Export using CharacterEncoding->"WindowsANSI" and re-Import? , ie. How to convert the characterEncoding in notebook without the export manipulation? Convert SampleCode2 to SampleCode1 _Futhermore, When I import some pdf generated by Tex or obtain other where, also will encouter with CharacterEncoding Problem. I think Import Pdf File should better add an Elements that Import pdf pages as Rasterized image list._
