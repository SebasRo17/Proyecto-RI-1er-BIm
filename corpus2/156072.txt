I have read this (Database design: 3 types of users, separate or one table?) I decided to put admin and normal user in one table since the attributes are similar:               fullname,     address,     phone,     email,     gender     ...      Then I want to draw ERD, suddenly my mind pop out a question. How to draw? Customer make appointment and admin approve appointment. now only two tables, and admin, customer in same table. Help.
