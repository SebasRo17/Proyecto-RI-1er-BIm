I have loops like this:               for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {         for(int j = 0; j < i; j++) {             sum += 1;         }     }      It's O(n * ), but I'm not sure what the j < i loop is. I have some tests that I ran,               n = 10, runs = 45          n = 20, runs = 190          n = 40, runs = 780          n = 80, runs = 3160          n = 10, runs = 12720      It seems to be converging onto .5*n^2, but I'm not quite sure.
