Is there any issue with creating a new controller within the ascx view pages. I don't want to create a model, are there any issues with doing it this way. Normally, the controllers control variables within the model, and the model is the middle point between them, but I am creating a new instance of a controller class within the ascx page itself. Is this ok? **EDIT I want to know the implications of putting an instance of a controller class directly into the asp.net ascx code on a view page Thanks
