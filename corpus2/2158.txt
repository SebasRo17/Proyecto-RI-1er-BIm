To my mind the only reason for the existence of `For[]` loops in Mathematica is to allow new users with some experience in procedural programming languages to write simple Mathematica programs. The real problem is that sometimes such a user do not dive deeper and as a consequence he has 1) ugly and unreliable code and 2) a belief that "Mathematica has a C-like syntax". It is hard for me to imagine a situation when `For[]` can not be effectively and more cleanly replaced by `Table`, `Map`, anything else or `Do` at least. Am I wrong? Should we really recommend beginners to avoid `For[]` loops? * * * SUMMARY There are actually two great answers. The first answer is the accepted one and the second answer is this question. I wish I could accept it as well.
