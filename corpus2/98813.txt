When I was assigned a program, I usually build them block by block. For example, I was required to write a program which enable FTP transfer of files, which also allow queueing of transfer and a multi-thread transfer instead of single thread transfer. What I would do is: 1) Try to make the program able to transfer 1 file 2) Try to make the transfer into a queue 3) Try to implement multi-threading Would you do this instead: 1) Read through all the material/tutorial of all 3 requirement 2) Try to assemble them into a general picture 3) Write the program at once. What do you think?
