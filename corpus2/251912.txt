I just recently started learning C++, and as most people (according to what I have been reading) I'm struggling with pointers. Not in the traditional sense, I understand what they are, and why they are used, and how can they be useful, however I can't understand how incrementing pointers would be useful, can anyone provide an explanation of how incrementing a pointer is a useful concept and idiomatic C++? This question came after I started reading the book A Tour of C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup, I was recommended this book, because I'm quite familiar with Java, and the guys over at Reddit told me that it would be a good 'switchover' book.
