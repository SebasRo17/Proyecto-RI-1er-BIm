> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Creating legends for plots with multiple lines? I have a ListPlot of data points. To distinguish between datapoints coming from different sources, I give them different PlotMarkers, say green triangles for one, and red circles for another. An example could be:               Jones2012 = {{3, 2.5}, {2, 4}};     Adams1999 = {{1, 2}, {4, 4}};     ListPlot[{Jones2012, Adams1999}, Frame -> True,       PlotMarkers -> {{\[FilledCircle], 20}, {\[FilledUpTriangle], 20}},       PlotStyle -> {Red, Darker[Green]},       PlotRange -> {{0, 5}, {0, 5}}]      Now I want to have a small box in the upper right corner explaining what data the different markers correspond to, e.g. Jones 2012 is marked with red circles. I am thinking that the best way to do it would be to make a box as an object first, then insert this object in the graphics afterwards. My best try at making the box so far is:               triangle =       Graphics[{Thick, Darker[Green], Polygon[{{0, 0}, {1, 0}, {0.5, 1}}]},        ImageSize -> 10]     circle = Graphics[{Thick, Red, Disk[{0, 0}]}, ImageSize -> 10];     box = Framed@       Text[Style[triangle "Jones 2012" circle "Adams 1999", 12]]      or               box = Framed@       Text[Style[triangle "Jones 2012 \nAdams 1999" circle, 12]]      But what I would like to do is to have the symbols first on the line, followed by what it represents, then a new line with the next data set. So something like: "green triangle" Adams 1999 "red circle" Jones 2012 Preferably the symbols would be aligned, as well as the left edge of the text. I feel like I should be close, but can't seem to figure out that last little thing to get it how I want it. Thanks so much!
