I want to implement a `JSP`, `POJO`, `DAO` and `Servlet` in my `J2EE` program. However, I don't fully understand how the relationship between these elements should be. Is the following (MVC) setup the right way to do it?   * Main class creates servlet(controller)   * Servlet has a `DAO` defined in its class   * `DAO` has a `POJO` defined in its class   * `Servlet` communicates with the view (JSP page) Please give your feedback.
