I have defined my function in this way               w = f[r,Θ] ;      After some calculations i obtained my results with respect to the previous function. For instance:               Set[lapla1, -(1/(2 μ)) (1/r D[w r, {r, 2}] - 1/r^2 (D[w, {Θ, 2}] + Cot[Θ] D[w, {Θ, 1}]))] // ExpandAll      In this moment i don't need to work with the previous function $w$, instead i need to keep my previous result, multiply lapla1 by $r$ and work with a new $w$               w = f[r, Θ]/r ;      I'm trying to use pure functions to accomplish this, however i don't know if i'm proceeding correctly.               Set[lapla11,lapla1*r /. f -> (f[#, #2]/r &) // ExpandAll ]      **EDITED:** When you make this transformation, the term $\frac{1 }{rμ }\frac{\partial f}{\partial r}$ must disappear from lapla1. This is the only way i found to prove it               Set[lapla12, -(r/(2 μ)) (1/r D[w/r r, {r, 2}] - 1/r^2 (D[w/r, {Θ, 2}] + Cot[Θ] D[w/r, {Θ, 1}]))] // ExpandAll
