Version 9 introduced `TemporalData` but, truth be told, the documentation doesn't suggest that one can do much with it. Many of us have probably assumed we'd be better off sticking with the date-value pairs familiar from use in `DateListPlot` and elsewhere. Are there some (perhaps undocumented) functions I can use to manipulate temporal data after putting it in `TemporalData` form?
