Mine is a typical website developed with LAMP stack. Due to scalability issues we are planning to incorporate NoSQL for the application. For the implementation, we are planning to implement hybrid solution: using NoSQL only for few of the high volume tables in database and keep on using MySQL for all the other. So, we are splitting the database in two with two different servers which use different database technology. We are weighing pros and cons for this approach. For example, with this approach we will have to depend on the web application to maintain data integrity. There will be 2 points of failure due to 2 DB servers, instead of one. Is it a usual practice? What are the pros and cons?
