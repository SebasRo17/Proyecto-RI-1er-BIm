I have a list of english words. I'm trying to come up with a data structure that allows me to do fast StartsWith filtering, like:               var words = dictionary.StartsWith("foo");      I was thinking of creating a data structure like this: ![Data Structure](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZhA1A.png) But I wanted to ask first: a) Does the above data structure already have a name? b) Is this the fastest way to implement what I'm looking for? Edit: The data structure will be built at the beginning and not change. I'll only need to do the equivalent of StartsWith and Contains.
