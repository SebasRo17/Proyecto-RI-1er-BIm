I have one class called "Institution" which represents a public institution (with properties like id_inst, name_inst, tel_inst, fax_inst...). The institution can have affiliated institutions, for example a university is composed of different faculties (which are also institutions with the same properties and methods). Theses faculties can also have affiliated institutions : laboratories, annexes, etc. How can I express this concept in a UML class diagram?
