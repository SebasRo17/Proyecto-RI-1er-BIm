I saw a lesson plan that had students filling different shaped bottles at a constant rate. The idea was to graph height vs. time to show the students how different shapes would produce different graphs, and especially the idea that most bottles would not produce a linear height vs. time function. Would it be possible to "design" a bottle as a 3-d shape in Mathematica, and then use integration to animate filling it...?
