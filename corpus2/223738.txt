I normally have 2 roles in most of my websites, i.e. `Admin` and `Member` and create one folder for each Role like                /Root        /admin        /member      but now I have come up with `10 Roles` besides `Admin` and each role represents a department in a Company. And each role has only access to their `Department's tables` e.g Users with `accounts` roles have access to table related to accounts info and so on... Now I am not sure if it will be a better way to create as many folders as the number of roles. And under that folder I will have almost same templates and same Queries where templates may contain different `links` and `Queries` maybe different `Tablename` Which will lead to a maintenance nightmare. What will be the best way to handle this?
