Create a new notebook with the following two input cells:               NotebookWrite[EvaluationNotebook[], Cell[BoxData[ToBoxes[Manipulator[Dynamic[x]]]], "Output"]]      and               y = 10  (* dummy cell *)      If you evaluate the whole notebook (`Evaluation menu\Evaluate Notebook`), you will see the manipulator appear then quickly disappear. If you manually evaluate the first cell, the manipulator will not disappear. Why is this happening?
