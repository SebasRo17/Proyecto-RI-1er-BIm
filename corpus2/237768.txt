Having solid git knowledge under my belt, I occasionally use mercurial, especially when patching a HG based project. I feel slightly uncomfortable, because my knowledge of mercurial is limited and does a lot of things differently than git. Since a lot of these things are probably just rooted in my lack of mercurial knowledge I would like to brush it up. One obstacle when learning mercurial is the abundance of plugins. It seems that not all plugins described in Tutorials are still recommended as many of them have been superseded etc. What are good, modern plugins to start with? While in Git, I work with branches heavily, I like to rebase occassionally to avoid having too many merge commits between master and feature branches back- and-forth. Can this usage be reasonably simple mapped to mercurial or would you say that I should change this approach while using mercurial for a "more native" workflow?
