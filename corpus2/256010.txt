I've been tasked with getting rid of a VB6 application. It's heavy with data input forms, tabs, modal dialogs etc. I see my options for the UI as:   1. rewrite as-is in Winforms    2. rewrite as-is in WPF    3. redesign UI completely and write in WinRT XAML    4. redesign as web app using ASP.Net MVC    5. redesign as web app using Angular All of these except Winforms will require much of a learning curve for me and my team, but I assume Wnforms is dead. What are others doing and why?
