After many years of coding, trying various programming styles, weeding out unreadable or impractical stuff, I still can't figure out one thing: what is the best way to single-line-comment multiple lines of indented code. 1.                   setup_checkpoint();     //    if (object->looks_suspicious())     //        guard->full_body_scan(object);      2.                   setup_checkpoint();         // if (object->looks_suspicious())         //     guard->full_body_scan(object);      3.                   setup_checkpoint();         // if (object->looks_suspicious())             // guard->full_body_scan(object);      Please, don't suggest multiline commenting, because sometimes you want to leave that possibility for bigger blocks, which may include smaller pieces of comments.
