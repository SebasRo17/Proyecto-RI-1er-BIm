I know you can sell apps using your own personal tax information, but what if there are several people working on the app? Our plan is to just have one of us register for the Google Merchant account and then we'll privately divide up any revenue that comes to the PayPal account. Is this legal? Or do we need to actually create an LLC and have a payroll, etc?
