I am writing a small desktop GUI application using Ruby and Gtk2. I am using RubyMine 3 on Linux (Fedora). I created a simple class to create a Gtk Window but now I feel it takes more time to just keep adding code for a Button, Drop Down and TextBox etc. I need to write even more code if the DropDown needs to be populated at run-time. Is there any Ruby Gtk IDE which supports adding Controls with simple drag-n- drop? At least I can focus on the business logic instead of just defining position and sizes of controls. One more question. I subscribed to Ruby-Forum mailing list but it is often flooded with Spam. Which is the official Ruby forum? Recently NetBeans has withdrawn support for Ruby. Is it worth to learn Ruby seriously and use it in commercial environment or not?
