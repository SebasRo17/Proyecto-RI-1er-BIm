I'm building close-source application with some libraries that's using Apache License 2.0. Number 4 point a) of the license stated that:               (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License;      Does this mean that my application is now under Apache License 2.0 because I included that license to my app? Where should I include this license? In my source code or on the GUI? Thanks.
