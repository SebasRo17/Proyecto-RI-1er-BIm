I am producing a graph, generated by a list of adjacent nodes. (The list looks like `{1 ->583, 1->2977, 2->14, 4->1293, 5->221, ...}`. Each node of my graph is a number. I wanted to get the centrality measures for this graph so I used:               bc = BetweennessCentrality[graph1]      This yields the entire list of centrality measures, (in the order in which the nodes appear in my list i guess?)               {6., 0., 0., 0., 0., 3., 5., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0.,      1., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.,      0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0.}      I would like to find a way to obtain the centrality measure for a precise node, say, node 2. I only know of this kind of way :               bc[[2]]      But this only gives me the second entry in the obtained list, not the centrality measure for node number 2. What I would really need is to generate a list with the first 10 nodes in my graph and their respective centrality measures.
