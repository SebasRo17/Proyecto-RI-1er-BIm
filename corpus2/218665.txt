Well, the title is pretty much self explanatory, but I'll expound it a bit, and say the origin of my question. So, I've been wondering as to how the CPU knows when it received the RAM. I'm pretty sure it doesn't OR the RAM outputs together, because 0x00 is still a number, yet ORing that together says that the RAM has not outputed anything. Does the RAM have some kind of "request acknowledged" line? Well, my friend was making an MC CPU, and he used interrupts for RAM reading, so that's where I got this idea. Anyways, the origin of my problem is probably when I was thinking about Virtual Memory. In virtual memory, you have to fetch from the disk and to the RAM. How does one compensate for the gap between the speeds? May this be answered too?
