I have a ListLinePlot and I'm trying to place a close-up of a specific range in the ListLinePlot. Using overlay I solved this problem with:               Overlay[{p1, Item[Show[p2], Alignment -> {-.7, .6}]}]      This results in something like the following image: ![Overlay example](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FTHOX.png) But I can't select this image and export it. I can do "Print Selection as" and save as pdf, but this rasterizes the image. I want the same resolution as with a normal graphics environment. How do I achieve this?
