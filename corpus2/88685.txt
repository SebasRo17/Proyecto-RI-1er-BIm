As far as I know and have understood in my experience with Qt, it's a very good and easy to learn library. It has a very well designed API and is cross- platform, and these are just two of the many features that make it attractive. I'm interested to know why more programmers don't use Qt. Is there a deficiency which speaks against it? Which feature makes other libraries better than Qt? Is the issue related to licensing?
