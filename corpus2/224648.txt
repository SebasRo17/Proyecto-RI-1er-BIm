So while I was learning HTML I encountered CSS. It's interesting because with CSS you can make a webpage cool or more beautiful. But since it's more about colors, designs, styles etc., I can't know the results of my CSS codes. As someone who is visually impaired, why should I learn CSS if sighted people can always design a webpage better than me because they can see?   1. Are there blind programmers here who write CSS? How did you do it?   2. Should I disregard CSS all together and leave it to sighted programmers? Or there are some things in CSS that I can do without asking people to look at my page to know if it has good design?
