You can find an endless list of blogs, articles and websites promoting the benefits of unit testing your source code. It's almost guaranteed that the developers who programmed the compilers for Java, C++, C# and other typed languages used unit testing to verify their work. So why then, despite its popularity, is testing absent from the syntax of these languages? Microsoft introduced LINQ to C#, so why couldn't they also add testing? I'm not looking to predict what those language changes would be, but to clarify why they are absent to begin with. As an example: We know that you can write a `for` loop without the syntax of the `for` statement. You could use `while` or `if`/`goto` statements. Someone decided a `for` statement was more efficient and introduced it into a language. Why hasn't testing followed the same evolution of programming languages?
