I need to plot the relative error vs compression ratio diagram of a discrete wavelet transform on an image, but no luck so far .. Here's the problem in short:   1. random_image.jpg   2. compress the image   3. plot the relative error vs compression ratio diagram Here's the code and below is the link I am using as a reference:               cumulativeEnergy[data_] :=       Module[{c = Sort[Flatten[data]^2, Greater]}, Accumulate[c]/Total[c]]          data = (* insert random image*)          wtdata = DiscreteWaveletTransform[data]          wtE = cumulativeEnergy[Last /@ wtdata[Automatic]];          ListLinePlot[Sqrt[1 - wtE]]      The problem is I don't get a curve like in the example..
