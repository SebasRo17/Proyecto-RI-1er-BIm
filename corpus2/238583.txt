We're about to venture into building a brand new SAAS application that needs to have a great looking and sophisticated front end. The UI is meant to be single-page, built on top of Web API and using Typescript. Backend is in ASP.NET/MVC. UI will be heavy on charts/graphs/reports/dashboards as well as data/entry of parameters. Dashboards need to be "live", but all other data can be refreshed on screens manually, no need to live-push it. Goals for the framework revolve around the following criteria: 1) Ability to acceptance-test UI data layer without Selenium (ie: json only, don't want to maintain tests at the brittle HTML layer) 2) Ability to work with Typescript 3) Great tooling with respect to Visual Studio 4) Easy to work with, understand, and catch issues/errors. 5) Html5 and responsive design are very important Appreciate any advice or follow up questions
