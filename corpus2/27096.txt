Note: I'm not sure if this question is more suitable for Stack Overflow or Programmers. The thought process behind putting it here was that it doesn't actually relate to coding itself. I noticed a small freeware utility I have on my computer uses a couple of DLLs. From their names ("RenderAllChunks" and "RenderSlice"), it looks like they're being used just for specific functions. If outsourcing program- specific functions is really necessary, wouldn't it be better to just stuff them in a separate header file? It seems quite pointless to go through all the trouble of compiling, linking and distributing DLLs just for one function.   * Is it bad to use shared libraries for small projects?   * When/why are shared libraries preferable over static libraries (or even header files)?
