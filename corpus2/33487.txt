I have hundreds of images similar to this image: ![Valid XHTML](http://i.imgur.com/oNrJq0j.png) I'm looking to count the number of ellipses as well as their major and minor diameters. The ellipses are touching, hence,               img = Import["http://i.imgur.com/oNrJq0j.png"]     EdgeDetect[img]      doesn't return fillable ellipses so using something like               WatershedComponents[%]      returns useless information. I'm very new to this type of image analysis using Mathematica so any help would be greatly appreciated.
