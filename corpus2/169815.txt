I'm learning the 23 design patterns of the GoF. I think I've found a way to understand and simplify how the Abstract Factory works but I would like to know if this is a correct assumption or if I am wrong. What I want to know is if we can see the result of the Abstract Factory method as a matrix of possible products where there's a Product for every "Concrete Factory" x "AbstractProduct" where the Concrete Factory is a single implementation among the implementations of an AbstractFactory and an AbstractProduct is an interface among the interfaces to create Products. Is this correct or am I missing something?
