Is there a way to enter the traditional form of a binomial coefficient, i.e. ${n \choose k}$ instead of `Binomial[n,k]`, like I would enter a radical sign $\sqrt{x}$ using control-shift-2? I would like to enter it that way in a notebook, and see it in that form in the input as well as output equations, just like the radical. I know that I can use `TraditionalForm` to convert it on output, but I don't need to do that to see radicals instead of `Sqrt`.
