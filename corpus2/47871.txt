StringCount["one letters three letters letters one letters letters three letters",     "one" ~~ __ ~~ "three"]      gives               1      because there is the one occurence of " **one** [letters three letters letters one letters letters] **three** [letters]" It took me some time to understand that Mathematica "thinks" in this way because I expected the value               2      due to " **one** letters **three** letters letters **one** letters letters **three** letters" Now I am facing the problem of finding the code that solves this problem in my desired way.
