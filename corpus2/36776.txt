I'm sure this has been asked before, but I can't find the right combination of search keywords to find it. Apologies. I want to do a `ReplaceAll` on a list of lists, for example, I would like:               {{a, b}, {c, d}} /. {i_, j_} -> {i, j, 0}      What I want is to turn this list into `{{a,b,0}, {c,d,0}}`, but I can't figure out a way to tell Mathematica to only look at lists that are one level "below". Running the above returns `{{a, b}, {c, d}, 0}`, as `i` matched `{a,b}` and `j` matched `{c,d}`. How do I pattern match lists that nested?
