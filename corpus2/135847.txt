I'm considering a career change after having worked as a financial software developer in London over the past 8 years. I'd quite like to move to Silicon Valley but I'm not clear on the practicalities. 1) Given the visa requirements, am I limited to joining a large software firm such as Google? Or are startups or self employment open to me? 2) Does the visa requirement put me at a disadvantage compared to local hires?
