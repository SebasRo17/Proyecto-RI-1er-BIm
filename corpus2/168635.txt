I just read through the documentation on the Codecs module, but I guess my knowledge/experience of comp sci doesn't run deep enough yet for me to comprehend it. It's for dealing with encoding/decoding, especially Unicode, and while to many of you that's a complete and perfect explanation, to me that's _really_ vague. I don't really understand what it means at all. Text is text is text in a .txt file? Or so this amateur thought. Can anyone explain?
