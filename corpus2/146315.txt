I'm looking at developing some commercial product (sell for money, only binaries, no sourcecodes). I have read up on open source licensing, but I just could not understand if what I want to achieve is possible. Will need some bros to walk me through. Like I mentioned, I looking forward to create a simple commercial product, I might be looking at using json for communication. I saw quite a number of favorable comments for Jackson JSON. Is it legally advisable for me to use it's library, but do not distribute my own source code? Or is there any other condition that I have to adhere to before I can sell my product without distributing my own source code? I won't be modifying the Jackson library at all, only calling its method. I definitely have no intention of paying to obtain a separate license to allow me not to distribute my source code. If this is not feasible, any other json library that I can look at? ps:I hope that there will not be answers directing me to read up on the license, as I have read, but do not understand the advise legally.
