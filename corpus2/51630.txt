I want to create a function that will take a variable $x$ and reassign the value $x+2$ to $x$. So               f[x_]:= x += 2      However:               f[10]      yields the _Mathematica_ error > AddTo::rvalue: 10 is not a variable with a value, so its value cannot be > changed. Which makes sense, as I am asking _Mathematica_ to assign the value of 12 to 10. So how can I do this so that it changes the assigned value of some variable $x$?
