I'm new to web applications. I have developed a web application using ASP.net. After hearing about jquery and going through some examples, I changed the existing application and used jquery to do most of the ajax work. On the server side I used html handlers for db connections and data processing. Because I'm using jquery, my concern is my script is visible to users of the application. Will this be a security issue? Am i following a right path?
