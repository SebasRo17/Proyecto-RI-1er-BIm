What is the best way to filter an image so that only the pixels close to a certain color are left? I've downloaded some satellite images from the web where a specific pixel color corresponds to a some type of crop. Thus I would like to filter out with Mathematica those pixels that are specifically for that color so I can next run ComponentMeasurements to obtain the area covered by those pixels, so I was trying to figure out what function to use or build that would just return an image with the pixels that match or are truly similar to the color provided.
