A young developer frequently hits me up for help with Asp.net web forms. Usually his problems revolve around the actual controls and how to manipulate them, rather than pure middleware type code. Since I work with Asp.Net MVC quite a bit I usually see simpler solutions to his problems, but he can not implement them because of the structure he is working in. I have discussed this with fellow developer, and he feels that it would not be a good move. His reasoning is that if you remove the structure that web forms provides, the young developer will flounder and not be able to do anything. I, on the other hand, feel that by removing the built in abstraction of web forms and their associated controls, and just focus on HTML and the code he will be more successful in his projects. Would it be a wise move for a developer in this situation to move away from web forms and start to learn Asp.net MVC?
