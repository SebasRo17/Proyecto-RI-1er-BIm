Probably a duplicate, but it's not easy to search on "lists". I have a function that accepts a list of lists, say `{{a1, b1}, {a2, b2}, {a3, b3}}` and performs some computation on `{ai,bi}` for each `i`. (We may assume that none of the `ai` or `bi` are themselves lists). I would like this function to also accept simply `{a1,b1}` as its argument list and operate on this as if it were the only member of the (nonexistent) outer list. That is, I would like               f[{a1,b1}]      to behave the same way as               f[{{a1,b1}}]      What I have done is the following:               f[list_] := Module[{nlist},        nlist = If [ListQ[list[[1]]], list, {list}];        <do other stuff...>     ]      This works fine, but seems pretty inelegant. Is there a better way?
