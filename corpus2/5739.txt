I have some rather long output from a notebook I run on a remote server. There is a time limit on processes so I typically do `NotebookSave[]` after any important result. However, some of these results are truncated. I would like to force these (and only these) results to be fully expanded before the notebook saves. I am aware of the `Short` command and the option in preferences to define the maximum byte size of output. However, I really do not know how large (in bytes or lines) the output is going to be. (Yes, I could experiment but it seems like there should be an easier way.) I tried `Short[%,Infinity]` but that didn't work. Any thoughts?
