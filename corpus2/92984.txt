Is there a way I can 'ease in' to programming. Like learning to use/modify CGI scripts to add some functions to a basic html site? Even if it's the only thing I learn it's still useful, right?. Unlike starting on page one of an O'reilly Python book, it might be a year before I'm useful or I find out it's not for me. I'm a designer by trade (not a programmer) but more and more I build sites on php driven apps like wordpress and joomla. Or sometimes I have a basic html site and I want to add a form or some small app. I've simultaneously become more and more interested in interactive functions and the 'gears' of processing so I am considering dabbling in some scripting languages (php, javascript, cgi) or even some high-level languages like perl, python or ruby. But there is part of me that's saying "what the hell are you doing here? There is a world of programmers in a universe of syntax. You'll get lost before you are useful so just hire a programmer and go learn piano, do some volunteer work or something else useful." But there is another side of me that say's "hey wouldn't it be great if I could just plug in a simple process here an get this little job done." Can anyone recommend an insightful approach or should turn back now and just pretend programming never existed? Is Python a suitable starting point?
