Someone wrote a .NET library to use the Google Maps API (link to the project). I downloaded the entire repository and there are only source files, no LICENSE.txt, readme, etc. However, I guess Google makes you pick a license when creating a new project so the author specified "New BSD License". What I would like to do is download the source and rework it (maybe include JSON.net, add features, etc) and keep it in my github account. So I have a few questions related to this:   * Is the license valid even though the author doesn't have an explicit file with his name, copyright, etc?   * If the license is valid, then do I just put his name and year into that BSD License Template?   * In general, if there is a license included with a project, how do I make sure I am doing right by the author? Would I just leave their license information in tact and then add my own on top of it?   * Am I over thinking this and some of these licenses just amount to a "do whatever you want just don't sue me" (kind of my feelings, since I would be delighted if anyone wanted to use my code for anything at all)?
