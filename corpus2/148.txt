Is it possible in Mathematica to get a step-by-step evaluation of some functions; that's to say, outputting not only the result but all the stages that have led to it? **Example :** Let's say I want to know the steps to get the derivative of $\cos x\times\exp x$; it should first tell me that it's equal to $\frac{d}{dt}(\exp x)\times\cos x+\exp x \times \frac{d}{dt}(\cos x)$ and then render the result to say $\exp{x}\times(\cos x-\sin x)$.
