I have some noisy data, and I'd like to analyze the derivative of the function the data approximately matches. `Interpolation` is normally great, but doesn't work very well at all here.               data = Table[{x, Sin[x] + RandomReal[{-.15, .15}]}, {x, 0, 2 \[Pi], .05}];      ![Almost sin\(x\)](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WR6Um.png)               xi = Interpolation[data];     Plot[xi'[t], {t, 0, 6.25}];      ![Not cos\(x\)](http://i.stack.imgur.com/MaOVG.png) As you can see, the derivative (as expected when you think of how interpolation works) is not at all `Cos[x]`. In this case, because it is so obvious that the curve is of the `Sin[x]` family, it would be trivial to fit it and take the derivative of the fit. In the data I actually collected, I do not know the function, and assuming some high-order polynomial, while it may fit well, is almost certainly an incorrect assumption. Is there a way to plot the derivative cleanly without requiring other knowledge about the function? Is it possible to tell `Interpolation` that it doesn't need to hit every point exactly?
