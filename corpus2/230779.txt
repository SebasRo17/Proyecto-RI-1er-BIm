I know what node.js is & what it does. What I really want to know is how does it work as an http server? A server like apache gets a request, fork a process, allocate memory to process, handle the request & release the process after it is completed. If we get thousands of http requests at a time, then apache waits for the the process queue to release process. How does node.js with a single threaded environment handles so many http requests. All the incoming requests are given their own event loop. All these event loops share same memory. How does using node.js to handle millions of http requests more scalable than using apache?
