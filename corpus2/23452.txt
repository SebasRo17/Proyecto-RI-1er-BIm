I have this differential equation: $$\ddot{x}-\frac{1}{6} \dot{x} - \frac{1}{6}x = e^t$$ When I DSolve it looks like this:               DSolve[x''[t] - 1/6 x'[t] - 1/6 x[t] == Exp[t], x[t], t]      Which gives me the correct answer. With that, we know I have the characteristic polynomial:               z^2 - 1/6 z - 1/6      I also find the roots:               Root[%,1]     Root[%%,2]      So all the results are correct. My question is, how can make this more easy for me, so I don't need to type manually the characteristic polynomial with its roots? I have tried with the function StringReplace to rewrite my differential equation into the characteristic polynomial, but it was messy and not functioning properly.
