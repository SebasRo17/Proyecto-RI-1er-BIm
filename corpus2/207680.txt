I am beginner to Python and I really like it so far. One question that comes to my mind very often is if I need to understand and therefore learn the Internals of a programming language (as in my case Python). As you might know, Python itself is written in C. So my question is: How deep do have to dive into a programming language to be proficient or fluent in this language. I compare this question to "natural" languages. I don't know every detail in grammar in my mother language but I am able to express myself with no problems in that language. This is when I say I am fluent in a language. Does that apply to programming languages too?
