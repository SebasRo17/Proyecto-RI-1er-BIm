After reading the book The Pragmatic Programmer, one of the arguments I found most interesting was "write code that writes code". I tried searching over the net for some more explanations or articles about it, and while I found some good articles on the subject, I still haven't found any specific code implementation or good examples. I feel it's still not a so common argument, something that lacks documentation or it's not embraced by so many people, and I would like to know more about it. What do you think about the subject? Is it something that will really increase your productivity? What are some good resources on the subject, among books, blogs, slideshows, etc? * * * Some code examples would be greatly appreciated to allow me to better understand its implementation. * * * Here's the wiki page on the subject with various relevant programming techniques, like Meta Programming, Generative Programming and Code Generation.
