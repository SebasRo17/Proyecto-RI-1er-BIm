I'm taking an Introduction to Agile Software Development course, The instructor was discussing an example about online store and asked us to write the **User Stories** and the **Conditions of satisfactions** and one story was _As a user I can commit for marketing card that was selected previously in order to buy my goods_ , the conditions of satisfactions in this case contained some conditions in addition to **The system must secure the Credit Card data across the internet connection using https**   * I disagreed with that and said this is a thing that must be done, not just in case the user asked me to protect it, and it is a fatal threat like or more important than SQl Injections and this is a non-functional requirement at the technical level and if the user mention it or didn't this must be taken in our development, some project managers in the course showed their disagreement and said this is a time wast on features that the user didn't ask for!, the instructor didn't give my comment any attention and didn't reply to me. I really think I'm true and not convinced, but all of those trained people disagreed with me[I'm new in the software engineering field but used always to work as a developer], so I'm asking you about this.
