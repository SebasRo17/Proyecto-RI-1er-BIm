I've been a programmer for most of my life. I recently interviewed for a management job in a company and the interviewer looked at my CV asked me "How do we know you're not just a programmer". Which in my opinion is quite a rude thing to say, but it's not an isolated incident and I've heard other similar things in other settings. It does seem that for some reason being a programmer is viewed as having a lower station, especially in settings where they have a separate IT department which is viewed as a support role. Is a career in software development doomed to being a second-rate support citizen?
