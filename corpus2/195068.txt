Id like to create something similar to what you see here... http://www.houzz.com/ideabooks/9424693/list/8-Beautiful-Ways-to-Work-Glass- Into-Your-Kitchen-Cabinets If you click on the second photo down, youll notice it has a bunch of tags, linking to actual products, or just descriptions of products. Is this done using HTML5 canvas overlayed onto the photo?   Or what would be the most efficient way to implement this?? I have a list of 1,000,000 products that the user will be able to tag. I wanna link the two, so that as he tags, it saves to a database, and then anyone else viewing his room, can come in and click a link, to go to that product. Thanks
