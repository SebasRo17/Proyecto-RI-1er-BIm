To be specific: How would you include it as part of curriculum? Would it be too boring to just introduce them as a pure law subject? Are there any course structure available or can we derive one? What are the books that could be used? I would like to see that - after going through the course - candidate is well aware of "what software licenses are and what they are good for". Various implications of not knowing it in it's proper sense. What licenses they should use for their own code. What to consider when they are trying to use certain libraries or tools in their project and gauge risks/rewards associated with it. The idea is to let them make informed choices when they are professionals/practitioners in field of programming and not make them substitute for a lawyer or even a paralegal who is going to fight the case or draft things.
