I attempted to produce a kind of miniature faking look from a street scene photo. I tried to shift the perspective lines close to parallel to each other to obtain such effect. However, the result looks ugly. Is there a better way to do it? This is the original photo. ![This is the original photo.](http://i.stack.imgur.com/AkqJW.jpg) This is the result from the code below. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/R8ObL.jpg)               im = Import["http://i.stack.imgur.com/AkqJW.jpg"]          pts = {{0, 0}, {0, 1}, {0.25, 0},  {0.25, 1}, {0.5, 0}, {0.5,1}, {1, 0}, {1, 1} };     imgcol = BSplineFunction[ImageData[im ], SplineDegree -> 1];     Manipulate[       Module[{f},        f = BSplineFunction[Partition[pts, 2], SplineDegree -> 1,          Method -> {"Extrapolation" -> "Clamp"}];             ParametricPlot[        f[u, v], {u, 0, 1}, {v, 0, 1},        ColorFunction -> (imgcol[1 - #4, #3] &),        MaxRecursion -> 0,        PlotPoints -> ControlActive[20, 100],        Mesh -> None,         Epilog -> { Gray, Opacity[.7], Line[Partition[pts, 2]]},         ImageSize -> {300, 300},        PlotRange -> {{0, 1}, {0, 1}},        PlotRangePadding -> Scaled[0.01],        FrameTicks -> None        ]        ],      {{pts, {{0, 0}, {0, 1}, {0.25, 0},  {0.25, 1}, {0.5, 0},  {0.5, 1},         {1, 0}, {1, 1} }}, {0, 0}, {1, 1}, Locator },      TrackedSymbols :> {pts}      ]
