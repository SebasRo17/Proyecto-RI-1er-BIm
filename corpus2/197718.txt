What non-programming jobs should someone look for who doesn't have the passion for programming? There are a percentage of people who make it through a computer science type of degree but do not have the passion for programming. I have worked with many people who have a programming background but became a project manager or tester and it has made my job as a programmer easier... and our products better. This is not a failure of the system or person... they are just finding where they fit. So, I wonder what non-programming jobs benefit from having someone in them that is a programmer and why does it make that person a stronger or weaker candidate for that job? For instance: Programmers make good project managers because they may be able to express requirements in a detailed fashion that makes sense to the programmers that will work on those requirements. But they may be to accustom to talking about things in a technical way that the customers may not understand and they may have a tendency to try to communicate a design for a solution instead of presenting the problem in a raw fashion.
