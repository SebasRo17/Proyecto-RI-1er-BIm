**Update:** I was wrong about the PyQt license. It isn't merely a GPL license. The PyQt authors include a special set of exceptions that allow users to release their own code under a different license, as long as it is one of the Open-Source licenses specifically listed in the PyQt `GPL_EXCEPTION.TXT` file. * * * For the purpose of this discussion, consider the following fully-functional app, which depends on PyQt:               # hello_world.py     from PyQt4.QtGui import QApplication, QPushButton     app = QApplication([])     button = QPushButton("Hello, World!", clicked=app.quit)     button.show()     app.exec_()      (In case it's relevant to the discussion, please note that Python programs like this one do not require "linking" per se.) My preference is to distribute my code under a **permissive** license, e.g. the BSD license. However, PyQt is released under the ~~GNU GPL~~ **GNU GPL with special exceptions**. With that in mind, what are my options here? Am I obligated to release under the GPL, even if I don't distribute PyQt itself? To be more specific, in which (if any) of the following scenarios am I permitted to release my code under the BSD license vs. being obligated to release under the GPL?   * **Scenario 1:** I give you a fully-packaged binary that includes `hello_world.py` and PyQt.   * **Scenario 2:** I give you the source code of `hello_world.py` and PyQt in a single download (say, a `.tar.gz`), but it's up to you to get them running together.   * **Scenario 3:** I give you `hello_world.py` alone, leaving you to obtain PyQt on your own. I know that most of us aren't lawyers, so it is very much appreciated if you can cite the sources your answer is based on.
