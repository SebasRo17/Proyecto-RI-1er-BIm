I'd like to return Greek symbols through MathLink from a C function. However, returning the usual escape sequence (such as \[Alpha]) does not seem to work. Here's a minimal example .tm file (myalpha.tm) which creates a function that should simply return \[Alpha] :               void myAlpha P(( ));          :Begin:              :Function:          myAlpha     :Pattern:           myAlpha[ ]     :Arguments:         { }     :ArgumentTypes:     { }     :ReturnType:        Manual     :End:          #include "mathlink.h"     void myAlpha() { MLPutSymbol( stdlink, "\\[Alpha]" ); }     int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { return MLMain(argc, argv); }      To compile it (on OSX) I use :               /Applications/Mathematica.app/SystemFiles/Links/MathLink/DeveloperKit/MacOSX-x86-64/CompilerAdditions/mprep myalpha.tm -o myalphatm.c     /usr/bin/clang -c -I/Applications/Mathematica.app/SystemFiles/Links/MathLink/DeveloperKit/MacOSX-x86-64/CompilerAdditions myalphatm.c     /usr/bin/clang++ myalphatm.o -L/Applications/Mathematica.app/SystemFiles/Links/MathLink/DeveloperKit/MacOSX-x86-64/CompilerAdditions -lMLi3 -lstdc++ -framework Foundation -o myalpha      And to run it I execute this little script :               link = Install["<fullpath>/myalpha"];     myAlpha[];     Print[%]     Uninstall[link]      Inside a Mathematica notebook this produces some binary symbol, and if I run it with MathKernel from the commandline then I get :               $IterationLimit::itlim: Iteration limit of 4096 exceeded.         Hold[Out[$Line - 1]]      My guess is that I haven't escaped everything correctly in the C string, but I'm not sure what the right escape sequence is. Since \ is the escape character in C I have escaped that, so the C-string reads "\\[Alpha]" and I've tried a variety of other options but to no avail.
