I'm an inexperienced programmer. I have been assigned to develop a Firefox plugin with no prior experience. So I followed the tutorial at MDN. I learned so many things, it's exciting and overwhelming at the same time. When I finally started programming, I ended up using extension the tutorial gave me, and modify it. And after realizing there are tons of code out there which pretty much does everything my extension has to do, I ended up analyzing these codes and implant them to mine with some modifications to suit my own needs.... So yeah, basically what I'm asking is: Will spending a lot of your time observing people's code and modifying them instead making my own improve my skill as a programmer in general?
