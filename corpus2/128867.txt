I have an interview for a C++ internship position. Now, the thing is I've taken two out of three quarters of the basic CS classes (in C++) at my community college and we covered the basics up to arrays, pointers, linked lists, recursion, etc (basically all of Walter Savitch's Absolute C++ book). I spoke to the interviewer on the phone and he said the interview will include technical questions on trees, hashes, probably some sorting algorithms, and other stuff like that. I have less than a week to prep for the interview. What can I do to familiarize myself with the absolute, bare, essentials of the aforementioned interview question topics? Or, is it just a waste of time for me until I take the next class that covers all of those things?
