I want to fit a function to some data and inside the function there's a list here's my data               Ei = {{1, -0.00006636511699298353`}, {2, -0.00007582534298933297`}, \     {3, -0.00008658039298836684`}, {4, -0.00009882137899808185`}, {5, \     -0.0001127647090015671`}, {6, -0.00012865092799074773`}, {7, \     -0.00014674610198994742`}, {8, -0.00016733831999715676`}};      the list               racc = {6.0, 5.9, 5.8, 5.7, 5.6, 5.5, 5.4, 5.3, 5.2, 5.1};      and my function               U[r_] := ecc (1 - (racc[[r]] - Exp[-Acc (1 - rscc)])^2);      But mathematica shows my function as               ecc (1 - (-E^(-Acc (1 - rscc)) + {6., 5.9, 5.8, 5.7, 5.6, 5.5, 5.4,         5.3, 5.2, 5.1}[[r]])^2)      Though in someway it can understand it and give the result for function               U[3] /. {ehh -> 1, Ahh -> 1, rshh -> 1, ech -> 1, Achrsch -> 1,      ecc -> 1, Acc -> 1, rscc -> 1};          -22.04      And it's able to fit it, although an giving an error               sol = FindFit[Ei, U[r], {ecc, Acc, rscc}, r]          Part::pspec: Part specification r is neither an integer nor a list of integers. >>         {ecc -> 3.45136*10^-6, Acc -> -21.5489, rscc -> 2.67028}      It can not Plot it               P2 = Plot[U[r] /. sol, {r, 1, 8}];     Part::pspec: Part specification 1.000143` is neither an integer nor a list of integers. >>     Part::pspec: Part specification 1.1430001428571428` is neither an integer nor a list of integers. >>     Part::pspec: Part specification 1.2858572857142856` is neither an integer nor a list of integers. >>     General::stop: Further output of Part::pspec will be suppressed during this calculation. >>      Does anybody have an idea how to put a matrix or list inside a function?
