While inheriting a class in C++, user can specify the access specifier like,               class Base     {         public int mem1;         protected in mem2;     };          class Derived1 : **private** Base     {         // mem1 will be private here.         // mem2 will be private here.     };          class Derived2 : **protected** Base     {         // mem1 will be protected here.         // mem2 will be protected here.     };          class Derived2 : **public** Base     {         // mem1 will be public here.         // mem2 will be protected here.     };      But the same is not possible in Java, i.e. extends in java is always like "public" inheritance in C++. Could someone explain the reason for this?
