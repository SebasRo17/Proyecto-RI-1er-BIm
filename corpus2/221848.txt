I have been tasked with producing a plan for implementing a slight change to the work of our developers (there are eight of us working at this company). The change affects a small portion of our work, but introduces a new tool that the developers aren't familiar with, and a new "step". _Very_ schematically the change looks like this Before change:   1. Write stuff   2. Do thing X After change:   1. Write stuff   2. Use tool A   3. Use tool B to do thing X What I have done so far is that I've written documentation for the use of tool A and tool B. My question is what should you be keeping in mind when introducing new tools/changes in development to a small development team? How do you assure that the transmission to the new way of doing things is smooth? What type of educational resources should be available? (The tools introduced are for version control of database schema [so it's only when we make changes the database schema that our development is affected], but I figured that was irrelevant to the topic)
