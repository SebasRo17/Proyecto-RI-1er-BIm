I am a native PHP developer, and have been for about a year or so. I love PHP and it was very easy for me to learn, but I have developed some bad habits along the way due to never having a formal education in programming. It's pretty easy to get the job done in PHP without writing the best code. I am looking to work more with another language; not because I don't like PHP but because I want a clean slate to learn programming fundamentals. I am looking to stay with web development, so Ruby or Python seem to be where I'm leaning, though I am open to other suggestions. The more important question is, how do I approach learning this new language to really become a good programmer rather than a guy that can "get the job done"?
