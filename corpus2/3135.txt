I was trying to solve this problem using Mathematica 8.04. I did this:               f[n_] := 2 Cos[2^(-1 + n) ArcCos[5/2]]     Table[{n, N[f[n+1]/Product[f[k], {k, 1, n}]]}, {n, 1, 20}]      and I got               {{1, 4.6 + 0. I}, {2, 4.58261 + 0. I}, {3, 4.58258 + 0. I}, {4,      4.58258 + 0. I}, {5, 4.58258 + 0. I}, {6, 4.58258 + 0. I}, {7,      4.58258 + 0. I}, {8, 4.58258 + 0. I}, {9, 0. + 0. I}, {10,      0. + 0. I}, {11, 0. + 0. I}, {12, 0. + 0. I}, {13, 0. + 0. I}, {14,      0. + 0. I}, {15, 0. + 0. I}, {16, 0. + 0. I}, {17, 0. + 0. I}, {18,      0. + 0. I}, {19, 0. + 0. I}, {20, 0. + 0. I}}      There is something wrong after `n=9`:               N[f[10]/Product[f[k], {k, 1, 9}]]     0. + 0. I     N[f[10]]/N[Product[f[k], {k, 1, 9}]]     4.58258 + 0. I      What is the problem here? I think the first input should be more accurate than the last one.
