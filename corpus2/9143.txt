> A cylindrical can is to be made to hold 1 L of oil. Find the dimensions that > will minimize the cost of the metal to manufacture the can. This is a standard calculus problem. The volume of the cylinder is: `V == π r^2 h` The area of the cylinder is: `A[r_] := 2 π r^2 + 2 π r h /. h -> V/(π r^2)` Find `r` when the slope of the area is zero:               Reduce[A'[r] == 0]      Result:               (r == -(-(1/(2 π)))^(1/3) V^(1/3) ||         r == V^(1/3)/(2 π)^(1/3) ||         r == ((-1)^(2/3) V^(1/3))/(2 π)^(1/3)) && r != 0      As you can see, when I defined `A[r]`, I replaced `h` with an expression produced by solving the volume equation for `h`. My question is, is there a way to express the problem in terms of Reduce and a set of equations, without the manual solving for `h`? I.e. something along the lines of:               A[r_] := 2 π r^2 + 2 π r h          Reduce[{A'[r] == 0, V == π r^2 h}]      Of course, that doesn't yield the correct answer because `A'[r]` doesn't treat `h` as being in terms of `r`.
