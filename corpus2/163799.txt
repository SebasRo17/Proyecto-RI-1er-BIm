I was nominated as scrum master in a new formed scrum team. We have already done some sprints. In the beginning I tried to make my team to work on one story at a time. But it didn't work. My team had difficulties to distribute the tasks in a way that they can work simultaneously on one story. Maybe we are doing something wrong? For example: we have a story to create a new dialog. We create the following tasks:   * Create Model classes   * Read model data from database   * Connect model classes with view   * Implement dialog handling   * Save data on close   * Test Documentation   * Solution Description Can theses tasks be done by more than one person at a time? The tasks - more or less - build upon each other. Or do we design the tasks in a wrong way?
