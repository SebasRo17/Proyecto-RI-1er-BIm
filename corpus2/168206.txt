I've been bumping around the startup world for a while, and most startups I've seen seem to have (amongst other things) two things in common:   1. A lack of money   2. An inability to, reliably, hire good quality developers This means that, for startups, the ideal hire is someone who is free - where they can wait until they've both raised money and found out that the hire is worth his price tag. When (if ever) is this a win win situation? For you, as a programmer or software developer, when would this make sense?
