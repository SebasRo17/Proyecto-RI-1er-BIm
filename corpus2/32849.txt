I am trying to simulate a signal that randomly increases its phase, so far I have tried two thing but neither worked. I usually use matlab but I want to learn some _Mathematica_ so I thought I would try this in _Mathematica_. My first try was               times = Table[i, {i, 0, 2, 0.05}];     function[source_, t_][fiIN_] :=          With[{fi = fiIN + 0.01*RandomReal[]},source*(1 + Sin[2 Pi*t + fi])];      Where I wanted to feed `fi` back into `fiIN` for each subsequent `t` value (in the list `times`). I did not know how to makes this work though so I went on with my second try:               fiupdate[fi_] := fiupdate[fi - 1] + 0.01*RandomReal[];      fiupdate[1] = 0;     fitimes = Range[Length[times]];      However this function does not remember the value of `RandomReal[]` for the earlier steps, so `fiupdate[10]` could be smaller than `[9]` or `[8]`. Also when using this function I get an error:               fis = fiupdate[fitimes];     $RecursionLimit::reclim: Recursion depth of 1024 exceeded      Im not sure how to make this work. Any help is appreciated. Thank you!
