Hey, I'm a Junior Programmer working at a company. I just found out that they've been releasing a debug build of their product to clients for the past four years because the release version is broken (and has been for several years). My initial reaction was to be aghast, and I still am, but is this common? Is this not as big of an issue (both business and code-wise) as I think it is? Thanks in advance for your answer, and apologies if I've tagged this wrong.
