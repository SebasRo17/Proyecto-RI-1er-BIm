I need to find an optimal set of "n" parameter values that minimize an objective function (a 2-hr simulation of a system). I have looked at genetic algorithm and simulated annealing methods, but was wondering if there are any better algorithms and guidance on their merits and limitations. With the above optimization methods I can find the optimal parameter values that hold true for the entire simulation duration. Incase, I want to find the optimal "time varying" parameter values (parameter values change with time during the 2-hr simulation), are there any methods/ideas other than making each time varying parameter value a variable to optimize? Any thoughts?
