First of all, I am sorry that the issue I'm going to say is not about a technical thing. I'm just confused. I am trying applying to several companies as a software engineer. The latest work that I developed is to develop RESTful APIs which is written in Python django. Here's the problem that I'm curious. can this work be classified as a software engineer's work? or is it just a web developer's work?
