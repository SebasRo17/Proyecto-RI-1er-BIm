The `finally` block for a `try-catch` structure is well known, and gives a really easy and elegant way to deal with some must-be-done code. Therefore, I can see no reason why It shouldn't be good for methods too. For instance, lets say I'm writing some very complicated logic in a method, and I expect to end up with a bunch of boolean flags that will in turn lead to some decisions. Many times in such kind of methods I have branches of code where I would want to "break" the flow and just perform the "real stuff" that I called this method for, with the satisfying information I gathered so far. So, Why isn't there such pattern? Or is there?
