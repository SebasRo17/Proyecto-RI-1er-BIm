I have been given a large notebook that was created in mathematica 6. It contains a structure of sections and subsections and the input text is formatted in an unusual (possibly just old) style (see screen grab below). ![original formatting](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ByUyG.jpg) My main aim is to update the formatting of the input cells to the standard mathematica 8 format as I find this format much easier to read/debug (example below). ![new formatting](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TRyNd.jpg) My first thought was to simply copy the entire notebook into a text editor and then copy back into a notebook. However, this results in the generation of a single large input cell that is prohibitively tedious to break up... Applying a new stylesheet does not change the input cell style. Is it possible to update the formatting/style throughout a notebook whilst preserving the cell structure and hierarchy? Edit: An excerpt from the original notebook can be found here, and here is the same excerpt after clearing formatting (but without syntax highlighting).
