There are many academic/industrial researchs about various development methods (Scrum, XP, waterfall, ect.), telling us how to do it right and stuff. But I never saw something that suggest how to choose a method, what will be better for a given project. I know that what the developers are used to is an very important aspect. But lets say that I am assembling a new group from scratch, and that every programmer in the world is willing to work with me. :) What aspects of the project should I consider to decide between Scrum, XP, TDD, ect.? Or is that an entirely human thing, regardless of what is being developed?   * I said that all programmers are available, but you may comment they're knowledge about the domain, or other characteristics in the answers. E.g. "If you chose to hire people with no domain knowledge, `MethodX` is better than `MathodY`, beacause ...." is a completely welcomed answer.
