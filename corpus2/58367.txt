The behaviour of string completion for functions that take strings as input is not entirely clear to me. For example, when I type a function `f` I tend to go through the following steps: first I type the name of the function and open- close square brackets:               f[]      then I take the cursor one place to the left and open close quotes if `f` takes string arguments:               f[""]      and, finally, I jump one place left again and I enter the string:               f["value"]      but string completion doesn't always work with this way of entering string arguments. Although with `CountryData` it does: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/a5cWX.png) other functions like `Import` no string completion occurs if you type in the brackets before the argument (which is a useful way of not losing track of open brackets). ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/NBud4.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tjp48.png) So my question is > Is there a way to force string completion for `Import` so that it works like > `CountryData` does?
