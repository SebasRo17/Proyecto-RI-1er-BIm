I'm starting using Mathematica. I have two coupled differential equations and after using NDSolve the output is in the form of a Interpolating Function. I want to Plot the square modulus of one of the two solutions, but after several trials the plot is still empty. I want to know how to work with this function.               sol = NDSolve[{a1'[t] == -I*V12*Exp[-I*w21*t]*a2[t],       a2'[t] == -I*V21*Exp[I*w21*t]*a2[t], a1[0] == 1, a2[0] == 0},      {a1, a2}, {t, 40}]           (* {{a1->InterpolatingFunction[{{0.,40.}},"<>"],       a2->InterpolatingFunction[{{0.,4‌​0.}},"<>"]}}    *)            f1=a1->InterpolatingFunction[{{0.,40.}},"<>"]                f2 = Conjugate[fun] // ComplexExpand      f3 = fun*gun Plot[f3, {t, 0, 40}]      Where `fun` is `f1` and `gun` is `f2`.
