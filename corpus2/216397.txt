In a rather unceremonious way - Apple has _removed_ Python support (at least from the SDK) in 10.9. Python IS still installed on the system in...               /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework      but trying to _link to it_ under the 10.9 SDK fails. Even with the "CLI Tools" installed, there is no Python in...               /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks      I'm no _Pythonista_... but I do find it interesting that Apple has removed a part of the Developer Toolchain that has been around for so long, and was once so promising (on the Mac platform). Apple often tries to steer the focus towards certain "methodologies"; but historically, when the plug has been pulled - it's over - at least in Apple's eye. Is this _a statement_ by Apple, along the lines " _People aren't using Python very much anymore.. we're gonna phase out support_ "? Or simply, " _Adoption of PyObjC is anemic, maybe we can reduce the size of the SDK by 3.1Mb_ "? Whatever the motivation, it's likely a change that is here to stay. Are there suggestions on workarounds to maintain compile and runtime-compatibility, or insights into why the decision was made?
