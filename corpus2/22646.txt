I am trying to use the descriptive statistics feature of Mathematica to answer the following question: suppose I have two events, A and B, whose occurrence is described by a normal distribution around time $t_A$ and $t_B$ (with moments $\sigma_A$ and $\sigma_B$). What is the probability that, at a given time $t$, both events have occurred? I have tried to define distributions and then use them in a construct of the form `Probability[A && B, â€¦]`, but it is clear from the documentation that `Probability` is not supposed to be used that way. * * * PS: I'm not so much interested in the mathematical solution (I have to read up on that subject, I'm really bad in statistics), rather in the way I can get Mathematica to solve this issue without me doing the maths :)
