There are many security risks coming from having close contact to the hardware as opposed to using well-tested and proved APIs from high level programming languages. It is much easier to cause a buffer overflow in C than in a language such as Java. What are the risks or vulnerabilities (e.g. buffer overflows) that every C programmer should be aware of (I.E. vulnerabilities relevant to C programmers)? What problems could these lead to? How to avoid them, and what are common mistakes causing these to occur in programs?
