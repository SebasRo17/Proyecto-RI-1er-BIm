I cannot open a SQLConnection to a SQL vectorwise database and I assume the JDBC driver is the problem. A JAR file was provided to me - the only info additionally provided to me was the java class: **com.ingres.jdbc.IngresDriver** What would I have to do to add it to the JDBCDrivers that Mathematica can use? Hope this is sufficient information - please let me know, if more information is required. Thanks and regards Patrick
