I'm creating a project that I want to be able to distribute across platforms. I'm writing in Java and AWT which already gives me a pretty large range of devices, but I'm mostly interested in Windows and Linux (Debian/Ubuntu). I'm trying to determine where I should put config files. I have application- wide configuration files and user-specific files. Where are common directories to put these files? Here's my current setup: ## Windows: App Config: `%PROGRAMDATA%\MyApp\config\` User Config: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\MyApp\` ## Other: App Config: `/opt/MyApp/config` User Config: `$HOME/.MyApp/`
