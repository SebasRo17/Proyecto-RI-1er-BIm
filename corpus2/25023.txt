In Mathematica 9, a graph is returned as an object with head `Graph`:               In[8]:= CompleteGraph[8] // Head     Out[8]= Graph      Right-clicking on a `Graph` object brings a menu with the option "Convert to Graphics". Selecting this option returns a new object which has head `Graphics`. I need to do this programmatically, but I haven't found any command that, applied to `CompleteGraph[8]` (to put an example), returns an object with head `Graphics`, with a plot of the graph. Is there a command in Mathematica to convert a `Graph` to a `Graphics`?
