Consider a complex linear ODE system $x'=Ax$, where $$A=\left( \begin{matrix} 0&1\\\ -2&-i \end{matrix}\right). $$ One can first find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors using `JordanDecomposition` and get the general solutions with `MatrixExp`. Here is my **question** :   Is there a quick way in _Mathematica_ that I can get the solution in the form such that the real and imaginary parts are separated: $$ v(t)=c_1v_1(t)+c_2iv_2(t) $$ where $v_1(t),v_2(t)\in{\mathbb R}$?
