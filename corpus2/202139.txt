the other day I was discussing with a colleague and he came out saying that using user's session in a web application is just wrong. I replied that it could be wrong depending by the information you are storing, otherwise why should a web session service even being provided by Microsoft (we were talking about ASP.NET). He replied to me, again, that even in MS they could easily reply me that it was bad design. And that he could show me some white-papers demonstrating that. Unfortunately I have no opportunity to contact this guy anymore, but I would really like to understand more about his point of view. Does anyone have information/points of view about that here?
