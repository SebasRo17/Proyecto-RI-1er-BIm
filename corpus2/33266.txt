I have data where the date is stored as an `AbsoluteTime`. Here's a dummy dataset:               sampleData=Transpose[{#,Range[Length[#]]}]&[Range[AbsoluteTime[{2012,10,01}],         AbsoluteTime[{2013,09,30}],60]];      I want to split it by date, so I use:               splitData=SplitBy[sampleData,DateList[First[#]][[;;3]]&];      This takes ~22 s on my machine. Often I have bigger data sets than this. Is there a faster way to get `splitData`?
