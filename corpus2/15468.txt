Python seems all the rage these days, and not undeservingly - for it is truly a language with which one almost enjoys being given a new problem to solve. But, as a _wise man_ once said (calling him a _wise man_ only because I've no idea as to who actually said it; not sure whether he was that wise at all), to really know a language one does not only know its syntax, design, etc., advantages but also its drawbacks. No language is perfect, some are just better than others. So, what would be in your opinion, objective drawbacks of Python. _Note: I'm not asking for a language comparison here (i.e. C# is better than Python because ... yadda yadda yadda) - more of an objective (to some level) opinion which language features are badly designed, whether, what are maybe some you're missing in it and so on. If must use another language as a comparison, but only to illustrate a point which would be hard to elaborate on otherwise (i.e. for ease of understanding)_
