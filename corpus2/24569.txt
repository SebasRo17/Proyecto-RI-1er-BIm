I was reading about webmathematica but it has mentioned that it is for websites and mobile apps depend on wolfram alpha to get its work done. But since exact mathematica code doesn't work in alpha, it obviously puts serious limitations regarding the granularity of computation needed as it is at mercy of database. So, is there some service that some app can be programmed that creates mathematica code based on parameters from front-end and it is sent as request object to some server where it can be computed and sent back as response object, hence giving the exact answer. In simpler words, Mathematica running on server and executing client's code.
