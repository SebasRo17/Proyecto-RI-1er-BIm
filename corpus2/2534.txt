I am running this command in Mathematica 8.0.4.0:               Minimize[(x1*1 - 1)^2 + (x1*0.823202 + x2*1 - 0.7551)^2 +               lambda*(Boole[x1 != 0] + Boole[x2 != 0]), {x1, x2}]      Now, with `lambda=0` (negating the `Boole` functions), I get:               {7.70372*10^-34, {x1 -> 1., x2 -> -0.068102}}      With `lambda=1`, I get:               {2., {x1 -> 1., x2 -> -0.068102}}      It seems to be ignoring the Boole functions, because clearly `x2 -> 0` is a better solution:               (x1*1 - 1)^2 + (x1*0.823202 + x2*1 - 0.7551)^2 +       lambda*(Boole[x1 != 0] + Boole[x2 != 0]) /. {x1 -> 1, x2 -> 0}          1.00464      I assume Mathematica is minimizing this function numerically; is it simply incapable of doing this with `Boole` functions, given their stepwise nature?
