As most projects use a C++ API, they deal with constraints of the API and constraints of the project itself. I'm a beginner at programming, I don't like to use OOP at all because nobody clearly managed to explain to me WHY it's is so important to restricting yourself with private scope to prevent others programmers to break data organisation consistency of some kind. I still can be ok with OOP, since it still allows to make some great things like Qt and Ogre3D, but those are only APIs, not applications, and those codes need to be perfect so nobody can criticize the work. I don't understand why do most programmers, since they make apps and not APIs, want to do perfect code like they design some genius piece of code, and waste time on this.
