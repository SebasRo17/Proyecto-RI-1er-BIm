Apologies if this is easy to find in the documentation, but is there a quick way of doing the following up to any given 'n'?               a=     Im[n^ZetaZero[1]] + Re[n^ZetaZero[1]] + Im[n^ZetaZero[2]] + Re[n^ZetaZero[2]] +      Im[n^ZetaZero[3]] + Re[n^ZetaZero[3]] + Im[n^ZetaZero[4]] + Re[n^ZetaZero[4]] +      Im[n^ZetaZero[5]] + ... ;          Plot[{If[a >= 0, (a^2)/n, -(a^2)/n]}, {n, 0, 30}]      For clarity, I include the plot for `n` up to `30`, for `ZetaZero` up to `100`: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4Mmgg.gif)
