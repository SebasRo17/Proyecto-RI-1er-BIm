In _No Silver Bullet_ , Fred Brooks makes a variety of predictions about the future of software engineering, best summed up by: > There is no single development, in either technology or in management > technique, that by itself promises even **one order-of-magnitude > improvement** in productivity, in reliability, in simplicity. His argument is very convincing. Brooks was writing in 1986: was he right? Do developers in 2014 produce software at a rate less than 10x faster than their counterparts in 1986? By some appropriate metric -- how large has the gain in productivity actually been?
