I have a list of the following form:               l = {{"label1", {1, 2, 3}}, {"label2", {4, 5}},            {"label3", {3, 6, 9, 8}}, {"label4", {11, 25, 24, 14}}, {"lable5", {4, 5}}}      I would like to retrieve only those labels whose corresponding list has an intersection with the corresponding list of another label, along with the intersecting elements. So, for `l` I would get               {{"label1", "label2", "label3", "label4"}, {3, 4, 5}}      (I'll add my answer, but I'd like to see if someone can come up with a simpler one)
