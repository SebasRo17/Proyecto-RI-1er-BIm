I often import files from excel or csv files and they come in a format like this:               {{"He", "She", "It", "We"}, {8.57167, 0.406351, 1.68575,        5.55309}, {9.16751, 2.57632, 9.20212, 9.8879}, {8.49497, 5.72921,        8.92677, 8.17118}, {3.78541, 2.35875, 4.94475, 3.56491}}      With dimensions in this case {5,4}, I then want to name the columns by the first row. In this case it would mean that row one would be called he, and is equal to `{8.57167, 9.16751, 8.49497, 3.78541}`. I have tried several ways to do this but some how i keep getting different errors. It should be a very simple and efficient solution. This would mean that i want {8.57167, 9.16751, 8.49497, 3.78541} to be shown every time i enter he into mathematica, also if the word starts with a capital as it does for all words in this case I would like it to be transformed from He to he and She to she etc.
