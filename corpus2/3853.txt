I'm doing my first big project and I don't have a lot of experience in a professional programming environment. While researching anything programming- related I often see references to Unit Testing, but I am still unclear as to how to set those up or even if it would be beneficial to me. Can someone explain unit testing to me, and how to set it up in a Visual Studio 2010 solution that has multiple projects? Is it something that occurs within your project's solution, or is it a separate solution? And is it something you'd recommend for a small development team or is it just a waste of time to setup? Right now I just run the entire program to test whatever I am currently working on, but occasionally I have run into problems that are not easy to debug and it would be useful to run subsets of the code elsewhere... Sometimes I do setup another project with some of the libraries referenced to test a small part of the program, but I feel more time is wasted setting that up then just running the entire program because of all the dependencies involved
