I understand protected method is good for unit testing since you can easily mock by the class by overriding the protected method for the sake of testing. However, protected variable is just a global variable (although limited) and should be avoided at all. Especially if you've all the essential getter/setter declared, you should have zero protected variable and it should not affect anything else. So, in the future, if I am going to elimiate all protected variables in my codes, are there any caveat that I am not aware of?
