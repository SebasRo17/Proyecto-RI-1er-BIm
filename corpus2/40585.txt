I've got three plots combined through Overlay:               Overlay[Table[Plot[PDF[NormalDistribution[0, ss], x], {x, -2, 2},           Axes -> {True, False},          Ticks -> None,          PlotRange -> {All, {0, 2}},           ImageSize -> 200],           {ss, {.2, .5, 1}}]]      Now I'd like to obtain something like this: ![overlaid plots with a shift](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IuuAc.png) I tried to achieve that with the Alignment option but to no avail. Thanks in advance for any ideas.
