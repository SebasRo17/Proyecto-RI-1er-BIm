I'd like to cut and paste from one Demonstration notebook to another. These notebooks have a few sections where the content is separated into disjoint cells (examples: Details, Related Links, Search Terms), like so: ![search terms](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SKDB1.png) How can I select a set of these sort of separate cells, so that I can cut and paste them en-mass to another notebook (I really want this for text from the Details section, not the search terms, as in the image above).
