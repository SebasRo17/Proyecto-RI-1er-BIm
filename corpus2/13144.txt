I'm evaluating Wolfram SystemModeler and I want to explore its capabilities together with Mathematica. Unfortunately, I don't manage to get WSMLink working. In the notebook I'm using I typed               Needs["WSMLink`"]      and pressed Shift+Enter. Mathematica gives me this error message: > Get::noopen: Cannot open > C:\Users\Carlo\AppData\Roaming\Mathematica\Applications\WSMLink\Config.m. > WSMLink::cconf: -- Message text not found -- > (C:\Users\Carlo\AppData\Roaming\Mathematica\Applications\WSMLink\Config.m) I'm new to Mathematica and I don't know where I can start fixing my problem. I checked and the file C:\Users\Carlo\AppData\Roaming\Mathematica\Applications\WSMLink\Config.m does not exist on my computer. Do you have any idea how to fix this?
