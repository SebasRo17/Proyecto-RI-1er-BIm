This isn't a rare case and occurs with me often and I spent countless time trying to debug the code. Latest example, this PHP code where I used `$email` for the parameter and for object as well.               private function _mail( $email )     {         if( filter_var( $email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL ) ):             $email = new Zend_Mail();             $email->setSubject( $this->request->post('subject') )                 ->setBodyHtml( $this->request->post('message') )                 ->setFrom( $this->request->post('from') )                 ->addTo( $email )                 ->send();             unset($email);         endif;     }      It was throwing an error, `strtr()` expects parameter 1 to be an string object given and it was really frustrating to browse through zend libraries to see what obscure string statement was throwing this error. How to avoid such mistakes?
