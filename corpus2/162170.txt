Many years ago, I wrote a small Access 2003 database for a non-profit to track the donations they received. They recently wrote me asking for some new features (I was shocked it was still in use, honestly) and I'm wondering if I could rewrite the application with a newer technology/framework. Here are the machine specs:   * Pentium 4 2.8 Ghz   * 1 GB RAM   * Onboard Intel video card   * Windows XP SP3 What, if any, would be a suitable replacement for the database and UI? I'm mainly a C# developer so Winforms + SQL Compact 4 springs to mind (I don't know how WPF would perform on a machine that old). Perhaps there are other possibilities in Python/Ruby/etc? Update: I appreciate and agree that rewriting is rarely the right thing to do, but I was hoping to learn via this question, that given the PC's specs and OS, what possibilities would I have for writing an application that could   * perform CRUD for donations   * generate summary reports (totals by month/year/etc) Or, put another way, is Access still the appropriate tool for the job?
