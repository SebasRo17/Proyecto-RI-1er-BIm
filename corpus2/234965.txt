**Question** : **As an lone, Agile (PXP/PSP) developer what is the proper structure for a formal project post-mortem?** **Scenario** I'm using a PXP methodology (which is a blend of extreme programming and the personal software process) to work on an undergrad project. The project revolves around computer vision and architecture. Although the project has a lot of potential for future improvement, I need to write a project retrospective for this release. I'm used to working with an SRS (requirements specification) and DSD (design specification document) with a structure like : Introduction   * Purpose   * Scope   * Definitions, acronyms etc. Description   * Product perspective   * system interfaces   * interfaces   * Hardware Interfaces   * Software interfaces... constraints etc. Requirements   * Performance, interfaces etc...   * Attributes for security, portability etc. DSD   * system overview -Design consideration   * Architecture   * detailed system design ... etc. However, agile project as we know revolve more around stories than functional requirements, and firm designs. A recommended non-agile structure for this final report is : Introduction : \- Literature review : \- planning : - statement of the methodology used. Design :   * requirements   * design aims Implementation - language choices, coding guidelines etc. Evaluation - evaluation of how good the algorithms are. I've not been able to find an example online of a definite project postmortem structue for a PSP project (even the documentation 1 does not mention how it should be structured).
