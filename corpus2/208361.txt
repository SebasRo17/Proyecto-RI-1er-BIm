I was going through the Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen et al.In the chapter titled Amortized Analysis,the difference between accounting and potential methods is given like this > The accounting method overcharges some operations early in the sequence, > storing the overcharge as “prepaid credit” on specific objects in the data > structure. ... > > The potential method maintains the credit as the “potential energy” of the > data structure as a whole instead of associating the credit with individual > objects within the data structure. I tried to understand this using the example of resizable array which doubles its size when there is no space to insert an element.What I couldn't understand was the following sentence > storing the overcharge as “prepaid credit” on specific objects in the data > structure Using Accounting method: ci = the charge for the i-th operation c'i = amortized cost of the i-th operation Si = array size after the i-th operation bi = balance of credit after the i-th operation               i   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10     si  1  2  4  4  8  8  8  8 16 16     ci  1  2  3  1  5  1  1  1  9  1     c'i 3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3     bi  2  3  3  5  3  5  7  9  3  5      what exactly does "storing on specific objects in the data structure" mean here? In potential method ,if I use phi to be 2n-m where n = number of currebt elements in the array ,and m=array size                               n     m    phi     empty            0     0    0      add first elem   1     1    1     add secondelem   2     2    2     add third elem   3     4    2     add fourth elem  4     4    4     add fifth  elem  5     8    2      In this ,what does it mean by "...the “potential energy” of the data structure as a whole instead of associating the credit with individual objects within the data structure."
