PEP8 recommends using > lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve > readability for variable and function names. I've seen this interpreted as `lower_case_with_underscores` by most people, although in practice and in Python's native methods it seems like `lowercasewithoutunderscores` is more popular. It seems like following PEP8 strictly would be awkward since it seems to suggest mixing both `lower_case_with_underscores` and `lowercasewithoutunderscores`, which would be inconsistent. What is your interpretation of PEP8's variable names, and what do you actually use in practice? (Personally, I like `lowerCamelCase` as a compromise between readability and ease of typing.)
