We are currently working on an inventory module. We have purchase requisition, purchase order, goods receipt modules etc. There is obviously the need for UOM or Unit of measurement conversion needed. User places purchase request in terms of **Sales UOM** , the metric in which they want to sell. The system places order in terms of **Purchase UOM** , in the metric they put an order to the supplier. However we are in a dilemma UOM conversion, we want to avoid fractions during conversion. > Eg. If one Purchase UOM = 7 Sales UOM, conversion will be 1/7 , this will > obviously create fraction quantities for both cases How can I convert the UOM's properly without suggesting the user to over purchase some goods (Rounding to nearest integer will do as long as there is no wastage)?
