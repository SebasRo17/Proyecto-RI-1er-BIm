In the output from a calculation in mathematica stands `a/((R^3*c)^(1/3))`, with `c` and `a` constants and `R` the variable. Now I want to use the outputformula for a new calculation. But Mathematica does not understand that `(R^3)^(1/3)` is the same as `R`. So I don't get (correct) answers by using this formula. But when I replace `(R^3)^(1/3)` manually in the outputformula by `R`, then it works perfecty. My question is how I can manage that mathematica understands automatically `(R^3)^(1/3)`? I have already tried formulas like `Simplify`, `FullSimplify`, `Collect` and much more formulas like that.
