I was doing some fitting with Mathematica7 using NonlinearModelFit. It's quite long the program to do the fit and that's why I am not displaying here ... It goes ok, and I can get the fit parameters as well as the covariance matrix               In[81]:= {Subscript[a, 0], Subscript[a, 1]}/.fitCCBA34["BestFitParameters"]          In[78]:= fitCCBA34["CovarianceMatrix"]      When testing it is Symmetric, it goes ok, as should be by construction of the matrix:               In[80]:= SymmetricMatrixQ[b]      Out[80]= True      However, it turns out, that, when trying to get some Multinormal distribution of the parameters, it complains about the matrix which is non-symmetric ...               In[84]:= MultinormalDistribution[{Subscript[a, 0], Subscript[a,         1]} /. fitCCBA34[        "BestFitParameters"], {{fitCCBA34["CovarianceMatrix"][[1, 1]],         fitCCBA34["CovarianceMatrix"][[1, 2]]}, {fitCCBA34[          "CovarianceMatrix"][[2, 1]],         fitCCBA34["CovarianceMatrix"][[2, 2]]}}]          During evaluation of In[84]:= MultinormalDistribution::cmsym: The covariance matrix must be symmetric. >>          Out[84]= MultinormalDistribution[{0.275723,        0.246948}, {{0.00001521, -0.0000535383}, {-0.0000535383, 11.6061}}]      Of course, if now you do copy paste, it works perfectly, so I guess it's some numerical issue, any clue about how to fix this? I need to encode this inside a function rather than copy paste each time ... Thanks in advance!
