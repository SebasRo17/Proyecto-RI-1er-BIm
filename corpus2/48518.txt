I'm having problems using `FullSimplify` to simplify a differential equation. The expression is simplifying just as I would like when I express a variable `c` as a function, but not when I leave it by itself. It boils down to this:               FullSimplify[       1 - (4 H n (c[x]^(-1 + 2 n)) )/(K^n + c[x]^n)^2 + (4 H n (c[x]^(-1 + n)))/(K^n + c[x]^n)]      Gives the expected output: > >     1 + (4 H K^n n c[x]^(-1 + n))/(K^n + c[x]^n)^2 >   However, when I replace `c[x]` with just `c`, the output changes completely and refuses to simplify. The output then is: > >     (c^(1 + 2 n) + c K^(2 n) + 2 c^n K^n (c + 2 H n))/(c (c^n + K^n)^2) >   I don't understand why _Mathematica_ is behaving inconsistently, or what I am doing wrong. I've tried adding assumptions about `c`, using things like `Part`, and searching the web to no avail. Can anyone help?
