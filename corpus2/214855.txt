With the new CSS 3 and HTML 5 technology, web applications have gained a lot of new tools for a better UI (user interface) interaction, beautiful templates and even responsive layout to fit into tablets and smartphones. Within a corporate environment, those new technologies are required so the company can "follow" the IT evolution and their concurrent, but they also want that those new web applications supports old browsers. How should I deal with this situation? By one side we are asked to follow the the evolution of technology, create responsive layouts and use a lot of cool jQuery plugins. On the other hand, we are asked to support old browsers that do not support those new responsive features, plugins or components.   * I would like advice and strategies on how to create "modern" web applications that are also supported on old browsers.   * How does your company deal with this situation?   * Is it possible to have the same web application run well and beautifully on old browsers, and be responsive and interactive on newer browsers?
