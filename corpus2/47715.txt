A Thue equation is a 2-variable homogeneous integer polynomial of degree at least 3. It's well-known that such equations have only finitely many solutions over the integers. I'm trying to solve some simple Thue equations with `Reduce` but Mathematica is having trouble (no error, it just runs 'forever', or at least hours). Here's an example I pulled from a test suite:               toSym[P_] := Simplify[y^Exponent[P, x]*P /. x -> (x/y)]     thue[P_, a_Integer] := Simplify[Reduce[toSym[P] == a, {x, y}, Integers]]     thue[x^4 - 13*x^3 - 172*x^2 - 13*x + 1, 9]      I can broaden the scope, asking for rational solutions, in which case it gives > (((x > Root[-20736 - 78978339 #1^4 - 16932890540 #1^8 + 2346433600 #1^12 &, > 2] || x < Root[-20736 - 78978339 #1^4 - 16932890540 #1^8 + 2346433600 #1^12 > &, 1] || Root[-20736 - 78978339 #1^4 - 16932890540 #1^8 + 2346433600 #1^12 > &, 1] < x < Root[-20736 - 78978339 #1^4 - 16932890540 #1^8 + 2346433600 > #1^12 &, 2]) && (y == Root[-9 + x^4 - 13 x^3 #1 - 172 x^2 #1^2 - 13 x #1^3 + > #1^4 &, 1] || y == Root[-9 + x^4 - 13 x^3 #1 - 172 x^2 #1^2 - 13 x #1^3 + > #1^4 &, 2])) || ((x > Root[-20736 - 78978339 #1^4 - 16932890540 #1^8 + > 2346433600 #1^12 &, 2] || x < Root[-20736 - 78978339 #1^4 - 16932890540 #1^8 > + 2346433600 #1^12 &, 1]) && (y == Root[-9 + x^4 - 13 x^3 #1 - 172 x^2 #1^2 > - 13 x #1^3 + #1^4 &, 3] || y == Root[-9 + x^4 - 13 x^3 #1 - 172 x^2 #1^2 - > 13 x #1^3 + #1^4 &, 4]))) && (x | y) [Element] Rationals but this isn't a solution -- it doesn't find whether the polynomials have the indicated rational roots or not. In any case I'm actually interested only in the integral solutions. Any ideas? Edit: I see in Some Notes on Internal Implementation that Mathematica implements the Tzanakis-de Weger algorithm for Thue equations. Can we trace the behavior of the functions to see if this is being called internally with some sort of `Unprotect` scheme? Edit 2: I don't think this should take so long to solve -- other systems can solve it in under a second. But I'd like to do this in Mathematica if possible. I suspect that the problem is that Mathematica is stuck on some aspect of the problem not being given to it in the desired format rather than a lack of ability on its part.
