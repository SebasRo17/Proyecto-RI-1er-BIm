I've just started working on an existing application that uses an LDAP directory service as its object store instead of a database. Many of my coworkers have been commenting how an application should never use a directory service instead of a database as its object store. I've got to work on it regardless, and won't be able to change it from LDAP to a database anytime soon. That said, my coworkers comments brings up the question in my mind: _Why is it bad to use a directory provider instead of a database as an object store?_ Could there ever be cases where this would not only acceptable, but even better than using a database?
