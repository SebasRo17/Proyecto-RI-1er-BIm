I want to make the linear stability analyis of a nonlinear system of PDEs. So for example then I want to plot what happens to the amplitudes of the modes. To do that I need to solve my equations with different initial conditions, which can be parametrised by the wavelenght $k$. There's what I do, but doesn't seem to work. I write down the equations               eqn1[λ_, ω_, v_, α_, δ_, σ_, A_] := **Something**     eqn2[λ_, ω_, v_, α_, δ_, σ_, A_] := **Something**      I prepare the parametrisation (I would like to put my different solutions - functions of $x,t$ - in the arrays SolVec1,2; and my different maximums - functions only of $t$ - in the arrays MaxVec1,2) :               SolVec1 = Table[0, {i, Nk}]; SolVec2 = Table[0, {i, Nk}];     MaxVec1 = Table[0, {i, Nk}]; MaxVec2 = Table[0, {i, Nk}];          Initial[x_, kk_] := {0.01*Sin[2 Pi kk*x / L], 1 - 0.01 Cos[2 Pi kk*x / L]/L};          Max1[sol_, t_] := First[Maximize[sol[x, t], 0 <= x <= L, x]];      I call NDSolve inside a loop on $k$:               Nk=3;          For[kk = 1, kk <= Nk, kk + 1,            sol1 = {θ, ϕ} /. First[NDSolve[{       eqn1[0.1, 0.13, 0.1, 0.08, 0.3, 0, 0] == 0,       eqn2[0.1, 0.13, 0.1, 0.08, 0.3, 0, 0] == 0,         **HERE, BOUNDARY CONDITIONS, I DO NOT WRITE THEM FOR SIMPLICITY**      θ[x, 0] == First[Initial[x, kk]],       ϕ[x, 0] == Last[Initial[x, kk]]}, {θ, ϕ}, {x,        0, L}, {t, 0, T}, AccuracyGoal -> 5, PrecisionGoal -> 4,       MaxSteps -> 200000]];           SolVec1[[kk]] = sol1[[1]];      SolVec2[[kk]] = sol1[[2]];           MaxVec1[[kk]]=Max1[sol1[[1]],t];      MaxVec2[[kk]]=Max1[sol1[[2]],t];          ]      Where I filled the various arrays. First question >> This doesn't work, it gets stuck in the loop. Why? Second question >> I would like to plot the different solutions (which will be saved in SolVec1,2) on the same graph, with different colors. For example for the different initial conditions:               Plot[{SolVec1[[n]][x, 0]}, {n, 1, Nk}, {x, 0, L}, PlotRange -> All]      does this make any sense? How could I do otherwise?
