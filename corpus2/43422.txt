![Screen Shot of my Mathematica Commands](http://i.stack.imgur.com/focjn.png) I was using RandomSample with very skewed weights. I am asking for a random sample of 6 numbers 1 through 100 without replacement. In the screen shown, the weights for 1 through 6 are 100 000, with all others less then 1; hence, the RandomSample should return numbers 1 through 6 is a random order very very often. But it does not. I have copied and pasted the commands shown. Am I missing something? Or am I misunderstanding the RandomSample function? Or is this actually a bug?
