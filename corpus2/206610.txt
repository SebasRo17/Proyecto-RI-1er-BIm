To illustrate the question, let's say we have two programmers of comparable skill that both solve the same problem. The code they turn out has roughly the same lines of code, but one programmer uses 5 classes while another programmer uses 20. Both sets of code get comparable wtfs per minute in code review, implying that the code is not hard to follow and doesn't do anything silly. Is the code with 20 classes more complex than the code that utilizes 5?
