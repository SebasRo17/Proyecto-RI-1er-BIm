I'd been doing my own convolutions of distributions for some calculations, decided to use built-ins. With               p5 = TransformedDistribution[py + pz,        {Distributed[py, BinomialDistribution[7, .2]],         Distributed[pz, BinomialDistribution[7, .3]]}]          PDF[p5, 5]      getting the PDF takes an inordinate amount of time (as in 30+ seconds on the laptop I'm on at the moment, faster on my real machines of course, but still slow.) I'm guessing it is using `DiscreteConvolve` under the covers, which is itself inordinately slow IMO, but I'm pondering if I'm missing something obvious in the use of `TransformedDistribution`. Any ideas (or explanations) for the slowness appreciated.
