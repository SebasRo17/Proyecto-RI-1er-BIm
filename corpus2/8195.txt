Apologies if this is outside of the realm of Mathematica -- I'm still trying to figure out the limits of how expressive Mathematica is (and how much of my work can be automated). Suppose I define the following:               f[1] = x     f[n_] = x * f[n-1]      Then, I want to ask:               for integral k>1, what is the degree of f[k] ?      so for example, I want to write a function:               degreeOf[f, k] = k      Now, I know that in this above example, given that we know how f is defined, it's trivial that degreeOf[f, k] = k. However, is it possible to write generic degreeOf ? In a sense, I'm curious if the "computational" part of mathematica -- it's ability to handle symbols and do substitutions + simplifications -- or if it can reason about them at a deeper level. Thanks!
