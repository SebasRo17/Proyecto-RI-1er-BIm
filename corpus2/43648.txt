I have just bought _Mathematica_ and I'm in the process of plowing through Shifrin's great book. On page 74 the function `oddSublists` doesn't give me the expected output. Since I'm a true beginner, I of course suspect mistakes on my behalf. I get: `{{}, {, 2}, {, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}}` However the function `oddSublistsNew` gives me the expected output.`{{1}, {1, 2}, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}}` Anyone had similar experience? And here is the code I forgot to include:               Clear[oddSublists];     oddSublists[x_List] :=       Part[x, Union[        Flatten[Cases[          Map[First,            Split[Position[x, _?OddQ], First[#1] == First[#2] &], {2}],            y_List /; OddQ[Length[y]]]]]]
