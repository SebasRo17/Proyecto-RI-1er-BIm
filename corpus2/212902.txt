Here's something I keep struggling to figure out the best solution to. I've had this problem while working with PHP and Java so it's a fundamental understanding of OOP issue. Examples are in PHP. Let's say I have a few object's here. Song, Artist, ArtistProfile, User. So in some instances I want the ArtistProfile and an array of User objects (subscribers) when I call the Artist (e.g. the artist's profile page), in other instances I only want the Artist info, like when viewing a page of the song. Should I be nesting one object as part of another or should I be creating more specific objects for different usages. Option 1: Nested               Class Song {        private $songId;        private $songName;        private $year;        private $Artist; //Artist object     }          Class Artist {        private $artistId;        private $name;        private $age;        private $subscriberArr; //Array of User objects which then have more nested objects such as a Role object, Profile object        private $profile; //Profile object which could also have more nested objects     }          Class User {        private $userId;        private $name;        private $age;        private $role; //Role object        private $profile; //UserProfile object     }      Option 2: Build more objects               Class Song {        private $songId;        private $songName;        private $year;        private $artistId;     }          Class Artist {        private $artistId;        private $age;        private $name;     }          Class User {        private $userId;        private $name;        private $age;        private $roleId;     }          Class SongWithArtist {        private $song; //Basic Song object        private $artist; //Basic Artist object     }          Class ArtistWithProfile {        private $artist; //Basic artist object        private $profile; //Profile object        private $subscriberArr; //UserDisplay object containing basic User object     }           Class UserWithProfile {}      Option 1 means wasting a lot of time/resources grabbing information I may not need for that page but easier to manage. Option 2 is messy and requires keeping track of which object is what but faster and far less db calls. Which is the 'correct' option and/or is there a 3rd correct option?
