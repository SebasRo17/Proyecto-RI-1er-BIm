I am trying to extract variable names from a list of transformation rules `mapping = {var1 -> 'val1', var2 -> 'val2' }`. Variables `var1` and `var2` are already defined in my notebook: ` var1 = 'init-val1'; var2 = 'init-val2'; ` When I try to evaluate `Extract[mapping, {1,1}, HoldForm]`, I get `'init- val1'`, instead of `var1`. What am I doing wrong? Why is `var1` getting evaluated despite the explicit `HoldForm` wrapper? How can I fix the problem?
