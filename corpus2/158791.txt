My question involves setting up a Software Development process. If you came in to an existing project that had no formal methodology or process set up, and then were asked to set one up yourself, how would you handle it? I have looked into various methodologies like Agile, or subsets thereof like XP, but these are primarily aimed at how to set up new projects. I am rather unsure how to implement them into an existing project. Also, many of these are aimed at web or desktop applications. My software project is an embedded system, so while many aspects of them are applicable, it is a bit overwhelming trying to figure out which one to use and how to convert it for use in an embedded system. Unit testing on embedded hardware (especially with a Single Board Computer for which no simulator exists) is incredibly difficult, particularly if the software is very far along, and to add a hardware abstraction layer to aid unit testing would involve tearing up the code dramatically. What tips would you have for setting up a Software Development Process for an existing project, for a programmer that knows how to program, but is new to software development process management?
