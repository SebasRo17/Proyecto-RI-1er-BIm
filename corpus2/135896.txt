I graduated with my BS in CS, June 2009 and then took a job near school which they told me would be web site maintenance. It was actually web-based customer service with a small amount of working on the company site. After about six months I got super bored with it and decided to move back home. I was desperate for a job so I could pay rent and start paying off my student loans. After six months of looking I found my current job where I've been for about a year an a half. My current boss also promised me the job would be company website development and maintenance but I ended up getting railroaded into doing customer service again. I just found out that my boss is having a website developed by a friend which I guess I will be asked to keep updated. I'm really unhappy in my job and I feel like my education is totally going to waste. I can't seem to find any job listings for CS degree students who don't have software development employment experience. And now that it's been three years since I graduated and I'm still not in the field it seems like that makes me look really bad to employers. I was offered an internship at a software company about a year ago but my fiance' asked me to turn it down because it would have been unpaid and we were running out of money. My current job takes up so much of my time and energy and leaves me so drained that I have a hard time working on projects at home or even finding the time to apply for new jobs. So, my question is two fold:   1. how do I get past the stigma of not having been working in the industry since I graduated and    2. how do I find a CS job in the small amount of time I have. Posting resumes and applying to job postings online, writing cover letter after cover letter seems useless.
