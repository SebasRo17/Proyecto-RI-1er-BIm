I'm in the very early stages of writing an application to mine through Twitter data looking for certain types of information. I've been using Twitterizer, which I have found effective in downloading the information (it provides interfaces to the "old" REST based API, and the newer streaming one). This would only be for personal use, so I don't think I would max out the number of API calls per hour on the old API, and it seems as though the streaming API is slightly slower. On the surface, it seems like the REST would suit me better, but I'm wondering if I'm missing any hidden advantages to using the streaming API that could benefit my application.
