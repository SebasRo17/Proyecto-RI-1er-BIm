This is more of a philosophical question, I suppose, but it seems quite well suited to here, to me. I'm a 20-year-old, second year software engineering student, with a good history in development, working for a software development/consultancy when I'm not studying etc etc etc All through my first year I found myself helping and explaining things to my peers when it came to programming and general software development stuff - data structures, common/important algorithms and the like. I can think of one or two pros to what I'm doing but I feel like I shouldn't have been helping, in case I end up confusing people or passing on bad practices. It bugged me at the time, but I never thought to ask. So: **should I be helping?** Thanks
