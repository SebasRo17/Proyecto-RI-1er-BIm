When refering to a users stuff should you use _My_ or _Your_ , for example: > My Cart | My Account | My Wishlist Or > Your Cart | Your Account | Your Wishlist I found this article that argues for the use of _your_. It says flikr does this. It also says MySpace and MyYahoo are wrong. I also noticed today that Amazon uses the term _Your_. However, I have heard they are the masters at testing variations and finding the best one, so what you see on their site might be the best variation, or simply something they are currently testing. I personally like the way _my_ looks better, but thats just my opinion. What do you think? What will hever the better impact on customers? Does it really even matter?
