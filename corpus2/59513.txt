I'm interested on how to count the number of real roots of a random polynomials in an instant, how to put the result in a table and how to plot it in a graph.I generated 1 million random polynomials following Gaussian Distribution with mean 0 and variance 1. I used this command               r:=GaussianDistribution[0,1]     y=randompol[n_,i_]:=Sum[r x^{j},{j,0,n}]     Solve[y==0,x]     CountRoots[y,x]      But the command Countroots does not apply for it says that the above generated random polynomials is not univariate. But it seems awkward that when I manually paste the generated random polynomial to the CountRoots command instead of using link, it works! But I want to do it in 1 million random polynomials and it is not practical for me to do so. I already used `y//Tableform` and `Remove[{}]` because I thought that the problem is braces since the random polynomials generated using this command `y=randompol[n_,i_]:=Sum[r x^{j},{j,0,n}]` is inside a brace while the `CountRoots` command does not require braces, but i Failed and it did not work. please help me...
