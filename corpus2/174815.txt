> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  What are the key differences between software engineers and programmers? I am a software company owner for 8 years now. After years of operation I figured out that all the while what I was doing was a software engineer's job. There are several questions in my mind that I want to ask from you guys. I know that answers will be subjective. As a software engineer, do you really need to be a seasoned programmer? Is it true that software engineers don't code but just make diagrams, functional specs. and othe related documents? I also noticed that there are no SE standards or board exams to pass and its really a dynamic and situational job. So basically I can just proclaim myself as a software engineer based on experience and product?
