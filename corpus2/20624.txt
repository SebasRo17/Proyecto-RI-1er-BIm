I'm planning to develop a web based ERP, which should be full-ajax and with desktop-like UI. It will be a data-entry & data-report application. For developing it I'm considering all technologies. GWT: I saw that with GWT Designer you could create cool UIs, but databinding seems to be too complex JSF: Netbeans no longer supports the visual web editor ZK: supports databinding in a relatively easy way, and has got an Eclipse- based visual editor Some people talk about REST + javascript as a winning choice I'd like to have your opinion about what could be the right choice. Thank you very much in advance!
