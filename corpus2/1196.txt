I would like to create randomly oriented planes. This is how I'm attempting to do that:   1. I create a 2 random unit vectors, $\mathbf{v}_1$, and $\mathbf{v}_2$, in the $x$-$y$ plane   2. I assume that if I rotate these two vectors around a random vector (in $x$-$y$-$z$) called $\mathbf n$, the plane on which the two vectors lie is random and uniformly distributed over the sphere.    3. So I randomly pick $\mathbf n$, keeping in mind the issues of random point picking on spheres.   4. I then use `RotationMatrix[Î±, n].v1` (and same for `v2`) to get the new vectors on the rotated and supposedly random plane. There is some question on what to choose for the angle $\alpha$ which gives the angle of the rotation.      * If I choose $\alpha<\pi/2$, the vectors do not encompass the entire sphere.      * If I choose $\alpha=\pi/2$, I get a bunching of vectors at the poles.      * If I choose $\alpha>\pi/2$, there is bunching at various latitudes. I cannot get a uniformly random distribution over the sphere! Is there a fix to the current method I am implementing? Is there another way to do it? * * * My real goal here isn't creating random planes. My goal is to take two vectors with some arbitrary magnitude and direction in $x$-$y$ and then randomly orient them over the sphere while maintaining their relative positions with respect to one another. The steps I have taken above seem like the logical way to do that.
