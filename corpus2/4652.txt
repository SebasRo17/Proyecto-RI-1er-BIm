I'm writing this fairly simple function:               hermite[0, x] = 1;     hermite[1, x] = 2 x;     hermite[n_, x_] := (       hermite[n, x] = 2 x*hermite[n - 1, x] - 2 (n - 1) hermite[n - 2, x];       Expand[hermite[n, x]]       )      But the `Expand` command is ignored. Yet, when I do               Expand[hermite[10, x]]      The result is expanded like I wish. Why is it not working when I put the same command inside a function? I'd like to do it in the function; it would be cleaner.
