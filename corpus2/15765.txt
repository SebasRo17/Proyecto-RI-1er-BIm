I want to draw a tree plot for Euler totient function for this question like the following: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/N64Zx.jpg) I generate the EulerPhi for first 20 numbers into a list:               list = Map[# -> EulerPhi[#] &, Range[2, 20]]      Then I plot it using this:               TreePlot[list, Bottom, 1, VertexLabeling -> True,  DirectedEdges -> True ]      And the output: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bsM9R.jpg) But I want the layout of tree become like the above one so that numbers of form $2^n$ are centered and branches to the left or right. How can I do this? By manually editing the graph the output looks like the following ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zpmip.jpg) **Updated** I've managed to centralize the powers of $2$ but now the branches aren't placed well.               y = 0; coordinates =       Map[First[#] -> {0, y++} &,       Select[Prepend[list, 1 -> {0, 0}], IntegerQ[Log[2, First[#]]] &]]          {1 -> {0, 0}, 2 -> {0, 1}, 4 -> {0, 2}, 8 -> {0, 3}, 16 -> {0, 4}}      and using `GraphPlot`:               GraphPlot[list, VertexLabeling -> True, DirectedEdges -> True,         VertexCoordinateRules -> coordinates]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3vEvt.jpg) Now, If the branches are placed upper than the root, then the result would be OK.
