I am having trouble with maximizing a function I am interested in. Below is the code I am using.               NMaximize[{(p^2)^alpha + ((c - p)^2)^alpha + (1 - (c - p)^2 - p^2)^alpha,        {c/2 - Sqrt[2 - c^2]/2 < p, p < c/2 + Sqrt[2 - c^2]/2, c == 1.2, alpha == 0.7}}, {p}]      I get the following error: > NMaximize::bcons: "The following constraints are not valid: {alpha == 0.7, c > == 1.2, c/2 - Sqrt[2 - c^2]/2 < p, p < c/2 + Sqrt[2 - c^2]/2}. Constraints > should be equalities, inequalities, or domain specifications involving the > variables." Why is this happening?
