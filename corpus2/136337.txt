I'm working on an iPhone application and I created a component diagram. I defined interfaces for each component. For example I have an AI component and I have made some interfaces for it. How should I carry on? Should I create a class diagram to go into details, should I go into details of each interface or should I just start implementing my interfaces? I am a bit confused on how to proceed.
