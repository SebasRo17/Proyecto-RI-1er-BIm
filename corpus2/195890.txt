I've been thinking about creating a class that handles importing and exporting of data, and I feel that naming it FooImporterExporter might look too long, I wan't to see if there's a name convention that I could use to name it. These are some of the names I think would be appropriate:   * `FooProcessor`   * `FooPorter` / `FooPort` \- ( as Import/Export comes from trading goods in a Port )   * `FooTrader`
