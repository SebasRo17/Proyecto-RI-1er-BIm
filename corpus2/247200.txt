bool? example = null;      is actually               Nullable<System.Boolean> example = null;      Now for the `bool` to `System.Boolean` conversion or actually compile-time replacement:   We ususally hardly care, as it is very obvious. I even think I _never_ used `System.Int32` or anything. However:   The conversion into a `Nullable<T>` through appending a `?`, that is something not so common. It is not custom to VS(#devel does it too) and my guess is that it is some secret magic in the compliler. My question is:   Are there more of these " _Conversions_ " / typing shortcuts available in `.NET / C#`?   I do NOT mean keyboard shortcuts.   A term to google for or something similar migth be best.
