Say I have a mobile application that allows users to enter information which is then uploaded to a central location. I had planned on building this using only HTML5 and javascript (non-native app), but I'm assuming if someone is in an area where there is no service they simply will not be able to use the app. As a work around would it be possible to write a native app that saves the information on the device and then uploads it whenever service returns? If so, is it possible to write a native app entirely in HTML5 and Javascript that does this?
