I have this GPL project, it got stuck for like a year, I really like the idea, then somebody fork it and changed the whole thing but used the same name, I don't mind for the code (it was GPL after all) but I like the name. What's the etiquette for this kind of situation? The project will benefit myself, and I like it, however the name wasn't for sale.. EDIT: I know if I contact the author he'll understand and change the name, but I have no time to work on that project right now, so I don't want to be a "name troll" for my folks (small community), so I'll let it be this time, my question is more about the etiquette of forking. If the project is apparently abandoned can they fork and use the same name or they MUST get a new name?
