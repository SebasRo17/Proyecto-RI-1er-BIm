Suppose I have a `Pane` containing some dynamic text, for example that is being updated by a logging function.               Pane[Dynamic[logText],       Scrollbars -> {False, True},       ImageSize -> {Full, 200},       ScrollPosition -> {0, 10000000}]      I want this pane to remain scrolled to the bottom so that I can always see the last line of text. I tried setting `ScrollPosition -> {0, Infinity}` (or to `{0, Full}`, or to `{0, All}`), which would be a possible interface to achieve this, but neither of these work.
