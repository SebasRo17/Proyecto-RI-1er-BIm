I have a desktop application that sends a POST request to my website every 5 minutes. This post request can contain a variable amount of data about the PC sending the request, but typically it contains about 20-30 variables of information. I'm storing all of this information in a MySQL table in a format like, RequestID|Field|Value. I want to be able to keep all of it so I can run trend reports over 24 hours, 48 hours, weeks, months, years, etc. This could amount so something like 10,000 rows of data every day. That's 3 million rows of data a year. I can imagine 20-30 people using my website and the database storing 100 million rows of data a year. What is the best way to approach this kind of 'notification' service and scale it?
