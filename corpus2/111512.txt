We have a high load SAAS product and due to lack of resources the board has outsouced reporting and OLAP & Warehouse work to a 3rd Party Company. When we started working with them, they accidentally DOS'ed our production system, now they have made too many long running queries on the production databases and slowed the system down to unuseable. They are about to deliver and we have a maintainence contract with them. How do you deal with 3rd companies you can't really trust no to bring your production system down? And what do you do about it when they do? Has anyone any experience of this? (note they have a test environment set up to do everything they need to on). I'm not looking for answers on how to prevent someone bringing down our system, I'm after what to do with the 3rd party company itself.
