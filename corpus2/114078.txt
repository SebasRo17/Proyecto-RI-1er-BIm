> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  VB.Net vs C# debate Are there any actual reasons why company should choose VB.NET over C#? I work for a company which develops medical software and switched from VB6 to VB.NET several years ago. There were two reasons to switch to VB.NET but not to C# at that moment:   1. VB.NET is more similar to VB6 and it should make it easier for developers to switch to .NET world   2. VB.NET had a better support for COM than C# The first reason is not serious as VB6 and VB.NET are two different worlds and there is no significant difference between switching from VB6 to VB.NET or C#. The second reason is not actual after C# 4 release. Our company eventually switched to C# (and yes, we now have modules in VB6, VB.NET and C#; and even some modules in C++) because: 1\. It is easier to find developers in C# 2\. .NET world is C#-oriented: Visual Studio works better with C#, Resharper has better support for C#, etc. I am just curious whether there are still some reasons for company to choose VB.NET over C#.
