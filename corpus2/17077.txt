> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Minimizing a function of many coordinates Suppose that the function $F[\vec{x}]$ computes a certain polynomial of the elements of the list $\vec{x}$. How can I use `Nminimize` or `FindMinimum` to find the vector $\vec{x}$ which minimizes the function $F[\vec{x}]$ ? Edit: I found this question Minimizing a function of many coordinates which asks about the same thing. The answer offered there using arrays, worked for my problem as well.
