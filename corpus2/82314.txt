I'd like to use the VLC's DLL in one of my programs. VLC is under the GPL license. Do I have to redistribute all the sources under GPL or can I redistribute only the modified sources of VLC under these terms while redistributing the rest of my program in the license I want? Thank you, SÃ©bastien **Edit** : And what if I only use the DLL of VLC in case they are installed on the user's computer ?
