How can one plot $f(x,y)$ as a pseudo-univariate function of $x/y$ (or some other composition of these variables) over the domain $a<\frac{x}{y}<b$. `Plot[f,{x/y,a,b}]` produces the following error               Plot::write: Tag Times in x/y is Protected. >>      The alternative is to redefine the function in terms of a single variable (i.e., replace all occurrences of `x/y` with a new variable `z`); however, I wish to avoid tedious manual redefinition if possible. **Edit:** As a simple example, consider the function $$f(x,y) = \frac{y^2}{x^2}\times\exp(x/y)+5\frac{x}{y}.$$ This function could be redefined as $$g(z)=\frac{\exp(z)}{z^2}+5z$$ where $z\equiv x/y$. One could redefine their function $f(x,y)$ as $g(z)$, but it would be more convenient if one could simply plot $f(x,y)$ against $x/y$ as a pseudo- univariate function.
