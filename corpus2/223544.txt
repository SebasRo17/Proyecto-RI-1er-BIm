Let's say I'm developing a web application. My first choice is to use PHP with Fat-Free Framework (F3) and MVC pattern. Next year, I might decide I want to switch to Zend Framework, or maybe even ASP.NET MVC. Does it make sense to try and design my application in such a way that it is loosely coupled to its framework, or is the framework too integral to make this realistic? The only reason I ask is because it came up in conversation with a peer recently, who criticized my pie in the sky idea of loosely coupling my application to F3.
