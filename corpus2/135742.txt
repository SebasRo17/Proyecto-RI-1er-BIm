Apparently, a composite design pattern represents individual entities and collective entities in the same manner. What is the advantage to this? For instance, if I subclass a class, why would I want to treat objects of both classes in the same way? For instance, if 'tuna' is a subclass of 'fish', why would I want to have the same implementations for methods of objects in both classes?
