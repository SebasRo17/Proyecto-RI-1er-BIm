I'm a beginner to Mathematica. I'd read several document. But I still have a problem. For example, every expression in Mathematica are of the form `Head[expr1,expr2,...]` If I type `Plus[3^3,6*9]`, what is the practical order Mathematica interpret?   1. Interpret `Plus` first, and then interpret expr1, expr2,... In other words, from 'outside' to 'inside'   2. Evaluate `Power[3,3]` first, then `Times[6,9]`, after evaluating these, then interpret `Plus` Or there may be other ways Mathematica use? What else should I notice? Thanks for your replying and forgiving my bad English grammar. :-)
