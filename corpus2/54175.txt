I'm not sure this question belongs here, it's not so much I problem I'm having with programming but rather a problem of what to do before I start programming. I want a visual representation of what variables I need and what classes have what methods.I know there is UML but I'm not sure if that is the best way, so what do you guys use before you start programming, which method? I don't want to start a flamewar about what is better just what are several approaches?
