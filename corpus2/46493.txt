I am pretty new to _Mathematica_ and to coding in general. I want to do a very specific thing, but I unable to do it. Please explain in detail how I can make this work. Here's the details on what I am trying to do: I have the following matrix, which included two variables which are lists in themselves, to analyze these lists using loops I want to make a list of lists using a loop so that the OUTPUT of the function will be this:               matrix = {       {{0, 1}, {-b3 - gain11[[1]]/m, -a3 - gain22[[1]]/m}},       {{0, 1}, {-b3 - gain11[[1]]/m, -a3 - gain22[[2]]/m}},       {{0, 1}, {-b3 - gain11[[1]]/m, -a3 - gain22[[3]]/m}},       {{0, 1}, {-b3 - gain11[[2]]/m, -a3 - gain22[[1]]/m}},       {{0, 1}, {-b3 - gain11[[2]]/m, -a3 - gain22[[2]]/m}},       {{0, 1}, {-b3 - gain11[[2]]/m, -a3 - gain22[[3]]/m}},       {{0, 1}, {-b3 - gain11[[3]]/m, -a3 - gain22[[1]]/m}},       {{0, 1}, {-b3 - gain11[[3]]/m, -a3 - gain22[[2]]/m}},       {{0, 1}, {-b3 - gain11[[3]]/m, -a3 - gain22[[3]]/m}}     }      As you may have noticed, it's the same list repeated 9 times, where it fetches data from two lists, from `gain11` and `gain22`, each with three elements, so that all possible combinations have been made. I have tried to use               For[i = 1, i < 4, i++,       For[j = 1, j < 4, j++, {{0, 1}, matrix = {-b3 - gain11[[i]]/m, -a3 - gain22[[j]]/m}}]]      but all that does is overwrite itself. I end up with only the last value. Help would be appreciated.
