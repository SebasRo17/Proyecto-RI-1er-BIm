How could I place a text box on the top of a bar chart where the top line would have a larger font size than the second line? My Data:               totals4={{1093, "AUSTRALIA"}, {235, "BELGIUM"}, {474, "BERMUDA"}, {187, "BRAZIL"}, {103, "BAHAMAS"}};      This code will plot the `PlotLabel->` as a long string. I would like to move " - excludes USA, as of: June 2012" to the second line with a smaller font and not bold. Ideally this text would be within a box, however I would just be happy to get the second line to display correctly.               BarChart[#, ChartStyle -> "DarkRainbow", PlotLabel ->      Style["Entities with LEI Number - excludes USA, as of: June 2012",      Bold, FontSize -> 12],       ChartLabels -> (Placed[     Rotate[Style[#, Black], Pi/3] & /@ #2, {{.7, 0}, {1, 1}}])] & @@     Transpose[totals4]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZUnxK.jpg) I have tried this code but it is not displaying correctly:               BarChart[#, ChartStyle -> "DarkRainbow",                  PlotLabel -> Style[TraditionalForm[Grid[{         {TextCell[                  Row[{"Entities with LEI Number (excludes USA)",             HoldForm[Subscript[a, b]], " As of June 2012"}],            TextJustification -> 1], SpanFromLeft},         }, Frame -> All]       ], FontFamily ._ "Times"],       ChartLabels -> (Placed[       Rotate[Style[#, Black], Pi/3] & /@ #2, {{.7, 0}, {1, 1}}])] & @@      Transpose[totals4]      Any help would be appreciated.
