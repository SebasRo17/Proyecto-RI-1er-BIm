Mathematica has the ability to plot a molecule using the data contained in an XYZ file. This is a simple text file, of which this is an example. The molecule is plotted using the Import command. Entering this:               Import["https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8fde18207e8abc7b770c/raw/8491d99e7fec7cc989fe38548319e09d6910ba02/form_MO_28","XYZ"]      gives this as the output: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4oaFq.jpg) I've been able to put this together with orbital plots, with results like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KpoVU.jpg) But I can only show other plots alongside the molecule plot, I can't modify the molecule. For example, I'd like to make the tubes forming the bonds smaller in diameter. As it is, the plots don't show if there is a single, double, or triple bond. Somewhere in mathematica, there must be a function which takes as its argument the XYZ text and returns the molecule plot. If I could see that function, I could modify it accordingly. Any clue on how to access this function? The documentation for this feature is minimal.
