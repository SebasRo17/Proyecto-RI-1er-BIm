I created a grid `g1` with `Grid[]` and then a separate grid `g2`. `g1` and `g2` have same number of columns. How to put the rows of `g2` at the end of `g1` purely using front-end? I tried to highlight `g2`, Ctrl+C, and move my curser to various positions in `g1` and Ctrl+V. But it always resulted in something not desirable such as the entire `g2` being copied into a cell of `g1`. Any suggestions?
