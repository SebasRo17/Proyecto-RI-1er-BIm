The volume of an $n$-ball (the $(n+1)$-dimensional analogue of a disk) of radius $r$ can be found by the following integral recurrence: $$V_0(r)=2r$$ $$V_n(r)=\int_{-r}^rV_{n-1}\left(\sqrt{r^2-x^2}\right)\ \mathrm{d}x$$ I would like to use Mathematica to compute a few terms of this recurrence (as an exercise. I am aware that an explicit formula exists). The recursive code I came up with was this:               BallVolume[dimension_, radius_] := If[dimension == 0,       2*radius,       Assuming[radius > 0,        Integrate[         BallVolume[dimension - 1, Sqrt[radius^2 - x^2]],         {x, -radius, radius}        ]       ]      ]      Calling `BallVolume[1, r]` works as expected, giving $\pi r^2$, but Mathematica seems to get stuck when evaluating `BallVolume[2, r]`. This doesn't seem to be a problem with its ability to integrate; if I define explicitly `CircleArea[r_] := Pi*r^2`, then `Integrate[CircleArea[Sqrt[r^2 - x^2]], {x, -r, r}]` correctly gives $4 \pi r^3\over 3$. Why does the above code fail for dimensions $3$ and higher?
