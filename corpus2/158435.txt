I don't know whether this should be on programmers - I've been looking at the above three apps over the past few weeks just for myself and I'm in two minds. All three look good, are easy to use, and I came to this conclusion;   * Asana is the easiest to use    * ActiveCollab is the feature rich and easiest flow   * BaseCamp is the best UX / design But I didn't really find my workflow was any more quicker / efficient, in fact it was a bit slower and organized. Is there a realistic place for them in workflow - should programmers use them for themselves, or only when a project manager can take control of it?
