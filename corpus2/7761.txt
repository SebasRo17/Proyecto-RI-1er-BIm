I am optimizing an equation that involves a number of trigonometric functions and `Exp[]`. How do I make sure that all my calculations have an accuracy of 120-200 digits after the decimal point? This includes the accuracy of `Exp[]` and trig functions. To get my point across, here is part of the equation: `z[x_, y_]:= Exp[Sin[60.0*x]] + Sin[50.0*Exp[y]]` Mathematica lets you control `Precision` of computations (which is total number of digits in the number) with two global variables - `$MinPrecision` and `$MaxPrecision`. However, I am not looking for precision.
