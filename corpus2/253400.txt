Consider this screenshot from our development repository: ![Branching](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SXGpq.png) We are relatively new to git, so things are still somewhat confusing. The question at hand: If you take a look at the commits by me at the very top; are confusing to us. Why do I need to merge something if I didn't even branch anything? I commited the `adjust buildpath` commit, and after that, git immediately made me do a merge. but with what? The `invitation` branch is not interesting for me, and I never touched it in any way. Where did this `anonymous` blue branch come from and why? My colleague (blue avatar) only works in the `invitation` branch currently. Can someone explain to me why this is happening in git-layman terms (as I said, we are new to this)?
