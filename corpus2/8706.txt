I have a large Excel .xls file. Miniature version shown below: (formatting should appear as two columns...)               Test1   Test2     75        64     58        85     81        55     64        63     70        94     88        90     78        96     96        98     54        97     75        61      I would like to do some statistical analysis on the file in Mathematica 8.0.4. Additionally I am using Mathematica Link for Excel 3.5. The issue I'm now attempting to address concerns the "headers," or "column labels." I need to tell Mathematica to disregard the headers. I want to use each respective header, however, as the name for the "variable stream" (Mathematica-speak for each column of data.) What might be the best ways of dealing with such headers? ===== Additional edit: The "one-liner" version seems to work just fine. Thank you Vitaliy. Follow-up Question: If the Excel .xls spreadsheet being imported is rather large -- 200 columns, 5000 rows -- will that present a problem with the Mathematica "one-liner" approach Vitaliy has suggested? i.e., memory inadequacy, inability to make subsequent steps? What I mean here is, is it completely okay to import an entire large Excel .xls all at once? Or is it far better to ONLY import "columns" as needed, that will immediately be used in subsequent Mathematica steps? I'd prefer to import all at once -- using Vitaliy's method -- if that's totally acceptable.
