I am a trainee in development sector. My Boss says that i should be an agile programmer. I went through through the net and found some interesting things about agile programming. Being a newbee how should I start with agile? What should be my first step in Agile programming? At present I am in pair programming. But it's not exactly pair programming as I am just watching what my co-developer is doing. I also wish to be an agile developer. Can you suggest a way for me stepwise? I wish to develop myself and also my programming skills.
