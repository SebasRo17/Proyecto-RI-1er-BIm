Through colleagues and exit interviews, I have heard that at my small company I am "responsible" for anywhere from 3-10 times more code than I would be at another job. I'm trying to look for some sort of fuzzy metric that I can use to compare my workload with others in my field. By "code responsibility", I don't mean "I'm the only one who knows area X of the code base" (though sadly, it's often true in a startup environment), but rather am referring to a number like "code_base_size/number_of_developers". Are there any resources I can use to help me more accurately measure my work load than just counting lines of code?
