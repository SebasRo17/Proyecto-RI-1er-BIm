Today I noticed something, I think for the first time. When used inside `Compile` variable values within `Module` (and `Block`) are sequentially shared:               Compile[{}, Module[{a = 7, b = a}, b + 1] ][]      > >     8 >   Compare the behavior outside of `Compile`:               Module[{a = 7, b = a}, b + 1]      > >     1 + a >     * Is this documented behavior or just a happy accident?   * If undocumented can it be relied upon or should this "trick" be avoided?
