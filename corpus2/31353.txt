I have a graph with labels on the edges:               ilGrafo=Graph[{1 <-> 2, 1 <-> 3,        2 <-> 3, 3 <-> 4, 4 <-> 5,        4 <-> 6, 4 <-> 7,        6 <-> 7},       EdgeLabels -> {1 <-> 2 -> "A",         1 <-> 3 -> "B", 2 <-> 3 -> "C",         3 <-> 4 -> "E", 4 <-> 5 -> "E",         4 <-> 6 -> "E", 4 <-> 7 -> "G",         6 <-> 7 -> "H"}]      I would like to obtain the `LineGraph[ilGrafo]` with the corresponding edge name on the vertices, but I am not able to find the way.
