I tried install mathematica 9 on linux. The whole process is fine. After the installation. I type "mathematica", and came up following lines: > > /usr/local/Wolfram/Mathematica/9.0/SystemFiles/FrontEnd/Binaries/Linux-x86-64/Mathematica: > /lib64/tls/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.4' not found (required by > /usr/local/Wolfram/Mathematica/9.0/SystemFiles/Libraries/Linux-x86-64/libML64i3.so) > > > /usr/local/Wolfram/Mathematica/9.0/SystemFiles/FrontEnd/Binaries/Linux-x86-64/Mathematica: > /lib64/tls/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.4' not found (required by > /usr/local/Wolfram/Mathematica/9.0/SystemFiles/Libraries/Linux-x86-64/libQtCore.so.4) It seems that I need to update my Glibc. But I received warnings that update Gilbc is highly risky. What should I do? How to update Glibc safely?? Or should I return to low edition mathematica? my Glibc version is glibc-2.3.4-2.39. Which edition of mathematica can I install?
