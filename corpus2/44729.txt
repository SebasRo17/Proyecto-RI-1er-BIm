I have a list of sublists. One element of each sublist is a string element. For example:               list = {{1, "banana", 3}, {3, "orange", 1}, {2, "apple", 2}};      When I sort by the first element of each sublist, an integer, I receive the results that I was looking for.               In[]=  Sort[list, #1[[1]] < #2[[1]] &]     Out[]= {{1, "banana", 3}, {2, "apple", 2}, {3, "orange", 1}}      Same for when I sort by the third element of each sublist, an integer again.               In[]=  Sort[list, #1[[3]] < #2[[3]] &]     Out[]= {{3, "orange", 1}, {2, "apple", 2}, {1, "banana", 3}}      Now, when I sort by the second element of each sublist, a string, I see results that are unexpected.               In[]=  Sort[list, #1[[2]] < #2[[2]] &]     Out[]= {{1, "banana", 3}, {3, "orange", 1}, {2, "apple", 2}}     expected: {{2, "apple", 2}, {1, "banana", 3}, {3, "orange", 1}}      I tried with `Order`, same unexpected result.               In[]=  Sort[list, Order[#1[[2]], #2[[2]]] &]     Out[]= {{1, "banana", 3}, {3, "orange", 1}, {2, "apple", 2}}
