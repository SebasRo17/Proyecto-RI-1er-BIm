I tried to build a simple 'blink comparator' - where you can click on an image repeatedly to switch between two similar images. (An old-fashioned notion in the days of powerful image processing software, it's true.) I think the problem with what I've done so far is the behaviour of the symbols inside a `DynamicModule`:               image1 = Thumbnail[ExampleData[{"TestImage", "Mandrill"}], 300];     image2 = Thumbnail[        ColorNegate[ExampleData[{"TestImage", "Mandrill"}]], 300];     DynamicModule[{imageList = {image1, image2}},      EventHandler[       Show[        First[imageList],        Graphics[         {          Text[           Style[            "name of First[imageList]]?",             14, White],           ImageDimensions[First[imageList]]/2]          }         ]],       {"MouseDown" :>          {          RotateLeft[imageList],          Beep[]          }        }]]      ![gratuitous mandrill picture](http://i.stack.imgur.com/75B9K.png) The `Beep` confirms the `EventHandler` action, but the image doesn't change.
