There are so many programmers out there who are also an expert at Query writing and Database design. Should this be a core requirement to be an expert programmer or software engineer? Though there are lots of similarities in the way queries and codes are developed, my personal opinion is, **Queries** seem to have a different _Structure_ than **Code** and it can be tough to Master both simultaneously due to the different approaches.
