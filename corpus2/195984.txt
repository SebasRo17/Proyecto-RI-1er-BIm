Given branch prediction, and also the effect of compiler optimizations, which code tends to offer superior performance? Note that bRareExceptionPresent represents an uncommon condition. It is not the normal path of logic.               /* MOST COMMON path must branch around exception if */          bool SomeFunction(bool bRareExceptionPresent)     {       // abort before function       if(bRareExceptionPresent)       {          return false;       }           .. function primary body ..           return true;     }          /* MOST COMMON path does NOT branch */          bool SomeFunction(bool bRareExceptionPresent)     {       if(!bRareExceptionPresent)       {         .. function primary body ..       }       else       {         return false;       }       return true;     }
