Is it standard practice when setting up a Continuous Integration server to build a Debug and Release version of each project? Most of the time developers code with a Debug mode project configuration set enabled and there could be different library path configurations, compiler defines, or other items configured differently between Debug/Release that would cause them to act differently. I configured my CI server to build both Debug & Release of each project and I'm wondering if I'm just overthinking it. My assumption is that I'll do this as long as I can get quick feedback and once that happens, then push the Release off to a nightly build perhaps. Is there a 'standard' way of approaching this?
