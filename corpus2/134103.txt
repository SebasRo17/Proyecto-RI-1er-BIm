I work as an analyst for a financial institution, which, due to data sensitivity, will not store any data in the cloud. However, I'm having some success getting my team to use Git for code management. I was wondering whether there was any way to implement Github-like pull requests in our own server. The specific feature I'm interested in is the ability to submit a changeset _for comments_ , without actually having it merged into a given branch. I like the workflow of (1) submit changes, (2) have changes reviewed and commented on, and (3) either accept the commit or reject it. Can this be implemented (even better, can this be _easily_ implemented) on our own servers?
