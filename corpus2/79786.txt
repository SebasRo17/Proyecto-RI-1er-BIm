Non-technical people tend to say the word module instead of feature. But I always get annoyed if someone tells me to write a module when what they really want is a feature. In my opinion a module is more than just a feature. A module has no strong dependencies to the application. The application works without the need for any modules. This is why I get angry if someone wants me to write a module because it is not easy to write modular applications. It requires architecting. A feature can be a module or not to be. So I always prefer to understand module as a feature if a non-programmer asks it of me. What do you understand if someone wants a module? What is module in programming terms?
