I recently stumbled across a company that has created what appears to be a computer vision technology that is capable of detecting shoplifting automatically and alert its users. LINK Watching some of the videos and examples provided by the company has left me completely baffled and amazed as to how on earth they may have achieved this functionality. I understand that no-one here will be able to tell me exactly how this may have been achieved but is anyone aware - and could point me to - research in this field or alternatively perhaps provide details as to how something like this could be implemented or guidance of where one might start? My understanding was the computer vision algorithms were many years away from being this sophisticated. Is this sort of application really possible? Anyone willing to hazard a guess at how they achieved this?
