I've been developing applications in **C#** / **VB.NET** for about 3-4 years ( **.NET Framework** v2.0, 3.5, 4). I have also developed some command-line applications or scripts in C, and Python under Linux. Sometimes I need to develop my applications in another languages, like **Python** , but the ~~problem~~ thing is that lots of those applications require a GUI. Maybe not a too complex one, but it does require some windows with _buttons_ , _text boxes_ , _list boxes_ ,... What books/tips/tutorials do you suggest me to start working with that language and be able to deploy my deliverables not only in **.NET**? **Note:**   Learning python is not the big deal here, because I already know the basic of it. I just want to focus on the GUI. _Maybe this question should be onUI instead of here? If so, please, migrate it :)_
