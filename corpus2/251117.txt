I am fairly new to code review, but I have been coding for years during my PhD - which doesn't always make you a good programmer! If the reviewer changes your code and goes through it with you line-by-line, what do you do if you disagree? Sometimes you made choice X and the reviewer changes it to Y, and you had Y in your mind but decided not to do it because of the disadvantages, but the reviewer asserts that those disadvantages are not important. Should you verbalise your disagreement, or just not and listen to them? Its difficult if you are not good at accepting criticism, and if the reviewer is a more senior person in the organisation. It would not be good to come across as too defensive.
