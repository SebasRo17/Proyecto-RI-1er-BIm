I want to create a table of replacement rules.               g[a_, b_] := a -> b          t1 = Table[10 i + j, {i, 5}, {j, 3}]     t2 =  Table[ i + j, {i, 5}, {j, 3}]           g[  # & @@@ t1, # & @@@ t2 ]      The correct output is below:               {{11 -> 2, 12 -> 3, 13 -> 4},      {21 -> 3, 22 -> 4, 23 -> 5},      {31 -> 4, 32 -> 5, 33 -> 6},      {41 -> 5, 42 -> 6, 43 -> 7},      {51 -> 6, 52 -> 7, 53 -> 8}}      Instead I am getting:                 {11, 21, 31, 41, 51} -> {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}      Which shows two concepts I am still trying to wrap my mind around how to accomplish in _Mathematica_. In a 2-d list how to you select each row, and then perform an operation on each element of that row ( in this case take that element and make a rule replacment a -> b). Then iterate through every row.
