Our project uses a user-specific configuration file. This file is currently not in version control, since it is different for each user. The problem is, whenever a developer adds a new module that requires configuration, or changes the name of an existing modules, the other developers get errors because their private configuration files are not updated. To solve the problem, we thought of working with two configuration files: a default/global configuration file that will be in version control and will be updated regularly by each developer that adds a new module, and a private configuration file that will be kept out of version control and will contain only the user-specific changes. However, this still seems like an ad-hoc solution. Can you propose a better solution? What do the professionals do?
