I am trying to use the `Export` command to convert a list of plots into a *.gif file, and the command runs and executes well, but I can't find the file! Where is it supposed to go? Did it even work? Here is my code :                 q[n_, x_] := x (1 + x)^n + x^n;       points = Table[          Map[{Re[#], Im[#]} &,         Flatten[NSolve[q[n, x] == 0, x][[All]] /. Rule -> (#2 &)]], {n, 1, 20}];            Export["domniationrootsstargraph.gif",          Table[ListPlot[points[[i]], PlotRange -> {{-15, 4}, {-10, 10}}], {i, 1, 20, 1}]             ]      Thanks in advance =)
