> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  To branch or not to branch? A co-worker is against branching. I use branching all the time. I put the team onto a basic 3 branch system. I create my own feature branches. Said co-worker tends to have good ideas, follow best practices and I tend to agree with him on many such things. Except this. The successful software shops I've read about: Microsoft, Google, fogcreek all use branching. My co-worker argues that because of the way our shop runs (medical field), branching causes problems. Instead, he says we should create many small project's (*.csproj files) and never work on the same code at the same time. I agree, we have issues with merging. I argue the root cause of these issues are a lack team communication and a lack of knowledge on how to correctly use our source control system to full effect (TFS). I consider his approach to be programming in Silo's and a DLL management nightmare. Are there situations where Branching is a bad idea? Am I wrong?
