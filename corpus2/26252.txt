I am trying to apply `InversePermutation` on a list of sublists of selected permutation elements. First I am trying to see if I am able to reach every element,               temp = {{Cycles[{}]}, {Cycles[{}], Cycles[(12)]}, {Cycles[{}],         Cycles[(13)]}}      So the code I have tried to print all is               k = 1; i = 1; Do[Do[Apply[Print, i], {i, k}], {k, temp}]      which gives $\\{\\}\\{\\}\\{1 2\\}\\{\\}\\{1 3\\}....$ it pics only content of `Cycle`. So, I changed it a bit as,               k = 1; i = 1; Do[Do[Apply[Print, {i}], {i, k}], {k, temp}]      Surprisingly it started to take all the contents with `Cycle` prefix along, giving $\\{\text{Cycles}[\\{\\}]\\}\\\ \left\\{\text{Cycles}[\\{\\}],\text{Cycles}\left[\left( \begin{array}{cc} 1 & 2 \\\ \end{array} \right)\right]\right\\}....$   What I could not understand is that putting `{i}` instead of `i` changed what ?   **Edit:** I am not able to replace this `Print` with `InversePermutation`.It doesn't respond if I replace Print with it. Can someone suggest what I am doing wrong?
