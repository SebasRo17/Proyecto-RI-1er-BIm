I am using yED to build an application flow-chart, and I can't figure out a 'nice' looking way of representing that a GUI's call to spawn a process loops back to the GUI process once it terminates, other than drawing another arrow to the GUI process. Is there a better way of presenting a process looping back to its parent on return/exit other than drawing another arrow back to the parent?
