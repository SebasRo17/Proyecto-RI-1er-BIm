I have a personal project that doesn't have robust testing. I had a bit of TDD going on at the beginning, but it quickly became counterproductive as the project details changed dramatically over time. So a lot of previously written tests have become useless. Now that the project solidified a bit, I dont' think big changes are likely. Should I go back and rewrite those tests for old functionalities or just start fresh and write tests for new functionalities only?
