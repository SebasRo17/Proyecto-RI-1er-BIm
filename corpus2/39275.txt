Here is the bit of code causing me issues:               {DynamicModule[{nothing},       EventHandler[        ActionMenu["Set x", {"x = 1" :> (x = 1;)}, Enabled -> True],        {"MouseClicked" :> (nothing++)}]], Dynamic[x]}      No matter how hard I try to click the `ActionMenu` does not open at all. Removing the `{"MouseClicked" :> (nothing++)}` allows to open the `ActionMenu`:               {DynamicModule[{nothing},       EventHandler[        ActionMenu["Set x", {"x = 1" :> (x = 1;)}, Enabled -> True],        {}]], Dynamic[x]}      The aim of the code would be to `Enable`/`Disable` the `ActionMenu` after `x = 1` is clicked in this example. What am I doing wrong in the first bit of code?
