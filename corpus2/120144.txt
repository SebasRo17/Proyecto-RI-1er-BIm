I have read so many docs about naming conventions, most recommending both Pascal and Camel naming conventions. Well, I agree to this, it's ok. This might not be pleasing to some, but I am just trying to get your opinion on why you name your objects and classes in a certain way. What happened to this type of naming conventions, and/or why are they bad? I want to name a structure, and I prefix it with "struct". My reason is that, with IntelliSense, I see all structures in one place, and anywhere I see the struct prefix, I know it's a "struct":               structPerson     structPosition      another example is the enum, although I may not prefix it with "enum", but maybe with "enm":               enmFruits     enmSex      again my reason is that in IntelliSense, I see all my enumerations in one place. Because .NET has so many built-in data structures, I think this helps me do less searching. Note that I used .NET in this example, but I welcome language agnostic answers.
