Is there an algorithm which I can use in order to generate synonyms for some term (word) in respect of a spam. I am writing a simple spam filter. For example, I set that the app must omit a word "viagra" and press a button which saves this term into a filter database. A script automatically creates synonyms of this word, such as: v.i.a.g.r.a, via_gra, via-gra, and similar. Or I filter a curse, and it generates all the tricks people use to have their curses appear in their comments.
