I am trying to set-up a simple SVN workflow at home. I am new to subversion (and programming) so I have been reading the official PDF documentations but still not sure about how to set-up my repository. I am working mainly with python, bash and rsl (Renderman Shading Language) So I already have a /dev structure on my disk as this: ![/dev structure](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Zy9no.png)   * http://imageshack.us/f/708/devstructure.png/ And I have a /site structure that links to my /dev folder: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/i82P0.png)   * http://imageshack.us/f/651/sitestructure.png/ So obviously starting to use SVN will change this approach that I already have in place. The question is when I am setting-up my SVN repository for the work I do in my /dev folder: **Will I set-up a separate repository for each different programming platform?** and **Where exactly I should be placing my repository?** Thanks.
