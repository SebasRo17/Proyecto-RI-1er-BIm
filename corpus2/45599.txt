First of all: I'm a beginner with _Mathematica_.   1. I'd like to define a function called `Rounding` which does the following:     * if for $x = n+a, n \in \mathbb{N}, a\in [0,1)$ I have $a < 0.5$ then the function should round down to $n$. Otherwise it should round up to $n+1$. I did this:               Rounding[x_] := If[x - Floor[x] < 0.5, Floor[x], Ceiling[x]]      It works.   2. I'd like to create a list `LIST` of random integers and THEN create a `LIST2` which rounds the elements of LIST with my Rounding function.              LIST = Table[RandomInteger[{-10,10}]/2, {i,1,10}]          LIST2 = Table[Round[...]???      I tried choosing each element of `LIST` by using `Part[LIST,{k,1,10}]` but I don't get it.
