I have two questions: `Question #1`: Is there any well known project to **VBify** C? **VBify** here means **to make it as easy as in VB.NET** and to make C well supported in IDE just like VB.NET, i.e. with following features: word completion, function's argument description and everything just as with VB.NET development using Visual Studio. `Question #2`: Is there any well known effort to make C as **RAD (Rapid Application Development)** language?
