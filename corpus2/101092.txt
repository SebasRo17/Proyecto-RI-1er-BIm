I suppose this question is going to be immediately flagged as subjective, but which do you think is better:               double volume(double pressure, double n_moles, double temperature) {       return n_moles * BOLTZMANN_CONSTANT * temperature / pressure;     }      or               double volume(double P, double n, double T) {       return n*R*T/P;     }      **In other words, should functions that implement some equation follow that equation's notation, or should they use more verbose names?**
