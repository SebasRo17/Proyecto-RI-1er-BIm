I have a `Manipulate[ ]` that displays an image with a superimposed `Locator` object. It works fine when I have `SaveDefinitions->False` but when I try to change `False` to `True` the image object changes (and is not displayed correctly). Here's an image which I load in and call `img` ![my tif image](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xKudh.png) The Manipulate is this:                img = Import["http://i.stack.imgur.com/xKudh.png"];      Manipulate[img, {p, Locator}, SaveDefinitions -> False]      If you evaluate this, it displays the image with a locator object in the bottom left. All is well. But if you now evaluate                Manipulate[img, {p, Locator}, SaveDefinitions -> True]      it displays not the image, but a long list of numbers starting with:               Image[{{244,243 ....      In trying to debug, I note that `ImageQ[img]` is `True` after evaluating the first `Manipulate` but is `False` after evaluating the second. This does not occur with all images (I tried a jpeg) but seems to happen with my .tif files (like the one above). _Mathematica_ 9.0.1 Mac OS. I just noticed that when I uploaded the image, it was converted to a .png file. The same (bad) behavior occurs with this file as well.
