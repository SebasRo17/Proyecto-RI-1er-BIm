We are trying to make a decision about if we should create a program in WPF w/ a WCF server, and I was wondering what the current opinions are of WPF. I was looking around online but most of the arguments I saw for/against WPF were dated a year or two ago, and about WPF3.5. I was wondering if those opinions have changed in the past year or two with the release of WPF4.0. Some notes.... The program we are making is for use by a single-company in a controlled enviornment. With the exception of one or two Vista laptops, most users are on Terminal Servers or WindowsXP. It is not media-heavy and doesn't need a pretty UI (although it won't hurt). It needs to be extensible and allow for easy additions later on. Security and Performance are our key concerns. **EDIT** Primary concern about WPF is Support (MS and community), memory/cpu usage on terminal servers, and finding people to work on the project now and maintain it in the future. Some smaller things of concern are lack of library controls, development time, and learning curve. The primary alternative we were considering is ASP.Net/jQuery.
