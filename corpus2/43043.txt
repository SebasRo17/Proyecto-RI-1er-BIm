I'm working through Carl Bender's Mathematical Physics lectures on YouTube (which are great fun), and I'd like _Mathematica_ 's help solving terms in the perturbation series. It would be convenient if expressions like               SeriesCoefficient[Sum[a[n] b^n, {n, 0, ∞}], {b, 0, 3}]      gave `a[3]` as a result. Replacing $\infty$ with an integer greater than 3 is fine, but easy to lose track of in my notes. Is it possible to add an assumption that the series converges, and would that solve my problem? Other solutions? **Edit** For an example of how I hope to use this functionality, consider solving $x^5 + x = 1$ by inserting the perturbation parameter $b$ in front of $x$ (but not $x^5$). I want to apply `SeriesCoefficient` to the result of               x^5 + b x - 1 /. x -> Sum[a[n] b^n, {n, 0, ∞}]      and build up a list of coefficients that equal zero.
