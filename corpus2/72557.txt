I have some experience in object oriented programming languages like c# or ruby. I know how to design a program in object oriented style, how to create classes and objects, and how to define relations between them. I also know some design patterns. How do people write functional programs? How do they start? Are there design patterns for functional languages? Are methodologies like extreme programming or agile development applicable for functional languages?
