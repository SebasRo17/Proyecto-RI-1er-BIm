I have a phone interview with a major Internet company and it is a mostly front-end developer position. If anyone has experience with UI/developer interviews and can give some advice/questions asked etc. that'll be great. Additionally, what resources can be read and reviewed for the following:   * Designing for performance, scalability and availability   * Internet and OS security fundamentals **EDIT:** Now I am told that the interview I am told will be mostly on coding, Data Structures, design questions etc. Anyone?
