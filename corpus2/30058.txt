I have a list of the form:               list = {1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,7,7,7,19,19,19};      Where we can see that there are an ordered set of integer values that repeat themselves some fixed number of times N. Is there a nice one-liner to transform this list into something like:               transformedList = {1,1+1/3,1+2/3,2,2+1/3,2+2/3,3,3+1/3,3+2/3,4,4+1/3,4+2/3,7,7+1/3,7+2/3,19,19+1/3,19+2/3}      Where we essentially choose each new element we come by in the list as an anchorpoint, and replace the repeats of that element as equispaced points along a line the anchor integer value and the next higher integer?
