I am trying to create a cycle plot in _Mathematica_ , and I am having a hard time finding the right approach to create the visualization. Can anyone give me a few pointers as to how to approach the problem? `ListPlot` seems to be the right way to go, but I have to manually add a placement for the x-axis and it is not ideal. This is what I have done with simulated data:               monday = {{1.1, 3}, {1.2, 3}, {1.3, 2}, {1.4, 1}};     tuesday = {{2.1, 4}, {2.2, 4}, {2.3, 3}, {2.4, 3}};     wednesday = {{3.1, 6}, {3.2, 4}, {3.3, 3}, {3.4, 3}};     thursday = {{4.1, 6}, {4.2, 5}, {4.3, 5}, {4.4, 4}};     friday = {{5.1, 10}, {5.2, 10}, {5.3, 9}, {5.4, 8}};     saturday = {{6.1, 12}, {6.2, 10}, {6.3, 8}, {6.4, 8}};     sunday = {{7.1, 11}, {7.2, 9}, {7.3, 7}, {7.4, 6}};          ListPlot[{monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday, sunday},     Joined -> True,     Mesh -> All,     Frame -> True,     FrameTicks -> {{Automatic, All},     {{{1, "Monday"}, {2, "Tuesday"}, {3, "Wednesday"}, {4,        "Thursday"}, {5, "Friday"}, {6, "Saturday"}, {7, "Sunday"}},      None}}]      I do have David Park's Presentations package, and it seems that may be an effective tool for this problem, but I have not really used it very much.
