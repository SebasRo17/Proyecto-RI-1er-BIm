Here is an example of my problem: ![eigenvalues](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8kayB.png) I am somewhat confused by the syntax of this. I am guessing that the #1 is specifying the start of another root? Why then does one of the roots = u + with nothing after the plus? I think if I better grasped what the #1 stood for I might understand. Also, is there a reason that the Root ends with an &? Thanks!
