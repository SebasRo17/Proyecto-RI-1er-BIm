I'm going to be an intern soon at a bank (this is my first software related job) and I was told that I'm going to be working mostly with:   * Java (I already know SE)   * WebSphere   * DB2 I saw this thread at reddit recently and let's just say I cringed a bit while reading the comments. I'm currently going through Head First JSP & Servlet and using tomcat as container to get myself ahead a bit. I would like to know your experience regarding working with the above technologies. Is WebSphere really that bad of a server? or is it just the typical reddit hate for Java?
