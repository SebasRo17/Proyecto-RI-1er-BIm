WReach has presented here a nice way to represent the _Mathematica_ 's evaluation sequence using `OpenerView`. It is **much more** clear way to go than using the standard `Trace` or `TracePrint` commands. But it could be improved further. I need straightforward way to represent the real sequence of (sub)evaluations inside _Mathematica_ 's main loop for beginners. In particular, it should be obvious when new evaluation subsequence begins and from which expression (it is better to have each subsequence exactly in one `Opener`). The evaluation (sub)sequence should be identified as easily as possible with the standard evaluation sequence. I mean that the reader should be able to map real evaluation step to one described in the Documentation for the standard evaluation sequence. Is it possible?
