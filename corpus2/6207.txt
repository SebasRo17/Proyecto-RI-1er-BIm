The `EventHandler` documentation, More Information section, lists 5 mouse events:               "MouseClicked" "MouseDown" "MouseDragged" "MouseMoved" "MouseUp"      There is at least one other mouse event that can be used that is not listed in this documentation: `"MouseEntered"` How can I find out all the possible arguments that can be used as events for `EventHandler`? **Edit** Also in this answer we learn of an undocumented option `HandleShiftReturn` which works as a "name" with `MenuCommand`. From the documentation: {"MenuCommand","name"} menu command with specified name chosen How do we find out all the possible "names"? **Edit #2 19th June** I got a reply from tech support. They state that "MouseEntered" and "MouseExited" in the GUI Kit are different from the ones in `EventHandler` and the ones in `EventHandler` are not yet ready for public use hence not documented. I didn't get an answer to my request for a full list of events for `EventHandler` (that are public). **Edit #3 30th June** Contacted tech support again after this question. Tech support advise that there is no (documented) way to use the shift, option, control, and function keys with `EventHandler`. Further they said there is no way to use key combinations with `EventHandler`. Still no closer to getting a complete list of events.
