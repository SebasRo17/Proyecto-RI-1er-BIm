I personally, always have problems with recruiter's and their constant spam.. I usually get tons of emails for jobs, not related to what I do. Or they have no idea what I do. Or they say they have a job in my field, but make me go thru hours of paperwork, only to find out they had no real job lead. Or my resume contained a keyword, that they searched for, but that keyword is like 1-10% of what I do, not my main job skill set. My point being is that I want to have a more polite, more accurate, less waste of each other's time. So I want to come up with a form letter, I can create in gmail to automatically send to all recruiter's, to help inform, educate and train them to deal better with me. That way, they know exactly what to send to me, so as to not waste my time. We don't play email/phone tag, just to find out they have no idea what I do, or how to find a job lead that matches that. I want this to be an improvement in my relationship and experience with recruiters, because honestly most of them waste my time. They call me at work, not considering I can't take phone call's at work, and they already had my email address. Mostly they annoy me, but I am tired of having to be rude to get my point across. I want them to immediately make sure they know what I can and have done, (Have you read my resume?) and have actual leads ready to be hired/interviewed soon or now. Any suggestions to how to improve the communication, to avoid wasting each other's time. I certainly hate having to come across as rude or improper, but when they just waste so much of my time, I don't know what else to do. So thank you for your time. Just to be clear, I want your help to write a form letter, that I can send to every recruiter that email's me, how to best work with me, and other people in IT/Web careers.
