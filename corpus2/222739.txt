Why does DrRacket (kind of Scheme) IDE highlights some of the identifiers as "keywords" (for example `define`, `lambda`, `send*`), and the others as "symbols" (user defined identifiers, `+`, `-`, `abs`, `send`, `send+`, etc.)? I am particularly confused by the difference between `send*` and `send+`. For reference, here are the beginnings of their definitions:               (define-syntax (send* stx) ...          (define-syntax (send+ stx) ...      (It is possible that I do not use the terms "identifier", "symbol", and "keyword" completely correctly, but this is how some of them seem to be used in DrRacket preferences.) Unless this is a bug, it must be explained by the language "semantics", so I decided to ask here.
