As an example, let's say that I need to check for a certain usage of C# code and warn the user that that is a bad pratice. There are multiple usages that I want to detect, such as:   * Resource not being released by developer (in a heavy COM environment)   * Instance should be created using Activator instead of new (I don't have control of the API I'm analyzing)   * Others The implementation of the API can be in any language, but I'll be mostly analyzing c# and vb.net. Suitable languages:   * C#   * Python   * Other
