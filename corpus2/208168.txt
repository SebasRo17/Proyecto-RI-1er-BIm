How can I match two strings, but at the same time allow for X number of characters to be incorrect in the match. The number of errors should be a controllable variable. While X number of characters can not match in the string there should be a limit as to how many run in a sequence. Given two strings I might allow 5 characters to be different, but not more than 2 in a row. I'm looking for a recommended algorithm for comparing these two strings, or maybe there is already a known solution for this.
