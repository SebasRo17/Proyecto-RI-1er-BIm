I'm interested in learning how to create a compiler for a dynamically typed language. Most compiler books, college courses and articles/tutorials I've come across are specifically for statically typed languages. I've thought of a few ways to do it, but I'd like to know how it's usually done. I know type inferencing is a pretty common strategy, but what about others? Where can I find out more about how to create a dynamically typed language? Edit 1: I meant dynamically typed. Sorry about the confusion. I've written toy compilers for statically typed languages and written some interpreters for dynamically typed languages. Now, I'm interested in learning more about creating compilers for a dynamically typed language. I'm specifically experimenting with LLVM and since I need to specify the type of every method and argument, I'm thinking of ways to implement a dynamically typed language on something like LLVM.
