I currently have an interface named `InternalEntityIdTransformer`, which has a `getInternalId` method, that given an external id returns the corresponding internal one. Now I am working on functionality that will need to do the opposite transformation, and go from internal id to external id. Is adding an `getExternalId` method to this `InternalEntityIdTransformer` a bad violation of the ISP? (All places that currently are using this interface only need the `getInternalId` and are not going to care about `getExternalId` at any point.) And if it is, then is is particularly harmful? Should I rather have two dedicated interfaces here? The language used is Java, PHP or C#.
