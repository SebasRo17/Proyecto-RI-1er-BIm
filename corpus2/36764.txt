Does Mathematica support importing a ".numbers" spreadsheet file (from the "Numbers" '09 (ver. 2.3 554) spreadsheet program in Apple's OS X iWork office suite)? A ".numbers" file is actually a zip file,                $ file foo.numbers       foo.numbers: Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract      and the contents of the spreadsheet is stored in "index.xml":               $ unzip -t foo.numbers     Archive:  foo.numbers      testing: QuickLook/Thumbnail.jpg   OK      testing: buildVersionHistory.plist   OK      testing: index.xml                OK     No errors detected in compressed data of foo.numbers.      Although it would be technically possible for me to parse it myself, I imagine a tool already exists for that. Thoughts? Thanks, Justin **Edit:** Here is an example .numbers spreadsheet.
