`data = Table[SQLSelect[conn, "All", {"col1", "col2"}, SQLColumn["col1"] == n && SQLColumn["col2"] == o], {n, 1, 8}, {o, 21, 30}];` This results in selecting the range of data in each column specified. What I'd really like to do is get a count of _each_ value in col1 _for each_ value in col2. As it is, I will get: {1,21},{1,22},{1,23},{1,24},{1,25},{1,26},{2,27},{1,23}... If I use the complete range of values I just cull col1 and col2 from my original table. What I have in mind is a table, per this example code, 8 rows x 9 columns that shows the count of all the times 1 and 21 appear together, then all the times 1 and 22 appear together up to 30, then how many times 2 and 21 appear and so on. I want to end up with a table that looks something like this (row and column headers can be ignored):                    21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30     1    1   1   2   7   12  30  47  80  91  112     2    1   1   3   12  18  48  59  118 133 151      and so on... These SQL symbols are tricky in that they react strangely to variable manipulations. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
