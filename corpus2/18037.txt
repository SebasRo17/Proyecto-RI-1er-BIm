I'm trying to get a Cell to appear in TraditionalForm when using `NotebookWrite`. Here is the closest I can get:               nb = CreateDocument[];     NotebookWrite[nb, Cell["Hello", "Section"]];     NotebookWrite[nb, Cell[BoxData@ToBoxes@TraditionalForm@"HI", "Text"]];      I get the following: ![nb output](http://i.stack.imgur.com/J9E3f.png) What do I need to do to get "HI" to appear in TraditionalForm? **Edit:** Here's a better example:               nb = CreateDocument[];     NotebookWrite[nb, Cell[BoxData[ToBoxes[Sin[x]^2]], "Output"]];      gives ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/I2SjF.png) whereas I'd like the output to look like ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/koJBx.png) Is there a specific option I need?
