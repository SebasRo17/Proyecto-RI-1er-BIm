The .NET CLR is not an interpreter, since code gets compiled to native code by the JIT compiler. So I find the usual description of code "running on" the CLR confusing. How does the native code interact with the CLR? Does the compiler insert calls into CLR methods at the beginning and end of your methods, for example? I have no idea.
