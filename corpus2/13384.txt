Change is not uncommon, change in requirements, change in specs change in workflow. I've accepted that there will be change, but I wonder: knowing that change is going to happen, how short of a planning period is too short? (Justifications are encouraged)   * An iteration (2-4 weeks)?   * A week?   * A 2-3 day period?   * A day?   * 1/2 a day? Assume that the company 'plans' 1 [time interval (from above)] in advance from the current so that any plan sounds like: "[this morning/today/this week/etc.] you'll work on _this_ and [this afternoon/tomorrow/next week/etc.] you'll be working on _that_. Also assume that the changes in focus/direction will consistently occur every second to third time interval.
