In the following query, If the option `PlotStyle->{Red,Blue}` is inserted it works but `FillingStyle->{Red,Blue}` does not: The filling turns all Blue. Is this a known issue? I tried basic `ColorFunction` but could only get rainbows. Any other options? It's desirable to alternate the segments using only 2 colors (though not Red and Blue, that's just for example).
