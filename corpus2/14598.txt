**Short version:** How can I convert an `XMLElement` that represents part of a HTML document to plain text? **Long version:** The more general problem is extracting information from webpages. We can import the webpage as an `XMLObject` and extract the relevant part. But this may still be a complex expression of many nested `XMLElement`s (several paragraphs, links, emphasis, etc.), while I'm typically only interested in the text. Let's take a random example: extracting the text from this article. Using the developer tools of any modern browser it's easy to find out that the relevant part is in a `div` with `id="article-body-blocks"`. So we do               page = Import[        "http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/nov/13/science-enforced-humility",        "XMLObject"];          body = Cases[page,         XMLElement["div", {"id" -> "article-body-blocks"}, ___], Infinity];      The body is still a compound expression. Is there a built-in, direct way to extract the text? My workaround is               ImportString[ExportString[First@body, "XML"], "HTML"]      but this is a hack (i.e. fragile, likely to break in future versions or with an input I didn't anticipate). Is there anything specifically meant for this purpose?
