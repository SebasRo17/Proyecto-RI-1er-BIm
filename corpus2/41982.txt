Suppose i have a function defined as follows -               f[x_] := E^-x - E^(-2 x);      I want to find the max/min hence need to find when f'[x]==0. So i tried the following -               Solve[f'[x] == 0, x]          {{x -> ConditionalExpression[2 I \[Pi] C[1] + Log[2],          C[1] \[Element] Integers]}}      Now if i assume x is real then i can do the following -               Solve[f'[x] == 0, x, Reals]     {{x -> Log[2]}}      However when i tried the following -               Assuming[x \[Element] Reals, Solve[f'[x] == 0, x]]     {{x -> ConditionalExpression[2 I \[Pi] C[1] + Log[2],          C[1] \[Element] Integers]}}      Why does Assuming not give me same answer as above ?
