I do not understand why I get different answers for the following two identical integrals.               Integrate[Cos[10*Pi (z - x)], {x, 1/10, 1}, Assumptions :> {}]     Integrate[Cos[10*Pi (z - x)], {x, 1/10, 1}, Assumptions :> {x > 0}]      Output (respectively):               -Sin[10Pi*z]/5Pi     Sin[10Pi*z]/5Pi      Running version 9. Any help would be very appreciated. Thanks!
