I want to use the color function "RedBlueTones" and I want to center the map at a number. Then I want to blend in the red direction of I am greater than that number and blend in the blue direction if I am less than that number. Here is an example. How do I center this at 8?               MatrixPlot[stackTest, ColorFunction -> "RedBlueTones"]     stackTest = {{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}}
