I am considering the technical viability of software that I want to write. Is there a way that I can push data to a phone (iPhone or Andriod) via Bluetooth without pairing with it? I want to be able to walk into a room and have a computer push data to my phone when I get a certain distance from it, or push data to any phone automatically when it comes within a certain distance to a Bluetooth-ready device?
