The Wikipedia article for domain-specific languages seems only to refer to actual _languages_. However, I've heard the term "DSL" used to refer to unique-looking coding paradigms encouraged by libraries in "standard" languages. From Ruby on Rails, for example (from here):               create_table :posts do |t|       t.string :name       t.string :title       t.text :content            t.timestamps     end      That is Ruby code. It's not it's own language, but it's a unique coding style encouraged by a library in order to make coding in a specific domain more readable. Is there a separate term for this?
