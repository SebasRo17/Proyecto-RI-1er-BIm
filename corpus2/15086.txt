I have previously been using               logf[x_, y_] := f[x, y] /. v_ :>(PutAppend[Unevaluated[f[x, y] = v;], "out.txt"];);      which produces output like `f[1,5]=2.566665345435;` on each line of the output file. How could I modify this to produce CSV file, i.e. output lines that look like               1, 5, 2.5666665345435     3, 4, 4.4353453453453     .     .      I tried the obvious guess                  logf[x_, y_] := f[x, y] /. v_ :>(PutAppend[Unevaluated[x, y, v], "out.txt"];);      but this does not work, as the word "Sequence" also gets exported. Also is this the best way I can export data from Mathematica to be read in by c++ code or is there a better way?
