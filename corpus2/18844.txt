How can I force Mathematica to completely evaluate a subexpression before using a replacement rule? For example, consider the following definition (for the series of `n` correction factors in Stirling's formula):               stirlingSeries[n_] :=      Series[Exp[     Total[Table[(-1)^(k - 1)/k t^k h^(k/2 - 1), {k, 3,         2 n + 2}]]], {h, 0, n}] /.      t^m_ -> If[Mod[m, 2] == 0, (m - 1)!!, 0]      What I want to tell Mathematica to do is replace powers of `t` at the end, as the very last step in calculating `stirlingSeries[n]`. Instead, it replaces them first. This changes the result of the calculation.
