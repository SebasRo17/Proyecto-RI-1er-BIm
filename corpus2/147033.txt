After asking this question, I got to realize that parallelism may not always be good. So far I can see that parallelism (under c#) is   * A little complicated code-wise   * Will probably insert some concurrency complications   * Will not always be faster I am looking inside parallelism because I want to make existing and new applications work faster, but now I see that it is no silver bullet. When should I use it? are there any best practices? Is it just a waste of time in most cases? Is it suitable for a specific kind of applications? I am looking forward for your insights on this matter.
