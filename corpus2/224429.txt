I am going to start a project, which in the `BLL` would have something like:   * Jumper    * Map   * Record I need to keep track of all those, so I will make probably classes which hold them, e.g.:   * JumperList   * MapList   * RecordList First of all, is that a good practice to hold all the objects and is it good if I separate them like: `BLL.Entity` for the `Jumper`, `Map`, `Record` and `BLL.List` for `JumperList`, `MapList`, `RecordList` * * * Okay, I may have written it in a confusing way. What I meant was, is it good to make it like that:               BLL.Entity      - Jumper      - Map      - Record     BLL.List      - JumperList      - MapList      - RecordList
