I was reading the following article: Great Hackers The following part grabbed my attention: > "When you choose a language, you're also choosing a community. The > programmers you'll be able to hire to work on a Java project won't be as > smart as the ones you could get to work on a project written in Python. And > the quality of your hackers probably matters more than the language you > choose. Though, frankly, the fact that good hackers prefer Python to Java > should tell you something about the relative merits of those languages." I would like to apply his advice on a commercial web application I am building (I am a strong believer in culture and community), yet this article was written in 2004, and python has increased in popularity in the recent years. How can I decided a language when taking in consideration its community, rather than the popularity? Any recommendations? Is there any language community that show dedication and passion for developing, rather than learning a language to get a Job and a paycheck?
