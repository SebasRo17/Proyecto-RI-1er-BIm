I want to publish a small web project that is supposed to contain some of my research results to present it to the scientific community. All my analysis I ran so far have been written in python already, thus I considered to use django web framework to provide the results. This is, because I plan to show some visualization on up-to-date data, so I can run my analysis on new data by a cron directly in django. there are actually two questions on my mind so far, how I am going to start developing:   1. How can I easily store `numpy arrays` in sqlite to keep the structure of the array and which type of django database field suits best?   2. What is the best way to `json.dump` the `numpy 2d-arrays` to be able handle them in d3.js? As you can see it is quite about putting numpy + django + d3.js together. My first hacking was to store the numpy results as strings, but I think this is not quite the best, since I need to parse them again after pulling them from database. Concerning the second question I already found `simplejson.dumps` but unfortunately it does not really work on `numpy arrays` and thus, sometimes I needed to hack something like this               return  HttpResponse('{"array1" : '+simplejson.dumps(list(array1))+'}')      which I actually don't really like. So to put it together again: **What are your techniques for storing`numpy` structures in django database fields and how do you serialize them for `http`?**
