I have a list of trajectories from a bunch of photons that travel inside a scattering medium. Each trajectory is a list of $(x,y,z)$ pairs. I'd like to visualise them in 3D space. I came up with the simplest (and ugliest) way:               data = Import["http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/25202446/dat.3d", "List"];     data = ToExpression /@ data;     Graphics3D[Line /@ data, Axes -> True, AxesLabel -> {"x", "y", "z"}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uJIP7.png) I also tried with `Point`s instead of connected lines but of course the result is also very "primitive". Another idea was to use the `SmoothDensityHistogram[]` and `SmoothHistogram3D[]` like this (I did some modifications in the code so that it works outside the context of my notebook. I hope that it does indeed):               plot1 = SmoothDensityHistogram[        Take[#, 2] & /@ Flatten[data, 1],            ColorFunction -> "Rainbow", Ticks -> None, Frame -> False];          plot2 = SmoothHistogram3D[         Take[#, 2] & /@ Flatten[data, 1],                ColorFunction -> "Rainbow", ViewPoint -> {1, 1, 1}, Ticks -> None,              Boxed -> False, Axes -> False];          comb = Style[Grid[{{plot1, plot2}}], ImageSizeMultipliers -> 1]      **NOTE** : The graphs that are generated may not look like entirely identical to the ones that I embedded, because the sample size is different. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vAh8E.png)
