In general I want to recover the z-values from an image of a DensityPlot. A simple example might just be               Flatten[Table[{x, y, x Sin[x y]}, {x, 0, 2 \[Pi], \[Pi]/50},         {y, 0, 2 \[Pi], \[Pi]/50}], 1]     ListDensityPlot[%, PlotRange -> All, ColorFunction ->"RedBlueTones",         Frame -> False,ImageSize -> 800, PlotRangePadding -> None]     Export["img.jpg", %]      I can get all the color data just by               pixelData = ImageData[Import["img.jpg"], "Real32"]      but when I want to get a z-value according to the RGBColor of any individual pixel within "pixelData" I'm lost. I guess it's rather straight forward using something like the inverse of               ColorData["RedBlueTones",z]      I also don't care about any range specifications since I can rescale to the desired range provided with the bar legend of the image of interest. Any ideas? Thanks in advance.
