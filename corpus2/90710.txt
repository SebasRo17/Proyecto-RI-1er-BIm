I am asked to create a pseudo-random number generator using the following algorithm: > The generator will generate every integer from `1` to `N-1` exactly once > > The algorithm for `N=2^n` > >   * Initialize an integer `R` to be equal to `1` every time the tabling > routine is called and then on each successive call for a random number: >   * set `R=R*5` >   * mask out all but the low-order `n+2` bits of the product and place the > result in R >   * set `p=R/4` > What does the algorithm mean when it says mask out all but the low order `n+2` bits of the product?
