Just purchased the Presentations package. First sketched this region:               << Presentations`          Draw2D[      {Opacity[0.6],       ComplexRegionDraw[0 <= Re[z] <= 1, {z, -2 - 2 I, 2 + 2 I}]},      Frame -> True,      Axes -> True,      PlotRange -> 2,      FrameLabel -> {Re, Im},      PlotLabel -> z,      ImageSize -> 300      ]      And I got the image I wanted. ![today](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BRDhj.png) Next, I want to sketch the image of this region under the exponential function $w=e^z$. I tried this:               Draw2D[      {Opacity[0.6],       ComplexRegionDraw[Exp[z], {z, -2 I, 1 + 2 I}]},      Frame -> True,      Axes -> True,      PlotRange -> 2,      FrameLabel -> {Re, Im},      PlotLabel -> z,      ImageSize -> 300      ]      But I got a blank image. Any suggestions? Looks like I might have an idea.               f[z_] := Exp[z]          Draw2D[      {Opacity[0.6],       ComplexRegionDraw[0 <= Re[z] <= 1, {z, -2 - 2 I, 1 + 2 I},         PlotPoints -> 30] // ComplexMap[f]},      Frame -> True,      Axes -> True,      PlotRange -> All,      FrameLabel -> {Re, Im},      PlotLabel -> z,      ImageSize -> 300      ]      And the resulting image: ![today2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zbGWX.png) Of course, what I really wanted was the image of the the strip with $0\le Re[z]\le1$ and $\infty\le Im[z]\le \infty$.               Draw2D[      {Opacity[0.6],       ComplexRegionDraw[0 <= Re[z] <= 1, {z, 0, 1 + 2 Pi I},         PlotPoints -> 30] // ComplexMap[f]},      Frame -> True,      Axes -> True,      PlotRange -> All,      FrameLabel -> {Re, Im},      PlotLabel -> z,      ImageSize -> 300      ]      And the resulting image. ![today3](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Z016O.png)
