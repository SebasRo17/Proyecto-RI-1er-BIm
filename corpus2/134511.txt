Sometimes I hear people say that because of the speed of processors and the amount of memory available, algorithm efficiency and runtime aren't, in practice, of major concern. But I imagine there are still areas where such considerations do remain of paramount importance. Two that come to mind are in algorithmic trading, where thousands of transactions must be conducted in fractions of a second, and embedded systems programming, where memory and power are often scarce. Am I right about these examples ? and what other areas would also be examples?
