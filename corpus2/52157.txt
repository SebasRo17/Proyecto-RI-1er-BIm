I'm working with xAct package. I've defined the tensor component values and my issue is that I want an expression involving Levi Civita symbols and tensor components, I don't know how to deal with it. The expression is something like $\epsilon_{abc}$T$_{ade}$ and other two index tensor components. Does anybody know how to deal with it? I try multipling the tensor T to the Levi Civita, but my output writes 'T' instead of the components of the tensor. Can anybody help me please? Thank you
