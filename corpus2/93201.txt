When talking about IDE software or about what a programming language allows you to do or not at the source level, I often use the word IntelliSense, which has a precise meaning in the Microsoft world, but is inappropriate when talking to people who don't have to be familiar with Visual Studio. In this case, what is the appropriate term to use? I usually use the term "auto-completion", but it doesn't always work. In fact, IntelliSense includes auto-completion, but it also provides documentation and hints.
