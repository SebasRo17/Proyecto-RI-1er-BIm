I have a set of files containing my data, and the file-names contain relevant information that I would like to extract. What I have is:               SetDirectory["c:\\data"]     files = FileNames["201406*.dpt"];     Take[files, 3]      > >     {"20140605_SampleName-C-vert_Polarizer0Deg.dpt", >      "20140605_SampleName-C-vert_Polarizer90Deg-Temp100K.dpt", >      "20140606_SampleName-C-vert_Polarizer0Deg-Temp10K.dpt"} >   I would like to do something like               analysis /@ files      that does something like `"%d_%s_Polarizer%dDeg-Temp%dK.dpt", date, samplestr, angle, temp` and returns `{date, angle, temp}` as in > >     {{{2014, 6, 5, 0, 0, 0.}, 0, Null}, >      {{2014, 6, 5, 0, 0, 0.}, 90, 100}, >      {{2014, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0.}, 0, 10}, ... >
