I have a function:               f[x_,y_] = x*y // ScientificForm;     Manipulate[f[x,y], {x, 10^-1, 10^-10}, {y, 0.01, 1, 0.01}]      When I try to execute it - it does work. However I want my x to increment in following manner: for `x`, 10^-1, 10^-2, 10^-3, ..., 10^-10 and for `y`, 0.01, 0.02, ..., 0.1, ..., 0.11, ..., till eventually 1; I can't get my head around this. Could somebody please share any links on how to actually build interface in _Mathematica_. That would be very much appreciated
