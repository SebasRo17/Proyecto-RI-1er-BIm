Quoting from Nature magazine's "Image integrity" guidelines: > Processing (such as changing brightness and contrast) is appropriate only > when it is applied equally across the entire image and is applied equally to > controls.

When I change the brightness and contrast of an image, say, with the following command:               ImageAdjust[ExampleImage, {contrast, brightness}]      Is it fair to say that contrast and brightness transformations are "applied equally across the entire image" in the spirit of the above quotation? Of course common sense is required in terms of not purposefully obscuring meaningful data, but are there pitfalls / issues I should otherwise be aware of specifically with regards to this sort of image manipulation in Mathematica?
