What's the difference between MariaDB and MySQL? I'm not very familiar with both. I'm primarily a front end developer for the most part. Are they syntactically similar? Where do these two query languages differ? Wikipedia only mentions the difference between licensing: > MariaDB is a community-developed branch of the MySQL database, the impetus > being the community maintenance of its free status under GPL, as opposed to > any uncertainty of MySQL license status under its current ownership by > Oracle.
