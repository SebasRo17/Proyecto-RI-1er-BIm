I was wondering if it's valid to initialize an instance of a class within the same class? For example:               public class Person()     {         string name;        string age;        public Person getPerson()        {             Person p1=new Person();            //some logic here            return p1         }     }      I ended up doing that for a part of my code at work and thus wanted to know if there are any potential problems with doing something like this.
