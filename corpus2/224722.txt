With reference to iOS 7. I couldn't find any Apple documents with regards to this. Are we able to download any size of documents and manage them ourselves (within our app say < 100MB)?   Example, we roll out new content every month. Thus after downloading contents for this month, we should remove last month's content to save space. Content doesn't have to be backed up and will be stored in Caches folder.
