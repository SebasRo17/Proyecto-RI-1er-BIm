Does anybody have real life examples where they regularly solve NP complete or NP hard problems (by heuristics, or chasing a suboptimal solution or whatever) in their job? I know they occur in scheduling, planning, VLSI design, etc., but I am trying to get an idea of the major industries employing programmers or engineers today that regularly do this. If one were to develop expertise or a library, in say, combinatorial optimization where could one use that as part of a programming job? Any personal accounts?
