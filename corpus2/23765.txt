Hello I have a problem in saving files in Mathematica. I can't save not only notebooks but also figures. When I choose to save the notebook it open a window that says: > Mathematica could not find enough disk space to save the file > `C:\Users\Διονύσης\Documents\science\mathematica\Untitled-1.nb`. The file > was left unchanged. The disk is full, or if you are using a file server you > may have reached your disk space quota. Although I have notebook saved from a friend. I can save on it. When I want to use it i simply copy-paste it, delete the code, wright mine and then I can save it without any problem. But still I cannot save figures. To save them I can only copy-paste them to Word from where I can save them as figures. If anyone could tell me the source of my problem it would be helpfull! Thank you very much!
