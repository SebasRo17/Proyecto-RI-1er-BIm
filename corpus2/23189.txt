Either I just have bad luck, I am wrong a lot, or there are an increasing number of pedants trolling on StackOverflow. We know that programmers are pedantic (this question), especially toward non- programmers. But as a programmer, when you are trying to help others by answering questions on StackOverflow, what do you do to avoid being called out in comments, voted down, or engaged in a useless argument because of a minor oversight, or worse, something you purposely didn't address to prevent confusing the asker with too much information? **Example** : I recently had someone argue with me about my choice of escaping in a regular expression: I chose `(?<=\=)` (a look-behind) when apparently `(?<==)` was all that was needed. I felt my answer was more safe (I didn't have a good reference to immediately find out whether the escape was unnecessary or necessary in all regular expression variations) and I thought it was less confusing to someone new to regular expression look-aheads. Should I:   * Be less thorough so that there are less possible points of contention in my answer?   * Burden the asker with more information than they might need at that point in time?   * Just ignore it? _**Note** : I didn't ask this question on meta.SO because I am not talking about the workings of SO, I'm interested in how to improve answers to programming questions in general, for everyone involved--the asker, and other experts who might also be answering or reading my answer._
