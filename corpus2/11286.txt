I'm not a mathematician, and I'm not even going to pretend that I understand anything of the ECM. But I know it can be a fast method for factorization. I benchmarked the factorization of $$798645312654798147285393218574111453126547981472185139328574111781$$ by Mathematica against this online applet, where the applet was 75 % faster (16 seconds versus 65 for Mathematica). Other factorizations were up to 6 times faster. Does Mathematica use ECM for factorization of certain cases? If yes, how comes performance is so different? **Additional information** We can investigate in the above problem by calling `FactorInteger[..,Automatic]` on the large number:               FactorInteger[       798645312654798147285393218574111453126547981472185139328574111781,        Automatic] // AbsoluteTiming          (* {5.647210,      {{61, 1}, {67, 1}, {74729, 1},     {2614930428035201342411278280525965452621044417207937542347, 1}}}      *)      This takes only a fraction of the time, but finds only _simple_ factors. So it seems the rest of the time Mathematic tries to factor the last big number. And in fact:               FactorInteger[2614930428035201342411278280525965452621044417207937542347] // AbsoluteTiming          (*      {43.717204,       {{97913387938680010938335707, 1}, {26706566722753457593818813677521, 1}}}     *)      _(feel free to edit tags if needed)_
