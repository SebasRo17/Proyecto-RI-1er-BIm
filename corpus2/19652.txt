(MMA 9.0.0 on Mac OS/X 10.8) Please consider the following snippet (this is as SMALL as I could make it -- my attempts at making a smaller repro-case eliminated the effect that I am investigating)               Manipulate[      With[{img =          Image@RandomVariate[           NormalDistribution[0.5 + p - p, 0.25], {25, 25}]},       With[{grf =          (* comment the following line to stop          the double-evaluation *)          MorphologicalGraph@           ColorNegate@            Image@             WatershedComponents@              Binarize@               img},        GraphicsGrid[{{img, grf}}]        ]],      (* click the + on the controller, wait a second,      and you will see double-evaluation *)      {p, 1, 10, 1,        Appearance -> "Open"}]      In the interactive block that results, press the `+` and `-` keys to advance or retract the value of `p`. If you are patient, on each press of `+` or `-`, after a delay of 1 second or so, the entire display will evaluate a second time. This behavior is rather obvious and jarring since the generated image and graph are random. If you remove the call of `MorphologicalGraph`, the behavior does not happen. Somehow, `MorphologicalGraph` seems to be (hypothetically) causing an extra evaluation step after a 'settling time'. I'd like to at least understand this behavior if not get rid of it.
