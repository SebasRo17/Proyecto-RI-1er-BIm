Currently developing a web app in a team of two maybe three in the near future. Tech stack is at the moment : flask, mongodb, and extjs for the fontend. I currently have the project under version control using mercurial and bitbucket. Question What is exactly the best way to work as a team on a we app peoject? I ussually work on the back end while my colegue works on the frontent. Sometimes i also help out on the front end. How should we do this? Each has a repo on their system but whee is the web server started? Curentlly i have it on my computer but that means that my partner needs to commit and push for each modification and i need to pull the changes and merge for each change. And for frontend stuff there needs to be a lot of changes. We tried having a server started on each of our machines but its a pain with multiple mongodb servers. Anyway any tips, clues and advices are greatly appreciated and welcomed.
