I was just having this idea once and wondering if there's any possibility to harness the power of p2p distributed computing to make a virtual supercomputer with the following features:   * Works like a normal machine but uses networked RAM   * Normal applications should be able to work on distributed environment dividing load among peers This maybe unrealistic, just curious and want to know your views.. EDIT: Some interesting links I found while researching...   * http://mashable.com/2005/11/29/my-latest-harebrained-scheme-distributed-computing-as-a-web-service/   * http://mashable.com/2005/11/04/amazon-mechanical-turk-human-processing-for-web-20/
