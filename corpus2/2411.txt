I have a list of $\{x_i,y_i\}$ pairs and I want to show that $x_i$'s and $y_i$'s have positive correlation. The result of `Correlation[Transpose[data][[1]], Transpose[data][[2]]]` is `0.856906` and `ListPlot[data, PlotRange -> All, AxesLabel -> {X, Y}]` results in the following plot: ![ListPlot of the simulation data](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WTzZ5.png) I just wonder if there is any other (better) type of plot in Mathematica to show the correlation between the variables?
