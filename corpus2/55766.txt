I'm using the Det function in Mathematica to compute the determinant of an $n\times n$ matrix $A$ with entries of the form $a+bt$ with $a,b$ integers and $t$ a variable, and I would like to know what the computational complexity of this function is. For a non-symbolic matrix one can find its determinant in time $O(n^3)$ by Gaussian elimination, but it seems to be more expensive to compute the determinant of my matrix $A$. Does someone know _how_ expensive?
