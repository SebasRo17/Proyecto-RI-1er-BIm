All the examples I am seeing on internet are related to normal functions that carry out loops and assignments but I have not seen one example where I can see a graphics based program being debugged. can someone who has used debugging extensively shed some light on this please? Edit: I meant to say that like in `Manipulate`, I can see the graphics dynamically, in the same way suppose I have completed a loop once than can I see the update in graphics successively or I will have to wait for the final values to arrive. In a way can I debug programs that include `Graphics` or `Graphics3d` in them? And thanks for such warm welcome. :) Example:               fun[x_]:= Graphics[... parameters]      So, can I step into this `Graphics` inbuilt function?
