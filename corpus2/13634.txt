I want to be able to do high dimensional integrals like, (..naively I wrote it as this..)               Nc = 12; Nn = 12;      f [x_] := (Sin[x])^2;     g[n_, x_] := Cos[n*(x)];     Integrate[ (Times @@          Flatten@Table[           f[(a[i] - a[j])/2], {i, 1, Nc - 1}, {j, i + 1, Nc}])*       SeriesCoefficient [         Series [          Exp[ Plus @@            Flatten@Table [   ((4)/(n (x^(-n/2) + x^(n/2))))*(Plus @@                 Flatten@                 Table[g[n, a[i] - a[j]], {i, 1, Nc}, {j, 1, Nc}]), {n, 1,               Nn}] ], {x, 0, 1}], 1/2], {a[1], -\[Pi], \[Pi]} , {a[        2], -\[Pi], \[Pi]}  , {a[3], -\[Pi], \[Pi]} , {a[        4], -\[Pi], \[Pi]}, {a[5], -\[Pi], \[Pi]}, {a[        6], -\[Pi], \[Pi]}, {a[7], -\[Pi], \[Pi]}, {a[        8], -\[Pi], \[Pi]}, {a[9], -\[Pi], \[Pi]} , {a[        10], -\[Pi], \[Pi]}, {a[11], -\[Pi], \[Pi]}, {a[12], -\[Pi], \[Pi]}]      But the above has been like running for ages without an output. I would like to know how I can optimize this work so that I can push this to higher levels. For instance I would like to extract higher powers of $x$ rather than $1/2$ as in the above example and also to more variables than $12$ as above.
