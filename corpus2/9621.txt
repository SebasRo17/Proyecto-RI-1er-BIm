I am home schooling a 15-year-old and would like to teach him programming. Our home computers are all running Ubuntu. What are some good options? So far I am leaning toward Scratch, but I also recently found out there is a free Basic project in the Ubuntu repo geared toward teaching, although I haven't checked it out yet. I also have thought of jumping straight to Mobile development, since he has an Android phone and that would be a pretty impressive conversation starter if he could learn to develop his own apps. I'm very open minded on this... sky's the limit!
