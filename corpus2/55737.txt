I have an analytic expression which involves several integrals               Integrate[f[x], {x, lb, ub}]      where the functions `f` and bounds `lb`, `ub` differ. I now would like to   1. replace `Integrate` by `NIntegrate`, while leaving the arguments of `Integrate` unchanged   2. specify a specific method for numerical integration, such as `Method -> "GaussKronrodRule"` I manage to accomplish (1) by               Integrate[f[x], {x, lb, ub}] /. Integrate -> NIntegrate      but I have no clue how to do (2).
