This is what I'm thinking about doing on a JEE Glassfish server using Jersey.               @GET     @Path("/{name}/{date}")     public String getMessages(@PathParam("name") String name, @PathParam("date") Date date)      I like the idea of being able to tell people consuming this RESTful webservice that "The date here is anything that works with the Date class in Java". That's pretty simple from the standpoint that they can just look at the Date spec, and they'll already have a working model that they can test with. The problem that I'm worried about is that when I do this, JAX-RS is not very nice when Date() doesn't like what it gets in the constructor. Since Date() throws an error if it can't parse what it's given (like if you pass it the string "today" instead of a real date), the JEE server returns a 404 error. Is this a good practice? Is there a better way to do this that I'm not thinking of?
