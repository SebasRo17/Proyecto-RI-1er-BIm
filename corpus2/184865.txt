I would like to have a tab open for PowerShell inside of my VS2012. There are other consoles that I have access to, such as "Command Window" and "Package Manager Console" Is there any way to get a Powershell console window open? I've attached an image that shows where I would like the PS window.![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zgwn8.png) http://i.imgur.com/kDs9Yhv.png
