I'm sorry if this not allowed here. On one computer (maybe with a newer version of Mathematica?) the autocomplete/input assistance for functions works perfectly: when I start typing one like ComplexExpand[], it displays a list of functions that start with that word so I can just hit tab. Also, if I make my own functions it learns about them and will autocomplete them. But on my other computer with Mathematica (Version 8.0.4.0), no list shows up. I've checked in Edit->Preferences->Interface, and there is nothing to turn it on -- strangely though, there is a check box that says "Match case in command completion", which suggests to me that the feature _does_ exist in this version. Does anyone know how I can get it to work? Thanks!
