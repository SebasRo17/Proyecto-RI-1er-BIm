Formatting text in _Mathematica_ should be a punishment for serious crimes. I've face another frustrating feature, and I don't know how to get rid of it.               tekst = StringJoin @@ Array["tekst " &, 15];           Composition[        Grid[{{#, Graphics[Inset@#]}}, Frame -> All] &,          Panel[#, ImageSize -> {150, 100}] &,        Style[#, LineIndent -> 0] &                ][tekst]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/4BVds.png) Those texts should look the same imo. The only difference is that the one in `Graphics` is not formatted as it should be. * * * `Boxes` look well and I don't know what causes that:               ...     PanelBox[      StyleBox["\<\"tekst tekst ... tekst \"\>", StripOnInput->False, LineIndent->0],       ImageSize->{150, 100}],      GraphicsBox[InsetBox[     PanelBox[       StyleBox["\<\"tekst ... tekst \"\>", StripOnInput->False, LineIndent->0],     ...      I was trying to set `FormatType` for `Inset`or `BaseStyle` for `Graphics` or `ParagraphIndent -> 0`. But with no avail :/. Help me please :P
