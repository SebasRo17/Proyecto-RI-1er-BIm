Say you have been programming for over 10 years. You know many languages, with few of those at very detailed level. You have been designing architecture for solutions, worked on and delivered larger projects. You have been studying patterns, best practices, effective coding guidelines, unit testing, multi- threading, etc. And then you slowly develop a feeling that most of the books you read, give less and less valuable information per 100 pages of text. So they start giving diminishing returns. You still learn, but you no longer improve by leaps and bounds. Why does learning become less productive compared to how it was before? Back then, it used to change your way of thinking, taught you new things and broadened your horizons that later improved either your current profession, or allowed to invent/manage/build something new. Why is it no longer the case?
