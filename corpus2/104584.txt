In many freelancing websites, you see many job ads for PHP (backed by MySQL). However, job ads for .NET, Java, Ruby, etc. are not that much. What are the reasons which make PHP so popular for freelancing? Is it because of its importance? Or is it because PHP is free? The reason I'm asking this question is that, I'm an ASP.NET developer and while I see that ASP.NET development productivity is higher (because of fascinating tools it has), it still doesn't attract developers as much as PHP. I want to know if I'm missing something here that I should take into account or no.
