My background in mathematics is very poor (i.e. last relevant math class taken was high school Trigonometry two years ago - another story for another time). I'm reading 'Javascript: The Definitive Guide' and it's a term that is being repetitively used and I've sort of just ran with it. But I've come to a chapter (Chapter 6 - Objects) where my lack of understanding of the term and its application in programming/OOP is starting to become detrimental to the learning process. The online dictionaries aren't helping out, so does somebody have a more explainable definition and/or example to show?
