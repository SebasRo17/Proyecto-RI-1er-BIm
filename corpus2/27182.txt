There are many functions in Mathematica, which return expressions with `TransformationFunction` head, for example RotationTransform. Unfortunately, there is no PerspectiveTransform amongst them. How to create custom transformation functions in general? There is no explanation in docs. It is only said that "TransformationFunction works like Function." what does it mean? That writing `TransformationFunction` is just writing a `Function`? Also it is said that when possible "matrix forms for transformations can be obtained from TransformationFunction objects using TransformationMatrix." Can I have some samples of custom TransformationFunction with and without matrix? **UPDATE** If I provide my transformation (homogenous) matrix it produces "nonaffine" error: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TJho5.jpg) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ffbB0.jpg) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/w0X0h.jpg) **UPDATE 2** Now trying to form transformation via `LinearFractionalTransform` and effect ios the same ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/R94mK.jpg)
