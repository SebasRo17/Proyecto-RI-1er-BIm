Is it possible to take advantage of Dataset's Query operator syntax to Merge parallel queries thereby avoiding Function's that are otherwise required? Using the planets data:                planets = ExampleData[{"Dataset", "Planets"}];          {moonMasses, nMoons } = {planets[All, "Moons", Median, "Mass"],        planets[All, "Moons", Length, "Mass"]}      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/v1syL.jpg) These queries are nearly equivalent merges: (1) `Merge[{moonMasses // Normal, nMoons // Normal}, List]` ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TWkoa.jpg) (2) `planets[All, "Moons", {Median[#], Length[#]} &, "Mass"] // Normal` ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PKpcr.jpg) The values in (1) are unfortunately wrapped in an extra nested list (and further requres normalizing the data as Merge doesn't take `Dataset` arguments). (2) is preferred (normalizing here only because 10.0.0 `Dataset Format` is not usable). How to avoid using `Function` in (2), eg, to shorten the query to a syntax similar to:               planets[All, "Moons", {Median, Length}, "Mass"]
