I have this code to find all the permutations of a set of letters that form legal words.               <<Combinatorica`     Module[{str = "abc", chars, len, r, check},      chars = Characters[str];      len = StringLength[str];      r = Range[len];      check[n_Integer] :=        DictionaryLookup[{"BritishEnglish",          StringJoin[chars[[UnrankPermutation[n, r]]]]}, 1];      DistributeDefinitions[check, chars, r];      ParallelTable[check[i], {i, 1, len!}]]      I've verified that, if I replace ParallelTable with Table, I get this:               {{}, {}, {}, {"cab"}, {}, {}}      With ParallelTable, however, in addition to that result, I also get warnings like these:               Part::pspec: Part specification Combinatorica`UnrankPermutation[1,{1,2,3}] is neither a machine-sized integer nor a list of machine-sized integers.          Part::pspec: Part specification Combinatorica`UnrankPermutation[2,{1,2,3}] is neither a machine-sized integer nor a list of machine-sized integers.          StringJoin::string: String expected at position 1 in StringJoin[{a,b,c}[[Combinatorica`UnrankPermutation[1,{1,2,3}]]]].          StringJoin::string: String expected at position 1 in StringJoin[{a,b,c}[[Combinatorica`UnrankPermutation[2,{1,2,3}]]]].      These warnings seem to come from kernel 7 and higher. My guess is that the computation reaches those kernels and there isn't any data left, since there are only 6 permutations, and causes them to spit out those warnings. Is my understanding correct? How do I prevent these warnings?
