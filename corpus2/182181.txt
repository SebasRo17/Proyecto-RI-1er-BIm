I am tasked with designing and implementing a flexible UI solution for deployment across a series of "kiosk"-ed Windows endpoints. There is some debate about what is the considered to be the best technology solution for the actual UI itself. The requirements are:   * Must be hardware accelerated   * Must play WMV video (for licensing reasons)   * Must be skinnable/themeable.   * Must support off-screen rendering.
