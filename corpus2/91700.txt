Example: A file, representing a serialized version of an object, needs to be read and deserialized. It would simple to implement this if we only cared about a single serialization format, but many such formats exist (JSON, YAML, etc.). One way to handle this would be to create an abstract serializer type/interface with methods such as `deserializeToArray`, `deserializeToObject`, and so on, and pass this interface as a dependency in order to decouple any dependent classes from any concrete implementation. This could be further generalized by having the serialization methods actually be implementations of another interface, which we'll call `Transform`. So here we're effectively using the Strategy pattern once again, this time encapsulating a family of algorithms for transforming one kind of data into another desired object or array format. Is this perhaps an overuse of the Strategy pattern? Are there better ways to structure things here or patterns more fitting for this sort of problem? Are there disadvantages to using several nested Strategy patterns as in this example?
