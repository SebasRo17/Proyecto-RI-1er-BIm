I wrote a simple application(I put the code in the end) to detect the parallel line pairs in the following picture: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OsyKp.jpg) It returned three pairs of parallel line:               {{{{584., 222.175}, {39.6747, 0.}}, {{0., 377.639}, {390.613, 472.}}},      {{{0., 403.894}, {306.413, 0.}}, {{0., 336.953}, {238.095, 0.}}},      {{{584., 186.489}, {127.104, 0.}}, {{0., 377.639}, {390.613, 472.}}}}      And then I want to show every result individually. Here's the way I output the result, where img is the test picture and parLines is the detected parallel line pairs.               For[i = 1, i <= Length[parLines], i++,     Show[img, Graphics[{Thick, Orange, Line /@ parLines[[i]]}]]]      I expected it to output several images and a pair of parallel lines on each. The number of images depend on the number of pairs of parallel line. However, it didn't draw anything. But if I printed them one by one, it worked fine.               Show[img, Graphics[{Thick, Orange, Line /@ parLines[[1]]}]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Eviow.png)               Show[img, Graphics[{Thick, Orange, Line /@ parLines[[2]]}]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/lKdvM.png)               Show[img, Graphics[{Thick, Orange, Line /@ parLines[[3]]}]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/T1Wwg.png) I can't understand where the problem is. Thanks for any help. * * * Here's the code:               img = Import["http://www.zechini.it/webtv/upload/book.jpg"];     edge = DeleteBorderComponents[EdgeDetect[img]];     lines = ImageLines[edge, 0.1];          NumofLines = Length[lines];     flag = False;     parLines = {};     For[i = 1, i <= NumofLines, i++,       For[j = i + 1, j <= NumofLines, j++,         line1 = lines[[i]];         line2 = lines[[j]];         vec1 = line1[[1]] - line1[[2]];         vec2 = line2[[1]] - line2[[2]];         para = 1 - ArcCos[Abs[(vec1.vec2)/Norm[vec1]/Norm[vec2]]]/(Pi/2);         If[para > 0.9, flag = True; AppendTo[parLines, {line1, line2}];];         ];       ];          If[flag == True,      For[i = 1, i <= Length[parLines], i++,       Show[img, Graphics[{Thick, Orange, Line /@ parLines[[i]]}]]],       Print["Cannot detect parallel line"]]
