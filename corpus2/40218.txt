I want to make and image/dashborad (to export to PDF) with many VERTICAL bullet graphs gauges. And I canÂ´t make it, in a automatic way. In general, the questions are: **QUESTION 1:** How to make a dashboard similar to this one: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KolwM.jpg) For example, with only 3 gauges, I write this code:               GraphicsRow[      Rotate[BulletGauge[{25, 98}, {80, 98, 107}, {0, 180},         ImageSize -> Large], 90 Degree],      Rotate[BulletGauge[{45, 62}, {20, 58, 107}, {0, 180},         ImageSize -> Large], 90 Degree],      Rotate[BulletGauge[{55, 82, 102}, {40, 88, 115}, {0, 180},         ImageSize -> Large], 90 Degree]      ]      and the result is: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9opwR.png) I modified the code and put "{ }" to separate the 3 graphs, to obtain no commas between graphs, and the text "Graph..." and the brackets... but the result is so strange to me, because I can only view a little piece of the graphs. **QUESTION 2:** Is this normal? How could I make my user view the entire graphs as in the previous image (without commas and "graph.." and brackets)?. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/NVZ2Q.png) **QUESTION 3:** How I can rotate the text marks "0", "50", "150"... ? Another way might be make automatic this individual bullet graphs, and find all I need in a PDF with LATEX, or in a similar way. **What are the best options for achieving all these things?**
