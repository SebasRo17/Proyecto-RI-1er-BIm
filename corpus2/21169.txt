I am programming with an apple keyboard (the one all aluminium with flat keys). it's quite some time I observed I occasionally mistype, and I feel pain in my hands. Is it the keyboard's fault, or am I just getting old ? Does any of you have experience with hours of programming with the apple keyboard ?
