Programming languages often come with various bit operators (e.g. bitwise left- and right shift, bitwise AND, OR, XOR...). These don't get used though very much, or at least such has my experience been. They are sometimes used in programming challenges or interview questions, or the solution migh require them, e.g.:   * Without using any equality operator, create a function which returns `true` when two values are equal   * Without using a third variable, swap the value of two variables These then again, probably have few **real world** uses. I guess that they should be faster because they directly manipulate memory on a low level. Why are such found in most programming languages? Any real world use cases?
