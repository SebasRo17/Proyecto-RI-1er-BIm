I want to add two matrices, the first one containing a 2D vector at each position the other one a list of 2D vectors. The 2D vector from the first matrix should be added to each of the 2D vectors at the same position in the other matrix. The way I know of is using MapThread, but is there a faster way? So basically I have two matrices defined like this:               MA = Table[RandomReal[], {i, 10}, {j, 10}, {k, 2}];     MB = Table[RandomReal[], {i, 10}, {j, 10}, {k, 3}, {l, 2}];      The output of `MA+MB` should be `Mout[[i,j]] = {MA[[i,j]]+MB[[i,j,1]],MA[[i,j]]+MB[[i,j,1]],MA[[i,j]]+MB[[i,j,1]]}` for each pair of indices `i,j`. The one method I am using right now is a combination of `MapThread` and `Map`:               Mout = MapThread[Function[{x,y},x+#&/@y],{MA,MB},2]      This works but is rather slow. Is there a faster and maybe more elegant way to do this?
