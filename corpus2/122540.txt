If asked a series of technical questions in a programming interview, does it look bad to admit when you don't know the answer to a question? In other words, does admission make you look incompetent or ill prepared? Or, is it assumed that no one will know the answer to every question? Does admitting it instead of taking a shot in the dark make you look honest or like you're a know-it-all?
