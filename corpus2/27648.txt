I have been using _Mathematica_ 8 on an OS X system for quite a while now, but this morning it threw this error at me when I started the program up: > Assertion 'kEINVALErr' failed at LikeResource.c:56 A search (`sudo find / -name "*Resource.c"`) of this computer reveals no such file. I asked the admin to re-install _Mathematica_ from scratch, but even after he did so the error popped up as soon as I tried to launch it. Any thoughts? Thanks in advance!
