I would like to justify whether my concept in the open source license is correct, as you know that, misunderstanding the terms may lead to a serious law sue. > The main difference among the open source license is whether the license is > copyleft.

That means they have to use the same license for the > modified version. Also, the copyleft license require all the released > modified version to be free software. > > On the other hand, if any others create derived work incorporating non- > copyleft licensed code, they can choose any license for the code.

Also, are there any popular license beside these?
