I am doing some nasty integrals trying to fill in a matrix, and to save computation time, I set my hbar to be a constant of undefined value, so the answer it spits out consists of a real number plus some number times the square of hbar, which means I should be able to ignore it and chop it off since hbar squared is very small. Essentially I want to tell mathematica to apply to the answer the value of hbar. To clarify, I don't want to define hbar and have it do the integration again because that would make the computation time too long. I want the value of hbar to be defined only on the answer I get from the integration, not during the integration. Thank you!
