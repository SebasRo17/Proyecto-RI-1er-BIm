I noticed that in the Vim automatically indents labels in a rather unintuitive way (IMHO).               int main(void) {          goto end;          end:         return 0     }      Are there any style guidelines for labels? For the faint-hearted, the goto's I am using are for error handling in a controlled and structured manner.
