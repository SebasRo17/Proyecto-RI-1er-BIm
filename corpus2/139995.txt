We are trying to make our releases more frequent. As part of that we have blocked out a day of the week where we told users that we'll be doing updates. Similar how Microsoft has Patch Tuesday. This is for a web app running completely server side, by the way. So updates are not a huge problem to deploy. Though they can get time consuming. Occasionally an update has a bug that needs to be fixed before the next update window rolls around. I see two real options: either undo the update and restore a backup of the previous version, or make a fix and deploy it outside the scheduled time. Making a fix sounds easy, but often times there are other changes that have been made to the code base. And the fix needs testing before it can realistically go out. Rolling back isn't a bad option, but sometimes that will remove recent features or at least delay them until the next week.
