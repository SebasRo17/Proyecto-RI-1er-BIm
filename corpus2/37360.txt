I wish to simplify the simple expression `fac[n_] := Sum[R^i, {i, 0, n}];` as much as possible for various $n$. `FullSimplify` or `Factor` work on this, but not always, as good as it should be. For example, in the sixth line of               Table[{fac[j], fac[j] // FullSimplify, fac[j] // Factor}, {j, 1, 8}] // TableForm      it seems that `FullSimplify` does not work at all!? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/hEAEv.png) $1+R+R^2+R^3+R^4+R^5+R^6$ has not been simplified! It is well-known that $$1+R+R^2+R^3+R^4+R^5+R^6=1+(R+R^4)(1+R+R^2).$$ So, now my question is: Is there any way in _Mathematica_ to obtain the very simplified form of the expression `fac[n_] := Sum[R^i, {i, 0, n}];`, just like $1+(R+R^4)(1+R+R^2)$ or even simpler for various $n$? I will be grateful if anyone can give me some tips.
