I want to use a list of tuples within a function to make assignments. Say I want to make assignments of the form               value[i,j] = val      What I have is a list of tuples that give the relevant indices (i,j):               tuples = {{i[1],j[1]},{i[1],j[2]}, ... , {i[imax],j[jmax]}}      What I have found is that this statement will work in Mathematica 8 :               Function[t, value[t[[1]], t[[2]]] = 0.] /@ tuples      But using slots does somehow not work:               value[#[[1]],#[[2]]] = 0. & /@ tuples      ... gives an error. Where is the mistake I am making or is there no way to do this using slots? (using `Part[#,1]` and `Part[#,2]` will not help either]? Kind regards, Guido
