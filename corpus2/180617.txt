**Problem Statement -** ![Problem Statement](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pbK2U.png) The task is to find the minimum number of swaps required in the given arrangement of cartons to get the desired arrangement of cartons. Only adjacent cartons can be swapped. I have tried an ad hoc approach, but it proved inefficient towards the upper limit of the data range. Here it is for reference -               Traversing through the given arrangement of cartons      if position of carton>than the desired position       swap back       go to previous iteration      What would be a pragmatic approach to the problem?
