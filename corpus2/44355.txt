I have a scanned image (binary-ized): ![example picture](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gQvOw.jpg) Is there any way to reduce one of these curved lines (full or dotted) to a series of its coordinates (e.g., sampling interval of 0.01 on x-axis)? I've read some similar examples: Recovering data points from an image How do I find the coordinates of points in this image? How can I extract data points from a black and white image? Obtain Data points from a graph on an image without axes But my problem is slightly different: I have several curves in one image. I would like to isolate them one from another and make each curved selectable by a simple click so that, for the selected curve, a series of coordinates of its sampled points (e.g., interval of 0.01 on x-axis) can be returned. Like this: ![clic](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HPsBv.png) ![image selected](http://i.stack.imgur.com/iI5ME.png) ![coordonnates returned](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SskBx.png)
