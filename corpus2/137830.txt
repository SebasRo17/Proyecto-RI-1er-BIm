On personal projects (or work), if one gets stuck on a problem, or waiting to figure out a solution to the problem, if you jump to another section of your code, don't you think it will be a good reason your application will be buggy or worse yet never get completed? Assuming you are not using git and code each feature to a specific branch, things can get out of hand since you have 3 different features you are working on, and you have unresolved issues in each. So when you get done to work, you get stressed out because you have these hanging issues and half-baked code lingering about. What's the best way to avoid this problem? (if you have it) I'm guessing using something like git and creating a branch per feature is the safest way to avoid this bad habit. Any other suggestions?
