jQuery is a Javascript library and framework, but when we are programming with jQuery into DOM problems/solutions, we can practice a style quite different of programming... We can read about jQuery at Wikipedia, _The set of jQuery core features — DOM element selections, traversal and manipulation —, enabled by its selector engine (...), created a new "programming style", **fusing** algorithms and DOM-data-structures_ This question is similar to the "subquestion-3" of this question but not so generic. The focus here is about this new kind of "programming style"... So, the question: **Is the "jQuery programming style in DOM context" a new paradign?** Or it is more one example of **reactive programming** (not "cell-oriented" but " _DOM- node oriented_ ") or another one? * * * We have no "standard taxonomy of paradigms", so, please, in your answer, indicate also your "best choice for Wikipedia Paradign". Example: if you understand that "jQuery programming DOM" is like "awk filtering data", your choice can be event-driven.
