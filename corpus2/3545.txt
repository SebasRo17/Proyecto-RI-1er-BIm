I always thought that `Grid` (and the underlying `GridBox`) and the general handling of tabular objects is a bit weird in _Mathematica_. One particularly annoying fact is that while one can set column widths explictly, the same cannot be done to row heights, because each row is set to the height of its largest content by default. I don't really understand this asymmetry between the two dimensions. Does anyone have any insight on this matter? As a more specific question: How to set the row height to be exactly 1, by clipping the content if necessary (i.e. some part of it should not be visible)?               Grid[{       {"000000000\n111111111\n222222222", "000000000"},       {"000000000", "000000000"}       },      ItemSize -> {{10, 5}, {1, 1}}, Frame -> All]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/h10dj.png) Can this be done with only `Grid` or do I have to map a `Pane` with explicit height value to each element (converting from pixels to ems, as `Pane` uses the latter)?
