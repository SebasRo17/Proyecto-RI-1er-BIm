I am developing a jQuery mobile app. In this app, i often use Mustache.js templates in separate html files. Actually, every template is needed by the user, but my app loads a template (via GET method) only when it is needed. For now, all the templates are small and they're all used by the client at runtime. But obviously this won't be the case for long, in case I add extensions that will be needed or not by the users. I could load every template at once, but I'm afraid this could become a blocking point in the future. Based on your experience, what is the best thing to do? Load all templates at once, or load them one by one, when needed?
