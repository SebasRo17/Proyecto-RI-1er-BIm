I am trying to publish a cdf document, but I'm having some problems with the function `Manipulate` with this code:               Manipulate[x + 1, {x}]      In _Mathematica_ , when I set `x = d + d^3` in the input field, I get this output: > `Manipulate[x + 1, {{x, d + d^3}}]` This is what I want. However, it seems that the cdf player is only able to evaluate the expression `x + 1` when `x` is a number and not a more complicated expression. Is this true or I am doing something wrong?
