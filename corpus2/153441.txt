I have an application who has **text fields** (not select, not checkbox or other types) where an user can enter some value, like this: ![*ISBN* and *E-Mail* are the label of each input](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nKf2O.png) _ISBN_ and _E-Mail_ are the **label** of each input. Now I have to automatically test these inputs according to their label. The question is: how to recognize that, for example, the first input requires an ISBN code? I programmed something like this:   1. turn the label value to lowercase   2. check if the label value contains _isbn_   3. if so set the field value to a random _ISBN code_ (i.e.: 1234567890), else set it to a random value (default) For the email field:   1. turn the label value to lowercase   2. check if the label value contains _e-mail_ or _email_ or _mail_   3. if so set the field value to a random _email_ (i.e.: abcd@abcd.com), else set it to a random value (default) And so on for each text field I encounter. Is that reliable? How can I improve the "recognizing part"? I know only the _label value_ and the _field value_ (what is already written in the field by default) for each text input.
