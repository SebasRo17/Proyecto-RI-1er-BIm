I have 5 books in my "read-wish-list". When do I read them? I mean I could force myself to use 1 hour during working hours, but this will last for 2 days then someone will ask me to do more "high priority things". One option can be reading at night, but also this has limits, even because I prefer to spend time with kids. Could you please share your experiences? A long term plan is needed of course, it makes no sense to read 5 books in a week, but to continuously read something. For this reason it must not be a stressful thing. It should be easy. It must not be a struggle to find time to read, but it should be done on a continuous regular basis. Somehow this question can be similar to THIS ONE but I want to ask about books. How many if you read books at work for self improvement, not to tackle a specific task?
