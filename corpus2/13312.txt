I'm trying to develop a way of comparing two sequences (probably originally text, such as text writing or source code, possibly converted to lists). As a familiar example, consider the revisions display for any typical SE question or the diff output from a command-line `diff`. I found a cool _Mathematica_ function called `SequenceAlignment` which looks promising:               text1 = ExampleData[{"Text", "ToBeOrNotToBe"}];     text2 = StringReplace[text1, {"s" -> "th"}]          (*      To be, or not to be,--that ith the quethtion:-- Whether 'tith nobler     in the mind to thuffer The thlingth and arrowth of outrageouth      fortune Or to take armth againtht a thea of troubleth, And by      oppothing end them? ...     *)      (lisp programming... :) Now:               sa = SequenceAlignment[text1, text2]      gives:               {"To be, or not to be,--that i", {"s", "th"}, " the que", {"s", "th"},      "tion:-- Whether 'ti", {"s", "th"}, " nobler in the mind to ", {"s", "th"},     "uffer " ...      which I want to convert to some kind of colored display. The best I've managed so far is this:                Reap[       If[Length[#] == 2,            Sow[Column[{Style[#[[1]], Red], Style[#[[2]], Green]}]],            Sow[Style[#, Black]]]          & /@       sa]      but it's not a pretty display: ![my attempt](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2R7Eb.png) How can I make this display look like a single piece of text with colored markup, like the SE revisions display? And would it be possible to process _Mathematica_ code as well - without evaluating said code first, obviously?
