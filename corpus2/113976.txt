I think somehow building a language which compiles to another language feels like a bad idea from the start, instead of learning javascript properly from the start. Look into Douglas Crockfords Good Parts and then are you hooked. And javascript is not hard - writing good code is hard regardless of language! If you write crappy code in javascript, then you propably will write crappy code in coffeescript or lattescript or what the flavor will be of the day. And to say that coffeescript syntax is beautiful passes me. I like my curly braces and C syntax - and would preferably work in a language which is like that (sorry VB!). And more toys and languages and frameworks for doing the same thing all over again feels not like progress to me anymore!
