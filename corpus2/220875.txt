I am designing an application where users message one another privately, and may send messages to any `Entity` in the database (an `Entity` may not have a user account yet, it is a professional database). I am not sure how to best design the database and the API to allow messaging unregistered users. The application should remain secure, and data only accessed by those with correct permissions. Messages sent to persons without user accounts serve as an invitation. The invited person should be able to view the message, act on it, and complete the user registration upon receiving an `InviteMessage`. In simple terms, I have:               User         misc user fields (email, pw, dateJoined)          Entity (large professional dataset):        personalDetails...         user->User (may be null)           UserMessage:        sender->User         recipient->User        dateCreated        messageContent, other fields.....          InviteMessage:        sender->User        recipient->Entity        expiringUrl        inviteeEmail        inviteePhone      I plan to alert the user when selecting a `recipient` that is not registered yet, and inform that he may send the message as an invitation by providing email, phone where we can send the invitation. Invitations will have a unique, one-time-use URL, e.g. `uuid.uuid4()`. When accessed, the invitee will see the `InviteMessage` and details about completing his/her registration profile. When registration is complete, `InviteMessage` details to a new instance of `UserMessage` (to not lose their data), and assign it to the newly created `User`. The ability to interact with and invite persons who do not yet have accounts is a key feature of the application, and it seems better to separate the invitation from the private, app messages (easier to keep functionality separate, better if data model changes).   * Is this a reasonable, good design?   * If not, what would you suggest?    * Do you have any improvements?   * Am I correct to choose to create a separate endpoint for creating invitations via the API?
