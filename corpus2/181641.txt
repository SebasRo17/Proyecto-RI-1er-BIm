I am frequently tempted to wrap integers, etc, solely for the purpose of writing methods that can return `null`. Negative 1 can work in many cases, but too often (especially in sound) it's a valid return value. Often, to get around this, I am returning a reference to a larger object that contains the primitive in question and calling a getter. This seems less efficient than the wrapper, and in some cases less encapsulating. So, are there any penalties with wrapping for this reason? Does anybody do this? Does this smell?
