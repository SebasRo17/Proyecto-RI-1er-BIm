Sometimes you want to return multiple values from a function. **How is this _normally_ done in Java?** One option is to use an array, like this Python snippet that returns a list or tuple:               value, success = read_unreliably()     if success:         print value      Another option would be to return a hash/dict, like this JavaScript example:               var result = readUnreliably()     if (result.success) {         alert(value);     }      One more would be to create a custom object just for this purpose, like this Java example:               ReadUnreliablyResult result = readUnreliably()     if (result.getSuccess()) {         System.out.println(result.getValue());     }      Of course you can also just use some global variables to store what you need instead of passing things around, but let's just say that's not an option.
