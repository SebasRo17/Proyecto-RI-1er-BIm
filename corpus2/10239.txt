Assume I have defined the following function:               FF[{x_, y_}] := {x^2 + y^3, 3.5*x*y}      I would like to apply `FF` on a list of input such as:               XX = {xa, xb, xc}     YY = {ya, yb, yc}      In order to do it I input the following syntax:               MapThread[FF, {XX, YY}]      but as output I get just the first element of the function:               {xa^2+ya^3, xb^2+yb^3, xc^2+yc^3}      what am I doing wrong here?
