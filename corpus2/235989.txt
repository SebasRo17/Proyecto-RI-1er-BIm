**EDIT** The original title of the question was **Is there a non-derogatory term for 'monkey patching'**. As I have learned that the term is actually not derogatory, or is at least not meant to be, I changed the name to free it from mistaken implications. * * * I would like to describe a piece of software, and try not to use emotionally biased language. However I am not aware of an unbiased alternative to 'monkey patching'. The term is meant to be derogatory for a reason. Many see it as a useful but problematic technique. I am aware of an alternative, but it is equally derogatory: 'duck punching'. I see 'open classes' not as an alternative name, but as a prerequisite for monkey patching. 'Overriding' does not seem right either. I would like to differentiate between monkey patching and the regular overriding as part of inheritance-based polymorphism.
