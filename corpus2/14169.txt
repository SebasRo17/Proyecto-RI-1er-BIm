I currently have a $77\times 38$ matrix, and I have used a clustering algorithm to cluster the row data and column data. The rows and columns of my matrix correspond to a list of country codes (not in numerical order). That is, I have a list of numbers:               {10, 28, 34, 44, ...}      where country 10 corresponds to row 1, country 28 to row 2, etc. I have a corresponding list for the columns of my matrix. I have independently clustered the columns and rows into groups of 3. For example, the row clusters look like so:               {{10, 1, 4, 2, ...,37 }, {28, 34, 27, 21, ..., 18}, {38, 20, ..., 12}}      Again, I have another clustering for the columns. I want to rearrange the rows and columns of my matrix such that the clustered rows and columns are next to one another. Using my example row cluster list, I want to rearrange the matrix such that row 1 corresponds to country 10, row 2 to country 1, row 3 to country 4, etc. After this, I wish to do the same with the columns of my matrix. Any help is appreciated. Edit: Haha, I apologize. I have a bad habit of haphazardly posting questions before going to sleep, hoping that my problems will all be solved in the morning. I have class now, but I'll probably update this later (+ examine all of the information already posted).
