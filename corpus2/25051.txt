Referring to this link I happen to realize that actually the trace being projected is dependent on an equation and not on disk or circle. Though I was presuming that it is getting traced because of the movement of circle/disk. So, in mathematica is it possible that the object can be traced automatically, say the same output of cycloid program without using parametric equations for trace of point on circle.
