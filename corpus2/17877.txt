Lately I've been working quite a lot with `Compile`. I also started using Wolfram Workbench. So a natural question arises: Is it possible to have syntax highlighting for local variable variables inside compile as well? Here is a screenshot demonstrating the problem. Notice the blue `x`'s in the lower right hand side of the image? These should be green. ![Screenshot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/US15o.png) I didn't manage to find anything under the preferences. I'm using WB 2.0
