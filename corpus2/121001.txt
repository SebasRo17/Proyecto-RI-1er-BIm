Code Retreat is an all-day training event that focuses on the fundamentals of software development. There's a "global" code retreat day coming up, and I'm looking forward to it. That said, I've been to one before and have to say there was a huge amount of chaos... which is fine. One thing that I still don't get is why the "Game of Life" is a good problem for TDD, and what good and bad TDD for it feels like. Realize this is a pretty open ended question, so feel free to comment.
