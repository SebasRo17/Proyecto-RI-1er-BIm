I am an experienced asp.net developer and asp.net mvc and I have my own CMS that I have written but starting to think there should be another approach. When someone asks you to develop them a website how do you develop it so that they can add pictures,slideshows, content, news items, diary events. On a side note do you give them a design for the home page and inner page and thats it. I'm just thinking if they turn around and say 6 months down the line I want a jquery slideshow on the right hand side of this page how do you or CMS's handle it?
