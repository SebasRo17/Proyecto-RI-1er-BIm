I've been seriously considering my career progress and would like to know your opinion on the following:   * 5 years full-time employment as a software developer / web technologies / best practices   * MSc Software Engineering student   * based on typical tasks that I've been doing, I'd say I'm a Software Architect + sysadmin + security consultant. The problem which exists with PHP is that most of its users (incl. employers) are sort of technological enthusiasts without proper training. Companies are small, typically start-ups, and they cannot afford following formal processes. Consequently, requirements engineering is skipped, project management is skipped, testing is about systematically clicking everywhere because use cases are skipped, architecture is skipped, documentation is skipped, etc. I've been working on senior positions, incl. technical lead, and always addressed these issues until I started studying. For studies it's better to be an independent contractor working at home online. My aim is to join a medium / big company that can afford doing things as in the book and then I want to enjoy new challenges, bigger projects, other senior staff, etc. I've been also planning further study following my Master's. Do you think Web Development with Java EE and Oracle 11g is what I need to achieve these goals? For the record, I have several years of experience with C/C++ and Java, but I did that mostly as an additional work. My positions were more about PHP and various enterprise systems / frameworks. Thanks for exchanging your stack, this question may attract someone who has a few years' experience working exclusively with these technologies. :)
