How can I implement a Boolean function F(A,B) that has outputs that are not specific and, therefore, the truth table output of this two-input function will be (a, b, c, d) -- here the first term refers to the case F(0,0), the second to F(0,1), and so on. This is how this Boolean function F(A,B) is represented on Wolfram|Alpha. How would I then evaluate the simplified Boolean expression for: F(A, B) AND F(B, A XOR B)?
