I am nearing the end of developing the major pieces of my website that I have been working on in my spare time for the last 3 months. My goal is to get it released by the end of next month and hopefully start making some money on it. Unfortunately the next step will be to write a lot of specific data handling and ui code that I can see becoming very tedious and boring. When I was first started the project I was able to find time for working on it easily, it was interesting and writing the back-end was new. Once I got to the start of writing stuff that I know and do at work (ui), it seemed harder and harder to make myself work on the project, sometimes the last thing I want to do when I get home from work is code again. Anyone in the same situation? Any tips on how to find time and effort for side projects without burning out? Any tips on staying on the right track? EDIT-Update Thanks for all the input, I really appreciate it. My and another friend are in on this website together, I'm doing all the coding he's doing the design, marketing etc. Obviously I don't have strict deadlines but our goal was to have it released by the end of July. I have no plans to lease the coding work to someone else. I am using a ui and back-end framework, the code is going to get tedious but the frameworks are both major time savers. My plan of action is to treat it like a job and really force myself to put hours in. Hopefully in a couple of months I'll be able to edit this and promote my website :)
