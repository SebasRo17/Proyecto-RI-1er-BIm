What coding standards do you think are important for .NET / C# projects? This could be anything from dealing with curly braces and spacing and pedantry like that. Or it could be more fundamental questions such as what namespaces in the .NET Framework to avoid, best practices with config files, etc. Try to avoid creating a post that is simply the corollary to another. For example, it would be fine to have one post focusing on curly braces. We don't need two to support one style vs. the other. The idea is not to vote for your pet standard, but rather to flesh out what should be thought about when creating standards.
