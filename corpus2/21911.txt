I have a client who wants a web app that will let him do the following (as he told me word for word):   * User registration   * Recurring payments for users   * Online conference room reservation I am supposed to give him a cost estimate very fast and I don't have any time to do any deeper requirements analysis! How would you deal with that kind of situation? Should I just give a very broad estimate and work out the exact requirements once he has accepted the estimate? At which point do you usually gather requirements, after or before getting a contract?
