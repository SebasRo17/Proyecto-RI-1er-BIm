I have two lists: `{a, 1, b}` and `{b, 1.3, y}` My goal is to print them to file `test.dat`, so that the content of `test.dat` looks like:               (a 1 b)     (b 1.300 y)      I want the elements of the lists in the output file to be separated by spaces. **Questions:**   1. How can I do it?   2. Is it possible to use Print command to do it? **Edit 1:** I was going along these lines:               myPrint[list_] := Print["(", Row[list, " "], ")"]     l1 = {a, 1, b};     myPrint[l1]      > (a 1 b) My problem is that I don't know how to export the results I got to a file. So this is the reason for my question 2. **Edit Final: Problem Solved** Solution by **swish** (from comments)               str = OpenWrite["test.dat"]     myPrint[list_] :=       WriteString[str, Row[{"(", Row[NumberForm[#, {4, 3}] & /@ list, " "], ")\n"}]]     l1 = {a, 1, b}     myPrint[l1]
