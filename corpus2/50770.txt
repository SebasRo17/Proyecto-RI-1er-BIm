I wrote a small script for a palette, which allows me to highlight a specific cell in a notebook by using `SelectionMove[mycell, All, Cell]`. The cell is selected as expected, but sometimes this cell is part of a cell group (section, subsection etc.) which is currently closed, so the cell itself is hidden, and `SelectionMove` does not reveal it. So far, I didn't find a way to open all parent groups of this cell programatically so that this cell will be shown... Is this possible?
