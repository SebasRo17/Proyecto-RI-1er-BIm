I recently upgraded versions of pylint, a popular Python style-checker. It has gone ballistic throughout my code, pointing out places where I import modules in the same package, without specifying the full package path. The new error message is W0403. > W0403: Relative import %r, should be %r > > Used when an import relative to the package directory is detected. * * * ### Example For example, if my packages are structured like this:               /cake       /__init__.py       /icing.py       /sponge.py     /drink      and in the sponge package I write:               import icing      instead of               import cake.icing      I will get this error. * * * While I understand that not all Pylint messages are of equal importance, and I am not afraid to dismiss them, I don't understand why such a practice is considered a poor idea. I was hoping someone could explain the pitfalls, so I could improve my coding style rather than (as I currently plan to do) turning off this apparently spurious warning.
