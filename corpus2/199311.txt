In any given class definition, I've seen the method definitions ordered in various ways: alphabetical, chronological based on most common usage, alphabetical grouped by visibility, alphabetical with getters and setters grouped together, etc. When I start writing a new class, I tend to just type everything in, then reorder when I'm done writing the entire class. On that note, I've got three questions:   1. Does order matter?   2. Is there a "best" order?   3. I'm guessing there's not, so what are the pros and cons of the different ordering strategies?
