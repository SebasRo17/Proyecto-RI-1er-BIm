I'm developing web site on self made MVC engine. I have _actionController_ that handles operations like _register_ , _login_ , _post submit_ and etc. _actionController_ receives operation name and parameters. Of course it mast handle errors such _user with same nick already exists_ or _password is to short_ about which action handler have to notify user. The question is which is the best way to organize errors, such that View could easily get localized user notification message. I see two ways First one: define error constants like               ERR_NICK_BUSY = '1'     ERR_NICK_INVALID = '2'     ...      and localization map               local[ERR_NICK_BUSY] = 'User with the same nick already registered'     local[ERR_NICK_INVALID ] = 'Nick, you entered is invalid'     ...      And second one: define abstract constants like               ERR_FIELD_BUSY = '1'     ERR_FIELD_INVALID = '2'     ...      and pass them with field name. In this case localization looks like               local['nick_'+ERR_FIELD_BUSY] = 'User with the same nick already registered'     ...      I don't like both this methods. Can you advise something else?
