I've been on this job for mere 5 years now. I feel like I've learned a lot in that time, and I continue to challenge myself whenever I can, even though my job doesn't allow that very often. Still, I feel like I've just started my professional career as a developer, and there is still much to learn. This is obviously true, being a developer is all about learning. So I've decided to order a book or two from this list: http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2004/02/recommended-reading-for- developers.html These guys (Jeff et al.) must be doing something right, so I'm guessing Jeff's recommendations have some weight. I'm considering buying Code Complete and The Mythical Man Month since they are on top of the list, but I am not sure these two are the right choice. Would you recommend these two as a good learning/self-improvement books? Regardless of your answer, please state your reasons. I'm just curious if these two have a good ROI or should I just keep my money and buy tons of ice- cream. Some of the questions would be: are they still relevant? Will they _really_ make me a better developer? Feel free to recommend other books, or argue about other books on Jeff's list, but keep in mind my question about these two in particular :)
