I want to differentiate a function `f[]` for which I don't have a specific expression. `f[]` depends on `x` and `y` and has parameters k1 and k2 in it. `x` and `y` depend on `t`,and not on `k1` nor `k2`. So when I use the total derivation operator `Dt[f, t]`, only `x` and `y` should be differentiated. But how can I say Mathematica that k1 and k2 are constant, without assigning values to them?
