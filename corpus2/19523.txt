I am trying to model microtonal music using `Play`. I have only partial success because it takes such a long time to make some sound. Could you please have a look at my stackoverflow.com question? The link is http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14849184/how-to-play-microtonal-music- using-mathematica-or-other-tools **=========== Original question linked above ===============** Do you have any suggestions how to write and play microtonal music? My solution: I tried to use `Play` and `Piecewise` but it takes a LONG time to take a sound! Please read the details. As you know there are many notes other than Do or Re or Mi of western music. So maybe I can not use `SoundNote` for ancient music. Each note is represented as a fraction. Using middle Do as a base (i.e., `base = 260.741 Hz`); the next notes are represented by `re = 9/8 base`, `mi = 5/4 base`, `fa = 4/3 base`, `di = 3/2 base`, etc. For example, to play fa for 2 seconds with `SoundVolume = 1/3`, evaluate               Play[1/3 Sin[ fa 2 Pi x], {x,0,2}].      I model each such instance with a list of the form `{time, note, soundvolume}`, for example `{2, fa, 1/3}`. Consider a very short example of such a sequence of notes               voice1= {{1, 9/8, 1}, {1, 5/4, 2/3}, {1/2, 4/3, 1/3}, {1/2, 9/8, 1/3}, {1, 4/3, 1},              {1, 3/2, 2/3}, {1, 4/3, 1/3}}      How can voice1 be easily played using `Play`? I tried using `Piecewise`, but with that I have to wait for a LONG TIME before I get any sound result. (Maybe the reason is the use `Piecewise` in `Play`, but I am not sure.) Please, try the following example to see how slow you get the sound result for voice1.               Play[       Piecewise[{         {1, 0. < x <= 1},         {2/3, 1 < x <= 2},         {1/3, 2 < x <= 5/2 || 5/2 < x <= 3},         {1, 3 < x <= 4},         {2/3, 4 < x <= 5},         {1/3, 5 < x <= 6},         {0, True}}]       Sin[ base 2 Pi          Piecewise[{           {9/8, 0. < x <= 1},           {5/4, 1 < x <= 2},           {4/3, 2 < x <= 5/2},           {9/8, 5/2 < x <= 3},           {4/3, 3 < x <= 4},           {3/2, 4 < x <= 5},           {4/3, 5 < x <= 6},           {0, True}           }]],       {x,0, 6}]
