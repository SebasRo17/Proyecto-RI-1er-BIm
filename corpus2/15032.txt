Inspired by this question, if I have a list               {a, p, b, q, c}      where `p` and `q` are binary operators, such as `Plus` and `Times`, how would I construct the expression               a ~ p ~ b ~ q ~ c      and execute it? Obviously, the solution proposed in the other question of constructing it via strings is the most straightforward approach, but I would like to know if the infix formulation, above, is doable without resorting to string manipulation.
