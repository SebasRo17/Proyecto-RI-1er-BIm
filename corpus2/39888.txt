There is however one part of your career that may not get updated. That is your job title. It seems beside all technological hypes there is also job title hype. It all depends on which company you work for. Many companies give employer better job titles because they want to keep them. The employee doesn’t change their job because the current title is much better, even if they would get better working condition and benefits if they changed their job.
