I'm interested in the prospect of spending a few years as a tester: it seems like two or three years as a tester in anyone's CV is a big gain. Are there any skills you can get as a software tester which you can't (or certainly won't) get as a developer? Is there a way back from software testing to development or do most companies prefer "pure" developers?
