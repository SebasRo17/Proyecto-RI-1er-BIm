In exercise 1-16 in The C Programming Language (K & R) it asks for us to: revise the _main routine_ of the longest-line program so it will correctly print the length of arbitrary long input lines, and as much as possible of the text. From what I read here, I get the notion that the main routine is everything inside of `main`, is this correct? I posted the code for the longest-line program below for more context, but I am confused my what I am being asked to do not the code. Thanks!               #include <stdio.h>          #define MAXLINE 1000                /* maximum input line length */          int getline( char line[], int maxline );     void copy( char to[], char from[] );          /* print the longest input line */          main()     {          int len;                /* current line length */     int max;                /* maximum length seen so far */     char line[MAXLINE];     /* current input line */     char longest[MAXLINE];  /* longest line saved here */          max = 0;     while (( len = getline( line, MAXLINE )) > 0)         if ( len > max ) {             max = len;             copy( longest, line );         }            if ( max > 0 )         printf( "%s", longest );             return 0;     }          /* getline: read a line into s, return length */      int getline( char s[], int lim )           {         int c, i;              for ( i = 0; i <  lim - 1 && ( c = getchar() ) != EOF && c != '\n'; ++i )             s[i] = c;                if ( c == '\n' ){             s[i] = c;             ++ i;         }            s[i] = '\0';             return i;         }          /* copy: copy 'from' into 'to'; assume to is big enough */     void copy( char to[], char from[] )      {         int i;              i = 0;         while ( (to[i] = from[i] ) != '\0' )             ++i;     }
