Is it possible to change the way Mathematica saves so that `Out[]` lines are never included? I have a `.nb` file that processes a lot of data, and displays most of it as standard output. These graphs, tables, and intensity plots almost double the size of the file. I'd like to easily save these files in a smaller form and also prevent accidentally sending confidential results to users outside my company or not under an NDA. That is, of course, without using `Cell -> Delete All Output` before each save. I can't be expected to remember to do that all the time! :-P
