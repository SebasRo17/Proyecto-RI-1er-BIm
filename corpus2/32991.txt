is there any possibility to slice through a Graphics3D object? At the end I would like to have a stack of images slicing , e.g. $n$ times in $z$-direction: $((x,y,z_{0}), (x,y,z_{1}),â€¦,(x,y,z_{n}))$ Here is an example of random spheres, which I would like to slice.               z = 100;     p = RandomReal[100, {z, 3}];     r = RandomReal[10, {z}];     obj = GraphicsComplex[p, Sphere[Range[z], r]];     t0 = AbsoluteTime[];     gr = Graphics3D[obj, Axes -> True]      I would be pleased about any suggestions.
