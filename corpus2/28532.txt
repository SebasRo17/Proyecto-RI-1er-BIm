`MapIndexed` is a very handy built-in function. Suppose that I have the following list, called `list`:               list = {10, 20, 30, 40};      I can use `MapIndexed` to map an arbitrary function `f` across `list`:               {f[10, {1}], f[20, {2}], f[30, {3}], f[40, {4}]}      where the second argument to `f` is the part specification of each element of the list. But, now, what if I would like to use `MapIndexed` only at certain elements? Suppose, for example, that I want to apply `MapIndexed` to only the second and third elements of `list`, obtaining the following:               {10, f[20, {2}], f[30, {3}], 40}      Unfortunately, there is no built-in "`MapAtIndexed`", as far as I can tell. What is a simple way to accomplish this? Thanks for your time.
