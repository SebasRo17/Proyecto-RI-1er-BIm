I am developing my own programming language. It's a general purpose language (think staticlly typed Python for the desktop, i.e. `int x = 1;` ) not intended for the cloud. Do you think it's okay not to allow inheritance or Mixins? (given that the user would at least have interfaces) For example: Google Go, A systems language that shocked the programming community by not allowing inheritance.
