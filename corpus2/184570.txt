I'm in the planning stage for an employee intranet system to be built with ASP.NET MVC 4. We'd like the site to consist of separate "modules", each of which provides a different feature: messaging, payroll changes, etc. I'd like these modules to be able to be enabled or disabled at compile time. The homepage will display some kind of navigation that will link to each module that is loaded. That's easy so far, but I don't want the navigation feature to have to know about the modules beforehand. In other words, I want the modules to be dynamically discoverable; I want to be able to write the code for a new module and then have a link added to the navigation bar with no code changes anywhere else in the source. Each module should have some way of registering itself with the navigation bar, and--more importantly--this should be done for each module as it's loaded. I believe that this precludes using MVC's Areas, since those are designed for the case when the layout of the site is known beforehand. MEF seems like it might be appropriate, although people seem to have had mixed success in combining MEF with MVC. Is MEF actually the way to go here, or is there a better way to accomplish what I need?
