I am really looking forward on creating a **chat application** which features basic implementation of text chatting, as well as advanced features of **audio/video** chatting. I have clearly understood how to implement text chatting feature using **push notification**. Now I am heading towards implementation of audio/video chatting in my application. I Googled around to see some samples for the same. I found **Voice chatting**, **idoubs** and a couple of more sources, but ended on a negative note. What I realized is I am not sure of what actually happens during a audio/video chat. What are the background activities which take part when user is chatting. I believe, if I understand the process behind the **audio/video** chat, I may implement it in a way I too understand. So, if anyone among you has a brief/detail knowledge regarding audio/video chat, kindly share it with me.
