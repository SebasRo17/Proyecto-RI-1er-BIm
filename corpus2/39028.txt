I'm working on a largeish system of differential equations where I encounter the `NDSolve::ndsz step size is effectively zero; singularity or stiff system suspected` error. Since this error arises from the complexity of the system I'm not able to distill a minimum example, but there might still be some useful general information we can share. In particular I'd like to know:   * What's the difference between stiffness and a singularity? How can I tell whether my sysetm is singular or stiff?   * What quantity is Mathematica calculating to decide if the system is stiff/singular? Can I calculate this quantity myself to see what property of my system is causing problems?
