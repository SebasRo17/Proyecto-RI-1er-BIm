It was pointed out to me yesterday that I need to get a book on SQL and learn about it properly. That is probably a fair assessment; I'm a functioning SQL programmer who can in general extract from the database the information that is needed, but as soon as extracting the data needs more than a couple of `joins` and a `where` clause the query that I come up with is probably not as good as it could be. Previously I was working at an Oracle shop where there were a few very good SQL programmers who would generally design the more complex queries and would be on hand to answer questions, but now I'm at a SQL Server shop where no one really has much of a clue about SQL and so I feel like I need to get my skills up. What I'm looking for is a book that is fairly short and very practical that I can work through in the evenings with a series of difficult SQL problems and then well explained solutions along with a few pieces of sage advice that is aimed at a programmer who can "do SQL" who wants to become more of a "SQL programmer". I appreciate that many things about SQL are platform dependent, so since I'm currently in a SQL Server shop then my preference would be for a book aimed at TSQL. Any suggestions?
