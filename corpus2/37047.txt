Which of the following to you find more readable? The hand-written loop:               for (std::vector<Foo>::const_iterator it = vec.begin(); it != vec.end(); ++it)     {         bar.process(*it);     }      Or the algorithm invocation:               #include <algorithm>     #include <functional>          std::for_each(vec.begin(), vec.end(),                   std::bind1st(std::mem_fun_ref(&Bar::process), bar));      I wonder if `std::for_each` is really worth it, given such a simple example already requires so much code. What are your thoughts on this matter?
