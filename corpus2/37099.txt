I couldn't find time and money to study due to financial issues,however I managed to land some good jobs and projects and 2 multinational and my portfolio now has good clients on it too, however I still feel that I lack something important so was wondering if someone knows an college/university that offers degrees if you are a qualified professional, I'm also willing to study for few weeks if required. _Update_ Thanks for the answers guys, in my area as far as I have looked, there are no evening or weekend classes for undergrad studies, however there are some for Masters and few of my working friends are studying on weekends (thats actually where my motivation came from).
