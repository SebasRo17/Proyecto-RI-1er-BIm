I want to create a plot style with a table and manipulate the variables in the plot style.               Menge = {g, h};     Manipulate[       Plot[{0.5 x + 1, x}, {x, -1, 5},         PlotStyle -> Table[Opacity[Menge[[i]]], {i, 1, Length[Menge]}]],     {g, {1, 0}},      {h, {1, 0}}]      This code won't work. But when i create the table and simply copy the output it works.   Can someone help me out?
