So I'm reviewing a piece of code that is a perfect candidate to be abstracted away into a view helper. However at the moment, the piece of code uses two other view helpers to get the final display. Now my question is, if a new view helper is created, is it recommended to inject the two helpers being used already, into the one created to get the final result needed? I've not seen anything for or against, my initial feelings were that the code probably needs refactoring, but I don't think the dev will be willing to, so what I have outlined seemed like a nice middle ground.
