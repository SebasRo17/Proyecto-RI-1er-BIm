Basically, I develop websites, some large with many crud operations, etc... However I've gotten into the habit of storing re-usable data as a constant in my PHP applications I currently have 44 constants defined in one application. These range from:   * Database config   * Home page for admin and guest   * url slug names   * declaring development mode   * declaring maintenance mode   * a few directory shortcuts ( instead of writing /admin/templates/images ill use const ADM_IMAGES )   * session names   * cookie names   * random things like MAX_IMAGE_SIZE, THUMB_SIZE and MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS I don't have any problems using all these constants... It's kind of helpful having all these in my application. I just wanted to know if its a 'good practise' to use them in this excess If not, how else could this data be encapsulated to be useful AND easy enough to reach in my application? Also bearing readability in mind.
