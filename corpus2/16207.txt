Can _Mathematica_ find the asymptotics of a function in the following sense? I have               Log[1/n^2]/Log[4^(-Sqrt[Log[n]]) + (2^(-Sqrt[Log[n]]) - 1)^2]      and I would like to know an asymptotic approximation when $n$ is large. That is a simple function that is within a constant multiplicative value in the limit when $n \rightarrow \infty$. If instead it was               Log[1/n^2]/Log[4^(-Sqrt[Log[n]]) + (2^(-Sqrt[Log[n]]))^2]      then I know that               Log[1/n^2]/Log[4^(-Sqrt[Log[n]]) + (2^(-Sqrt[Log[n]]))^2]/Sqrt[Log[n]]       tends to a constant value. My question is how could you use _Mathematica_ to discover that $\sqrt{\log{n}}$ is the right answer in the second case and to find whatever the right solution is in the first case? By trial and error I happen to know that the right answer in the first case is somewhere between $2^{\log^{1/2}{n}}$ and $2^{\log^{1/2+\epsilon}{n}}$.
