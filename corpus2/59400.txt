I tried to use `ColorReplace` to change the colors obtained from `MorphologicalComponents`. However some of the changes didn't follow the rules specified, Is there any reasons?               im2 = Binarize@Import["http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZDeYq.jpg"];     im3 = Colorize@ MorphologicalComponents@im2      colors = DominantColors[im3, 5]       ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5gZkM.gif) Now trying to change the colors accordingly,               ColorReplace[im3, {       colors[[2]] -> Red,        colors[[3]] -> Blue,        colors[[4]] -> Green,        colors[[5]] -> Yellow       }]      One of the changes did not follow the rules specified: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/aNxL2.gif)
