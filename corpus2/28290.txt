The solutions of the second order differential equation $$\frac{1}{\eta}\frac{d}{d\eta}\left(\eta \frac{df}{d\eta}\right)+\left(1-\frac{s^2}{\eta^2}\right)f-f^3=0$$ is shown in Fig. 5.2 below, for two different values of $s$. ![solution](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7WP6a.png) The result is taken from the book "Bose-Einstein Condensation", by Pitaevskii&Stringari (2003). As the authors comment, $\lim_{\eta \rightarrow 0} f(\eta) = \eta^{|s|}$, whereas for $\eta \rightarrow \infty$, the limit is 1. This can also be seen from the plot above. The problems arise due to the divergencies at $\eta=0$. The one in the first term is relatively easy to take care of, but I do not know how to get rid of the divergency in the term $\frac{s^2}{\eta^2}$. For the $s=2$ case, where $f$ goes to zero as $\eta^2$, this term has the limit 1: $$\lim_{\eta \rightarrow 0} \frac{4}{\eta^2}f = 4,$$ so I tried to make use of that. Here is what I came up with so far:               ClearAll[f1, f2, f3];     f1[\[Eta]_ /; \[Eta] > 0] = 1.;     f1[\[Eta]_ /; \[Eta] == 0] = 2.;     f2[\[Eta]_ /; \[Eta] > 0] = 1./\[Eta];     f2[\[Eta]_ /; \[Eta] == 0] = 0.;     f3[\[Eta]_ /; \[Eta] > 0] = 4./\[Eta]^2 f[\[Eta]];     f3[\[Eta]_ /; \[Eta] == 0] = 4.;          NDSolve[{f1[\[Eta]] \!\(     \*SubscriptBox[\(\[DifferentialD]\), \(\[Eta], \[Eta]\)]\(f[\[Eta]]\)\     \) + f2[\[Eta]] \!\(     \*SubscriptBox[\(\[DifferentialD]\), \(\[Eta]\)]\(f[\[Eta]]\)\) +      f[\[Eta]] - f3[\[Eta]] - f[\[Eta]]^3 == 0, f[0] == 0, f[10] == 1},     f[\[Eta]], {\[Eta], 0, 10}]      Although this gets rid of the divergencies for the particular case of $s=2$, it results in another series of errors and no result is obtained. Edit: I am particularly interested in the case $s=1$.
