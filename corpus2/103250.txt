I am interested in changing careers and becoming a mobile app developer. I've been trying to teach myself how to build mobile apps using HTML5, jQuery Mobile, and appmobi. I really want to become a mobile application developer, but need some guidance as to what kind of degree and/or certificate I should get in order to get a good job. I already have an undergraduate degree - Bachelors of Science in Experimental Psychology.
