Imagine, there is a resource, for example event. User is able to get list of events in HTML format. He should be able to view that list in two ways: as a list and as a calendar. How the API should respond to this options? The simplest approach, I think, is to pass some parameter to index action to determine which type of presentation to use, but I don't like it. Don't know why, it is not RESTful for me. What do you think, do I misunderstood something and should keep things simple or there is a better approach?
