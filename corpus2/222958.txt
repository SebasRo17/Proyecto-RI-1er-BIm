ok, am just looking for a win loss code example. This can be for any language, just wanting the outline. Fairly new to programming, so dummy it up for me :) I can do (win-loss/total of win loss). Guessing that is a good standard win loss ratio, but I don't want a new person that has 1-0 to be ranked higher than someone that has 20-3. Any help is appreciated and thank you. EDIT: The chess styles are a little more than needed. Just want a ranking system with win/loss. so lest say 20-3 is top in league right now. he is, say 23 weeks in so far. if one guy comes in and wins first match against anyone, I don't want him to take #1 spot over people thats been there longer and have a great winning record. To respond to ampt... maybe he will be best in league, but I don't want him instantly there cause he had one good match. Not sure if that clarify any more. Didn't really follow Doc all the way. Looks as if he is hindered in list up to his 11th game. Not sure if thats what you ment there. Thanks again for all reasponses.
