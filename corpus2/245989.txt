Let's say Alice has a Git repository, and the version is kept track of inside the repository (let's say `package.json` for npm). Bob sends a pull request to Alice which increments the version number from `0.1.0` to `0.1.1` Carol also sends a pull request to Alice (independently from Bob's request) which increments the version number to `0.1.1` as well. How can Alice deal with this situation?
