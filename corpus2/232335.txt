I've got decent programming experience for an undergraduate. I just started the study of algorithms. I read the description and saw visual examples that make perfect sense in my head. But when it comes time to write them down in code, I'm unable to implement them. I'm talking about basic algorithms like insertion sort. I'm starting to feel that I'm just stupid. I love programming and the study of algorithms actually really fascinates me even though I haven't really gone into too much depth. But not being able to implement simple algorithms has really stopped me from getting past the beginner stage. I'm starting with Intro to Algorithm books/tutorials so I don't see how I go down a level. Is there anything else one can do while in this situation?
