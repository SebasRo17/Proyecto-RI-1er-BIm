I am getting the message > LinkObject::linkd: "Unable to communicate with closed link > LinkObject["E:\Program Files\Wolfram > Research\Mathematica\9.0\SystemFiles\Converters\Binaries\Windows\Tesseract.exe", > 134, 7] This is what is did As Mathematica's version of Tesseract was not recognizing text correctly, I installed `tesseract-ocr-setup-3.02.02.exe` in another directory. But my efforts were in vain. Therefore, I uninstalled that setup and, then, when I tried the following code it gave me the error message quoted above. Maybe I messed up somewhere.               x = Import["http://i.stack.imgur.com/AqSqO.jpg"];     TextRecognize[x];      Please, can anyone help me to solve this problem. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/AqSqO.jpg)
