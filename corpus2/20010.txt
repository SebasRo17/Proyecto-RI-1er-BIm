I am trying to make a polar plot of a two variable function, which has a radial and an angular part. For instance `Y[r,φ]=r^2 Cos[φ]`. I can make this plot using `ContourPlot`, but is there a way to do it using `PolarPLot`? My `ContourPlot` is               Y[r_, f_] := r^2 Cos[f]     ContourPlot[Y[Sqrt[x^2 + y^2], ArcTan[x, y]], {x, 0, 1}(*Radius till 1*), {y, 0, 60}(*Angle from 0 to 60*)]      ![](http://i.imgur.com/h9I9tJs.png)
