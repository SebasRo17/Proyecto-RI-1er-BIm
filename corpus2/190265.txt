I wrote an application that helps you to save energy. Actually it is very simple. I check the current location of the phone and I make some changes to the configuration like "sound off, dark display, wifi off...", depending on the location of the user. Sony just released a new phone including one of my apps features (actually they have an extra entry in the options menue for this). I have no idea whether there is a patent for this function. Can I even release this app without risking to be sued some day? I'm very confused about the whole "patent" situation.   I'm about 20 years old and I can't even write a simple app, without investing lots of money for a lawyer. Edit: **I don't ask for legal advice**. I wanted to receive an overview about how developers see or handle the whole situation.
