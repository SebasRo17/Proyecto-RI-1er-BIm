How important would a statistics course be to a software developer? More specifically given the description: > 2510 Statistics for Physical Science Students (F) & (W) examines elements of > probability, conditional probability, Bayes' Theorem, discrete random > variables, cumulative distribution function, introduction to continuous > random variables, mathematical expectation, estimation of mean, proportion > and variance, hypothesis testing for one-sample case I'm trying to find out whether I have room to add more CS courses. This course (STAT 2510) is not required, but is "recommended".
