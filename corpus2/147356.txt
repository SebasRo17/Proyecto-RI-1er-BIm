Facing a situation where I can't possibly get all the features that are requested into each version of the LOB I support, I've evolved a number SQL query templates that users have and send to me, which I then execute. This then led to a password protected SQL execution dialog which users with write access can execute for themselves with an understanding that if they make the wrong typo they could do damage. While this makes me nervous, the upside of having the functionality outweighs the risk in this situation. Then there is the change in how people view the functionality. It seems less magical when they understand more about how the database works. On the other side of this, however, new users can potentially walk into a culture where the lingo includes something totally foreign to them. Any advice on weather this direction has relative utility?
