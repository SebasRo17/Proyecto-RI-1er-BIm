I'd like to draw               Plot[Re@Sin[x+I*2], {x, -10, 10}]      as an epilog on               Plot3D[Re@Sin[x + I*y], {x, -10, 10}, {y, -10, 10}]      and position it at `y=2`. What's intuitive to me doesn't work:               epilogData = Table[{x, 2, Re@Sin[x + 2*I]}, {x, -10, 10, 0.1}];          Plot3D[Re@Sin[x + I*y], {x, -10, 10}, {y, -10, 10},       Epilog -> {Red, PointSize[Large], Point[epilogData]}]      Using               epilogData2D = Table[{x, Re@Sin[x + 2*I]}, {x, -10, 10, 0.1}];      will draws something, but not what i want (What's that anyway?). I've also played with `Inset` and got no luck so far.
