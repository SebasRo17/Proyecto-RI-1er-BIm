Multiple assignment is supported by `Set`. How can do something similar in `Module` expressions? If I could do it, whould there be drawbacks? Here is what I tried so far:               g[x11_, y11_] := {xx111, yy111} = {x11, y11}          g[x11_, y11_] := Module[{{x111, y111} = {x11, y11}}, 1]          g[1, 2]      > Module::lvset: Local variable specification {{x111, y111} = {1, 2}} contains > {x111, y111} = {1, 2}, which is an assignment to {x111,y111}; only > assignments to symbols are allowed. >> Possible alternatives are:               ggg[x11_, y11_] :=        Module[{xx = {x11, y11}, x1, x2}, {x1 = xx[[2]], x2 = xx[[1]]}]      or               ggg[x11_, y11_] := Module[{x1111=x11, y1111=y11}, what... ]
