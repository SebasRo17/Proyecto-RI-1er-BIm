I have been working until past 1:00 in the morning almost every night. Then I ride the bus home and I'm just envisioning my computer screen in my head. I get home and sleep at most four hours and then start seeing my screen on the bus the next day when it begins again. After four or five days of this I crash and sleep for 16 hours or more. I get a lot done but it feels unhealthy and I can't help but wonder if I'd actually get more done on a normal schedule. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Am I just a workaholic? I do like programming and this past year I have been learning how to write LOB apps, and I love it.
