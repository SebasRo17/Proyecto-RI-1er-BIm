I would like to label a graph with matrices. Suppose the graph is simple: * * * ![GraphPlot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qLA4M.png) * * * And I have an array **mats** that contains the labels for vertices 1,2,3,4 (these are just random 0-1 matrices; ignore the entries): * * * ![mats](http://i.stack.imgur.com/05V6s.png) * * * What is the appropriate syntax to employ `VertexRenderingFunction` to achieve having each vertex `i` replaced by (an image of) the `MatrixForm` of `mats[[i]]`? Or perhaps I am looking in the wrong direction entirely...? I know this is elementary; thanks for your patience & advice!
