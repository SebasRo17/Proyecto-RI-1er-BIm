So i've been trying to learn some Embedded/Assembly programming for a bit here lately, as well as going far as trying to learn the lowest level (gates and such). One thing puzzles me though....is how do we "get" instruction sets. I understand somewhat how gates/TTL and such works, but I don't see how we get from that to mov,add,clr etc...? It's probably a stupid question....but I mean I think back to the first micro- processors/controllers and think....how exactly did they design an instruction set and make it work? edit: I guess for Clarity, pretend im talking about the first microprocessor, how did they go from Binary to actually creating an Instruction Set?
