Im really aware of some benefits of using Hudson as CI server. But, im facing the problem to convince my coworkers to install and use it. To put some context, we are developing two different products (one is an enterprise search engine based on Apache Solr) and several enterprise search projects. We are facing a lot of versioning issues and i think Hudson will solve this problems. They argued about its productivity and learning curve What Hudson's benefits would you spotlight?
