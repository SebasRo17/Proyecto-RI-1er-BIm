I'm addicted to VC++ since 2008, and I begin to work for my current company from 2011 when I graduated in Mathematics. Now I still love VC++, it is a wonderful programming language. I'm a little confused whether it's a good idea to continue with Windows Programming. I'm in Beijing, China. Of course, I come from China. I want to find a work in Silicon Valley, America in the future. Can anyone tell me is it possible for me to find a VC++ work in Silicon Valley someday in the future? And what should I do in the recent years?
