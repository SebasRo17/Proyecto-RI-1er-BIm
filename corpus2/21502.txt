Again, I am writing homework sheets. I have tried                a = "(portionOfCircle)";      SectorArea =  a * Pi * r^2       SectorArea =  a * Pi * r^2 // TeXForm      With[{a = "portionOfCircle"}, Defer[a * Pi * r^2 // TeXForm]]      I would like the output to be in LaTeX form such as $$\text{(portion of circle)}\cdot \pi r^2$$ instead my code will output $$\pi \text{(portion of circle)}\cdot r^2$$ Also, I would like                a = RandomChoice[{Pi/6, Pi/4, 5 Pi/4}]/(2 Pi)      SectorArea = a*Pi*r^2      SectorArea = a*Pi*r^2 // TeXForm      With[{a = a}, Defer[a*Pi*r^2]]      to output $$\frac{\pi/4}{2\pi}\cdot \pi r^2$$ instead, it simplifies the fraction hiding the concept i'm trying to emphasize. Any help would be much appreciated.
