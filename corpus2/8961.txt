Here is the equation I'm trying to solve:               NIntegrate[1/(E^(1/(位 T)) - 1), {位, 200, 220}] == 1000      `T` is the parameter I'm trying to work out. I tried to solve it with `InverseFunction[]` but it seemed not to work:               te[ii_] := InverseFunction[NIntegrate[1/(-1 + E^(1/(# 位))), {位, 200, 220}] &][ii]     Evaluate[te[1000]]      What's wrong with my solution? How to correct it?
