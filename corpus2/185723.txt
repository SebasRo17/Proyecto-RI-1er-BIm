We have transcripts of around 8000 videos. However, these transcripts do not have any timed text (ie: they are not time coded to the video) We are trying to ascertain whether software exists, or what approach to take to automatically time code the transcript to its associated video. Does software exist to do this? If not, what software approach would you use to accomplish this feat?
