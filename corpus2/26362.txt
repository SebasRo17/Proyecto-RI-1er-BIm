I'm trying to do triple integration on a bivariate function where one of the upper integration limits is the variable of the outer-most integration. When I execute the following lines, _Mathematica_ takes too long and also returned a not-so-useful answer. This is what I have written so far.                F[θ_, α_, β_] := CopulaDistribution[{"GumbelHougaard", θ},                            {ExponentialDistribution[α],ExponentialDistribution[β]}];      GumExpExp[x_, s_] := PDF[F[θ, α, β], {x, s}] //FullSimplify          M = β Integrate[Exp[(-δ)*(T - s + u)] x GumExpExp[x, u],                     {s, 0, T}, {u, 0, s}, {x, 1, 10}]      And this is what _Mathematica_ returns to me: > >     NIntegrate::slwcon: Numerical integration converging too slowly; suspect > one of the >     following: singularity, value of the integration is 0, highly > oscillatory integrand, >     or WorkingPrecision too small. >> >   $$ \ \beta \int_0^T\int_0^s\int_0^\infty e^{-\delta (T-s+u)}x GumExpExp[x,u]dxduds\ $$ (with $GumExpExp(x,s)$ replaced by the long expression defined in `GumExpExp[x_,s_]`). What is wrong with my function/code? Function `GumExpExp` (pdf of F) does exist. We may assume values of `theta = 1.5`, `alpha = 0.1`, `beta = 10`, and `delta =0.04`. I'd like to obtain a numerical answer to this problem.
