I've been using _Mathematica_ for years, and over time I have developed the habit of using:               Select[data, (# == 1 &)]      instead of               Select[data, # == 1 &]      I learned this by mimicking the style of more experienced users. I'm pretty sure that there are reasons for flanking the function with parentheses, but I'm not sure that I have seen a reason for why this is necessary or a good habit to get into. Would someone be able to comment?
