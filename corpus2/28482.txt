I'm trying to make it so that you do not need to rely on keyboard presses to manipulate a 3D graphic. I've done some searching, but I can't find a way to make it so that Mathematica will recognize something else as equivalent to a Shift or Ctrl press. Anyone have any ideas on how I could make a 3D Graphic fairly interactive with only a touchpad? (Pinch-to-Zoom, Two-Finger Panning, etc.)? Thanks in advance. By the way, I'm running a Logitech T651 on a Mac (I am using the Mac- compatible touchpad). The Pinch feature on the touchpad currently causes all of Mathematica to be magnified, including any interfaces or lines of code. Not sure if this helps.
