I'd like to add texture to a `Cylinder` inside `Graphics3D`. I can't see how to use `FaceForm` and tell it to use `Texture`. The problem is `Texture` needs `TextureCoordinateFunction`. I saw few solutions, but many use `ParametricPlot3D`, which I could use, but I need a solid `Cylinder`, so I would have to do the top/bottom faces manually. For example, using the solution in Applying an ArrayPlot as a texture to the surface of a cylinder I could do               mplt = MatrixPlot[Table[Sin[x y/100], {x, -10, 10}, {y, -10, 10}],         ColorFunction -> "Rainbow", Frame -> False, ImagePadding -> 0,         PlotRangePadding -> 0];     p = ParametricPlot3D[{ Cos[theta], Sin[theta], rho}, {theta, -Pi, Pi}, {rho, 0, 3},         PlotStyle -> Directive[Specularity[White, 30], Texture[mplt]],         TextureCoordinateFunction -> ({#1, #3} &), Lighting -> "Neutral",         Mesh -> None, PlotRange -> All, TextureCoordinateScaling -> True];          Graphics3D[First@p]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/g5d2V.png) But what I want is to add texture to outside surface of                 Graphics3D[Cylinder[{{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 3}}, 1], Axes -> True]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/LwQJk.png) There is solution here for 2D objects How to texturize a Disk/Circle/Rectangle? since one can find the `VertexTextureCoordinates` are easy to do for these. I think what is needed here is to tell `FaceForm` to use `Texture`? but do not know how to go about this. Version 9.01
