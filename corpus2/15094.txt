Given an integer $n$, I want to get two lists: > a) the set of pairs of the divsors $a,b$ into exactly two factors $n=a\cdot > b$, > > b) the set of pairs $a,b$ of two summands $n=a+b$. The code I came up with works, but I'd like to know if there is a more efficient/elegant or even build in alternative:                 Function[ int, {#,int/#}& /@ Divisors[int]][12]            Function[ int, {#,int-#}& /@ Range[int -1]][12]      Also, in case I want to do that later, how do I eliminate lists from a list, which only differ in order, e.g. how do I reduce `{{a,b},{b,a}}` to `{{a,b}}` ? (Side note: These problems arise in writing the code for this bigger problem)
