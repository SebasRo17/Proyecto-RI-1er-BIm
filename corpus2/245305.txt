I am about to start a Tetris clone using Java as my programming language. While I was designing how it'd be done, I've stumbled upon this question: What would be better, if any difference at all, regarding performance 1, to draw my game? For a matter of simplicity, I will use a background grid as an example. The following code will be running in the graphics update loop: 1) To perform the drawing using my `graphics g` variable, such as this               g.setColor(Color.DARK_GRAY);                                                            for(int x = 0; x < COL_COUNT; x++) {                                                        for(int y = 0; y < VISIBLE_ROW_COUNT; y++) {                                                g.drawLine(0, y * TILE_SIZE, COL_COUNT * TILE_SIZE, y * TILE_SIZE);                     g.drawLine(x * TILE_SIZE, 0, x * TILE_SIZE, VISIBLE_ROW_COUNT * TILE_SIZE);         }                                                                                   }         or 2) pre-load an image like this:               BufferedImage img = null;     try {         img = ImageIO.read(new File("grid.jpg"));     } catch (IOException e) {     }      and then use my graphics to draw it using Graphics drawImage:               g.drawImage(img, x, y, null)      1 \- _I know that a Tetris game isn't that performance-hungry, but I believe that this doesn't invalidate the question._
