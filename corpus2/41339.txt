I'm trying to figure out how to iterate through several functions that all "feed" into one-another but am having some trouble. Here are the variables:               r[1]={1,2,3}     r[2]={3,4,5}     G=1     M=2     dt=20     r1 = N[Sqrt[r[1].r[1]]];     r2 = N[Sqrt[r[2].r[2]]];     TA = N[ArcCos[r[1].r[2]/(r1 r2)]]     A = Sqrt[r1 r2 (1 + Cos[TA])]      And here are the functions:               S[z_] := N[(Sqrt[z] - Sin[Sqrt[z]])/Sqrt[z^3]]     c[z_] := N[(1 - Cos[Sqrt[z]])/z]     y[z_] := r1 + r2 - (A (1 - S[z] z))/Sqrt[c[z]]     x[z_] := Sqrt[y[z]/c[z]]     t[z_] := (x[z]^3 S[z] + A Sqrt[y[z]])/Sqrt[G M]     F[z_] := (y[z]/c[z])^(3/2) S[z] + A Sqrt[y[z]] - Sqrt[G M] t[z]     dF[z_] := (y[z]/c[z])^(3/2) (1/(2 z) (c[z] - 3/2 S[z]/c[z]) + 3/4 S[z]^2/c[z]) + (A/8) ((3 S[z] Sqrt[y[z]])/c[z] + A Sqrt[c[z]/y[z]])      and I'm trying to iteratively do the following               z[i + 1] := z[i] - F[z[i]]/dF[z[i]]      I tried using FixedPointList, but the Mathematica help files confused me more than anything once they got past the most basic examples (my knowledge of Mathematica's syntax is quite limited). I'd love it if someone would be able to help. I was extremely tempted to just do it in excel as it would be a lot simpler for me, but I feel like it should be done in Mathematica. EDIT: I've since given up trying to use FixedPointList and have decided to switch to a more intuitive While loop (I know using Whiles are frowned upon, but I like them as they allow one to break the logic down step-by-step). I've also switched from using Newton's method to a bisection method. Here is my code so far, but currently it isn't giving me any output at all (a reference to the loop algorithm is given by http://ccar.colorado.edu/~rla/documents/lambert.pdf near the end of the document):               G = 6.672*10^-11     m[0] = 1.988544*10^30     dt = 254*86400     R[1] = {6.6072*10^10, 1.31631*10^11, -3.64831*10^6}     R[2] = {-1.30112*10^11, -1.90008*10^11, -7.90975*10^8}     R1 = 1.47283*10^11     R2 = 2.30289*10^11     TA = 2 Pi - N[ArcCos[R[1].R[2]/(R1 R2)]];     A = Sqrt[R1 R2 (1 + Cos[TA])];     z = 0     zhi = 4 Pi^2     zlow = -4 Pi     c[z_] := 1/2     S[z_] := 1/6     While[Norm[t[z] - dt] > 1*10^-6,      y[z_] := R1 + R2 + (A (S[z] z - 1))/Sqrt[c[z]];      Print[y[z]];      While[A > 0 && y[z] < 0, zlow = zlow + 1];      X[z_] := Sqrt[y[z]/c[z]];      t[z_] := (X[z]^3 S[z] + A Sqrt[y[z]])/Sqrt[G m[0]];      If[t[z] <= dt, zlow = z, zhi = z];      z = (zhi + zlow)/2;      If[z > 1*10^-6, c[z_] := (1 - Cos[Sqrt[z]])/z;        S[z_] := (Sqrt[z] - Sin[Sqrt[z]])/Sqrt[z^3],        If[z < -1*10^-6, c[z_] := (1 - Cosh[Sqrt[-z]])/z;         S[z_] := (Sinh[Sqrt[-z]] - Sqrt[z])/Sqrt[(-z)^3], c[z_] := 1/2;         S[z_] := 1/6]];      Print[Norm[t[z] - dt]];]       Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you guys.
