The post is already long enough but if you want I could add it. These additional errors appears when plotting with the whole function.               FindDivisions::fdargs: "The arguments in Developer`FindDivisions[{∞,-     ∞,0.5}, 10, 10] are not supported."     ∞::indet: "Indeterminate expression 0\ (-∞) encountered."     ∞::indet: "Indeterminate expression -∞+∞ encountered."       I don't understand where I get ∞. I put the complex element to 0. If you check the output there is no ∞ value. That could happen because of the error "is not a valid vector field dataset or a valid list of datasets." When I compare data5 and data4 I see no differences in format output. It works with data5 and not with data4. The code between a) was done that way so I could plot {{By,Bz}, Norm[By,Bz]}. I couldn't find a better way. Thanks in advance.
