I would like to paint something like this ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XiK7O.jpg) or,even better, like this ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vrJcC.jpg) I have tried               colors =       {Red, Blue, Yellow, White, Black};          cells =       ConstantImage[RandomChoice[colors], #] & /@         RandomInteger[{50, 10}, {30, 2}];          ImageCollage[      cells,      Background -> Black,      Method -> "Rows",      ImagePadding -> 1,      ImageSize -> 400]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/djFWm.jpg) The result is unpleasing, especially because all rows have equal height. How could one produce a more Mondrian - like image?
