Is there a way to define functions in a stylesheet? So far I have managed to write my stylesheets without the need to use my own custom functions or definitions. For instance, maybe I have some color that I wish to use throughout my stylesheet.               myColor = RGBColor[.5,.5,.5];      The reason I would like to do this is that later on, if I change the color, every style that depends `myColor` will automatically change. This can apply to other functions that you might create. I know that I can use any built-in function I want in the stylesheets. Is there a way to define custom functions to use in a stylesheet without making a package? If making a package is the only way, how can we make sure the stylesheets that use such package load the package first so that the styles are properly defined?
