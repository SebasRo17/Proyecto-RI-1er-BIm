It looks to me like a number in a base other than base 10 gets evaluated before the evaluator ever gets a chance to be tweaked. For example, `FullForm[16^^abcdef]` or even `FullForm[HoldAll[16^^abcdef]]` both produce `11259375`. Am I missing a trick that would get me some sort of less evaluated form? I guess I can use `BaseForm[]` when I need to record what base the number originally was in.
