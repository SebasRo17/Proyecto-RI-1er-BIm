I recently wrote a couple of WordPress Themes in PHP and was wondering what license I should put on it. I don't mind users reusing my code, but I don't want them to be able to sell and redistribute my themes as I want to retain that right. I heard somewhere that an _all rights reserved_ link would stop the distributing etc... Is that true or do I need to include another license and dual license my Themes? So to sum it up I want to use a license to stop others from selling and distributing my themes, while at the same time letting others use the code if they want to.
