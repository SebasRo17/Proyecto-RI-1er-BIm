From what I know, the session information is usually saved on the server.   In Java the data is handled as a Map which I guess contains the a String identifier and an object reference which points to a memory zone from the server. Considering that, is it safe to assume that storing a `Properties` file on the session will not have a critical effect on performance? I have to handle some Language Properties files (`ResourceBundle`). For some reason I have to translate at every request at least 30 strings in one of 3 languages. This results in many conditional clauses which can be avoided by storing the Properties file on the session. **Note:** The `Properties` file is just an example. The aim of the question is to determine why and how placing an Properties object in the session differs from pacing an String object. I am aware of the size aspect but does this issue stands while all Objects are stored on the server?
