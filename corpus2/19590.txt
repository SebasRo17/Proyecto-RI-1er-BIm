Here are several equations, it seems that Mathematica couldn't plot them well, although I set PlotPoints>100                ContourPlot[Csc[1. - x^2] Cot[2. - y^2] - x*y == 0,         {x, -10, 10}, {y, -10, 10}, PlotPoints -> 120]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/LwOZ0.jpg) I tried               cf = Compile[{{d, _Real}},         Do[If[Abs[Csc[1. - x^2] Cot[2. - y^2] - x y] < 0.02,           Sow@{x, y}], {x, -10, 10, d}, {y, -10, 10, d}],         CompilationTarget -> "C", Parallelization -> True,         RuntimeOptions -> "Speed"];               Graphics[{AbsolutePointSize@1, Point@Reap[cf[0.002]][[2, 1]]}]      but I don't know how to join the points. Is there other better method do it? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/lkORL.jpg)
