Let us take CMB spectrum as an example. I get data of $C_l$ as a function of multipole moment $l$. Also, multipole moment is a function of angular scale. The question is: how to make a plot with a frame and two different scales on the x-axis as on the plot below ![CMB power spectrum](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dTG45.png) EDIT: See below for what I've done. Any easier way of doing it?               ListLogLinearPlot[a, Frame -> True,      FrameTicks -> {{Automatic,      None}, {{{10,        10}, {20, , {.006, 0}}, {30, , {.006, 0}}, {40, , {.006,         0}}, {50, , {.006, 0}}, {60, , {.006, 0}}, {70, , {.006,         0}}, {80, , {.006, 0}}, {90, , {.006, 0}}, {100,        100}, {200, , {.006, 0}}, {300, , {.006, 0}}, {400, , {.006,         0}}, {500, , {.006, 0}}, {600, , {.006, 0}}, {700, , {.006,         0}}, {800, , {.006, 0}}, {900, , {.006, 0}}, {1000,        1000}, {2000, , {.006, 0}}}, {{360, "0.5"}, {90, "2"}, {900,        "0.2"}, {9, "20"}}}}, AxesOrigin -> {10, 0}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/MQFVE.png)
