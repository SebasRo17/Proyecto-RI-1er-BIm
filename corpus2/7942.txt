My supervisor is allowing my team to dip our toes in the water of working from home. Considering a recent aquisition of another company is requiring some employees to love this new idea which will hack up to an hour off their commute into work every morning, I really want this to succeed. In order to make it a success, we need good tools to make our lives a lot easier. We currently are set up with OpenVPN, and Team Foundation Server 2010 with SharePoint 2010, and use Live Messenger (for SharePoint integration and easier remote desktop) for IM. These are just what we use (and they are currently working well) , but you can suggest other products. So, what are some great tools that will helps us collaborate, communicate, and generally work together when we're hours apart?
