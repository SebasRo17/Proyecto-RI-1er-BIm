I am currently interested in job prospects outside of my own area of programming. Specifically, I'm a web developer but want to make the transition to desktop application programming. How should I tailor my resume to show that I am capable of this type of software development when I have had no prior experience with it? This question can also be generalized for any other programmer making a leap to a different area (for example a programmer mostly experienced in finance software that wants to go into embedded systems programming). In short, I've used HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL and Javascript at work. For a short while I also used ColdFusion. I'm very familiar with OOP concepts and frameworks. In the meantime I've moonlighted for over 3 years on my personal hobby projects in C# and C++. I know it's bad focusing too much on the tools than their application as a metric to measure your abilities, but for making a transition in my career, would emphasizing knowledge in these tools be good idea to put on your resume? Problem is that a lot of jobs put programming languages as strict job requirements (see here). My resume currently shows 5 years of web development experience. I know general programming concepts well enough, and at this point my experience counts much more than my degree. _I want to know how I can make a potential employer of a software company look at my resume with cautious optimism, and not instantly reject it when it shows I have 5 years web experience with PHP and zero desktop software experience._
