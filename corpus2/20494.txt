The built-in `ImageCrop` function "effectively removes borders from _image_ whose pixel value distribution is **almost uniform** " (emphasis mine). I need an efficient cropping function which removes borders whose pixel values are **identical**. What is the best way to do this in _Mathematica_? I don't need support for 3D images, but images with an alpha channel should be supported. Here is an example of inconsistent behavior of `ImageCrop` (v. 9.0.1):               img = Rasterize[        Graphics[{Circle[{0, 0}, 1],           Text[Style[l, FontFamily -> "Times"], {1.2, 0}]}, Frame -> False,          PlotRange -> {{.9, 1.3}, All}], "Image", Background -> None];     Show[#, Frame -> True, FrameTicks -> False,         PlotRangePadding -> None] & /@ {img, ImageCrop[img],        ImagePad[img, -BorderDimensions[img, 0]]}      ![screenshot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/r83pg.png)
