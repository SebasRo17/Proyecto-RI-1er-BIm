> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Pass function or formula as function parameter I am trying to implement a simple Plot[]-like function, with the same synopsis; my first (and unique so far) try would be something along these lines:               MyPlot[f_, {var_, xmin_, xmax_}] := ListPlot[Table[{y, f[y]}, {y, xmin, xmax, (xmax - xmin)/100}]]      however I have to call the function as follows               MyPlot[Sin,{x,0,1}]      while I would prefer calling the function just like Plot[]               MyPlot[Sin[x],{x,0,1}]      I just don't know how to strip the "[x]" when a function is used as an argument to another function. This is not only a matter of consistency with Plot[], it is also needed in order to use a multi-argument function as the argument, such as:               MultiSin[x_,y_]:=Sin[x+y]/(Sqrt[x^2+y^2])     MyPlot[MultiSin[x,1],{x,0,1}]      which is not possible AFAIK with my simple re-implementation.
