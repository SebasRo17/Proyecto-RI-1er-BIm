I've looked into many open source software repositories, and I've found some common elements and somethings people do in different fashion from one another. For example, every repository has a `README` file, a `INSTALL` file, a `COPYING` file and stuff like that. Other things differ:   * Some projects, like git, have their source code in the root level, while others have the source code in a `src/` folder and others, like the Linux kernel, have the source code spread in different folders in root level, that divide code by areas;   * Some have their tests in a `t/` folder, while others in a `tests/` folder, or named otherwise;   * Some have files about submitting patches and who the maintainers are, and those might be inside some `Documentation/` or in the root level. Are there recommendations? A best practice? For example: personally, I don't like the code in the root level, git-fashion. It looks messy and confuses one trying to start as a contributor (especially because they have some code inside folders, and scripts in the root level as well, it's really messy). If I were to start a project of my own and wanted to start right from the start, are there recommendations? Best practices? How can I make a clean and clear structure? Thank you!
