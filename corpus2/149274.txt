I have been working on a Mysql db design which keyword based search seems to be necessary. Main table has two columns:               id | Title      For each entry, users will be required to enter 4 or 5 keywords. I think using a seperate table for keywords would be better. I would like to learn if there is any difference between these two designs in terms of performance, scalability and management. There will be millions of rows in the main table.               id | keywords     1  | 1kword1, 1kword2, 1kword3     2  | 2kword1, 2kword2, 2kword3      Or               id | keyword     1  | 1kword1      2  | 1kword2      3  | 1kword3     4  | 2kword1      5  | 2kword2      6  | 2kword3
