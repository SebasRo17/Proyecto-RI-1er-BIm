Are there any languages or even servers that instead of running a script on page load, (Apache/PHP, Ruby on Rails, ...) actually keep the code loaded and running forever, and when it receives a connection it calls a function of that code? (Like a PageLoad event basically?) I didn't really know how to call this so I went for Passive Web Server because the code is basically sleeping till an event occurs, instead of fully unloaded or just cached.
