I would like to determine the determinant of a 4x4 matrix with the entries `a[i,j]` being functions of $i$ and $j$. I used Compile with code: * * *               m4 = Table[a[i, j], {i, 4}, {j, 4}];          variable = Det[m4];     soln = Compile[{{a[i, j], _Real}}, Evaluate[variable]];          soln       * * * How do I declare that the function `a[i_,j_]` can be an arbitrary real number? The terms of `Det[m4]` are output correctly but Mathematica does not recognise `a[i,j] = 0` for $i=j$. Can you help, please?
