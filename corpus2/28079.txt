FindRoot[{F[A, V] == V - i, D[F[A, V], V] == 1}, {A, 0.01}, {V, 1.01}]      I think this should be an easy question, but I am new to _Mathematica_ and can not figure it out. Variable `x` is what I would like to obtain, and given the parameters values at the beginning of the code, the value of `x` can be found. It should be 6.3632. Here is the question: how can I change the code and establish a loop to evaluate the values of `x` with σ taking different values, like ranging from 0.1 to 0.2 in step of 0.01. Thus, σ is no longer a constant input as presented in my code but a iterating variable. Also, if it is convenient, how can I plot `x` against the values of σ?
