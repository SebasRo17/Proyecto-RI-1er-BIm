I am trying to get some symbolic expressions in Mathematica which I would like to paste into my C/MATLAB codes. This can be accomplished nicely by selecting the expression and right-clicking to select `Copy as plain-text`. However there is one small issue I have. Consider the simplest possible case for 2 symbols `a` and `b`               In[1]:= c = a*b               Out[1]= a b      How can I tell Mathematica to produce all its output as `a*b` and not `a b` Without this, I have to go through the pain of replacing manually all spaces in my C/MATLAB codes with the `*` espcecially for long expressions.
