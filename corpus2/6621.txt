From the reference here, Clear complains that a variable is not a symbol or a string? This could be done by                    << Notation`                Symbolize[NotationBoxTag[\(\[Lambda] \_ 0\)]]      or possibly                     Unset[Subscript[\[Lambda], 0]]      But then when I tried to reassign a value to $\lambda_0$, I got warning "Cannot assign to raw object Subscript[[Lambda], 0]"                     Subscript[\[Lambda], 0]= 1                During evaluation of In[252]:= Set::setraw: Cannot assign to raw object Subscript[\[Lambda], 0]. >>                Out[252]= Subscript[\[Lambda], 0]      When I enter $1$, it output $\lambda_0$                     In[25]:= 1                Out[25]= Subscript[\[Lambda], 0]      No help with following commands:                      Clear[Subscript]                  RemoveSymbolize[NotationBoxTag[\(\[Lambda] \_ 0\)]]      The "DownValues[Subscript]" is empty.
