After experiencing quite a lot of problems with our small project's manager (we're a startup, and he's the only guy who has the appropriate education; the rest of us are programmers), we have finally identified the cause of our troubles: his understanding of the inner works of our project is limited, as is his understanding of a normal software development workflow. He has expressed the desire to quickly learn and to fill these gaps; however, I don't really know what books, articles or blogs to recommend to him. In short, can you recommend a good reading for a manager-type person who is not going to be a developer himself, but needs to understand web application development process well enough to understand our explanations when he requests them? P.S. No, kicking him and finding another manager is not an option at this moment.
