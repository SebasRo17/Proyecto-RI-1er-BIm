I recently stumbled upon the Cycloid and was working on finding its length and such when I found this animation on Wikipedia. ![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Cycloid_f.gif) Strikingly pretty and small in size too (66KB) So on searching how he made that particular animation and others I stumbled upon this talk > What software edited the animations? > > ... None at all. I used MSVC++ to write a little program that calls some > GDI+ functions and draws a multi-layer TIF picture each layer of which is a > single frame (Only Math, C++ & some Windows API that are well-documented). > ... I went on searching libraries to program with but ultimately quit because it was too much of a bother. Somewhile later I saw this and thank goodness the author used a software package (MuPAD). But the software costs a lot and is now part of MATLAB, and the size of the `.gif` was way too large. Finally I've come back to Mathematica and want to know how to go about it. Don't just tell me the code right away; give me some pointers, text, documentation, other questions, etc. EDIT : Thank you people, here's my rendering (not exactly, because I used J.M.'s code) ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xTRNt.gif)
