I am currently working on a project with a small dev team. The problem is that the lead programmer is "working remotely", and does virtually no work. We have missed every deadline, and at this rate we will miss many more. The lead programmer is a great talker, and has convinced the CEO that everything is fine. It doesn't bother me that he gets paid for doing nothing. What bothers me is that he is harming every single employee and destroying the company. It's clear from our project management tool that the lead programmer hasn't delivered most of his tasks. The idea to critique the code and not the programmer ( My coworker is a nice guy, but his performance is sub-par. Do I tell my boss?) is great, but the problem is not the quality of the code. The problem is that code is not being created. I feel like I should tell the CEO what is going on, but I also feel like it's not fair to the lead programmer to go behind his back and tell the boss that he is not doing work. The other problem is that the boss is very direct. I think he will call the lead programmer and say, "This guy says that you aren't doing anything. What's going on?" The result will be that nothing will get solved and the lead programmer will get pissed off, making it difficult to work with him.
