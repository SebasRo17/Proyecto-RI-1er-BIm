I have a method which has external dependencies within the method. Please help me in writing a junit test case for the below program.                   @Override         public void methodToTest(String user){                //fetch the values from the properties file. Config class has a static method called           //getProperty which reads the values from the environment specific property file.           String url = Config.getProperty("serviceurl");           String username = Config.getProperty("serviceusername");           String password = Config.getProperty("servicepassword");                //Connect to an external service.           Service service = new Service(url, username, password);                //invoke the method on the service.           String returnValue = service.registerUser(user);                if (returnValue.equals("failure")){             throw new Exception("User could not be registered");           }         }      **Note:**   1. The method overrides the superclass method so that I cannot change the arguments to contain the url, username and password.   2. The method also connects to an external service. which is environment specific. The environment details is taken from the properties file.
