Recently, I was approached by a local ad agency with a job opportunity. They are bringing all web/interactive development in-house and adding to their development team. I'm growing sick of my cushy, yet boring corporate job, and am intrigued by the position. Having only worked for software shops where the primary business was making software, I worry that they may not put emphasis on quality software practices, since development is not the focus of their business. Could anyone with experience at both compare/contrast working at a software company with working at a company that just happens to have an in-house software development team or department?
