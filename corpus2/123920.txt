Is there a way to measure the success of an agile project as it relates to a well defined outcome? For example, I've pair coded Conway's game of life with 12 people using TDD, and each time it was different, but the goal of implementing a fully working version of the program was the same everytime. Clearly that's an extreme example, and most projects will not be that small, or well defined in scope, but it's just an attempt to express the concept I'm presenting, and which I'm looking to better understand.
