I want to make a delicate application of mine (an antivirus actually) open source but I want to have a control on who really obtains the source or not. Preferably they should apply and I or administrators approve their applications. Is there any online platform for this? The main reason for the control/security is to possibly prevent malware makers to easily discover how to bypass the stealth checking methods it utilizes for malware detection. Edit: I am looking for advice - possibly to hear from someone who has done something similar. Thanks!
