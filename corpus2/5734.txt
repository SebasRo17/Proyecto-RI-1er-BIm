**Background:** Using the settings under Edit-> Preferences->Evaluation I can redirect all the Print statments to the console. ![Settings dialog](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IEWWC.png) What I'd really like to do is redirect just some specific `Print` statements to the console. I know I can print to another notebook with something like:               PrintToNotebook[nb_, expr_] := (         SelectionMove[nb, After, Cell];         NotebookWrite[nb, Cell[BoxData[ToBoxes[expr]], "Print"]])       So perhaps this boils down to finding the "Console Handle"? **Question: How can I create a function (eg`PrintToConsole`) that behaves like `Print` but outputs to the console?** **EDIT** Turns out the trick is in `MessagesNotebook[]`. This is what I'm currently using               ClearAll[PrintToConsole]     $OldLine = -1;         PrintToConsole[            expr_] := (SelectionMove[MessagesNotebook[], After, Cell];            NotebookWrite[MessagesNotebook[],              Cell[BoxData[ToBoxes[expr]], "Print",               CellLabel ->  "During evaluation of In[" <> ToString@$Line <> "]:=",           ShowCellLabel -> ($OldLine =!= $Line)]];        $OldLine = $Line;);     PrintToConsole[        expr__] := (SelectionMove[MessagesNotebook[], After, Cell];        NotebookWrite[MessagesNotebook[],          Cell[BoxData[ToBoxes[Row@{expr}]], "Print",           CellLabel -> "During evaluation of In[" <> ToString@$Line <> "]:=",              ShowCellLabel -> ($OldLine =!= $Line)]];            $OldLine = $Line;);
