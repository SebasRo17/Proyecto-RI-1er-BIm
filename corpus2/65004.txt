It happens in my workplace that when a product is finished, and just some weeks before it is released and the project is closed, some business considerations remain about features that are wanted for future versions. A revision is made about the features when the project is closed, and the clients and stakeholders, along with the team decided, for example, that they want to open a new project that has as objective to create a new version of the project that includes some new requirements. Now this is a typical case, but it happened before that the team that made the product, now works for another company and a new fresh team is formed to do this project. I know Agile aims to give value to interactions rather than documentation, but how does Agile manages this? How do you continue a new project to extend an already existing product without documentation?
