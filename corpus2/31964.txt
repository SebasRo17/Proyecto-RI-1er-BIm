I have an application using `InputField` to allow a user to dynamically update a data structure. In some cases the user will want to remove a string from one field and paste it into another. If this is done using cut and paste everything works okay, and the underlying data updates to reflect what is seen in the GUI. However, if the string is moved using drag and drop, the `Dynamic` in the source field does not appear to register the change of contents, although the destination field works as expected. Here's an example:               test = {"string", ""};     Column[{       InputField[Dynamic[test[[1]]], String],       InputField[Dynamic[test[[2]]], String],       Dynamic[test]       }]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xhL3k.png) If I now drag and drop the string from the upper field into the lower field I get this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GYxGP.png) The upper input field is now empty but `test[[1]]` still contains `"string"`. This is a problem, because normally the `Dynamic[test]` line won't be there so the user relies on the input fields to correctly show the actual contents of `test`. How can I fix this?
