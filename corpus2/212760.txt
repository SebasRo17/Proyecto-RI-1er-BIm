I am doing work for a company that is wanting to put all their .Net applications (web applications, Windows applications and console applications) together in a single Visual Studio solution. I am looking for experience from developers who either structure their own applications this way or who work in a company that does this. Is this a good idea?   * What are the pro's/con's to putting all your applications in a single solution rather than having separate solutions for each application?    * How fast is Visual Studio with a solution of 20+ projects?    * And how stable is the solution file with source-controlled concurrent development?
