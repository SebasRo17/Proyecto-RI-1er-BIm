Here's the problem with MWE:               Framed[       FlipView[Framed /@ {100, 1}, Alignment -> Center]       ,        ImageSize -> {100, 150}, Alignment -> Center]      > ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TuTVz.png) I find the following behaviour unexpected, undesired, possible bug:   * while `mouse key is pressed` now visible **next** object **left** edge is aligned to **current** object **left** edge ( _invisible alread_ ). But it should not be dependent and be aligned as the options are stated.   * after releasing the mouse key it is aligned correctly according to options. This makes horrible jumping each time.
