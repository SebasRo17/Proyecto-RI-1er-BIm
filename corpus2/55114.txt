This question is related to: Composition of functions using slots `Slot` (#) interfering with evaluation Consider a toy example:                list1 = { {a1, b1, c1, d1}, {a2, b2, c2, d2}, {a3, b3, c3, d3} };      I’d like to take elements from the list as follows example:               {#1, #2}@@@ list1      But I’d like to able to define #1, #2 programmatically. I tried:               n=1;     {Slot@Evaluate[n], Slot@Evaluate[n + 1]} & @@@ list1      But it gives me an error… Answers appreciated. **Even better if the answer uses the # notation rather than the Slot function.**
