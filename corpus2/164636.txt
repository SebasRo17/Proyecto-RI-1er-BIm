I have an idea for a personal iOS project that I would like to write and release to the iOS store. I'm the type of developer who enjoys developing and publishing. I want to write quality software and take care of my customers. Assuming that I wrote an application that had reasonable success, there is a fair chance that I would want to sell the ownership rights of the app to another party and I'd use the proceeds to develop my next personal project which, in turn, I'd probably want to sell in the future. With that said, what are some general guidelines for creating, making and publishing an iOS project that I will eventually want to transfer to another company/developer? I know this is a bit of a broad question, but I request that the given advice be a general list of tips, suggestions and pitfalls to avoid. If any particular bullet point on your list needs more explanation, I'll either search for the answer or post a new question specific to that requirement. Thank you! **Note Regarding this Question** I am posting this question on Programmers.SO because I think that this is an issue of software architecting, seeking advice for setting a new application project and publishing a project to the Apple iOS store-- all within the requirements for questions on this site. **UPDATE** \- 2012-09-14 I would further like to request that if anyone is aware of a good article on a case study of such a transition, I would consider that a good answer as well. Such an article may not have all the answers, but it could outline quite a few of the pitfalls which should be avoided. Apps are sold to other holding companies on a semi-frequent basis. Often, it happens when a small app becomes a runaway success and a bigger company wants to purchase the ownership and rights. I've had difficulty finding any information on this topic (probably my poor googling skills.) Most keywords that I tend to search also relate to promoting an app so that people will download it. Thanks for your insight.
