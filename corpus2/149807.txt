I’m an EA in an organisation with 10000+ employees. Strategically we are heading towards SOA. Currently I’m researching about SOA’s and creating a road map and I have come over many blogs that talk about “SOA is dead”. We can all agree that SOA is not just web-services. The problem is that I have hard to find any information on the reason behind SOA-fail stories in enterprises. What went bad and what went right? My question is: **What are common SOA mistakes in enterprises that make SOA fail in long term? Is the any best practice for SOA? What are the most important requirements for a successful SOA in an enterprise?** It would be good feedback towards our SOA strategy in this organisation. I have tried to narrow down the question, but it’s hard due to the nature of the question.
