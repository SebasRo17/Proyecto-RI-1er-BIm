I have made a program that goes like this, the goal is to estimate the remaining time of a function (it is running a bunch of **solveChase[]** functions with different parameters which can be seen in the best answer of this question):               count=0;     count2=0;     precision=100;          Table[         {             Do[{                 Somefunction[var],                 count2++                 },                 {precision}             ];             count2=0;             count++;         },         {i,3},         {i,3}     ]      If in another cell I put:               Print[Dynamic@Round[100 (precision count + count2)/(precision max1 max2),.01], "%" ];      (which shows the percentage of all the process, from 0 to 100%) That value will change, but because of _SomeFunction[var]_ (a NDSolve result which its running time depends on i and j) not in a linear way. It has different rates of change in some parts, so it has a velocity which is **not** constant and **can** be calculated. This is a example(sorry for bad quality): ![example of not linear remaining time on some calculations](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SBjtz.gif) * * * My guess is to insert another variable _t_ , which depends on time, and then do something with it, but I don't know how to do it. Any help will be appreciated.
