Consider the following (Microsoft-sanctioned) code:               <% using (Html.Form<HomeController>(action=>action.Index())) { %>              <input type="text" id="search" />              <input type="button" value="Submit" />          <% } %>      The `using` statement has but one purpose here: _to add a`</form>` tag to the end of the generated HTML._ This feels dirty to me, for what I hope are obvious reasons:   1. It's not `using`'s raison d'etre.   2. It deliberately causes side-effects.   3. It's not intuitive that `Html.Form` would implement `IDisposable`.   4. The `using` statement is not actually required, but `Html.Form` will break without it (unless you emit `</form>` yourself, which kinda misses the whole point). This is not the only abuse that people have heaped onto the `using` pattern. The question is, is there a viable alternative that provides the same stylistic/readability benefits as `using`, without making you feel like taking a shower afterwards?
