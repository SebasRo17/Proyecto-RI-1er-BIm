Problem of `RuleDelayed`               NameList = {"a", "b", "c", "d"};          rules = Table[NameList[[i]] <> "=" ~~ x__ ~~ "\n" :> NameList[[i]] <>                    "=" ~~ OptionValue["Position"] ~~ "\n", {i, Length@NameList}];      output of `rules[[1]]` is               a=~~x__~~  :>NameList[[i]]<>=~~OptionValue[Position]~~      Here, since I used `RuleDelayed`, `NameList` in the right-hand side is not evaluated. One workaround is to use Rule, but `Rule` may cause some warning errors concerning not a string.               rules = Table[k = i; NameList[[i]] <> "=" ~~ x__ ~~ "\n" -> NameList[[k]] <> "=" ~~                    OptionValue["Position"] ~~ "\n", {i, Length@NameList}];          rules[[1]]          (*         a=~~x__~~->a=~~OptionValue[Position]~~     *)      How to solve that in the `RuleDelayed` case? the effect like the `Rule` case?
