Conundrum: During the course of working on a new feature or fixing a defect, you find a legacy problem in code. What should you do? Fix it and risk altering the behavior of the code. It has either been working up until now by some fluke, or else the defect has not been detected or worth anyone's time to report. Should you leave it alone and allow the problem to make the code harder to work with later? Fixing the problem will only add to the time of your original task and force you to regression test. Few will appreciate the work. Fixing it, however, seems right somehow. Code with fewer problems is easier to refactor and build upon. I've been finding myself in this situation time and time again as we work to modernize a web application. I can't tell if I'm being obsessive or honorable when I go off-tangent working on these old bugs. How do you handle these situations? Thanks, Corey
