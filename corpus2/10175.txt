Recently, I learned that it is possible to assign "types" to function arguments in the definition of a function. Suppose I have a function `stringFun` that does some operation (e.g., `StringSplit`) on an input string `str`. I could define the function in this way:               stringFun[str_] := StringSplit[str]      Or, I could define the argument `str_` as being of type `String`:               stringFun[str_String] := StringSplit[str]      What other argument "types" exist in Mathematica? Can I use, for example, `Real`, `List`, or `Table`? I am using Mathematica 7, and I am having some difficulty locating a list of "types" in the documentation. Thanks for your time.
