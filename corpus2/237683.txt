I've recently come across a Python library on GitHub. The library is great, but contains one glaring typo in a function name. Let's call it `dummy_fuction()` while it should be `dummy_function()`. This function is definitely "in the wild" and most likely used in embedded systems. The first thing that springs to mind is to add a second version of the function with the correct name and add a deprecation warning to the first version for the next release. Three questions:   1. Could the approach above have any unintended consequences?   2. Is there a standard approach to this kind of problem?   3. How long should any deprecation warning be left in place?
