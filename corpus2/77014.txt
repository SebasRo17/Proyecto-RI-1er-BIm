I'm currently employed with what is basically a startup company, I took the job to gain more experience on the platform I want to work on. I want to entertain options for possibly moving into a new position with a more stable company but have had some issues when posting my resume (I seem to get a large volume of contact from recruiters, etc) including   * lots of messages from people recruiting for jobs out of my area which I have no interest in   * people recruiting for jobs that are not what I am looking for (for a different language, etc than I currently work on, which I have no interest in)   * within my metro area, people recruiting for jobs that are still far away (its a very spread out, suburbanized area) to where the commute is simply too far for my preference. I've made a few attempts to "put myself out there" to open some lines of communication but then I start getting a lot of calls to where I can't reasonably even answer the phone during the day or I wouldn't get much work done. What I am asking is what steps I should take to narrow down the amount of people contacting me, I figure I could try taking out any keywords for other languages form my resume (even though I had them in there originally to show a diversity in previous experience) and specifically stating my preference on location, commute, etc but I am not sure they will actually read this to heed my expectations. I've taken the stance that I'd like to be able to talk to them via email first just to narrow down whether this is even a position that makes sense for me to pursue. They always seem to just want to get me on the phone without providing any info upfront, sometimes they will leave a phone message then email me later (after I don't call them back). Should I just email them back basically with a few initial questions and say that I'm not able to talk on the phone until I know if its even a possible fit? I'm rambling a bit here but I guess I am wondering how not to turn off the people who may have good opportunities but also be protective of my time because there seem to be a lot of recruiters who are just taking the "contact as many people as I can" approach
