here's the link of the app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iatll.airlock I had studied AI in the final year of b.tech cs programme, and i do remember some algorithm of generating and solving the 8 puzzle game; we had to implement it in Prolog (tough times) But I'm not sure if the above mentioned app uses that same algorithm. Where do I need to look to create a puzzle game like that? They seriously couldn't have designed each level by hand right? Had to be computer generated. How can I so that? pardon me for not formatting, I'm on a mobile device.
