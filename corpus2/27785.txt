I would like to dedicate a small machine to exclusively running a Mathematica kernel and use that kernel to read http requests arriving on port 80, treat them and send http responses back **without any web server or extra software of any kind**. Requests are to be treated in sequence (only 1 connection shall be supported at a time). Clearly webMathematica is an overkill here. Any ideas?
