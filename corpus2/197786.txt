I have a commercial application that uses a Qt Solutions component. Until recently, this component was licensed under the LGPL license, so I was forced to use the component in the form of a shared library. According to this post http://qt.digia.com/Product/Qt-Add-Ons/Qt-Solutions-Archive/, the Qt solutions have been re-licensed with the BSD license reproduced below. My question is, can I mow use the source code directly in my application or do I still need to create a shared library?
