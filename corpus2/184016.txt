If I'll begin developing cross platform applications, The complied file speed is very important for me . I have research before than and find same result about IDE : (I ignored eclipse because very java base, but not complete) for IDE : >   1. NetBeans C/C++ IDE . >   2. CodeBlocks . >   3. CodeLite . >   4. or others . > And for complier || framework || toolkit : >   1. QT toolkit or UnitTest++ . >   2. gnu g++ . >   3. gnu gcc . >   4. wxWidgets . >   5. cygwin . >   6. VC++ . >   7. or others. > But I watch to some QT apps are very dependent to QT's libs :( , It's not good and decrease speed. Now my real question if I want start project what is the best IDE with debugger ,what is the best compiler that give fast speed native code to me, or I force use multi-compiler for any OS ? & please say your reason why that IDE & why that complier.
