When I use the form `Export["file", list, "Table"]` to export a list to Excel, I get columns of lists. I want my Excel sheet to have each list element in a separate column. For example,               Export["file.xls", {{2, 5}, {5, 7}}, "Table"]      Gives the output > >     {2,5} >     {5,7} >   I want those lists above to be split up. How do I do this?
