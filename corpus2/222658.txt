I'm interested in creating an chess endgame solving engine. The endgames in chess are usually solved using the endgame table-bases generated by `retrograde algorithm`. I have found that Artificial Intelligence and Genetic Algorithms have been applied to the chess programming. However, before starting the implementation I wanted to find out whether the chess endgames can be played without the endgame tablebases? If yes, then what are the pros and cons of these alternatives to endgame tables? Are there any other algorithms known for this problem?
