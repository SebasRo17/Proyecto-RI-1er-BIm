I went for an interview yesterday where I was asked this question: "How does having assets (images/videos) stored on a secondary domain (assets.example.com) reduce the load time of example.com?" To that I answered that by having the code "call" those assets from a secondary website it reduces the traffic that is coming to the main domain and therefore only applying bandwidth to the main domain vs having to also serve bandwidth to request assets. Is that correct? Also, If i am correct, would you say it makes sense to start new websites with this in mind or do you prefer having it done after large traffic rates are achieved?
