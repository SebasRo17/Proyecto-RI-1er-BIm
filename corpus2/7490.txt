I wrote a notebook on Mac OS 10.7.4 and run it on Windows XP at work. On my Mac I use a full version of Mathematia 8.0.1.0, whereas on the Windows-system only a trial version (Version 8.0.4.0.). First of all I cannot run the following code on the Windows system (on Mac it works perfect):               ImportData={{"Test1", 5670.`, 0.`, 180.`, 2756.`, 2443.`, 180.`, 1008.`, 2007.`},                 {"Test2", 100.`, 0.`, 3006.`, 1235.`, 9874.`, 4543.`, 3241.`, 5004.`}};           WhitespaceCleaning[string_] :=           StringReplace[           string, (StartOfString ~~ Whitespace) | (Whitespace ~~                EndOfString) :> ""]          OriginalData =        Drop[ImportData, 1] /. {a_, b_, cc_, d_, e_, f_, g_, h_, i_} ->       {WhitespaceCleaning@a, {b, cc, d, e, f, g, h, i}};      However I can get the same result as on my Mac with the following code for my Windows system:               allData=ImportData;     numData=allData[[All,2;;]]     strings0=allData[[All,1]];     stringsWOSpacing=WhitespaceCleaning/@strings0;     OriginalData=Transpose[{stringsWOSpacing,numData}]      The rest of my code runs perfect (I get the same results on both operating systems). However, running my code on Windows provokes many messages (such as Divide::index, Divide::infy, Power::infy, General::stop, Less::nord, LessEqual::nord) which does not happen on my Mac. I don't understand why Mathematica on my Windows system is acting so odd. Does anyone has an idea?
