As suggested in this earlier post, I restate my question here about appending `CellTags` option to existing list of `Cells`. What I have for the moment:               listOef = {};          SelectionMove[this, Before, Notebook];     SelectionMove[this, Next, Cell];     SelectionMove[this, Next, Cell];     Do[      (       SelectionMove[this, Next, CellGroup];       AppendTo[listOef, NotebookRead[this]]       )       , {i, aantalVragen}]      This copies cells I give in the `EvaluationNotebook[]` to the list `listOef`. I now want to write this list to the new notebook `nb` after permuting its elements randomly with               allPermutations = Table[RandomPermutation[aantalVragen], {aantalToetsen}];      like this:                Do[       (NotebookWrite[nb,         Permute[listOef, allPermutations[[toetsNummer]]][[vraagNummer]]];        ),      {vraagNummer, aantalVragen}]      In this `Do[]` command, I would like to add Labels to every cell during the `NotebookWrite` command: its label would be `"vraagNummer"`, the counter which goes from `1` to `aantalVragen`, which is given at the beginning of the document. I'd like to have something like this:               SetOptions[ Cell, CellLabel->"vraag"<>ToString[vraagNummer] ]      but this doesn't seem to work. How can I address the cell which has just been written by `NotebookWrite`? Or how would you suggest to do this using this structure? Thanks for all help!
