**Background:** I have just started at a new shop, where there is one other developer. This shop was not historically a software shop, and their software development process really shows it. They recently started using subversion (although most of the code is not in a repository), and they do not have a bug tracker. They sell desktop software, and more recently mobile GPS devices with proprietary software. This seems pretty unsustainable. **My problem:** My manager seems amenable to installing Trac and integrating it with subversion. He's asked me to write a proposal for the company owners about it to justify why I might spend my valuable time fiddling with a Trac installation, and why we might change the development process to include formal bug reports and feature requests. I have been trying to come up with reasons that matter to people other than me (e.g., not: "So I can see the whole story about why someone wrote this now- buggy code.") and sort of falling flat. I'm not a manager, and I don't know a lot about managing things. I just want to avoid the headaches attendant with coding in the wild west. **My Question:** How do I (politely) tell managers that it's in their best interest to use Trac?
