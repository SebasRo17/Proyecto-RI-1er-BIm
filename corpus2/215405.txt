I'm preparing for a test and doing practice questions, this one in particular I am unsure I did correctly: We are given a very simple UML diagram to demonstrate inheritance: I hope this is clear, it shows that W inherits from V and so on:                                 |-----Y     V <|----- W<|-----|                       |-----X<|----Z      and this code:               public X method1(){....}     method2(new Y());     method2(method1());     method2(method3());      **The questions and my answers:**   1. **Q:** What types of objects could method1 actually return? **A:** X and Z, since the method definition includes X as the return type and since Z is a kind of X is would be OK to return either.   2. **Q:** What could the parameter type of method2 be? **A:** Since method2 in the code accepts Y, X and Z (as the return from method1), the parameter type must be either V or W, as Y,X and Z inherit from both of these.   3. **Q:** What could return type of method3 be? **A:** Return type of method3 must be V or W as this would be consistent with answer 2.
