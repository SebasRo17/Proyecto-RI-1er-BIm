I have noticed a recent trend in requesting programmers who are _rockstars_. I get it, they're looking for someone who is really good at what they do. But why (pray) make the reference to a rockstar? Do these companies really want these traits as a real rockstar?   * Party all night and wake up to take care of quick business in the morning?   * Substance abuse,   * Narcissism with celebrity,   * Compensation well exceeding their management,   * Excellent at putting on a short-lived show,   * Entertainment instead of value,   * 1 hit (project) wonders or single-genre performers,   * Et cetera What is wrong with _Senior_ or _Principal_ Software Engineer who has an established and proven passion for the business? Rather do we mean quite the opposite, someone who:   * rolls up the sleeves and gets to work,   * takes appropriate direction and helps influence teams,   * programs in lessons' learned and proper practices,   * provides timely communication to the whole team,   * can code and understand multiple languages,   * understands the science and theory behind computation, Is there a trend to diversify the software engineering ranks? **How many software rockstars can you hire before your band starts breaking up?** Sure, there are lots of folks doing this stuff on their own, maybe even a rare few who do coding for show, but I wager the majority is for business. I don't see ads for rockstar accountants, or rockstar machinists, or rockstart CFOs. What makes the software programmer and their hiring departments lean towards this kind of job title?
