Consider the following code:               ClearAll[K, L, λ, q, r, w]          TC[K_, L_, q] := w*L + r*K + 10*q     Phi[K_, L_, λ_] := TC[K, L, q] - λ*(10*K^(4/5)*(L - 40)^(1/5) - q)     Phi[K, L, λ]          FullSimplify[{       D[Phi[K, L, λ], K],       D[Phi[K, L, λ], L],       D[Phi[K, L, λ], λ]       }]          FullSimplify[      Solve[{        D[Phi[K, L, λ], K] == 0,        D[Phi[K, L, λ], L] == 0,        D[Phi[K, L, λ], λ] == 0        }, {K, L, λ}]      ]          r = 64;     w = 32;     FullSimplify[TC[K, L, q]]      Is it possible to automatically assign the real-valued solutions for `K` and `L` to get the output               2 (640 + (5 + 4 2^(1/5)) q)      with executing the last command? **Update** After hints from Artes, I've managed to always get the function `TC` for real- valued `K` and `L`. However, how do I print only the _real-values_ [which I forgot to mention the first time I updated the question] of `K` and `L` when I solve the system of equations? When executing               F[k_, l_] := 10*k^(4/5)*(l - 40)^(1/5)     TC[k_, l_, q_] := w*l + r*k + 10*q     Phi[k_, l_, λ_] := TC[k, l, q] - λ*(F[k, l] - q)     expressions = {D[Phi[k, l, λ], k], D[Phi[k, l, λ], l], D[Phi[k, l, λ, λ]};     FullSimplify[Solve[expressions == {0, 0, 0}, {k, l, λ}]]      I get five solutions;               {{k -> (q w^(1/5))/(5 2^(3/5) r^(1/5)),        l -> 40 + (q r^(4/5))/(20 2^(3/5) w^(4/5)), λ] -> (        r^(4/5) w^(1/5))/(        4 2^(3/5))}, {k -> -(((-1)^(1/5) q w^(1/5))/(5 2^(3/5) r^(1/5))),        l -> 40 - ((-1)^(1/5) q r^(4/5))/(20 2^(3/5) w^(4/5)), λ ->         r^(4/5) w^(1/5) Root[-1 + 8192 #1^5 &, 2]}, {k -> ((-1)^(2/5) q w^(         1/5))/(5 2^(3/5) r^(1/5)),        l -> 1/40 (1600 + ((-2)^(2/5) q r^(4/5))/w^(           4/5)), λ -> ((-1)^(2/5) r^(4/5) w^(1/5))/(        4 2^(3/5))}, {k -> -(((-1)^(3/5) q w^(1/5))/(5 2^(3/5) r^(1/5))),        l -> 40 - ((-(1/2))^(3/5) q r^(4/5))/(         20 w^(4/5)), λ -> -(((-1)^(3/5) r^(4/5) w^(1/5))/(         4 2^(3/5)))}, {k -> ((-1)^(4/5) q w^(1/5))/(5 2^(3/5) r^(1/5)),        l -> 40 + ((-1)^(4/5) q r^(4/5))/(         20 2^(3/5) w^(4/5)), λ -> ((-1)^(4/5) r^(4/5) w^(1/5))/(        4 2^(3/5))}}      P.S. `q`, `r`, and `w` are all positive numbers.
