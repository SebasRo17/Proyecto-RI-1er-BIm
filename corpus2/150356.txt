I'd like to reach out to the community on this one. As a software developer, I'm not an expert salesperson or marketing guru - I think in code and not much else. Most developers I come across are like this and also tend to be serious penny-pinchers. Let's say, as a developer, I recently released a new software product that I'm pretty sure will be a hit IF people only knew about it. Assume a budget of $0.00 and limited time each day (i.e. 30 to 60 minutes). What can I do, within those limitations, to maximize exposure? If possible, please back up your reply with at least two working examples.
