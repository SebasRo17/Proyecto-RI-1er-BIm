I cannot understand the difference between `Apply`, `Scan`, and `Map`. I have tried to play with these function by the codes below:               f[x_] := x^2      * * *               Map[f, {{a, b}, c}]      Output:               {{a^2, b^2}, c^2}      * * *                Apply[f, {{a, b}, c}]      Output:               f[{a, b}, c]      * * *               Scan[f, {{a, b}, c}]      There is no output for this one. The function of `Map` is understandable. But I cannot get the purpose of `Apply` and `Scan`. What are the differences between these three function?
