I read this question and the most voted answer and said to myself "Those things are what I want to do! But why the heck I'm not doing it?" The problem here is that I can't get anything started. I hope you get some kind of idea what I'm interested in and can help me continue programming. I'm interested in embedded programming and I'd like to learn some ARM assembly. I think those could be combined with image processing. Also I'd love to create programs that are actually useful to some people but it seems like there are already multiple programs for pretty much every purpose. Maybe if I found an interesting program without open source alternatives I could get a great project to work on. How could I get myself to finally start a project or few and keep myself interested in them? I just want to get myself to do something I love.
