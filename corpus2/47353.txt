Version 9 has a new option `Legended`, which I find appealing since it should allow me to add individual expressions/curves to a legend, but it doesn't seem to be working for expressions in `Plot` or `LogLinearPlot`. For example, I would like to plot $log(x)$ and $x sin(x)$ together but only have $log(x)$ appear in the legend, I try:               LogLinearPlot[{Legended[Log[x], "Log(x)"], x Sin[x]}, {x, 1, 100}]      and the curve for $Log(x)$ just disappears instead of appearing on it's own in the legend. If `Legended` is not supposed to be used with the "`Plot`..." family of symbols, then could someone suggest an alternative solution to my problem?
