In .NET Framework, localized strings are located in an XML file (or multiple files). Those files are part of the project and are committed to the source control as any other source code file. Usually, Visual Studio is used to display those files as a table and edit the localized strings. I work in a small team on a product which should have a multilingual interface.   1. As a developer, I draft the localized strings in both languages, given that the translation may be inexact,   2. Another person from the team (a non-developer) reviews the content in both languages and corrects it if needed. The current issue is that the non-developer person would not use neither source control, nor an IDE, since it would be too cumbersome and difficult (version control _is_ difficult for non-developers) for this person. An alternative solution would be for me to export the localized strings as an Excel file, wait for this person to review the Excel, then to re-import the modified strings. The caveat here is that I may be creating other strings, renaming existing ones, etc., making it difficult to diff the local version with the reviewed one. What to do? How does it happen in other teams?
