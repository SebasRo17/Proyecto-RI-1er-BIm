In a stackOverflow question I have read that using a GUI designer program can generate lots of messy code and is considered to be a bad practice unless you're making smaller programs. My question is why and how. Is it bad to use a GUI designer program? Why? Additional details:   * Programming on a Windows platform;   * Only programming in C++/Java for windows programs.   * For IDE I've been using visual studio 2010 (Not the express edition) since it comes with the GUI designer.
