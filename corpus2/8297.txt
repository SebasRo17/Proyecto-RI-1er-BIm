My management just asked an unprecedented question in my (admittedly brief) history with the organization: "What can we do to help you?" Simultaneously, we're working several big projects for a fairly new client whose ability to push requirements around mid-project is legend. Developing for these guys is like tap dancing on quicksand. Seems like a prime opportunity to propose a shift to a more agile approach. The thing I know I'm going to get asked, and that I don't have any idea about, is how to quote/bid/bill for that sort of project. Do you go hourly? Do you bid a range of prices? Do you charge by the sprint? More generally, the aspect of the Agile Manifesto that reads "We value customer collaboration over contract negotiation" is GOING to scare my management. How do you value that in the real world of customers who want a lot for a little?
