data was given in columns in the order {y, x, z}, with y dependent on x, z               points = {{144, 18, 52}, {142, 24, 40}, {124, 12, 40}, {64, 30,          48}, {96, 30, 32}, {74, 26, 56}, {136, 26, 24}, {54, 22,          64}, {92, 22, 16}, {96, 14, 64}, {92, 10, 56}, {82, 10, 24}, {76,          6, 48}, {68, 6, 32}};          equation2 = A + Bx + Cz + D*x^2 + Ez^2 + Fx*z;     nlm = NonlinearModelFit[points, equation2, {A, B, C, D, E, F}, {x, z}, Method -> NMinimize]      I get errors, and nothing that gives the values of the coefficients A,B,C,D,E,F... What am I doing wrong?
