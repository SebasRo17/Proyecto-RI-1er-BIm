I have some projects that I do not wish to be viewed publicly (some of them are school course work), but I want to show them to my potential employers. Ideally, I would be able to generate some bit.ly-like links that expire after certain period. I am guessing I can do this with Dropbox's public link where I put the link to the code on the resume and then I delete the folder after some time via `crontab`, but I am wondering if there are better options. I do have accounts on github and bitbucket.
