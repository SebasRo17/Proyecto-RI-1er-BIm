We all know sometimes a e.g. merge can go wrong. If our [unit / integration] tests are in the same repository as the merge, is there then a weakness there that if the tests have merged incorrectly and do not appear in the final code then "we don't know what we don't know". Should the unit test project then instead be a complete separate item? In many ways I'd say no as it could litter a master branch with feature tests which are not yet relevant. In compiled languages then the compilation will fail if the test's reliant code is missing, so will help to a certain degree. But perhaps a non-compiled language is better as it would highly specific missing items when running the test. Does anyone have a workflow which it is possible to know which features may of merged incorrectly?
