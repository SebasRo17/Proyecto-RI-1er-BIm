I have a homework problem for an Artificial Intelligence course that I am having trouble answering. > Consider solving the Sudoku problem using A* search. The start state has > some number of cells filled in, and the successors of each state are all > legal ways an additional cell can be filled in. At any time we know exactly > the number of cells that remain to filled. > > Therefore, if K cells remain to be filled at node n, we know that h(n) = K. > Thus if we set our heuristic function h(n) to be h(n)=K, we will have > perfect heuristic knowledge in A. > > Explain the mistake in the above statement. I understand that this heuristic is entirely pointless since if there was some function that could find legal successors you might as well run a depth first search but what exactly is wrong with the above statement.
