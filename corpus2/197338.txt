I was looking over the evolutionary history of Unix and Unix-like systems on Wikipedia and one operating system name stood out to me: **OpenServer**. Judging from the image, SCO's **OpenServer** is completely _closed sourced_ ; so why does SCO **OpenServer** have the word "open" in its name if the operating system is proprietary and contains no open source code? I suspect this is because the original **Unics** operating system had a mixed/shared license, but that seems like a pretty distant ancestor when the proprietary **Xenix** came before **OpenServer** as well. Can anyone shed some light on the reason for this name?
