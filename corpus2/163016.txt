Where I work, projects take a significant amount of time because the teams are large, there is a lot of "design and analysis", a lot of documentation, and work always gets pushed off. I work in the middle tier and I always have to wait for the services and client folks to get their work done. Oftentimes there are weeks at a time when I can't get any work done. I feel bored and weird just sitting here scrambling to at least appear like I am busy. Management seems to do little when asked for more work. What do you do in such cases?
