What is the correct way to provide _Mathematica_ with a path to Python user scripts? Simply executing Python as a shell command, using something like               usefulOutput = Import["!python -c 'import mypkg; mypkg.use()'", "Text"];      fails, because _Mathematica_ — like many IDEs and Python launchers — has no access to (or at least ignores) `PYTHONPATH` or any `sys.path.append` in 'shell_config.py'. I seem to be able to `Run` shell scripts without errors, but that's not what I'm looking fore here. Does _Mathematica_ provide a setting for extending `python.path` or is there a related directory setting in _Mathematica_ that would result in my scripts being found?
