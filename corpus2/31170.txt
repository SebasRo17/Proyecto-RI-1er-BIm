I have an .eps file which was created using GLE. There is nothing wrong with the file, GS View can read it correctly. However, when I use Mathematica to read it using               Import["dcl.eps"]      it returns `$Failed`. The particular .eps file can be found here EPS file I want to read this eps file so as to rasterize it, thus reducing its size. I'm using Mathematica v 9.0 under Win XP. Any ideas why Mathematica cannot read this file?
