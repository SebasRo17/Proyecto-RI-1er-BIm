It seems to be impossible to play more than 15 different instruments simultaneously with the `Sound[{Soundnote[...],...}]` construct. Any guesses why it is so? With up to 15 instruments it works well:               Sound[ Table[ SoundNote[ i, {i - 1, i}, i], {i, 1, 15}]]      (* I would put an image of the output here if it weren't for the "stackexchange reputation system" *) But with 16 or more different instruments this yields no playable result.               Sound[ Table[ SoundNote[ i, {i - 1, i}, i], {i, 1, 16}]]       Does anyone know whether there is any way to instruct the `Sound` function to play more than 15 instruments?
