I use Linux and other open source software in my home. As I'm not a professional coder, I usually report bugs to developers as my skills are not enough to solve problems on my own. What kind of things you want me to check before I send a bug report? I mean, once I thought I found a bug in Gedit and I couldn't find similar bug in Bugzilla. But after I sent the report, some developer said that the bug is already in Bugzilla as the bug was in GTK+, not in Gedit. Sometimes it might be hard for an amateur to guess whether some previously known bug would solve the issue I found.
