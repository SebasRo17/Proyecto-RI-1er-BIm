I am working on two different project simultaneously where whenever the changes are made we use   1. Tortoise SVN for project A   2. Backed up by folder for Project B (this is done by me on my system) I find SVN good for maintaining the latest code server machine and update it whenever necessary.   For Project A, I happen to make alot of changes to the project A and I am advice not to commit the changes again and again but just a major change all at once.   But since in not alone on project A I tend to make code backs by folder every time I make an important change so I can go back and return if some conflict occurs. But what should I do in case of the project B?   where most I am on the project (as of now).   Should it be SVN or folder backups? The reason I do folder backups for the project B is that   sometimes the build given to the client fails/buggy so instead of making them wait for it to fix   I just go and open the project and compile the last working build and give the executable so they can carry on their work and not wait for me to fix it (may take long). I am working with Delphi on both the projects.
