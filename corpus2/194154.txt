I was reading some article on the internet as I was preparing for interview and I found out below statement- > Writing object oriented code, even in non-object oriented language? Is this statement true?? Can anybody provide an example to justify the above statement if somebody asked me this question in the interview. And when do we write object oriented code in non object oriented language? I mainly worked in Java. So any example corresponding to that will be helpful. Thanks in advance.
