In a previously posted question VLC used the element specification               {"MedianMarker", filledCircle[10], Black}      in a box and whisker chart, where               filledCircle[size_] := Graphics[{Black, Disk[]}, ImageSize -> size]      VLC was dissatisfied with the way the his filled circles were displayed in the resulting chart. Two answers were offered and there was some lively discussion in the comments. Strangely there was an elephant in the post and nobody noticed it. According to the _Mathematica_ documentation on `BoxWhiskerChart`, the second element in a MedianMarker specification is a **number** specifying the width of the horizontal line used to draw the median marker. There is no indication that a function application evaluating to a graphics object is acceptable. Thus my questions: Why does what VLC did work at all? Has he discovered a undocumented feature?
