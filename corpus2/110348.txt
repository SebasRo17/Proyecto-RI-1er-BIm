I am about to enter the world of consulting for the first time and am having to write my first contract. One problem I have is regarding open source work and intellectual property. I love working on open source projects, whether it's an existing project or a project that I start on my own. The question is: how can I write my contract to accommodate the following situations:   1. In the course of working on the client's project, I want to open source part of the code to the community under my own name.   2. In the course of working on the client's project, I am making use of some of my existing open source projects, and am making improvements to them.   3. In the course of working on the client's projects, I make improvements to third party open source projects and contribute them back.   4. In the course of working on the client's project, we decide to open source part of the code under the client's name. What are the precedents to this if any? _Update: I added a item in the list above(item #3)._
