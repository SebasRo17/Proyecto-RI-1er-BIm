I'm trying to determine how we can measure how much time the developers are loosing to poorly managed environment and inefficient ways-of-working. **The goals are:**   1. Show managment how big the problem really is, in terms they can relate to. I.e $$$   2. Get a good baseline so that we can measure the progress.  **Short background:** We manage the programming environment for 500 developers. This includes IDE (mainly Eclipse and Visual Studio), version control systems (ClearCase), what programs they have available. Basically, everything related to the computer that involves programming. Examples: Not being able to work with tools they are used to due to strict security requirements. Using version control system in a bad way causing problems when working in parallell. Setting up project environment is done manually and different each time. Using homecooked frameworks, rather than what are industry standard. Building takes longer than needed due to homemade practices. Deploying takes longer than needed due to homemade practices. This does **not** include the actual coding pratices, project management or meetings. Sure, we can influence those things too, but for this questions those things are out of scope. **The question:** So, how can we determine how much time are lost due to the project environment? The only thing I can think of to get some good data are polls and questionnaires. Have anyone done something like this? What were the experiences and results? Are there other literature or reasearch where I can get ideas from or compare results with? _Other questions exists regarding programmers inefficiency (likethis), but those relate to coding practices and bugs._
