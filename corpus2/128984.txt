Are business majors like Marketing relevant for programming jobs. Do employers even consider business degree holders as potential candidates? Let's say, if all I had was a business degree, should I be spending time applying for programming jobs, or should I be doing something else? [Update] I should clarify that I already got the Business degree, and more than half way through the CS one.
