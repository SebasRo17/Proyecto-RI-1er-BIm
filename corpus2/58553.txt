Is Mathematica able to handle ordinary differential equations where the _variable_ itself is complex? I am looking for solutions of ODE systems of the form $$\left\\{ \begin{align} i\frac{da_1}{dt} &=E_1a_1(t)+\mu\cos(\omega t)a_2(t) \\\ i \frac{da_2}{dt}&=\mu\cos(\omega t)a_1(t)+E_2a_2(t), \end{align}\right.$$ and I need to use the analytical continuation of the solutions to a contour that consists of a number of straight-line segments on the complex plane. (Why? because of things like this.) My naive try would be               NDSolve[{           I a1'[t] == E1 a1[t] + μ Cos[ω t] a2[t],            I a2'[t] == E2 a2[t] + μ Cos[ω t] a1[t],            a1[0] == 1, a2[0] == 0},         {a1, a2}, {t, 0, I (2 π)/ω}];      (suitable parameters are $E_1=-1$, $E_2=-1/2$, $\mu=0.1$, $\omega=0.05$) but this simply causes an error               NDSolve::ndnl: "Endpoint 0. +125.664\ I in {t,0.,0. +125.664\ I} is not a real number"      I have looked online but I haven't found any good resources. Is this functionality natively available in Mathematica? Are there easily available add-ons that provide it? Or will I need to manually convert the ODEs into a chain of equations of a real variable?
