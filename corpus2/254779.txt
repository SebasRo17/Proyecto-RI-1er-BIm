I am interested in develloping a web music player similar to the soundcloud one However, I can't figure out one thing: How player like soundclou one (and some other one) can "resist" a page change, continue playing without any latency, even if the page in the background is loading, the player is here and continue his job without any lag at the momment we click links. The only way to stop it is to reload the page with the browser How can this be achieved? Does this used using a particular language and site architecture that center the player? If not, does any language / framework offers possibility to do thing like that? EDIT: So I made a Few search, and I get the following Idea:   * Pjax : That allow you to reload only certain content.   * HTML5 History API : The API Behind PJax   * One-page APP : Much harder. But using Ajax it could work. Are these solution good? Wich one would be easier/ Better? Are there other alternative?
