I am going to enter university next fall in computer sciences, but have been programming already for a few years. I am currently doing web application development. I use Python and Java mainly. I also know C++, but never really pacticed it because everytime I think of a project, there seems to be a language that is better suited for the job than C++. For example, Java seems to give the same result as C++, but in a more productive way (even performance-wise, Java is not far behind C++). Not to mention that the Java library is much greater than the C++ one. This makes me wonder where, in the world of web development, could I use C++ and get an advantage that other languages won't give me? I currently believe that it would be as an add-on to a language like Java or Python.
