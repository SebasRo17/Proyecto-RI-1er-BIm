Is there a design pattern or well known algorithm to build a simple map with roads and city blocks? To have an idea of what's my target i describe some of the constraints and the context:   * a matrix which represents a (rectangular) map   * few possible city blocks represented as rectangles (eg, 4x3, 5x2, 1x6)   * few possible road sizes (eg, 1, 2)   * block are never connected, meaning that there is always a road between them the result would be an array like this:               111101111100110     111101111100110     111100000000110     000001110000110     000001110000000     ...      where as for example, "1" are the blocks and "0" are the roads. What I intend to do is to place a block where it is possible, then circumscribe with roads, and go on. This would be ok, but could lead to some place where blocks don't fit. I would like to know if there is something in the state of the art of such algorithms.
