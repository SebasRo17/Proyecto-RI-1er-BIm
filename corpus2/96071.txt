So far I've always coded using raw/embedded, dialectic SQL. This seems obviously wrong to me because it ties you to concrete technologies so your software can't be deployed to any machine - especially servers. In general (independently of the programming language and RDBMS), what options does one have in this case? How good are each one of them? What would you say is the standard approach?
