My lecturer mentioned today that it was possible to "label" loops in Java so that you could refer to them when dealing with nested loops. So I went home and looked up the feature as I didn't know about it and many places where this feature was explained it was followed by a warning, discouraging nested loops. I don't really understand why? Is it because it affects the readability of the code? Or is it something more "technical"?
