Whenever I want to add a new functionality, I introduce a new private variable into the class. Declare it just above the first method definition. leave a small comment. Set it in a certain method. And then use this set value in another method. Now the possible problems which arise are, I dont cover all the possible cases when to modify the value of this variable and only notice a bug in it when during trying various possible user flows of the software. Is there any possible way to tie this value to some kinds of triggers so that I know all the possible situations when to modify its value? I am using Javascript. For e.g. I create a status message for editing an existing DB record. If the updating is failed over REST HTTP I set the status. Now I forgot to reset the status when I dont hit update button and instead select another record for updating. What is the best way to manage such new private variables? How to mange their state? what is the best software engineering way to prevent such mistakes?
