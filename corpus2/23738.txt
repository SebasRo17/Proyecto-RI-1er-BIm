Naïvely this is what happens and it obviously is not helpful!               In[7]:= Conjugate[SphericalHarmonicY[1, 1, θ, ϕ]]          Out[7]= -(1/2) E^(-I Conjugate[ϕ]) Sqrt[3/(2 π)] Conjugate[Sin[θ]]      So I tried stating initially that $\theta$ and $\phi$ are reals - but still that doesn't seem to have helped any bit,                In[8]:= θ ∈ Reals; ϕ ∈ Reals;             In[9]:= SphericalHarmonicY[1, 1, θ, ϕ]            Out[9]= -(1/2) E^(I ϕ) Sqrt[3/(2 π)] Sin[θ]            In[10]:= Conjugate[SphericalHarmonicY[1, 1, θ, ϕ]]            Out[10]= -(1/2) E^(-I Conjugate[ϕ]) Sqrt[3/(2 π)] Conjugate[Sin[θ]]      Kindly tell me how to do this? (...I want to calculate sums like $\sum\limits_{m=-\ell}^{\ell}\vert Y_{l,m} (\theta,\phi)\vert^2$...)
