In my problem, I need to plot a figure in a relatively small region of the $x$ axis, e.g.,                ListPlot[{RandomReal[#] + 10^4,         RandomReal[#]} & /@ (Range[100] 10^-10), Frame -> True, Axes -> False]      and the figure is displayed properly, but all the tick marks have the same label: ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ujeYw.png) Is there any clever way to get rid of this problem?
