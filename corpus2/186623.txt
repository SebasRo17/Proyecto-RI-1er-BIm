I plan on migrating a website from PHP to ASP .NET MVC. However, since the website is large and this migration can't be done in a short time I plan to use both MVC and PHP pages together. So the idea is to replace each PHP page or group of pages with an MVC equivalent. I have to refactor each page and rewrite it overall anyways so I thought I might as well move to the ASP .NET MVC framework for various reasons. The question is, does anyone know what are some of the problems I will face while doing this? Here are some I thought of: \- Logins \- I plan to overcome this with an ajax request to the ASP .NET website on the background and keeping the login information separately for asp .net. \- Sessions \- I'm not sure how I can share sessions or if I will even need to. Other than that, I'm not sure if anything else will arise. Anyone experienced that have a few things to say?
