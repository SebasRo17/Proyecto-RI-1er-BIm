I'm a junior php/js developer and have been working for about a year. When I start working on a task I tend to have a quick think about what needs to be done then jump straight in, in a somewhat brute force approach. However I think this hinders my productivity since I haven't defined path to completing the task. What have you found to be the best approach and way to prepare writing code? Especially dealing with legacy code
