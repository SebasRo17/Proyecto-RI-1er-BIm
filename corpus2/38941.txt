I have a recurrence relation that grows exponentially if expressed in closed- form. I need to integrate this function. If I plot it, I think _Mathematica_ evaluates the recurrence numerically at every level, so the recurrence doesn't grow to be a huge expression. `NIntegrate`, however, seems to be trying to find a closed-form equation to integrate, even when I turn off symbolicprocessing. I've tried all the options I can think of, including extracting my relation to a function, adding `Simplify` to the recurrence, and I'm just completely stumped at how I can force _Mathematica_ to stop using symbolic manipulation for an expression that has $2^{100}$ terms. Anyone have any ideas?               HOWavefunctions = Function[{q, n},          RecurrenceTable[{y[i + 1] ==             Sqrt[2/(i + 1)]*q*y[i] - Sqrt[i/(i + 1)]*                y[i - 1], y[0] == 1/(Pi^0.25*E^(0.5*q^2)),           y[1] == Sqrt[2]*q*y[0]}, y, {i, 0, n}]]     n = 100;     Plot[HOWavefunctions[q, n][[n + 1]]^2, {q, 14.05, 15}]     NIntegrate[HOWavefunctions[q, n][[n + 1]]^2, {q, 14.05, 15}]      (If you turn $n$ down to $15$ or so, both work just fine.) I guess, ultimately, what I'm looking for is a way to tell `RecurrenceTable` to evaluate 'lazily', that is, only evaluate a term once all variables have numeric values, and never ever expand the relationship symbolically. I tried inserting a `Simplify` in the recurrence, but _Mathematica_ apparently ignored me.
