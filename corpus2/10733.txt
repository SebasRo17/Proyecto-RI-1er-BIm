I have a presentation remote that allows me to advance Mathematica slides when in the SlideShow environment. The control sends a `page down` key. Some of my slides extend below the screen window, and `page down` scrolls a page at a time. Is there a way to change the scroll rate associated with a `page down` key- stroke? I'd like to advance the slides by half a page at a time, or a quarter, for example, or even cell-by-cell. The notebook options associated with `ScrollingOptions` seem not to control what I need. My system is MacOSX, running Mathematica 8.0.4.
