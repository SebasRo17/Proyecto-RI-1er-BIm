Imagine we wish to evaluate some expression like `NIntegrate[x^2*q,{x,0,100}]` assuming some value for `q` like `q = x`. How can we do this such that:               MakeLocalAssignmentOrAssumption[q = x, NIntegrate[x^2*q,{x,0,100}]]     Print[q]      Returns:               2.5*10^7     q      In other words, how can we assume that `q = x` ONLY in the context of evaluating the `NIntegrate` expression?
