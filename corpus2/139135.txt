I'm excited about the possibilities for duplex communication with WebSockets between a web browser and web server. I see that WCF for .NET 4.5 supports a WebSockets binding now, and I know there's a JavaScript API for using WebSockets. However, what I don't understand is how these are supposed to interoperate. Yes, you can deal with raw message passing with the JS API, but there doesn't seem to be any JS library for doing SOAP-based RPC compatible with WCF. Do any of you know if there are any libraries to enable a web browser to call a WCF service using WebSockets?
