Why did Microsoft not provide generic implementation of OrderedDictionary? There are a few custom implementations I've seen, including: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/recipes/GenericOrderedDictionary.aspx But why did Microsoft not include it in the base .net library? Surely they had a reason for not building a generic.... but what is it? Prior to posting this message, I did see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2629027/no-generic-implementation-of- ordereddictionary But that just confirms that it does not exist. Not **why** it does not exist. Thanks
