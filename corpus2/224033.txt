Let's say in some reason all objects are created this way $obj = CLASS::getInstance(). Then we inject dependencies using setters and perform starting initialization using $obj->initInstance(); Are there any real troubles or situations, which can't be solved, if we won't use constructors at all? P.s. the reason to create object this way, is that we can replace class inside getInstance() according to some rules. I'm working in PHP, if that matter
