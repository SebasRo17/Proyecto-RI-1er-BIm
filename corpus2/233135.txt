This may be a terribly stupid question, but I can't find anything even related on Google (maybe I am not searching properly). I've been a developer for around a year now. I do desktop and web apps using Visual Studio at my day job and use a WAMP setup for freelancing. For storing data I have either used a database or not. What I mean is that if the program stores data for longer than the app runs then I use a database; that's all I know. Here's the thing, I have always worked with **existing** databases for desktop apps. I have never made a desktop app from scratch (the programming part yes, but the database has just always been there and on a local server somewhere for the app to pull from). I want to develop a desktop application that would need a database. My question is how does that process work? In providing the application do I supply the database, say SQLserver, or is there another way in which that works? To be clear: The application would need to store your typical customer information, files, possibly images, payment information - which I know a database would provide, but I do not know how that works once you sell and install the application. I know other applications do these sorts of things - quickbooks, email clients, etc. How do they do it with just an install?
