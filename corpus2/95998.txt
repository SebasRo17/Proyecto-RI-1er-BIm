I have very similar code over multiple files in my project. If a client wanted some level of commented code, would I have to invest the time into duplicating the code for every file. I think it would simply be a waste of time. What would be the best/easiest way to provide comments to a client. (Refer them to a readme to show one file with the comments?) It's along the lines of URL's to point to and BOOL's to change. **For Clarification: I don't want to, nor do I think it would be a good idea to consolidate code to create a single place for settings. If I was building a desktop app or using PHP, I would create a config file. But this isn't a situation where that would be called for. Infact, it might actually be considered (from what I understand) a best-practice. I totally get that It's a good idea to eliminate duplicate code, but I don't even think there's an efficient and simple way to eliminate the duplicate base code. My question pertains how I should Comment for clients/dev's in these sort of situations*** Disclaimer: Next time, I'll start with comments rather than adding them in later.
