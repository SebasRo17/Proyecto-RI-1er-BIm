I am building a Java applet for a client. Yes, we have gone over all the options, and for the client's requirements and environment, this is the Right Choice. I am a big believer in using Apache Commons whenever possible to simplify my code and avoid reinventing the wheel. One part of the functionality I need for this applet is implemented in the Commons IO library, which is 160kb in size. Or I could create a custom build of Commons IO with just the classes I want. Less easily maintained, but minimizes the overhead of the applet. I could also write the needed functions; they would be far smaller than 160kb. I've probably spent more time pondering the Right Thing To Do than it would take me to write the code by hand. As an additional consideration, I will be doing a code review with the client, and would like to take any opportunities I have to teach them best practices like using Apache Commons. Any strong opinions, and justifications, for which option I should choose?
