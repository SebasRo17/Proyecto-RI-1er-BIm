I would like to start giving unique names to "cache-able" files - i.e. *.css and *.js - in order to prevent caching, without requiring changes to the web- server settings (as is currently done in IIS). For instance, let's I have a JavaScript file called `global.js`. Going forward I would like it to have the name `global.123.js` when revision 123 is checked in. This would also require the following:   * The previous version of the file - perhaps it was `global.115.js` \- is removed when the file is deployed.   * All references to the file are updated with the new file name How do I go about doing this? What concerns do I need to consider?
