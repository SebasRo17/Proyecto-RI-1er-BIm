I have a friend who has a slightly greater amount of programming experience as me. We were talking about all the different programming technologies we use and Interface Builder came up in conversation. Being of no programming background except for what I've taught myself, I personally believe that IB and all it's features (`IBOutlets`, `IBActions`) help coders of my skill level (and all skill levels, for that matter) complete projects of theirs in less time. His view of IB is a little enthusiastic. He believes that coders that utilize Interface Builder are "cheating" in the fact that they don't have to lay out interfaces by hand. * * * Question: **Should using a GUI builder to lay out interface elements be considered "cheating" (since most programming originally required laying interfaces out by hand in code)?** Why?
