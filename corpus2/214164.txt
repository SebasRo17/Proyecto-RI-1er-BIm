I have been writing my website, front-end: html, JS, jquery and css, back-end: php mysql. However my php files only contain php and mysql code. Is this a really bad thing? In what situation should PHP files contain html/javascript?? Currently my php files are just there to receive request and response with array of information. I just dont understand why people would put front-end stuff in back-end, is it for security?
