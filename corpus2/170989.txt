I need to standardize coding practices for project that compromises, among others, of pl/pgsql database, that has some amount of nontrivial code. I look for:   * Code formatting guidelines, especially inside procedures.    * Guidelines on what constructs are considered unsafe (if any)    * Naming conventions.    * Code documentation conventions (if this is practiced)  Any hints to documents that define good practices in pl/pgsql code? If not I'm looking for hints to practices that you consider good. There is related question regarding TSQL: Can anyone recommend coding standards for TSQL?, which is relevant to psql as well, but I need more information on stored procedures.
