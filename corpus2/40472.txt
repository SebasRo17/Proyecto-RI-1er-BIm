I want to find all values of the paramaters $m$ for which the equation $$t^4 + (2 m - 1) t^2 - 18 m - 72=0$$ has four real distinct solutions less than 2. Put $t = x^2$, I tried               Clear[f];     f[x_] := x^2 + (2 m - 1) x - 18 m - 72;     d := Discriminant[f[x], x];     sol = Solve[f[x] == 0, x];     x1 = x /. sol[[1]];     x2 = x /. sol[[2]];     Reduce[{d > 0, x1 > 0, x2 > 0, x2 < 4}, m]      > -6 < m < -4 How can I reduce my code?
