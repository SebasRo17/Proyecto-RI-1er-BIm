I have an expression, `expr`, containing 3 variables, 4 coefficients and 2 non-zero generic constants. I want to solve for the 4 coefficients such that the equation holds for all values of the variables and for all non-zero values of the constants. It is possible to solve either `expr == 0` or `expr == 1`. Acceptable solutions should not assign a specific value to the constants. Also, I do not want solutions that set all 4 coefficients simultaneously to zero. Example: Let `x`,`y`,`z` be the variables, `a1`,`a2`,`a3`,`a4` be the coefficients and `b1`,`b2` be the generic non-zero constants.               expr =       -2*a3*b1 + a1*x + a2*x + a3*x + a4*x + (a3*b1*y)/b2 - (a4*b1*y)/b2 +         2*a1*z - 2*a1*b2*z - 4*a2*b2*z - 2*a3*b2*z - 2*a4*b2*z;          SolveAlways[{b1 != 0, b2 != 0, expr == 0}, {x, y, z}]     (* {{a2 -> -a1, a4 -> 0, a3 -> 0, b2 -> -1}, {a2 -> 0, a4 -> 0, a1 -> 0,        a3 -> 0}} *)          SolveAlways[{b1 != 0, b2 != 0, expr == 1}, {x, y, z}]     (* {{a2 -> -((2 a3)/(1 + b2)), a4 -> a3, a1 -> -((2 a3 b2)/(1 + b2)),        b1 -> -(1/(2 a3))}} *)      Here I would want to automatically select only the last solution, all the others do not meet my criteria. Also, it should be rearranged so as to assign a value to `a3` dependent on `b1`, not the other way around. Is there a way to do this?
