I'd like to create a custom number format for use with `ToString`. However if I do the obvious and create a function that calls `NumberForm` with modified options:               numberform =        NumberForm[#,          ExponentFunction -> (If[-5 < # < 5, Null, #]&),          NumberFormat -> (If[#3 != "", SequenceForm[#1, "E", #3],#1]&)]&        > >     Slot[1]& >   It works fine as a function:               numberform[1234567890.]        > >     1.23457E9 >   but not with `ToString`:               ToString[1234567890., numberform]        > >     ToString[1.23457*10^9, Slot[1]&] >   Is there some attribute I have to set to make it behave like the built-in forms? Is that even possible? Is there a workaround?
