I write Linux embedded software which closely integrates with hardware. My modules are such as : -CMOS video input with kernel driver (v4l2)   -Hardware h264/mpeg4 encoders (texas instuments)   -Audio Capture/Playback (alsa)   -Network IO I'd like to have automated testing for those functionalities, such as integration testing. I am not sure how I can automate this process since most of the top level functionalities I face are IO bound. Sure, it is easy to test functions individually, but whole process checking means depending on tons of external dependencies only available at runtime.
