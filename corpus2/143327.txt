I'm doing research on what version of PHP to use when creating commercial scripts that will be sold to the public. Although the available stats aren't great, PHP 5.3 shows a 18.5% adoption rate. I'd like to use Symfony to create these scripts and it requires 5.3.2 which shows an even lower adoption rate (roughly 13% of that 18.5% use less than 5.3.2). Would I be risking much by jumping straight to PHP 5.3.2+ or should I ignore the stats and plough ahead?
