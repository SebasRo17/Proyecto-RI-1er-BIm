I wrote the following simple code and deployed it as a `CDF`.                  Button["Ok", (SystemDialogInput["FileSave", ".PDF"])]      If I open the `CDF` file in _Mathematica_ and click on the button, it brings up this dialog: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jNJfA.png) If I open the `CDF` file in MathematicaPlayerPro and click on the button, it brings up a different dialog: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ai5kM.png) How can I get the same dialog from MathematicaPlayerPro as I get from _Mathematica_?
