The tool "get coordinates" (clicking on a plot), seems to work with a fixed number of significant digits (4), in a way that we can quickly lose sensibility (the tool really becomes useless). The following example shows the problem:               Plot[a, {a, 1950, 1950.2}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BPI1k.png) I imagine that this is a feature tending to the bug classification. Is there a way of correcting this behavior? (on 9.0.1)
