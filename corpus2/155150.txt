I'm about to release a project of mine that I'm really proud of under the GNU GPL and I have some questions:   1. Should one attach a copyright notice on each and every source code file from their project? I think it's a bit ridiculous to claim copyright on a 3 line abstract class. Should I attach a copyright notice only to really important source code files?   2. Can I not attach the whole standard thingy? Because it's big and bulky and gets in the way... If so, is the variant below ok/enough?  _Copyright year firstname lastname.
