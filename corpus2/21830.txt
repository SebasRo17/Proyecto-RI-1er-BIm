I have a list of arguments (which in reality is lengthy):               arguments = {a, b, c}     arguments2 = {a_, b_, c_}     f[Sequence@@arguments2] := a + b + c      _Note_ : It seems awkward to define two lists here, there should be a better way to do this. And I want to numerically integrate a function of those arguments:               int[Sequence@@arguments2] := NIntegrate[f[Sequence@@arguments], {x, 0, 1}]      This does not work because of the `HoldAll` property of `NIntegrate`. Is there a way to do this correctly?
