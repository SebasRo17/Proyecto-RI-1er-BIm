Now, I have been given a series of tasks, from a bigger project. My company has (supposedly) bought a revenue/sales software written in PHP. Basically this whole big piece of software needs to be modified to meet my country standards. I have been given a large number of tasks to do in a relatively small time span. Now, this might be my very own understanding of the whole timing problem, but this seems a very big thing to do because I need to fully understand:   1. the whole system structure   2. the "style" in which it has been written, classes, functions, etc.   3. the database structure Considering the above, I need to add some functionality, some of which can be considered "core" ones which, in my opinion, is a too long of a job to be done in 6 days. I understand that I have given too little information for anyone to understand the level of difficulty of said tasks, since for some people might be impossible while for others might be a breeze, so I want to ask the following: To the people who went past a similar situation, what was your outcome? Can I start considering myself unprepared or maybe they are asking too much? What was your experience on a similar situation?
