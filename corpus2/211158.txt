Many books on startups/kanban strongly advocate the use of AB testing to validate product features. I haven't had any experience with this but it sounds like a great idea for some projects. My question is, how does one go about AB feature testing in practice? Say you want to test how registered users interact with a specific feature. Do you create tables to set what batches of users see what features? What about non-registered users. ect. Say it's determined the feature isn't needed based on your tests. Do you go back into the code base and cut that code out?
