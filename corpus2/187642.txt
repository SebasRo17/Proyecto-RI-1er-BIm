On the Android operating system details about the phone are available via the `Android.OS.Build` class. These details include things such as the phone manufacturer, model, version, etc. The customer may want us to collect this data and save it to our database for analytics and tracking. I think this raises some privacy concerns for the end user. Are we obligated to inform the user that we are collecting this information (similar to how the use of the device's capabilities, such as camera or microphone, are presented in the Play Store) and what we intend to use it for? If we are not required to do so, is this something that we should, from an ethical perspective, inform the user that we are doing?
