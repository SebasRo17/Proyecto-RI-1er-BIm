I've tried rewriting some Java functions in C++ and called them using JNI. I observed that it takes longer time to execute the native C++ functions as compared to Java functions, due to the JNI overhead. As it is widely believed that C++ has certain advantages over Java, I wanted to know whether rewriting some Java code to C++, with a view to improve overall performance of the Java application, a good idea? If yes, then what parts of the application should be rewritten and how can a Java application use it?
