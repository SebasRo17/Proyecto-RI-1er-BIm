I'm interested in books that would introduce / explain the theory behind programming and programming languages. My logic is that by truly understanding the theory behind programming it will only take a few weeks to pick up new languages and implement some simple software. As far as the type of books I'm looking for they would be similar to SICP. I've done some research on this site and also on stack overflow. I know there are some large threads about books which discuss software architecture but I'm looking for information specific to programming. I have an okay understanding of Python which I've received from an into CS class on programming but I need to advance my knowledge. Thanks
