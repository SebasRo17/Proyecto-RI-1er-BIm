This is more a web design / user experience question, but since programmers.stackexchange.com is more opinion based, I posted this here - Does it make sense to have a single tab in a web app? I don't see any reason to have a tab if you can't tab to it from some other tab. My PM is demanding a single tab. I honestly think my PM is making horrible decisions regarding the design (we have no official designer) and eventually we will lose customers. The design of the application was made early 2000's and it shows (HTML tables, lots of inline css, etc). I am afraid that if we don't update it to match this decade's expectations of application, it will just turn off our potential customers. The application is an enterprise app that we sell to potential customers. We are a small company - our team for this application is 6 (3 developers, 2 qa (one being the pm), and one of the company's partners). Everyone's opinion matters (so I have been told), but if someone happens to disagree with the PM (who can do no wrong), she gets all huffy....and I am rambling. So my question remains - what are your thoughts on a single tab?
