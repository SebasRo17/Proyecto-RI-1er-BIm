Can you recommend books **and other material(video)** on how to build career , what path and wayouts are there in the whole area of software engineering? **What a developer can evolve into?** Some sort of evolution path from development? I m not asking just for 2 well- known directions: project management and freelancing, i m asking for the whole range of possibilities where these skills can be useful I m not asking for stuff about:   * frameworks, languages    * certifications for Microsoft, Oracle etc
