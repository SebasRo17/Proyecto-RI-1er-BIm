I have a huge graph with ~8k vertices and ~1k components. I want a histogram showing the number of vertices for each component. How do I do this? EDIT: I'm trying ubpdqn's approach, but not gettting the expected results. Here are the details of my graph and the resulting histogram:               H = ExampleData[{"NetworkGraph", "HighEnergyTheoryCollaborations"}]          Histogram[Length /@ ConnectedComponents[H], LabelingFunction -> Above, BaseStyle -> 20]      Result: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/AnD2P.png)
