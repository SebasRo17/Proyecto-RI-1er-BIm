I'm developing a standalone application using java, I have a Login screen, wherein user enters his username and password. For each instance of the application, user have to enter his credentials. From a usability standpoint, I thought of keeping a remember me check Button. My question is, as I am not using any database, how do I persist the user details. I have some rough thoughts, storing them in a property file and retrieving. I think there may be better approaches than the one I had. Any Ideas and suggestions?
