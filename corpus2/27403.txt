By referring to the _Mathematica_ documentation, I learned to use `##2` to represent all the arguments but the first one. This is a brief way to represent a pattern matching all arguments but the first one. However, how can I do the same thing in the long `Function[args. body]` form? For example, `{##2}& @@ f[x1, x2, x3, x4]` will give `{x2, x3, x4}`. Unfortunately, `Function[{u1, u2}, {u2}] @@ f[x1, x2, x3, x4]` only gives `{x2}`. I think this occurs because the long form does not interally contain pattern matching functionality, although I find this hard to believe. So my question is whether the long form really ignores the functionality of pattern matching? In general, are these two pure function forms identical in every aspect? That is, is the short form is just a shortcut for the long form?
