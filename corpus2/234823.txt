Consider this license I wrote for my software:               Copyright 2014, [my name]          The author(s) of this software intends to provide the users with the     maximum amount of freedom. As such, this software may be used under     any one of the following licenses:          1. MIT: [link to the license]     2. Apache 2.0: [link to the license]     3. BSD 2-clause: [link to the license]     4. BSD 3-clause: [link to the license]          Or, it can be considered released into the public domain in jurisdictions     where this is possible.          In any case, the software comes with absolutely no warranty.      Do you guys see any potential problems with this licence, especially from a legal point of view? Does it succeed in providing the users with the maximum amount of freedom?
