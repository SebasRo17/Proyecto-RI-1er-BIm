Is this code crashing your Mathematica session? ( _it can so look out :P_ )               DynamicModule[{a = 1},           FlipView[{        Framed["(", Background -> Dynamic[If[CurrentValue["MouseOver"], Blue, LightBlue]]],        Framed["<", Background -> Dynamic[If[CurrentValue["MouseOver"], Blue, LightBlue]]]        }, a]           ]      > ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cZEPW.png) Fast workaround would be to take `Framed` outside `FlipView`. I'm just curious if this happens to all of you and if it should be marked as a bug.
