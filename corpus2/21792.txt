I'm runnning _Mathematica_ 9 on Ubuntu 11.10. After installing CDF player I still have problem (most of time) with `Manipulate`. Only way I'm able to change value of a parameter is by manually entering a value into into an edit field (dragging the slider or pushing buttons doesn't work). Can anyone suggest what I'm doing wrong? (Even simple `Manipulate[x, {x, 1, 5}]` doesn't work properly.)
