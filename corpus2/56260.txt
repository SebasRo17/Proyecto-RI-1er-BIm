I want to define a function of two variables, `func[f_, g_]`, such that when it sees a general constant multiplying one of the variables, say `a`, it will take it outside the evaluated expression. So for example, if `f` and `g` are variables and `a` is a constant multiplying `g`, it will be evaluated as               func[f_, a_ g_]:= a func[f_, g_]      I need to inform _Mathematica_ that `a` is a constant, not a variable, and that it should be pulled out of the expression.
