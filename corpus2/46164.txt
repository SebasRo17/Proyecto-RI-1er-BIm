I need to display edge labels of a graph in a way that allows the edge labels to be moved. `Locator` seems the simplest and most obvious function to use. My application requires an interface that generates new graphs with different numbers of vertices and edges, so I can't treat the locators individually.               With[      {coords = {{1.08, 0.94}, {1.08, 0.036}, {0., 0.97}, {0., 0.}, {1.94, 0.49}},       edges = {{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 5}, {3, 4}, {4, 2}, {5, 1}}},      DynamicModule[       {edgePosns = Table[0.5, {Length@edges}]},       (betweenPnt[a_, b_, l_] := (1 - l) a + l b;        DynamicModule[         {edgeCentres =           MapThread[            With[{av = coords[[#1[[1]]]], bv = coords[[#1[[2]]]]},              Dynamic[betweenPnt[av, bv, #2]]] &,            {edges, edgePosns}]},           Graphics[            GraphicsComplex[             coords,             {{Line[edges]}, {Darker@Red, PointSize[0.02],                Map[Point, Range[5]]},              Map[Locator, edgeCentres]}], ImageSize -> 400]])]]      ![picture of output of above](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PZTtl.jpg) The locators can be moved, as expected. What I did _not_ expect was that, (even) if the output is deleted and the cell is re-evaluated, the locators retain their new positions. However, I've now learned that this is standard behaviour (see m_goldberg's comment below), which can be fixed by `Initialization` (see Kuba's solution). Also, I would like to constrain the movement of locators to lie on the edges, for which I hope to use the 2nd argument of `Dynamic`. Can I do it with this (admittedly flawed) design? My attempts so far have resulted in unresponsive locators. I think I need to update `edgeCentres` using the callback of the 2nd argument, but whether it is because it is a list, or for some other reason, this is ineffective. I do not know how (or if) I can implement this constraint by adding a second argument to `Dynamic` in the code above. In fact, I prefer to update `edgePosns`, which is list of the proportions of respective edges that the locators mark, but I need to be able to walk first. Related question now split from original question following Kuba's suggestion.
