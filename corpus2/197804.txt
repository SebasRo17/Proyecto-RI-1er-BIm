RSpec allows users to share context across tests / examples, which would reduce the number of code lines in my app by a significant amount. On the other hand, somehow related to the question of sharing codebase between tests, one of the reasons why I'm using Factories and not Fixtures is because I don't want tests to be dependent on code stored outside the tests. Ryan Bates explains it better: > There’s a heavy dependency between the tests and the fixtures and we can > cause the tests to fail just by changing the fixtures. External dependencies > that are this strong aren’t a good idea and make the tests brittle. What's best practice here, to share context across tests or to have an independent context for each test?
