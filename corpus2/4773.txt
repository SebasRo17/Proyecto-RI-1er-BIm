I have been using several Mathematica packages to do numerical inverse Laplace transforms on known (expressible in closed form) expressions, $\tilde{f}(s)$. I am now being confronted with the more difficult problem where I can only obtain $\tilde{f}(s)$ as a table like               {{s_1,f_1},{s_2, f_2}, {s_3, f_3 ... etc.}      I have not been able to find any packages for doing the inverse Laplace transform on tabulated data. I saw one ancient discussion in a forum that says the inverse Fourier transform can be used but I don't see how that's possible. I would greatly appreciate if anyone had done something like this before, or knew of an appropriate package, or had any suggestions for a workaround. EDIT: this is how I'm getting tabulated results for the transformed function: I have $\tilde{f}(s) =\frac{1}{s} \frac{1-\tilde{g}(s)}{1-a \tilde{g}(s)}$ where $\tilde{g}(s) = \int_{-\infty}^0 h(s,x) dx$. I know what $h(s,x)$ is, but the integral over $x$ cannot be done analytically so I am doing it numerically which is why I end up with tabular data for $\tilde{f}(s)$.
