Which Java framework meets these requirements? What set of frameworks would be best suited to meet these requirements? The requirements are:   * oriented for web   * support for transactions   * support for creating RESTful web services   * support for security, levels of security   * integration with some kind of ORM framework like Hibernate   * ability to change front-end without need of making changes to back-end. Firstly, I want to develop a flex based front-end but if I've ever wanted to change it to HTML5 then I don't want to make changes to my back-end   * ready for cloud   * free to use for commercial purposes To my mind comes Spring but are there any other alternatives meeting these requirements? What about if it is not necessary java? Do you know framework, set of frameworks combined together in other language which meet these requirements best?
