Imagine you have three numbers `a`, `b` and `c`, and using `Manipulate` you wish to combine them in the following way: `x a + x2 b + (1-x-x2) c`. Here, `x`, `x2` and `x3 = 1-x-x2` must all be between `0` and `1`.This means `x`, `x2` and `x3` form a two-dimensional simplex within a three-dimensional space. Does anyone have a nice idea of how to create a simplex (triangular) controller which allows me to move `x` and `x2`, such that `x3` is always between `0` and `1`. I hope this is clear, at least to the people who know what a simplex is. The solution might be a `Slider2D` with some constraint. Thanks!
