I read this answer and found a comment insisting not to send password by email: > passwords should not be able to be retrieved by email, I hate that. It means > my password is stored in plain text somewhere. it should be reset only. This raises me the question of handling Forgot Password option? At any cost the raw password must be displayed in any UI so that user will be able to read it. So what would be the way to handle "Forgot Password"
