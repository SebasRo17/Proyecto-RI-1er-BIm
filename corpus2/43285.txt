I have the following code for a 2d heat c equation:                soln = NDSolve[{        D[y[r, f, t], r, r] +                         (1/r)*D[y[r, f, t], r] +                      (1/r^2)*D[y[r, f, t], f, f] ==                                      (1/1.27*10^-4)*D[y[r, f, t], t],                y[r, f, 0] == 0,                y[10^-2, f, t] == 0,               (D[y[r, f, t], r] /.                     r -> 2*10^-6) == -(1/(3.14*10^-8))*(1 + Sin[2*2*3.14*t/2]),                (D[y[r, f, t], f] /. f -> 0) == -(10/238)*y[r, 0, t],                (D[y[r, f, t], f] /. f -> 3.14/2) == 0},                          y, {r, 2*10^-6, 10^-2}, {f, 0, 3.14/2}, {t, 0, 1}]      and I'm getting the two following error messages: NDSolve::ibcinc:   Warning: Boundary and initial conditions are inconsistent NDSolve::mxst:Maximim number of 10000 steps reached at the point t==1.629*10^-10 NDSolve::eerr:Scaled local spatial error estimate of 4203.0461 at t=1.840*10^-8 in the direction of independent variable r is much greater than prescribed error tolerance. Grid spacing with 51 points may be too large to achieve the desired accuracy or precision. A singularity may have formed or you may want to specify a smaller grid spacing using the MaxStepSize or MinPoints method options I saw an answer for the first one so i'm pretty ok with that but the second one is giving me trouble limitting the useful time domain.I cannot figure out why I'm getting this. Any help will be greatly appreciated! Claudiu
