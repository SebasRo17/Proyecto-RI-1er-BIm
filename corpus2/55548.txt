I'm not advanced in _Mathematica_ but I'm trying to get better. I have a big set of `Data` and I want to `Plot` the first row against the other ones. I tried to set the `Rows` into a list and run a "do loop" over all `Rows`. My Code :               ClearAll["Global`*"]     Data = Import["file", "Table"];     Time = Table[1/60 i, {i, 0, 1430}];     Rows[k_] = Do[List[Transpose[{Time, Data[[All, k]]}]], {k, 1, 16}]     Toplot = Do[Transpose[{Time, Rows[k]}], {k, 1, 16}];     ListPlot[{Toplot}];      I would be grateful for some help and tips.
