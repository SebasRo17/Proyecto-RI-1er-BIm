**UPDATE: The final palette has a new homehere! Please test and provide feedback (usability, suggestions, bugs)** **A note to the readers and voters:** This is intended for community use, so please test the palettes in practice! I encourage all answerers to "steal" from each others, and come up with a solution that is the most pleasant / practical to use. * * * Sjoerd suggested that when we want to post input lines that alternate with output lines, instead of including the In/Out labels, we could simply comment out the output. Read his suggestion here:   * How should I include code samples in posts? I have seen several people use this style in the past few days. The only problem with it that it requires a lot of manual editing (too much work for my taste). How can we automate this process? **The challenge is:** Create a palette button that will copy the selection in the format suggested by Sjoerd. Two-dimensional expressions (i.e. things like $\int x^2 \; dx$) should be converted to plain text or input form. The notebook contents must not be modified/destroyed. An example (directly copied from Sjoerd's post):               In[108]:= D[Cos[x] Exp[x], x]     Out[108]= E^x Cos[x] - E^x Sin[x]      should be copied as               D[Cos[x] Exp[x], x]          (*       ===> E^x Cos[x] - E^x Sin[x]     *)      Let us ignore cells that are neither input nor output for now (text, headings, etc.) Can we create a tool that is good enough to be of practical use to the community?
