Say I would like to display the $10$ greatest primes that are less than $10^5$. I could do the following:               AbsoluteTiming[      M = 10^5; m = PrimePi[M];      prms = Prime[#] & /@ Range[1, m];      prms[[#]] & /@ Range[-1, -10, -1]      ]      And the result comes out :               {0.0156250, {99991, 99989, 99971, 99961, 99929, 99923, 99907, 99901, 99881, 99877}}      But if I tried to do in in reverse,               AbsoluteTiming[      M = 10^5; m = PrimePi[M];      prms = Prime[#] & /@ Range[m, 1, -1];      prms[[#]] & /@ Range[1, 10]      ]      the process takes a whole lot longer:               {0.6250000, {99991, 99989, 99971, 99961, 99929, 99923, 99907, 99901,        99881, 99877}}      Using the second method, I can't even increase `M` to $10^6$, as the program takes extremely long to execute. Can anybody offer some insight into this ? $\;$ Am I essentially not doing the same thing in both cases ?
