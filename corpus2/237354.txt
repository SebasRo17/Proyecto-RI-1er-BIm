I am currently working an Android app that receives most of the displayed data from a REST interface. First, I request the information for a company the request includes a list of store IDs. With each ID I can then request the details for this store. As part of my app I can update the store opening hours and send them back to the server. For that, I obviously need the store ID to tell the server which store to update. Now, my question: The JSON object returned by {SERVER}/StoreDetails/{ID} does not include the the store ID. So I need to first fetch the JSON, parse it, and then manually add the store ID to the object - which I feel needlessly complicates my logic, as well as my model objects which now either need a setter of some kind of copy/update constructor when they could otherwise be totally immutable... Would it be/have been reasonable to include the store ID in the returned JSON object or is that considered redundant and a bad practice?
