I'm trying to build a pop up window with i lines. Each line would read: Number of neurons in layer 1:   Number of neurons in layer 2:   etc until layer i The user would enter a numeric value on each line. That value would be recorded as `d[1],d[2],...,d[i]`. The solution I've come up with results in Mathematica assigning the input from any line to d[i] (for example if there are 5 lines, it assign inputs from line 1, 2..5 all to `d[5]`). I understand why it's happening. I just can't think of how I'm suppose to achieve what I want. Here's my code:               a = Table[       List[StringJoin[{"Number of neurons in layer ", ToString[i], ":"}],         InputField[Dynamic[d[i]], Number]], {i, 3}];      AppendTo[a, {CancelButton[], DefaultButton[DialogReturn[]]}];     CreateDialog[Grid[a, Spacings -> {1, Automatic}, Alignment -> Left], Modal -> True];      Any suggestions? Thanks.
