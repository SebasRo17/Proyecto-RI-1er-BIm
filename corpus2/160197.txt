I have started reading Part 2 of Introduction to Algorithms and in the section **The structure of the data** the author/authors says in the context of sorting a sequence of numbers: > In practice, the numbers to be sorted are rarely isolated values. Each is > usually part of a collection of data called a record. Each record contains a > key, which is the value to be sorted, and the remainder of the record > consists of satellite data, which are usually carried around with the key. > In practice, when a sorting algorithm permutes the keys, it must permute the > satellite data as well. If each record includes a large amount of satellite > data, we often permute an array of pointers to the records rather than the > records themselves in order to minimize data movement. Can some one explain what the authors mean here ? Why the term _satellite data_ ? What is the intuition behind this concept ? And also how this concept relates to a higher level programming platform like Java ?
