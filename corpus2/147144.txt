The Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) defines that if a login module has the flag "REQUIRED", the authentication should proceed down the login module list on success or failure, and that the module is required to succeed for the overall authentication process to succeed. The question is: What could this flag be used for? Since the login module is required to succeed, why does the authentication process need to continue down the login module list when a REQUIRED module fails to authenticate a Subject?
