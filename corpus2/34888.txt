I have a surface               s = Plot3D[{x,y,F[x,y]},{x,-1,1},{y,-1,1}]      with $F$ predefined, and a curve               c = ParametricPlot3D[{g1[t],g2[t],F[g1[t],g2[t]]},{t,0,1}]      with $g1,g2$ predefined. $c$ is therefore a curve on the surface $s$. If I want to show both the objects together I can use               Show[s,c]      but how can I animate the trajectory described by the curve $c$ on the surface $s$?
