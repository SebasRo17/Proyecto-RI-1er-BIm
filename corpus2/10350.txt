I'm taking a linear algebra / matrix theory course and we are free to use any software we want, and will be "expected to use MATLAB or an equivalent" for homework. The professor and textbook (Applied Linear Algebra) prefer MATLAB, some students seem to like R, but I'm already familiar with Mathematica and have a student license. Are there any possible limitations of Mathematica to watch out for, if used as a learning device (i.e. not for work or intensive computation) for a linear algebra course? e.g. Are there some operations which the other software packages can do which Mathematica cannot out-of-the-box?
