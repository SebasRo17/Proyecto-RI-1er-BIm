I was hoping I could recreate a noise cancelling set-up by recording sound from the microphone in my headset or from the computer and play it back in my speakers or headphones with the appropriate phase shifts (I understand it may not be a simple as that but it would be a start). That is what I want to achieve, let's start with some small goals. Is it possible to record sounds automatically in Mathematica (or even in Mathematica for Rpi) ? I am familiar with `SystemDialogInput`                SystemDialogInput["RecordSound"]      It pops a dialog which allows you to press a button to record a sound. However I can't seem to find an option, or maybe another way, to have the sound record automatically. So that this can automatically processed
