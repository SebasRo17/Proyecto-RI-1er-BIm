Consider a block (partitioned) matrix               matrix = ArrayFlatten[{{a, b}, {c, d}}]      where, `a`, `b`, `c` and `d` are each matrices themselves. Say, for example,               a = {{a11, a12}, {a21, a22}}     b = {{b11, b12}, {b21, b22}}     c = {{0, 0}, {0, 0}}     d = {{d11, d12}, {d21, d22}}      How can you find the _block_ inverse of this matrix? A desired solution is, using the example above               {{Inverse[a] , -Inverse[a].b.Inverse[d]},{0,Inverse[d]}}      which is easily verified using               Simplify[Inverse[ArrayFlatten[{{a, b}, {c, d}}]] ==      ArrayFlatten[{{Inverse[a], -Inverse[a].b.Inverse[d]}, {0,       Inverse[d]}}]]      which yields `True`. How can you solve the block inverse problem for arbitrary submatrices, and for block matrices of larger sizes (i.e. 3x3, 4x4, etc)?
