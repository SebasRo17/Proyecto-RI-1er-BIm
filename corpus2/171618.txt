I just read this quote from Steve Jobs: "Doing LSD was one of the two or three most important things I have done in my life." Also a quote from that article: > He was hardly alone among computer scientists in his appreciation of > hallucinogenics and their capacity to liberate human thought from the prison > of the mind. Although **I am aware of the fact that Jobs was not a programmer** , this quote got me thinking if there's any evidence to support the theory that drugs can help make a "better" programmer.   * Has there ever been a study where programmers have been given drugs to see if they could produce "better" code?   * Is there a well-known programming concept or piece of code which originated from people who were on drugs? EDIT So I did a little more research and it turns out Dennis R. Wier actually documented how he took LSD to wrap his head around a coding project: > At one point in the project I could not get an overall viewpoint for the > operation of the entire system. It really was too much for my brain to keep > all the subtle aspects and processing nuances clear so I could get a > processing and design overview. After struggling with this problem for a few > weeks, I decided to use a little acid to see if it would enable a > breakthrough, because otherwise, I would not be able to complete the project > and be certain of a consistent overall design[1] There is also an interesting article on wired about Kevin Herbet, who used LSD to solve tough technical problems and chemist Kary Mullis even said > "...that LSD had helped him develop the polymerase chain reaction that helps > amplify specific DNA sequences." [2] EDIT 2 Sadly the question was closed again but there was a great discussion on HackerNews.
