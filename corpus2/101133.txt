I have an initial phone interview coming up with a company for a Senior Web Developer position and in the email they asked to prepare by signing up on their site because they'd like to hear my thoughts about it and suggestions for improvement. I've heard stories before of companies that do this. They interview 10 people and then if everyone gives advice, then they've got a lot of free consultation. I believe this is the first time I've ever been asked to do something like this so I wanted to hear other people's thoughts of whether it is free consulting or if I'm just being paranoid.
