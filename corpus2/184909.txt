People advise me to "find a job doing something that you are good at", but the truth is that I don't believe I am good with anything other than just writing code. I don't think that I can design or structure a program though. Don't get me wrong, I'm not the kind of programmer who can't write a fizz buzz program; I'm more like the kind of programmer who can't do much besides getting the job done. It's not that I have a "do the bare minimum" attitude; it's that I'm painfully aware of my limitations as a programmer. For example, implementing a quick sort algorithm is something that I could do only by relying on rote memorization (that is, if I ever find the motivation to spend a good chunk of my day trying to commit the entire algorithm to memory and not just go like "umm, I see, that makes sense, I can see the logic..."). When it comes to structuring and designing an application I feel I'm just as helpless. Since I am unable to see the right answer at the start I just make a judgement call which nine times out of ten I later regret. I still manage to obtain job promotions and praise from my coworkers, so others don't necessarily share my opinions. Objectively speaking though, I simply have neither the learning ability nor the sheer brain power to realistically aspire to be anything more than a 'slightly above average' programmer. I wonder whether I actually have an ethical duty to make room for more talented people and find myself another kind of job, even if I'm fairly confident that I would not find another role I am better qualified for. My question then is "Do average programmers have a place on a team?"
