For my calculations, I need increased precision of parameter 'k' in my Manipulate:               Manipulate[      Plot[Cos[k x], {x, 0, 2 Pi}], {{k, 1}, 0, SetPrecision[4.0, 22],        SetPrecision[0.100, 22], Appearance -> "Labeled"}]      However, at the same time, for aesthetic reasons, I want the label to the right of the slider to display only couple of digits. How this could be done?
