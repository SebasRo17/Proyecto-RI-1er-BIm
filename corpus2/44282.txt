I am calling lots of OpenCL functions from Mathematica. The problem is that the memory the kernel uses grows and grows until the RAM is fully occupied. I have created a small piece of code to demonstrate the behaviour.               Needs["OpenCLLink`"];     openclPlatform = 1; openclDevice = 1;          For[i = 0, i < 1000, i++,      OpenCLMersenneTwister[1, Platform -> openclPlatform,         Device -> openclDevice];       ]      (OpenCLMersenneTwister is a predefined function by Mathematica) When running that piece of code multiple times I can see that the RAM usage of MathKernel.exe grows and no memory is freed. Is it a bug in Mathematica or is my code wrong? Thanks
