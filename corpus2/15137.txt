This might seem like a simple enough question but Mathematica seems to simplify inadequately here:   How would you sum over the digits of an arbitrary binary number?   I already tried this:               Total[IntegerDigits[j, 2]]      which immediately simplifies to an incorrect $j+2$   In fact all               Total[IntegerDigits[j, n]]      simplify to $j+n$   After that, I tried this:               Sum[i, {i, IntegerDigits[j, 2]}]      which simplifies to another incorrect               1/2 IntegerDigits[j, 2] (1 + IntegerDigits[j, 2])      Is there any way, I can prevent these erroreous simplifications?   I need a solution that will work if I use it in another sum which, I ultimately hope, simplifies to something correct. If you want to see what I need this for, it's for another now solved problem on Mathematics StackExchange.
