We have a course called Computer Organization. I am wondering if it is useful in terms of software engineering. These are some topics from the course: Instruction set architecture (ISA), ISA design considerations, RISC vs. CISC, assembly and machine language, programming a RISC machine. Computer arithmetic, arithmetic logic unit, floating-point numbers and their arithmetic implementations. Processor design, data path and control implementation, micro programmed control, exception detection. Pipelining, hazards, pipelined processor design, hazard detection and forwarding, branch prediction and exception handling. Memory hierarchy, principles, structure, and performance of caches, virtual memory, segmentation and paging. I/O devices, I/O performance, interfacing I/O. Should I learn all of those topics or are there any topics that i could skip learning? This is the online course page http://courses.bilkent.edu.tr/videolib/course_videos.php?courseid=16
