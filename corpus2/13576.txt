I am relatively new to the _Mathematica_ enviroment and not sure where I am going wrong. I have evaluated the question and understand it, but dont know how to exactly create a module for it. The problem is:   * I need to calculate `PowerDensity` at a location $(x,y)$   * I am given the power $P$ at the source and its location $(x2,y2)$   * To calculate the `PowerDensity`, you use $P_d= \frac{P}{4\pi r^2}$   * The two $x$ and $y$ coordinates compute to give : $P_d = \frac{P}{(4*\pi*(y_2 - y_1)^2 - (x_2 - x_1)^2)}$ How do I write a `Module` like:               PowerDensity[antenna_, loc_] := Module[(* Enter your code here*)]      so the user would enter e.g. `PowerDensity[{1000,1000,12}, {0,0}]`? So far I have this:               PowerDensity[antenna_, loc_] := Module[{xone, yone, w} {xtwo, ytwo},         PD = w/(4*Pi*(ywo - yone)^2 - (xtwo - xone)^2),         print[PD]     ]      But it is not working. Any help?
