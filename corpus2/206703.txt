I was reading about the rules for royal succession of the British monarchy and thought the easiest way I could understand it is with code (or pseudo-code). I came up with this (in a C# like pseudo-code):               EventHandler CurrentMonarch_Died {         CurrentMonarch = SuccessorRootedAt(Person.Electress_Sophia_Of_Hanover);     }          enum Gender { Male, Female };  // Male must come before Female          Person SuccessorRootedAt(Person person) {         if (person.IsAlive && IsQualified(person.Religion, person.Citizenship))             return person;              sortedChildren = person.Children.OrderBy(p => p.Gender).ThenBy(p => p.DateOfBirth);              foreach (child in sortedChildren) {             successor = SuccessorRootedAt(child);             if (successor != null)                 return successor;         }              return null;     }      Is it correct?
