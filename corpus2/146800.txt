I am attempting to move from IntelliJ IDEA to vim, primarily for C development. What are the equivalent of the following common IntelliJ features/tasks in vim (and what plugin is required if any)? **Source Navigation** 1) Find file in project by name (Ctrl + Shift + N) 2) Navigate to [Function] Declaration (Ctrl + B / Ctrl + Right Click) 3) File Structure Pop-up (Ctrl + F12) 4) "Forward" (Ctrl + Alt + Right) 5) "Back" (Ctrl + Alt + Left) **Refactoring** Note that for the following, I don't want just "find/replace." If I change a single function definition, I want all occurrences of that function updated in the project (as a single command). 6) Rename File / Function / Variable (Shift + F6) 7) Change Function Signature (Ctrl + F6) 8) Inline Function (Ctrl + Alt + N) 9) "Safe Delete" (Alt + Delete) Safe Delete helps you delete a file / function / variable without breaking your compile. So, (for C) you could delete a *.h file from your project, with the operation listing the other files that import functions defined in that header and giving you the chance to cancel the delete. **Other** 10) Show Usages (Ctrl + Alt + F7) This is different from just "grep" as it gives you the option to exclude matches in comments, documentation, etc. 11) Surround with... (Ctrl + Alt + T) In IntelliJ, I most commonly use this to surround method calls with "try/catch/finally." Perhaps not something that is needed much in C development? 12) Quick Documentation (Ctrl + Q) IntelliJ pops up the JavaDoc in a tiny window, giving you the option to select from possible matches (if more than one). Here, I would expect equivalent except in a newly-opened split buffer. 13) Using Control-Space for keyword completion.
