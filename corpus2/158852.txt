I'm working on a project which uses GIT as the main version control system for trunk, the official branches and most sub-projects/unofficial branches. As such, I want to make my own branch use GIT to allow the rest of the community to access my branch using the system they know. However, I'm working on a part of the project which overlaps both official and unofficial branches, along with some patches which will never enter trunk - as such, I need to be able to keep my patches separate, allowing all to be used in my branch and selective patches to be taken for use in trunk. This naturally leans towards using mercurial queues. Is there any reason that I can't use mercurial for my own local repository, but push the entirety to both GIT and Mercurial hosted repositories? Or rather, is there any good reason not to, I'm sure it's possible.
