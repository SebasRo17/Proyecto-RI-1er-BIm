My linear algebra book has questions that are are marked to use math software. There's probably some $50 guide on how to do everything but usually documentation has gotten me through. I've been kind of stumped by this though. I'm doing some applications problems where I have to do something n times. Simple               x_1 = A.x_0,     x_2 = A.x_1,     ...      I remember these as sequences in calc. As it stands I am just doing `x = A.x` and repeating as many times as I need to, but this is obviously more work than needed if I knew the right tools. Could you please tell me what would be this tool?
