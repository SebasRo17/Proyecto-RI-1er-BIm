In scheme when defined               (define f (lambda (a b c d) d))          (define l (list 'a 'b 'c 'd))      Why it does not do argument destructuring? I mean arguments should evaluate first, why destructuring is not part of that?               (f . l)      What are reasons that this expression is not equal with following?               (apply f l)        * Edited to make it clearer, according suggestions in comments
