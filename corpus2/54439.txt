Sorry for the bad title..Didn't know how to describe this, feel free to change it to be more specific. I have a list in this form:               list = {"a(0)", "a(1)", "a(2)"}      Now I want the positions of all a* in the list. At first I thought this is easily done with the Position-function, but then I had some difficulties:               Position[list, "a"]      Thought this would work, but somehow I'm missing something. So..how to implement the * to give me all a's regardless of the following characters?
