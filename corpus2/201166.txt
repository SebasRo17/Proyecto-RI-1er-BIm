For advocacy purposes, I'm looking for a good example of some popular/widely- known closed-source and generally paid-for software application/package which uses dynamically linked **LGPL** -licensed libraries, and isn't shy of saying so in its installer dialogs or preferably in its "About" info and/or online documentation once the application is installed. Basically I'm looking for evidence which will back up an argument " _If ...big vendor... doesn't have a problem shipping ...hugely popular SW... with an LGPL dependency, neither should you._ " (Links to any screenshots or online copies of documentation which demonstrate the usage without me needing to actually acquire the software would be most appreciated).
