I am trying to use `Manipulate` to show the process of creating a convex hull using the Jarvis march algorithm. My code currently computes the convex hull using locators when you input points on the pane. I've shown it below. What I would like to do is use the `Manipulate` to plot the progress of each addition of a side, one step at a time. In particular, I'd like for the user to be able to click on an "Autorun" button, and have the graph update after each computation of `find$next$point`, showing the addition of the next side. How could I go about doing this?               l = Graphics[{Black, Disk[{0, 0}, .1]}, ImageSize -> 10];          find$next$point[u_, p1_, p2_] :=      Module[{v1, v2, angles, maxIndex, i},        v1 = p1 - p2;        v2 = Inner[List, u[[All, 1]] - p2[[1]], u[[All, 2]] - p2[[2]], List];        angles = {};        Do [        If[v2[[i]] == {0, 0},          angles = Append[angles, 0];,          angles  = Append[angles, VectorAngle[v1, v2[[i]]]];        ];        , {i, 1, Length[u]}      ];      maxIndex = Position[angles, Max[angles]][[1, 1]];      u[[maxIndex]]     ];           convexHull[u_] :=       Module[{hull, p1, p2, temp},      If[u == {},      hull = u;      ,      hull  = {};      p2 = u[[Position[u[[All, 1]], Min[u[[All, 1]]]][[1, 1]]]];      p1 = {p2[[1]], -10000};      hull = Append[hull, p2];      temp = find$next$point[u, p1, p2];      p1 = p2;      p2 = temp;      hull = Append[hull, p2];      While [p2 != hull[[1]],       temp = find$next$point[u, p1, p2];       p1 = p2;       p2 = temp;       hull = Append[hull, p2];       ];      ];     hull     ];          Manipulate[       Graphics[Line[convexHull[u]], PlotRange -> 3],        {{u, {}}, Locator, LocatorAutoCreate -> True, Appearance -> l}]
