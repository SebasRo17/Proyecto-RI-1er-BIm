I have a query on whether the following requirements would need to be designed via Business Rules - this is for a JEE based application where currently this is coded as part of the Business logic. > System will create a tax account for every city, county and district > combination that imposes tax for only certain cities, counties or districts > depending on the taxpayer's business. > > When the user establishes an account which exists in all subdivisions (i.e. > at city or county level), the application must use his tax code and > automatically populate all the locations without requiring the user to data > enter every location. I assume this would mean a data lookup table from a master table (of tax accounts) and fetch and display all locations. Is there some way in which a Rules Engine can be used to manage these combinations?
