At our company we are not using a source control so we do backup manually. My habit is like this: I backup only scripts where I removed code snippets, and those scripts where I only added code snippets I don't backup. Is it reasonable to backup each time when you change something, or there are some conditions for file subversion? And when we backup changed files, should we only backup that file or all the project?
