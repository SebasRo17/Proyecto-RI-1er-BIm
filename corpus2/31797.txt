Recently in response to this question Mr.Wizard suggested an unusual way to summing numbers. This doesn't seem to be documented.               HoldForm[+##] & @@ RandomInteger[100, 2]      This works fine for `Plus` and in case of `-` it generates -ive of product of list elements. I could not find out how to write a close variation of this for `Divide` or `Subtract` or other operations. Can someone please shed some light on this ?
