I am obtaining in Mathematica:               Cos[2*Pi*FractionalPart[1/2*(i + j + k)]]      We know that for $i, j, k$ being positive integers this expression after simplification should give: $$ (-1)^{i+j+k} $$ I would like to know why the one of the solutions proposed for this similar question:                Refine[Cos[2*Pi*FractionalPart[1/2*(i + j + k)]],          Assumptions -> {Element[{i, j, k}, Integers], i > 0, j > 0, k > 0}]      did not work for this case?
