Every few years someone proposes tighter regulation for the software industry. This IEEE article has been getting some attention lately on the subject. > If software engineers who write programs for systems that expose the public > to physical or financial risk knew they would be tested on their competence, > the thinking goes, it would reduce the flaws and failures in codeâ€”and maybe > save a few lives in the bargain. I'm skeptical about the value and merit of this. To my mind it looks like a land grab by those that proposed it. The quote that clinches that for me is: > The exam will test for basic knowledge, not mastery of subject matter because the big failures (e.g. THERAC-25) seem to be complex, subtle issues that "basic knowledge" would never be sufficient to prevent. Ignoring any local issues (such as existing protections of the title Engineer in some jurisdictions): The aims are noble - avoid the quacks/charlatans1 and make that distinction more obvious to those that buy their software. _Can tighter regulation of the software industry ever achieve it's original goal?_ 1 Exactly as regulation of the medical profession was intended to do.
