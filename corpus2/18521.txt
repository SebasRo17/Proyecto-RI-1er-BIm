I want to output an arrow based on input from user and I tried writing this small function to achieve this:               g[{matric}] :=       For[i = 1, i < Length[mat], i++,        Graphics[{Arrow[{{0, 0}, {matric[[1]], matric[[2]]}}]}, Axes -> True,         AspectRatio -> Automatic]]      To call it: `g[mat[[1]]]` which is not working !! I want to send array as list for example `{{1,2},{3,4}}` and create its output as arrow but I don't know how to break this list. The second problem is that I can generate plots using `Apply[f,arg,{1}]` but it gives different plots for different elements in the list,so how can I combine them together in one plot. I know about `Show` command but I just wanted to know if there is any other way too.
