Here is my situation: a company has x number of employees and x number of machines. When someone is sick, the program have to give the best possible solution of people on the machines. But the employees can't work on every machine. I need a code for making little groups of possible solutions. this is a static example private int[][] arrayCompetenties={{0,0,1,0,1},{1,0,1,0,1},{1,1,0,0,1},{1,1,1,1,1},{0,0,0,0,1}}; => row is for the people and columns are for machines                   m1  m2  m3  m4  m5  m6  m7     p1  1               1            p2      1   1   1   1            p3          1       1       1     p4      1       1       1        p5  1       1       1       1     p6              1   1   1   1     p7  1       1   1   1   1   1      my question => with what code do i connect all the people to machine in groups (all the posibilities) like: p1 -> m1 , p2->m2 , p3 -> m3 , p4->m4 , p5 -> m5 , p6->m6 p1 -> m1 , p2->m3 , p3 -> m3 , p4->m4 , p5 -> m5 , p6->m6 p1 -> m1 , p2->m4 , p3 -> m5 , p4->m4 , p5 -> m5 , p6->m6 p1 -> m1 , p2->m5 , p3 -> m3 , p4->m4 , p5 -> m5 , p6->m6 p1 -> m1 , p2->m2 , p3 -> m3 , p4->m4 , p5 -> m5 , p6->m6 .... i need a loop buth how? =D thanks!
