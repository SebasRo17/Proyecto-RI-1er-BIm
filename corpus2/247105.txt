I have an array which stores a set of positive x coordinates in sorted way, say `arr={1, 4, 5, 9, 12, 45}` etc. And I have a maximum distance `k` which I can go from one point to another point let `k=3`. Now, given two points `x` and `y(arr[x]<arr[y])` I need to determine if I can reach from `x` to `y`. I will be able to reach `y` from `x` if distance between every two hop is less that or equal to `k`. Here suppose `x=1 y=4` then I can go from 1->2 then 2->3 but since distance between 3 and 4 is greater than 3 I can't go so in this case I can't reach. But if `x=1` and `y=2` then I can reach. It can be simply solved with O(n). I have created a for loop from `arr[x]` to `arr[y]` and for each pair of points I check if distance between them is less than or equal to `k`. But I want better algorithm. I am thinking of doing something like binary search. Can anybody please suggest a good algorithm?
