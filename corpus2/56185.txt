Is it kind of tacky or poor practice when programmers use an unusual amount of libraries/frameworks to accomplish certain tasks? I'm working with someone on a relatively simple programming project involving geolocation queries. The guy seems like an amateur to me. For the server software, this guy used Python, Django, and a bunch of other crazy libraries ("PostGIS + gdal, geoip, and a few other spatial libraries" he writes) to create it. He wrote the entire program in one method (in views.py, nonetheless _facepalm_ ), and it's almost unreadable. Is this bad? Is this really tacky and amateurish? Am I the only minimalist out there these days?
