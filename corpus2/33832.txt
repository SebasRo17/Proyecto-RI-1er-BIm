As the title says, I have an external data file which contains thousands lines of data. The data file contains eight columns and here is what I would like to plot: Let's assume that the length of the file is $N_0$.               N0=Length[data];      Now, some statistical analysis: if the seventh column is non zero (in other words, either 1 or 2), plot $\rm log_{10}(N/N_0)$ as a function of $n$, where $n$ is the integer of the eight column and $N$ is the number of lines inside the date file that have non zero seventh column and the respective values $n$ of the eight column. This is a rather complicated aspect, so I hope I explained correctly and clear what I want to plot. Nevertheless, if there is any confusing issue, please ask for additional details. Here is a small sample of the data file:               data1={{-0.63, -0.05, 0.607293, -1.01899, 244.7, 8.9221*10^-10, 2, 33},      {-0.63, -0.04, 0.750888, -0.914848, 99.06, 0.00192017, 2, 13},      {-0.63, -0.03, 0.866068, -0.807778, 240.9, 8.3753*10^-11, 2, 30},      {-0.63, -0.02, 0.5362, -1.05766, 105.95, 0.0000915176, 2, 14},      {-0.63, -0.01, 0.818972, -0.85418, 109.99, 7.34825*10^-8, 2, 14},      {-0.63, 0., 0.644631, 0.994565, 75.04, 0.0000214851, 1, 10},      {-0.63, 0.01, 0.678989, 0.972796, 131.81, 0.000396984, 1, 19},      {-0.63, 0.02, 0.572168, 1.03831, 212.27, 2.26474*10^-9, 1, 31},      {-0.63, 0.03, 0.593172, 1.02434, 125.65, 0.000119734, 1, 18},      {-0.63, 0.04, 0.620368, 1.00784, 80.25, 0.302882, 1, 11},      {-0.07, 0.47, 0.687758, 0.963341, 2.71, 1.07464, 1, 0},       {-0.07,0.48, 0.680021, 0.973429, 2.76, 1.10912, 1, 0},       {-0.07, 0.49, 0.668844, 0.980709, 2.81, 1.1496, 1, 0},       {-0.07, 0.5, 0.654742, 0.989591, 2.87, 1.19496, 1, 251},       {-0.07, 0.51, 0.636733, 0.999036, 2.94, 1.24555, 0, 72},       {-0.07, 0.52, 0.614364, 1.01248, 3.03, 1.29982, 1, 0},       {-0.07, 0.53, 0.586779, 1.03184, 3.15, 1.35616, 1, 0},      {-0.07, 0.54, 0.552593, 1.05116, 3.3, 1.41155, 0, 30},       {-0.07, 0.55, 0.512858, 1.06758, 3.5, 1.33486, 1, 0},      {-0.07, 0.56, 0.48694, 1.08078, 3.84, 1.17199, 1, 27}}      The complete data file can be obtained from here: data. Many thanks in advance. I have not tried anything, simply because I have no idea where and how to start. This however, should be quiet easy for a list- manipulation guru! **EDIT** Let me explain more what I want to plot. The seventh column has three options 0,1,2 and the last column contains only integers whose values go from zero to an unknown maximum value. I want to plot $\rm log_{10}(N/N_0)$ as function of $n$, in other words how $\rm log_{10}(N/N_0)$ evolves for every value of $n$ $(n = 1, n = 2, n = 3, ....., n = n_{max})$ when the corresponding seventh column is non zero (1 or 2). **EDIT 2** The final plot should be look like the following plot. The data file correspond to the darker green line (0.20). ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/uExGr.png)
