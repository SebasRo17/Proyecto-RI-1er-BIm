I have come across many blogs and books where it is stated that it is bad for a system requirement to contain conjunctions like "and". However in reality I am often coming across scenario where a requirement is satisfied when a certain set of conditions are met. For instance, Shopkeeper should sell alcohol only if the buyer is older than 18 years, he has the necessary proof and he does not have any alcohol related problems. The requirement would not be complete if I break it down into multiple system requirements and I cannot complete the requirement without use of "and".
