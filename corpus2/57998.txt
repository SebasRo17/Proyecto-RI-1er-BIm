Interviews are full of an array of different types of questions. What I'm curious about is what people think about asking an interviewee about the differences in .NET versions. For instance, asking what was new in .NET V2.0 to 3.0 and then from 3.0 to 3.5 and so on. Is this a good interview question to find out what a person knows about the .NET world? As V2.0 was released in 2005, I start to wonder how valid it is to ask about what was new in a release done 6 years ago. Is it a good question at guaging a developers knowledge or just his/her memory?
