I want to run `Simplify` and/or `Refine` on various expressions, but keep it from touching anything that contains a specific `Head`. For example, I would like to `Refine` the following expression under the assumption `x>0` but not do anything with any part of the expression whose `Head` is `Log`:               expr = Sqrt[x^4] Log[x^2] + Log[x^4];     Refine[expr, x>0]      Instead of               (* 4 Log[x] + 2 x^2 Log[x] *)      I would like to see               (* x^2 Log[x^2] + Log[x^4] *)      Where the Logarithms remain unsimplified
