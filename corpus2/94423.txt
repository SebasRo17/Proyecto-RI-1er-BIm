Put this image inside `images` folder. All JavaScript files should go inside a folder called `js`. Put templates inside a folder called site-templates and for each template, have three folders called `layouts`, `looks`, and `pages`. We're all familiar with these file-system structures in which we try to logically and efficiently categorize files and folders in an acceptable hierarchy inside our projects. On the other hand, because many times we do I/O operations on these files, changing the file-system structure forces us to update parts of our code, no matter how high-tech, and decoupled our code is. My question is, based on the effect that a file-system structure has on an overall project, can we consider it as a part of the software architecture? Because, in many cases, choosing a correct file-system structure prevents us from duplicating a file, say jQuery, in many places.
