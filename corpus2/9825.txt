MATLAB offers a function polyeig for computing polynomial eigenvalues, which appear, for instance in quadratic eigenvalue problems (see here for some applications) such as: \begin{equation} (M\lambda^2 + R\lambda + K)x =0 \end{equation} where $M$, $R$ and $K$ are matrices. Any realistic way of accomplishing this in _Mathematica_? By realistic I mean one that actually employs specialized algorithms. * * * P.S. If anyone from Wolfram is reading this: any perspectives on whether this may appear in future releases of _Mathematica_?
