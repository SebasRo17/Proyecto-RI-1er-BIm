I want to make a simple interactive user interface like this: ![gui](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cxrvJ.png) Such that when the user clicks on the "Add Edge" button, the edge specified by _from_ and _to_ fiels is added to the graph. The new graph may have a new layout and I want to make an animation between the old and new graphs (see my other question and my answer to the question). Most of the examples I found, change the graph/plot just on change of the inputs without waiting for a click from the user. I know how to add the edge to the graph and generate the frames of the animation, but how can I do the rest?
