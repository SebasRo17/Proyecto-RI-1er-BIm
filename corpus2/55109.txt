After importing an array of latitudes and longitudes and trying to find the position of some latitudes I was encountered with an unexpected problem since certain values could not be found for some reason. Position and MemberQ behave the same. Everything works just fine if converted to strings. I work with _Mathematica_ Version 9. Example:               r = Range[39.7026, 39.703, 0.0001];     r == {39.7026, 39.7027, 39.7028, 39.7029, 39.703}      > >     True >                 MemberQ[r, #] & /@ r      > >     {True, True, True, True, True} >                 MemberQ[r, #] & /@ {39.7026, 39.7027, 39.7028, 39.7029, 39.703}      > >     {True, True, False, True, True} >                 Position[r, #] & /@ r      > >     {{{1}}, {{2}}, {{3}}, {{4}}, {{5}}} >                 Position[r, #] & /@ {39.7026, 39.7027, 39.7028, 39.7029, 39.703}      > >     {{{1}}, {{2}}, {}, {{4}}, {{5}}} >   Out of the 1001 values of the following list rr, this problem is encountered with 17 of them               rr = Range[39.69, 39.79, 0.0001];      Notice the spacings of 30 Positions: > >     {{92}, {122}, {199}, {229}, {259}, {336}, {366}, {443}, {473}, >      {503}, {580}, {610}, {717}, {747}, {824}, {854}, {884}} >   Values: > >     {39.6891, 39.6921, 39.6998, 39.7028, 39.7058, 39.7135, 39.7165, 39.7242, > 39.7272, >      39.7302, 39.7379, 39.7409, 39.7516, 39.7546, 39.7623, 39.7653, 39.7683} >
