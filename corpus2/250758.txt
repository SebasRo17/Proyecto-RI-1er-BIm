Supposing I have an SQL table named `websiteArticle` containing articles filed by date under various categories. It has field names `id`, `category`, `date`, `subject`, `body`. As a matter of best practice, I also include `created` which is automatically filled in by the database with the date/time the article was inserted into the table. Also I include in `modified` (date/time) and `modifiedBy` (the `id` from `websiteUser`) which are filled in by the application. I like that, except that sometimes I also have a field for `deleted` which is a date/time that is filled in rather than deleting the record entirely. For brevity I don't want a separate `deletedBy` field. Also it is not needed since we do have a more detailed log in place. However, I do want to log the user who deleted it for convenience, overwriting the reference to the user who modified it. I could replace `modifiedBy` with `user` and update it in whenever the record is `created`, `modified` or `deleted`. Unfortunately `user` is ambiguous, as it could be the assigned `user`, and the record could have been modified by a different `user`. So I have date/time fields `created`, `modified`, `deleted`. I'm wondering what would be the appropriate field name for the user responsible for the same. Something like `author`, except that seems to only apply to `created`. Is there a less ambiguous word that works for all three? I searched the dictionary but didn't turn up any better results.
