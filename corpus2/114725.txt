I am supposed to work on web Services (using Apache CXF and Spring ) I was asked to get familiarized with certificate generation, as we will need to generate certificates going forward for the web services. One thing I knew is that they are using Glassfish server. I googled , but I didn't understand anything. I know that the information I provided is not sufficient, to expect a relevant answer But Could anybody please let me know , what will be the best starting point on this ?? and what other information should we need from the client to make it clearer ??
