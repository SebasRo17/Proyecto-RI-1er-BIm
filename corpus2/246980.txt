Say I had a PHP page with a calculator interface, but I want to transfer the sum to Windows Calculator.exe and then get a reply from the application back to my PHP page, how do you go about doing this? I understand that the sum could easily be done in PHP and it would be pointless using another application, but I just wondered how it would be done and will be helpful to know for my next project. I couldn't find any relevent exisiting questions but the search criteria for this isn't easy! Thanks
