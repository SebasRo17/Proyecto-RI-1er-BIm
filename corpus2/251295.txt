I am pushing my project over to Visual Studio Online in order to have some source control. I am developing this project by myself. I have never used Scrum, Agile, nor CMMI before, and the detailed description I read at http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/vstudio/ms400752.aspx is assuming a lot of knowledge. (It makes no sense to someone who doesn't already know what they are talking about.) The best way for me to really learn Scrim or Agile or CMMI is by using them. But where to start? The above link does not help me there. As a solo developer who is just looking for source control, should I start off with Scrum, Agile, or CMMI? To take the opinion-basedness out of this question, I will make my official question: **What is the difference between Scrum, Agile, and CMMI in Layman's terms?** (But really, I just am trying to figure out where to start!)
