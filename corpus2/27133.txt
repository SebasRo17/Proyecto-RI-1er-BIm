I have a feeling that lately I haven't improved much as a programmer. I may have learned a few bits regarding some technologies and acquired some domain knowledge, but it isn't much. In general programming skills there has been very little that I have learned. I haven't gotten better at reading legacy code. I still struggle with it. My design skills have not improved. I have hard time making design decisions. I have a limited experience of different workplaces and so I'm asking that how much does the working environment affect ones learning and what things in it specifically? I guess there are things that affect ones motivation to learn, but also things that make it possible to learn. Please share your experiences.
