I'm an ASP.Net/C# programmer using SQL Server as a back end. I am the Technical Director of the company, I'm extremely happy in everything I do and consider the languages and system we use to be perfect for what we do. In the back of my mind though I know that over time programmers can become stale. I remember as a wee youngster that all those "old" developers were past it and couldn't keep up with the youngsters. So considering I'm happy in everything I'm doing. What options are there for keeping up with everything and avoiding becoming stale. One particular idea that I use is to let all the new developers use and showcase the things that they think are cool. If anything catches my eye then absolutely it will be something we all use going forward. Thoughts?
