I'm slightly confused about how AJAX works. I mostly understand the PHP/MySQL model of retrieving database information for the user, but how does AJAX do it? From what I understand the AJAX engine sends an HTTP request to the backend which does some magic and returns XML data to the AJAX engine which translates it to HTML+CSS for the user to see, but what happens when it sends that first HTTP request to the backend? Is a server-side language acting as the middleman there to get data from the database for the rest of the process? Also, does HTML5 put any extra spin on the usage of AJAX?
