When I enter some expression like `a-b`, it is shown as I want, i.e. as I entered it. But in some cases the variables aren't sorted alphabetically, and entering e.g. `b-a` I get `-a+b` as output. This makes it harder to read more complex expressions, so I'd like to avoid it. This also includes differences inside the expressions. How can I prevent placing negatives before positives? Maybe a good idea would be to somehow tell Mathematica to prefer such sorting of variables which minimizes length of the expression.
