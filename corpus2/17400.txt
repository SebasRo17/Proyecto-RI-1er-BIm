I have two tensors of arbitrary but equal rank n (and equal dimensions): `A` and `B`, and I want to get a third tensor of rank n + 1, `C`. I want to do a element by element `Join`, so the element in `A` and the corresponding element in `B` are contracted into a list in `C`. For example, with n = 2:               A = {{a[0,0],a[1,0]},{a[0,1],a[1,1]}};     B = {{b[0,0],b[1,0]},{b[0,1],b[1,1]}};      then:               C = {{ {a[0,0],b[0,0]} , {a[1,0],b[1,0]} },{ {a[0,1],b[0,1]} , {a[1,1],b[1,1]} }}      I think it might be doable with some combination of `Inner` and `List`, but I'm not sure.
