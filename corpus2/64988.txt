I have some experience in PHP4, but after learning the object-oriented parts of PHP, I'm having difficulty understanding how to use the Smarty template engine. The official documentation appears to require a level of knowledge I don't have yet so it doesn't seem like a good place to start. What do I need to know to jump into Smarty template development? Or if Smarty isn't the standard PHP template system anymore, how should I go about templating?
