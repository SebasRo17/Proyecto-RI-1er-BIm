I've got a bunch of `Note`-Models with properties like `pitch`and `duration`. In music notation, these notes must now be placed into a certain bar on a certain line on a certain page, and so on. Many more factors influence the positioning of these notes like the notes that are placed in the same bar before them. Also, style-properties influence many different view-elements. The positioning of notes is affected by the "line-height" of the music lines, whether the bar is justified to the width of the page or not, and so on. **I'm looking for a design pattern that can help me cleanly position all these views relative to each other.** Can anybody help me out? I'm using SVG with JavaScript for my current project, if this is important. Thank you so much for helping out! :)
