An organization with a number of agile Scrum teams also has a small group of people appointed as "enterprise architects". The EA group acts as control and gatekeeper for quality and adherence to decisions. This leads to overlaps between the team decision and EA decisions. For instance, the team might want to use library X or want to use REST instead of SOAP, but the EA does not approve of that. Now, this can lead to frustration when team decisions are overruled. Taken far enough, it can potentially lead to a situation where the EA people "grabs" all power and the team ends up feeling demotivated and not very agile at all. The Scrum guides has this to say about it: > Self-organizing: No one (not even the Scrum Master) tells the Development > Team how to turn Product Backlog into Increments of potentially releasable > functionality. Is that reasonable? Should the EA team be disbanded? Should the teams refuse or simply comply?
