I've started learning my first language recently, Python, and I became interested in how it differed from the myriad of other programming languages. I've been able to find most of it out with some searching: There is interpreted, compiled and assembly language. Then there is numerical machine code (which as I understand is just binary?) that is read by hardware directly. So Python is an interpreted language because it isn't explicitly compiled to machine code (although from what I understand this is a false distinction since most code is both compiled and interpreted, if only behind the scenes). I still have one question I couldn't figure out how to search an answer for. I assume Python code requires the Python platform to be read because it contains the interpreter. But how do you get those "standalone" .exe programs which you can run on most computers? Are those files just using a platform which every computer has by default, or are these files that are already compiled completely to machine code? (Like with C++?) The main reason I'm wondering this is that I was wanting to send someone my simple Python programs without having them install the platform. I've searched online and found some 'compilers?' that will do this, but they don't seem to work very well and are very difficult to work with.
