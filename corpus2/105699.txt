Whenever I read blog posts about a new app that had Node.js involved, bloggers often write "the app was **written** in node." But I hardly ever see a phrase going like "the app was written in JavaScript, with the Node.js runtime." Now I'm beginning to ask whether or not Node.js is merely a runtime, or perhaps the creators are now planning to add more features that JavaScript doesn't offer, or maybe because it's much easier to say "written in Node" rather than "written in JavaScript, but runs on Node." What's the deal?
