I want to plot the region of points who satisfy the following equation:               2 < r <= 5 && 3/4 π < θ <= 5/4 π      I have been able to plot region in cartesian coordinates:               h[r_, θ_] := 2 < r <= 5 && 3/4 π < θ < 5/4 π     RegionPlot[h[Sqrt[x^2 + y^2], ArcTan[x, y]], {x, -6, 6}, {y, -6, 6}, PlotPoints -> 100]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pjksH.png) I would like to plot the region with polar axes, but I don't think I can make `PolarPlot` plot a region probably.
