I am about to build some WCF Services. Those services need to communicate to each others too, in some scenarios. I've done some "Google-ing" about Service Registry but can't figure out how to implement service registry with WCF; is there any other alternate? Is there any Microsoft technology available for Service Registry? I'm new to SOA and I will really appreciate any help or guidance (what and where should I exactly look for registry services).
