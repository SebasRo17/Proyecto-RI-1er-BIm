I want to implement an in-memory datastore for a web service in Haskell. I want to run transactions in the `STM` monad. When I google _hash table steam Haskell_ I only get this: `Data. BTree. HashTable. STM.` The module name and complexities suggest that this is implemented as a tree. I would think that an array should be more efficient for mutable hash tables. Is there a reason to avoid using an array for an `STM` hashtable? Do I gain anything with this steam hash table or should I just use a steam ref to an `IntMap`?
