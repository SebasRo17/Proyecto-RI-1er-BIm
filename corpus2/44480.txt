## Problem: The length of the longest ladder that can negotiate the corner depicted in Figure 2 can be determined by computing the value of theta that minimizes the following function: > $L(theta)=w1/sin(theta)+w2/sin(pi-alpha-theta)$ For the case where w1 = w2 = 2 m, use a numerical method to develop a plot of L versus a range of alpha's from 45 to 135 degrees. ![Figure2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/l1x0P.jpg) ## Solution so far: Until now, I could think of 2 methods for solving this problem: The first method was to compute the derivative and solve the equation `L'(theta)=0` and from here find theta for which the function has a minimum value. Here is the code:               L[th_] := 2/Sin[th] + 2/Sin[135 Degree - th]     NSolve[D[2/Sin[th] + 2/Sin[135 - th], th] == 0, th]     N[Minimize[D[L[th], th], {th > 0}, th]]      The output of NSolve gives me the following error `NSolve::ifun: Inverse functions are being used by NSolve, so some solutions may not be found; use Reduce for complete solution` information and this results               {{th -> -1.61504}, {th -> -0.0442421 - 0.0442132 I},      {th -> -0.0442421 + 0.0442132 I}, {th -> 1.52655},      {th -> 3.09735 - 0.0442132 I}, {th -> 3.09735 + 0.0442132 I}}       which are a lot of values and I don't know which one is the right one. For the Minimize function I get this error and nothing gets computed `NMinimize::nnum: The function value (L^\\[Prime])[0.0914636] is not a number at {th} = {0.0914636}. >>` The second approach was to use a root-location technique. I chose the Newton- Raphson, but the results obtained were in a strange form. This is the code:               th1 = 1          thl = 10          thu = 100          thr = thu - (L (thu)*(thl - thu))/(L (thl) - L (thu))          NewRa = {1}          h = D[L[th], th]          For[i = 2, i <= 4, i++, a = NewRa[[i - 1]]; b = h /. x -> a;      AppendTo[NewRa, a - L[a]/b]]          NewRa          {1, 1 - (2 Csc[1] + 2 Csc[1 + 45 \[Degree]])/(-2 Cot[th] Csc[th] -      2 Cot[45 \[Degree] + th] Csc[45 \[Degree] + th]),      1 - (2 Csc[1] + 2 Csc[1 + 45 \[Degree]])/(-2 Cot[th] Csc[th] -      2 Cot[45 \[Degree] + th] Csc[45 \[Degree] + th])       Am I approaching the problem in the right way? If yes, how can I solve the error from Mathematica?
