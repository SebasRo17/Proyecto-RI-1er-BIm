I want to set a zero-offset not only for the y-axis like i did with PlotRangepadding, but also for the x-axis. That means i dont want the white offset left of 1E-4 and right of 1E-1, and the y-axis/frame at my o-range. When i use the normal plot i dont get a x-axis-offset there, at least not in the positive direction. I thought that How to set a zero offset for the frame origin? would solve it but it only did it for the y-axis ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TS0pr.png)               i[r_, o_] := (r*0.87)/(0.00022 + o)     LogLinearPlot[Evaluate@Table[i[r, o], {r, {100, 200, 400, 600}}], {o, 1*10^-4,0.1},PlotRangePadding -> None, PlotRange -> {0, 2500000},       Filling -> Axis,Frame -> True]
