I am just a graduate from India and I have knowledge of Java, JSP and Servlets, Android application development and some iOS development. I do not have a background in C or C++ and a little weak background in Data Structures and Algorithms. I want to know whether I can make a successful career in the IT industry without knowledge of C or C++ but having a strong grasp on Java and Python (which is what I am thinking of learning next). As for the Data Structures and Algorithms part I am planning to study them again with implementation in Java as I am not fluent in C or C++. Can I go good in future if I know Data Structures through Java?
