Functions like `Piecewise` have cool, easy-to-read formatting. In the same vein, I think it would be wonderful if the `Which` function automatically returned output in a column or tabulated form:                Which[a < b,     1,            c < d,     2,             True,      3]      rather than the what currently happens, which can sometimes be difficult to read.               Which[a < b, 1, c < d, 2, True, 3]      This example happens to be easy to read, but for `Which` expressions with a large number of `<condition, value>` pairs, it would be nice to have a structured layout for the output. Any suggestions as to how to make this happen automatically?
