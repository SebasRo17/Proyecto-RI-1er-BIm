I'm working through a problem in Programming Pearls -- specifically, the implementation of a program which sorts a file containing, at most, 10,000,000 integers (Column 1, Problem 3). Since the book doesn't specify how the data should be stored in the file, I'm considering storing the integers as raw bytes (there are some other constraints that make raw bytes a good option). I've never worked at this low of a level before, so I want to know if there's anything dangerous I should watch out for. Do I need to worry about accidentally using some sort of end-of-file sequence when I'm writing raw bytes to a file, for example? Edit: I realize now how broad my question was. I really meant problems of the more catastrophic kind, like accidentally overwriting other files on the disk. Sorry I wasn't clearer originally.
