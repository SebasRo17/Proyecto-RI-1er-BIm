I have a pretty sparse array of vectors (in the colloquial sense that it covers the domain sparsely; it's not a `SparseArray`). `ListStreamPlot` without options was only showing one stream. I'm trying to pass in an array of `StreamPoints` to hit (namely, the points for which vectors are defined), but most still end up not hit: ![sparse StreamPoints failing to hit](http://i.imgur.com/3SOWua6.png) You can see the notebook here: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13934821/incomemobility.nb My guess is my vector array (21 vectors from this data on income mobility (pdf link)) is too sparse, and the vector field ends up kind of, um, underspecified? Does that make any sense?
