I am trying to define an object type in Mathematica as follows               Operator /: MakeBoxes[Operator[pow_, sym_], fmt_] :=      With[{sbox = If[StringQ[sym], sym, ToBoxes[sym]]},With[{abox = SuperscriptBox[#, pow]     &@sbox},InterpretationBox[abox, Operator[pow, sym]]]]      This works fine when I use integer powers for example               X = Operator[2,x]      gives me $x^2$, however it doesn't work if I use a symbol for the power for example               Y = Operator[a+b,x]      should give $x^{a+b}$ but it does not. What needs to be changed?
