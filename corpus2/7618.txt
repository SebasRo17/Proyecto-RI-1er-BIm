I'm trying to write a java program that uses mathematica code for processing and graphs while using java for the front end. From what I've been able to glean from the j/link tutorials on the wolfram site I will need to import com.wolfram.jlink in my java program like so:               import com.wolfram.jlink.*;      I can't seem to get it to work. When I try to compile my compiler says that the com.wolfram package does not exist. I'm guessing that I need to download and install the com.wolfram package somewhere but I don't know where to acquire it and google has been less than helpful. In case it's helpful I'm running JRE 1.6 on a machine running windows 7.
