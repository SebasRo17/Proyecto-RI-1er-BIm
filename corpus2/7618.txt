Perhaps the greatest promise of using object-oriented paradigm is the code reuse. Some dispute that this was achieved. Why was it (not) achieved? Does code reuse as OOP defines it, make projects more productive? Or more manageable? Or easier to maintain? Or with more quality? Probably we all agree that code reuse is a good thing, but there are several ways to achieve this goal. The question is about the method of code reuse offered by OOP. Was it a good thing? **Are there better methods to achieved code reuse** than object orientation, sub-classing, polymorphism, etc.? What ways are better? **Why**? Tell us your experience with OOP reuse or other paradigms reuse.
