I'm trying to solve the recurrence               a[n] == 0 for n < l     a[l] == 1     a[n] == (l + 2(n - l) a[n - l] + (n - l)(n - 1) a[n - 1])/n(n - l + 1) for n >= l      using the ODE               l = 2;     DSolve[(x^2 y''[x] + (2 - l) x y[x]) (x - 1) + 2 x^(l + 1) y'[x] + (l x^l)/(1 - x) == 0,        y[x], x]      For `l = 2` it works, but not for `l > 2`. Is it possible to do it? Maybe there is another way to solve this recurrence ?
