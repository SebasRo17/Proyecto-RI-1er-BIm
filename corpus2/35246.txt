Using Print[], I know it is possible to print out "helping text" to better understand a solution:               Print["The solution is: ", x]      if x holds some value. Now, this text is displayed using typewriter's font and OutputForm (I think: correct me if I'm wrong...). Is it possible, and if so, how, to display this outcome using TraditionalForm for `x` and using non typewriter's font for the text?               "The solution is: " x // TraditionalForm      doesn't give the desired result, as once `x` holds a value, it is moved to the front of the expression. Thanks for all help!
