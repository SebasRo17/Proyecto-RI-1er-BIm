I'm asked to refactor my component code to support A/B Testing. What is the better approach:   1) Pass a boolean value to the methods and check for that flag inside the method body?               method(flag abTest):             if A_VERSION_ENABLED:            // Do 'A' logic         else            // Do 'B' logic      2) Create dedicated methods for each version?               codeForATest()     codeForBTest()
