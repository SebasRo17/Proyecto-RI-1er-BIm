I'm getting used in working with git at the moment. And I'm touching an issue that is unclear to me. I feel compelled, if I think of commiting after a change and making a documenting description. I don't know exactly _when_ I should commit, because that's very relative and there's always something under construction. I tend to commit, when I fear to hose something. But then the summaries look like "Backup before trying this and that" or just "Backup". What do you do? Is there a better way, or is my practise common?
