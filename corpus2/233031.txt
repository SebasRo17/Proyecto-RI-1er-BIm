Given two sorted array in ascending order with same length N, calculate the Kth min a[i]+b[j]. Time complexity `O(N).` Another variant of the question goes like this: given a matrix with sorted rows, and sorted columns, find kth smallest. We can easily formulate an `O(klogk)` solution with minheap, but the challenge is doing the same in `O(N)` time ... The paper below formulates the solution but I could not understand it. Can somebody explain it or any alternative idea? hint: http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~andy/pubs/X%2BY.pdf
