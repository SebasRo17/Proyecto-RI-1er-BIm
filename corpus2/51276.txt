I am trying to find maximum likelihood estimates of parameters for a fairly complicated multivariate distribution. The support of the distribution depends on its parameters so I need to include some constraints in `NMaximize`. The following is a simplified version of the problem. Consider the following code which generates 1000 observations from a Max Stable distribution and estimates the parameters:               SeedRandom@100;     data = RandomReal[MaxStableDistribution[0, 1, 1], 10^3];     pars = FindDistributionParameters[data, MaxStableDistribution[μ, σ, ξ]]     (* {μ -> -0.0296428, σ -> 0.946788, ξ -> 0.945316} *)      Suppose now we want to find these estimates using `NMaximize`. Let's assume that $\gamma\ne 0$ so I just need to include the constraint $\frac{\gamma (x-\mu )}{\sigma }+1>0$ in the log likelihood function where the `PDF` is given by the following:               ClearAll[G]           G[x_] = PDF[MaxStableDistribution[μ, σ, γ], x] //      FullSimplify[#, γ != 0 && 1 + (γ (x - μ))/σ > 0] &      I have tried to include the constraint $\frac{\gamma (x-\mu )}{\sigma }+1>0$ in the definition of `G` by using `Boole` to no avail. I should add that even without that constraint `Nmaximize` does not return a result:               NMaximize[{Total[Log[G[data]]], σ > 0, γ != 0}, {μ, σ, γ}]      Any suggestions on how to do this would be gratefully appreciated.
