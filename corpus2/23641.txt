So I've downloaded the latest FeynCalc from this site and put the extracted folder in `user/me/library/Mathematica/application`, but when I write the command               << HighEnergyPhysics`FeynCalc`      _Mathematica_ says a bunch of lines saying stuff like: > `FeynAmp::shdw:` Symbol FeynAmp appears in multiple contexts > {`FeynArts``,`HighEnergyPhysics`FeynCalc`FeynAmp``}; definitions in context > `FeynArts`` may shadow or be shadowed by other definitions. >> Anyone know what to do, how to install FeynCalc on a Mac properly? I'm using _Mathematica_ version 8.
