## Context In $\LaTeX$, I can write something like:                 Thus, we have $x = \sqrt{2}$, ...          the $ ... $, as opposed to $$ ... $$, inline the LaTeX symbols.      Now, with _Mathematica_ , I type a line of Input, I press `Shift``Enter`, and it produces the answer on a different line of output. However, I would like to type something like this:                 Thus, we get $c^2 - c = 1$, and solving it, we get $N[solve[c^2 - c = 1, c]]$, ...      The idea is that mathematica evaluates the command, takes the output, and _inlines_ it into the sentence, rather than have it as a separate line. I have no idea how to do this. From what I've read, this sounds like "cells", but from goofing around, it's not clear how to make this work. ## Question: How do I inline a mathematica expression, such that its output is displayed inline?
