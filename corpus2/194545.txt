I'm trying to improve my OOP code and I think my User class is becoming way too fat. In my program a user has rights over "lists". Read, Write, Update, Delete. So I made a User class               class User     {     protected $_id;     protected $_email;     protected $_username;     protected $_hashedPassword;          //...Various setters/getters          public function canRead(List $list){         //Database query verifies if user has READ rights     }          public function canUpdate(List $list){         //Database query verifies if user has UPDATE rights     }     //etc...     }        * Should canRead, canUpdate, canWrite, canDelete methods be moved to another class (UserAccessCheck or something...)?   * If not, should the actual SQL be moved into the List object (listCanBeReadByUser()) ?
