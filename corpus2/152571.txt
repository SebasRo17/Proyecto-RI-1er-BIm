Researching distributed source control management (specifically mercurial). My question is more or less **what is the best practice for rejecting entire sets of code that fail testing?** **Example:** A team is working on a hello world program. They have testers and a scheduled release coming up with specific features planned.               Upcoming Release:        Add feature A        Add feature B        Add feature C      So, the developers make their clones for their features, do the work and merge them into a QA repo for the testers to scrutinize. Let's say the testers report back that "Feature B is incomplete and in fact dangerous", and they would like to retest A and C. ![Repo Doodle](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DteiT.png) **End example.** What's the best way to do all this so that feature B can easily be removed and you end up with a new repo that contains only feature A and C merged together? Recreate the test repo? Back out B? Other magic?
