Hello Mathematica users, I have problems trying to eliminate variable $Q(x,y)$ froma PDE, but Mathematica output is just `True`. The problem is that I already found how to eliminate it. We can apply $d/dx$ on the second equation and then from the first equation we can determine and substitute $dQ[x,y]/dx$ in the second. Why can't Mathematica do that? My output is in that case a PDE of fourth order, but I don't have `Q[x,y]`, which is the aim, and I solved it by hand.                Eliminate[{A0*D[w[x,y],{y,2}]-B0*D[w[x,y],{x,2}]-        C0*D[Q[x,y],{x,1}]+C0*D[w[x,y],{x,2}]==0,        E0*D[Q[x,y],{y,2}]-FF0*D[Q[x,y],{x,2}]-CC0*D[w[x,y],{x,1}]-Q[x,y]==0},         {(Q^(0,2))[x,y],(Q^(1,0))[x,y],Q[x,y]}]
