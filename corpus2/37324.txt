I am trying to solve equations which looks like this: $$ T_{ab} - T_{bc} = a_1 T_{ab} + a_2 T_{ac} + a_3 T_{bc}, $$ where $T_{xy}$ are tensors. I want to get the $a_i$'s (in this simple example $a_1=1$, $a_2=0$, $a_3=-1$). The problem is that the Mathematica solving routines (`Solve`, `LinearSolve`) divide the equation by $T_{xy}$ to obtain a solution (or solutions), which is (or some of them are), in turn, not a solution (solutions). What I tried to circumvent this problem: I know (from the construction of my equation) that all $a_i$'s are element $\\{-1,0,1\\}$. So I tried to set the domain to integers. But this gives me lots of condidtional solutions (like `if Tab=integer, then...`) which I don't want. Of course I could solve the above example equation by hand, but in the end I will need to solve a few hundred equations of this type with 70 tensors or so. Thanks in advance for any attempt to help me! Anton
