Can anyone see how to fix this text display? The example is from a larger project. I need to export the graphic at high resolution, but the text is going wrong.               text = StringTake[        ExampleData[{"Text", "DonQuixoteIEnglish"}], {110600, 110914}];          a = Graphics[{{LightBlue, Rectangle[{0, -0.21}, {1, -0.04}]},        Inset[Graphics[{{LightYellow, Rectangle[{0, 0}, {450, 40}]},           Inset[            TextCell[text, LineSpacing -> {0, 16}, TextJustification -> 1],            Center, Center, {450, 40}]},          BaseStyle -> {FontSize -> 12}, PlotRange -> {{0, 450}, {0, 40}}],         {0.5, -0.155}, Center, {0.9, Automatic}]},       PlotRange -> {{0, 1}, {-0.21, -0.04}}, ImageSize -> 600]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Is0fv.png)               Rasterize[a, ImageResolution -> 300]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gZioC.png) N.B. This problem is happening on Mathematica 7. I just checked on Mathematica 9 and it works ok, but I need to run it on version 7.
