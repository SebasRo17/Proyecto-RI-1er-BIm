I am trying to compute the product of a sequence of matrices using the command `ParallelDo`. Of course, if I use the simpler command `Do`, I am able to do the computation. In order to set my current problem, I've considered my Table of Matrices (with another less trivial values):               R = ParallelTable[i*IdentityMatrix[2], {i, 0, n}]      And now, I would like to compute something like:               g = IdentityMatrix[2];     Do[g = R[[i]].g, {i, 1, n}]      To reduce the computing time, I would like to use `ParallelDo`. Can someone help me please?
