I will release my first shareware soon and I'm wondering for how long should a paying user be entitled to free updates. I can think of three options:   * You buy a version then all the updates are free for one year (eg. SmartFTP)   * You buy a version then all the minor updates (mostly includes bug fixes) are free (eg. UltraEdit)   * You buy a version and all the minor and major updates are free forever (eg. Total Commander) It seems that different applications use different ways. What would you recommend?
