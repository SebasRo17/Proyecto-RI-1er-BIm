FindInstance[680 == 1/3 2^m (-1 + 4^v), {m, v}, Integers]      `FindInstance` seems to be unable to find the integer solution $ {m = 3,v = 4} $ in the equation above (failing with the message:               FindInstance::nsmet : The methods available to FindInstance are insufficient to find     the requested instances or prove they do not exist.      Is there are technique that can be used to find integer solutions to equations like the above?
