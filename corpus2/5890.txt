Is there a way to _temporarily_ suppress certain messages, so that I could write for example (with made-up syntax for that feature):               WithOff[Pattern::patv, rule = (f[x_Integer|{x__Integer}] :> g[x])];     rule2 = x_[x__] :> x;      and get no `Pattern::patv` message for `rule`, but do get one for `rule2` iff the message was enabled at the beginning (that is, `WithOff` doesn't affect the on/off status of the message outside of its argument)?
