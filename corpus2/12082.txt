I am looking for a few ideas on how to change a highly conventional work culture to be more innovated in their approached to problem solving. I've come across this article and am looking for more specific and practical ways that we as developers can help each other think outside of the box. I've constructed a simple formula of how to energize innovation in my everyday development. (Please critique this for improvement) Input External Data/Info -> Creates New Ideas/Concepts -> Communicates/Shares Ideas -> Trusts Others -> Risks Trials -> Innovation Happens What are some of your attitudes, thought processes, and behaviors towards approaching a challenging problem in way that would be considered innovative?
