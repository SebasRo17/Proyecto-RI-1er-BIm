I've been reading and thinking a lot lately, and I've come to the conclusion that I maybe I should rethink my web development strategy. I'm doing a lot of on-the-fly programming, and in the 2 years I've been working on a PHP web application, what might have begun as a little tool became quite the big project. But there is a ton of _legacy_ code from me and my predecessor, snippet of code that might have make sense at the time, but now I'm questioning the usefulness of said code in the form it is actually. Furthermore so such things like unit testing and Test-Driven Development wasn't in my scope until quite recently. So how would you approach refactoring the web application? What would be the things I should look for and in which order? What about browser game versus functional web app? Would there be then difference in the approach?
