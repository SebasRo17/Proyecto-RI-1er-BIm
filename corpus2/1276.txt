**Is there a pattern to match a list of lists, containing at least one list, with each list containing at least one element?** In the Mathematica documentation it says that the pattern               x:{___List}      will match a list of lists. This is true, but it also matches `{}`, which is a list of zero lists (or zero _anything_ ). To make sure there is at least one list in my list of lists I can remove one of the underscores to change `BlankNullSequence` to `BlankSequence`, i.e. switch to               x:{__List}      which no longer matches `{}`. It does, however, match `{{}}`. How can I also guarantee that each matched sublist is non-empty? Is this even possible, or should I be checking for it programmatically within the `Module` to which I'm passing arguments of this form?
