I'm experimenting with Inversion-of-Control (callback) programming patterns, and I would like a way to generate streams of data at specified real-time intervals. I came up with the illustrated way to use Animate (or Manipulate) to do it, and that's fine for experiments with the notebook front end, but I would like to have pure-code solutions I could put in a .m package. As always, I will be grateful for any hints, advice, and solutions! ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dvVuZ.jpg)
