I'm currently in the process of modifying a C++ code that was written for UNIX system so that it works by compiling from Visual Studio. I had to change some built-in functions' names and I had to change the way dynamic arrays are defined. My question is, can I say that I'm 'porting' this code from UNIX to Windows/Visual Studio or is 'porting' used only when changing from one programming language to another (porting from C++ to Java)?
