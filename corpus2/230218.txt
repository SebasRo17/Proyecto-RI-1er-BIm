We want to export some data from our data base as XML. For example, a `Person` can have `age`, `name` and some other properties. We have two choices to define the XML format. Choice #1:               <Persons>        <Person>            <Age>16</Age>            <Name>Richard</Name>        </Person>        <Person>            <Age>34</Age>            <Name>Eric</Name>        </Person>        ...     </Persons>      Choice #2:               <Persons>        <Person Age="16" Name="Richard"/>        <Person Age="34" Name="Eric"/>        ...     </Persons>      So what's the difference between definition of sub node or attribute? And what's the benefit of each choice?
