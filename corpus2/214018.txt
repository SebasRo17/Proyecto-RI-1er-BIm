Once I heard that a good book on any programming language cannot be short, so the number of pages is the first criterium when choosing a tutorial. The statement was half a joke, but it has some truth in it. There are tens and hundreds of books available for most popular programming languages, frameworks and technologies, and it is hard to choose one. So that _dummy condition_ is the first one to check. Are there any criteria to help choose the "right" tutorials? What is the first (or probably the second) thing to pay attention on when choosing a technical tutorial?
