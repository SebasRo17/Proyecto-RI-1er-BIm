It took me time T to develop program A, which is measured at 1000 lines of code (SLOC), in certain a language and domain and of a certain complexity. Is there a method to determine how much time it will take to develop program B, which is estimated to be 4000 lines, that has the same level of complexity, is in the same domain, and is developed in the same programming language? I expect that the time it takes me will be grater than 4T. Is there a formula to estimate how T grows as SLOC count grows?
