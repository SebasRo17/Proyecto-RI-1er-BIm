> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Is Entity framework reliable enough to use in a Corporate Project? Should I > use Entity? I'm a junior developer who's just completed a project using Entity framework. Unfortunately I was chewed out by one of the Senior Developers at my work citing that I should have used ADO.net and that Entity Framework quote: "Is not reliable or feasible in a corporate application". Although I think this is mostly exaggeration - are there any truth to his claims? If so, what are the facts / sources (and will this change with the release of Entity Framework 5)? If not - what can I use to justify my position that Entity is as reliable as ADO.net.
