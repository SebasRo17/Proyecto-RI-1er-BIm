Mathematica has a function for sending mail (`SendMail`) and can import the `MBOX` format. But what I'd like to do is programmatically _retrieve_ mail from a Gmail account, from within _Mathematica_ on a Windows system. Is this possible? **Use case:** I use MarineTraffic.com's e-mail notifications about ship arrivals to watch interesting ships as they pass by. I'd like to filter incoming messages from them and use data from previous notifications to filter 'seen' ships. I may want to do some automated lookup on ship names too to find those that are more likely to be interesting. A perfect task for _Mathematica_ â€” if only I could periodically get the new mails and process them!
