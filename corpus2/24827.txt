Applying `EdgeDetect` to an image generates a black and white edge-detected image, which I suspect corresponds to an underlying binary matrix. How can I access this underlying data structure, and map between a given matrix position and the corresponding coordinates in the processed image? Ideally, I'd just like a list of, say, the $1$'s or $0$'s in the matrix (whatever corresponds to the white lines in the edge-detected image) and their coordinates.
