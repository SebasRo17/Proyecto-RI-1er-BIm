In this answer Brett Champion describes how one can intercept and modify the suggestions used for auto-completion. **Question:** Is it possible to modify the suggestion for the automatic auto- completion in _Mathematica_ version 9? ## Background I think it's possible to improve the auto-completion significantly by using _camel humps completion_. If you want to see it in action, I made a small screen-cast to demonstrate it for _Mathematica_ **version 8** (please switch to 1080p and fullscreen): ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/M7IDx.jpg)   * ~~For all users from good old Germany or~~ for users who prefer classical music: here is a ~~GEMA friendly,~~ musically educating version.   * Users from Germany can enjoy this screen-cast in comforting silence! The basic idea is to   * allow `ListLiPlo`, `ListLPlot` or even `LLP` to be expanded to `ListLinePlot`. Since all _Mathematica_ built-in functions are consistently named, this works pretty well   * to sort the list of suggestions by importance. In the screencast, I used the appearance of built-in functions in all packages of the `AddOns` directory as measure. The more often a function was used, the more likely it is to be on top of the list if it matches. To give an example: When you expand `Pl` in version 8, you get a list consisting of `Placed`, `Placeholder`, `PlaceholderRepeated`, `Plain`, `Play`, ... Those are all functions I barely use. I the auto-expansion I wrote, `Plot`, `PlotRange` and `Plus` are on the top of the list and after them all the others follow. In version 9 this was fixed and the completion box seems to have a better ordering.
