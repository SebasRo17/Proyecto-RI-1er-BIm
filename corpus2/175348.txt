The development team has finished a website and my duty is to prepare a document so that other programmers can maintain the website with ease. I have no experience in this and would like to ask what should be mentioned (document structure) in that report? So far my idea is only to prepare a ERD diagarm for the database and flow chart for each function. Any other suggestions, eg. what cookies stored?
