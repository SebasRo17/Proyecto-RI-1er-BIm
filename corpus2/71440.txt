**QUESTION** : How can you re-write the questions of the Joel test to apply to web developers? > 1\. Do you use source control?   >  **(source control for _all_ aspects of your app, including configuration, > database and user-based settings?)** > > 2\. Can you make a build in one step?   >  **(can you deploy a site from staging to prod in 1 step?)**   >  ...   >  10\. Do you have testers?   >  **(how do you test AJAX and CSS?)** **BACKGROUND** : This is for people who work in a shop that does some web development but also uses some off-the-shelf tools like Drupal and Wordpress, but doing custom development on top of that.
