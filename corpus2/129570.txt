Today I have held my first interview with potential interns. While this has been mostly open questions, I have had some trivial programming tasks for them:   * Write a function that returns true if triangle sides (all integers) a, b and c can represent a right triangle.   * FizzBuzz.   * Calculate the Nth element of Fibonacci using recursion (if they didn't know what Fibonacci was, I would even write them the definition F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2); F(1) = 1; F(0) = 1).    * Implement structure List for integer and write function to reverse it. These are obviously very easy tasks and I was not prepared for someone not to solve them. How should I act when they struggle with these questions? Should I give up the answer? Give tip by tip (I did that and ended up solving the problem myself)? Or just move on (or maybe just stop) with the interview? ps. By having problems with questions, I don't mean like having a bug, I mean if they can't even get started. This was a case with Fibonacci and List questions.
