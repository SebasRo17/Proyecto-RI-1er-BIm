I'm looking for historical statistics showing approximately how many developers of some language X switch to language Y. It should be the kind of data that answers question such as:   * Are former VB6 developers using mainly C# or VB.NET now?   * Have many Java developers switched their main development language to Scala so far?   * etc. I'm not doing a study, I'm mainly curious. Is there some website or institution that collects and publishes such data?
