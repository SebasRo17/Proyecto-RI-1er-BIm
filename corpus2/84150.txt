I have a history of web development using LAMP + html/css (though I admit the LAMP aspect isn't in great depth) and would like to follow the career path of software developer, so I'm currently learning C, after which I'll look at C++. **I was wondering if anybody could give me a list of subject area's within computer programming as a whole that are important to fully understand, right through to a 'senior' level of career progression?** Obviously I know it's the mindset and knowing when to use various techniques that makes a good programmer, but you have to start somewhere! By topic areas I mean for examples:   * Data types   * Variables   * Functions   * OO   * etc. Many thanks.
