I am inheriting a legacy code. The legacy code has lot of web forms and each web form does not have much of functionality other than hosting a user control. My question is -   * Should we create a user control even if that control is not used in any other web form ?   * Are there any hard benefits in creating user controls over web forms? P.S - Web forms are .aspx files and User Controls are .ascx files.
