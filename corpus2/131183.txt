Ever since I've started lurking on stackoverflow, I keep coming across programming concepts such as abstract classes, virtual functions, contracts, interfaces, etc., from a questions about other languages such as C++, Java, and C#. As far as I can tell, most of these things are related to object oriented programming but aren't typically mentioned in Python tutorials because Python uses a combination of duck typing and magic to make such concepts redundant. Nevertheless, I'd still like to know what they are.   **What are abstract classes, virtual functions, contracts, interfaces, etc. (explained from a Python standpoint?) What other programming/OOP concepts should I know about that Python typically doesn't use or require you to know?**
