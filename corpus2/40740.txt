# The Spiral I'm trying to place circles along the outside of an Archimedean spiral. Shown below: ![Archimedian Spiral from 0 to 6 Pi](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nbgyo.png)               ParametricPlot[{θ/(2*π)*Cos[θ], θ/(2*π)*Sin[θ]}, {θ, 0, 6π}, PlotStyle -> Red]      # The Circles ![Circle placement](http://i.stack.imgur.com/k60VS.png) To do this effectively I have been trying to use the Law of Cosines to determine the change in the angle. I found the path that would contain the circle centers:               f[θ_] := {((π+θ) Cos[θ])/(2π), ((π+θ) Sin[θ])/(2π)}      Using the Law of Cosines for the following: ![Law of Cosines for this example](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bTZ7J.png) Seems pretty straight forward, right? Well, when I went to solve for the angle alpha Mathematica seems to have trouble. ![code](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pUoAQ.png) seems to work "fine", but any subsequent evaluations don't seem to go smoothly. In fact, any evaluation that does not contain Pi seems to fail, and an evaluation of the distance between the points shows that the angle is off (!=1). ![Distance](http://i.stack.imgur.com/hK9FI.png) # The Question What am I doing wrong to be more than 5% off from what I expect. Also, is there a more efficient and correct method to solve for the angle? # An End Product Thanks to KennyColnago for his response. ![Final Product](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YVpvo.png)
