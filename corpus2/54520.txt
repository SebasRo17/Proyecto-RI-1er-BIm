These are distinct but related questions about mapping functions to Associations and Datasets. Given:               assoc = <| a -> 1, b -> 2, c -> 3|>       And               data =       Dataset@{<| a -> 1, b -> 2, c -> 3|> , <|a -> 4, b -> 5, c -> 6|>}      Re MapAt:               MapAt[Framed, Key[b]][assoc]       ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WMKvE.jpg) Although Dataset is not explicitly mentioned in the doc page for MapAt, it's supposed to apply to generic expressions. However:               MapAt[Framed, Key[b]][data]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cvR8u.png) Next, consider mapping over a named `Key` with this syntax:               data[All, {Key[b] -> Framed}] // Normal      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/aOdkY.png) Why don't the following variations work on `Dataset`?               data[All, Key[b] -> Framed] // Normal      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wpseG.png)               data[All, Key[b] -> Framed[#] &] // Normal      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3H6Em.png) Finally, back to Association:               assoc[Key[b] -> Framed] // Normal      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/JvPh5.png)
