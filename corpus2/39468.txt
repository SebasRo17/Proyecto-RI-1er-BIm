Currently there are a list of notebooks in Windows that I am processing in a folder. Ideally I would like the notebooks to be concated in the same order as how they display in Windows Explorer. I found the question Sort Strings By Natural Order, but none of the answers seem to use the same technique as Windows Explorer. After reading What is the first character in the sort order used by Windows Explorer?, it appears that Windows has an internal function that could be used to naturally sort the filenames. I plan to run this only on Windows, so it is okay if it depends on OS-specific functions, though a pure Mathematica way would be nice. I believe that Windows sorts the files based on ASCII order unless a number is encountered. Ideally I am looking for a function that sorts a list of names into the following order when run. None of the answers linked above correctly order the names below.               {"Ie4 01", "Ie4!01", "Ie4_01", "Ie4_128", "Ie5", "Ie6", "Ie401sp2",       "Ie501sp2"}                    Ie4 01     Ie4!01     Ie4_01     Ie4_128     Ie5     Ie6     Ie401sp2     Ie501sp2
