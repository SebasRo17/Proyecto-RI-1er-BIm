Given a pretty long expression, such as               a={-11 ψ^2 λ[1]+6 ψ λ[2],35 ψ^2 λ[2],11 ψ^2 λ[1]^2-11 ψ^2 λ[2]-6 ψ λ[1] λ[2],ψ^2 λ[1]^2-ψ^2 λ[2]-ψ λ[1] λ[2]+λ[2]^2,-λ[1]^3+2 λ[1] λ[2],-3 ψ λ[1]^3+6 ψ λ[1] λ[2]+λ[1]^2 λ[2]-λ[2]^2,-ψ λ[1]^3+λ[1]^4+2 ψ λ[1] λ[2]-3 λ[1]^2 λ[2]+λ[2]^2}      `a >> tmp` would output the expression of `a` to an external file `tmp`. But I don't like the format in this output. It breaks lines, and contains extra spaces between operators of "+-*/". In fact, in _Mathematica_ , selecting an expression, we could do **(right click)** > **Copy as** > **Plain Text** , and then we could paste it to any external text editor without any problem. Is it possible to specify the output stream using this "Plain Text" format above?
