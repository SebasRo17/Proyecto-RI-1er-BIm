I would like to solve the equations as given below in mathematica. I have written some codes before but I have no idea when there is sub indexing to indicate the series of functions. I will be very happy and grateful if you could help me. Here are the equations: $$P[n]=\int_{(-\infty,B)\cup (A,\infty)} q_n (x) \mathrm{d}x$$ and $$q_n(x)=\int_{B}^A q_{n-1} (\omega)f(x-\omega)\mathrm{d} \omega,\quad q_1=f,\quad n\geq 1.$$ and $f$ is some density function, say standard Gaussian density. Eventually, I want to obtain the probability mass $P[n]$. Thank you very much! * * * I wrote this (from Hector's post):               f0[x_] := 1/Sqrt[2*Pi*1^2]*E^(-(x + 1)^2/(2*1^2))     q[n_ /; n > 1, B_, A_, f_][x_] := NIntegrate[q[n - 1, B, A, f][ω] f[x - ω], {ω, B, A}]     q[1, B_, A_, f_][x_] :=f[x]     p[n_, B_, A_, f_] := NIntegrate[q[n, B, A, f][x], {x, -∞, B}] +                                        NIntegrate[q[n, B, A, f][x], {x, A, ∞}]          N[p[1, -2, 2, f0[x]]] --> 0.160005     N[p[2, -2, 2, f0[x]]] --> 0.35594     N[p[3, -2, 2, f0[x]]] --> 0.237045     N[p[4, -2, 2, f0[x]]] --> 0.229432     N[p[5, -2, 2, f0[x]]] --> 0.222063      ##  ... these results seem incorrect because $p$ is the probability mass function and should add up to $1$. Correct results for $f_0$ Gaussian with mean $-1$ and variance $1$ and $A=2$ and $B=-2$:               n=1-->0.1600     n=2-->0.3559     n=3-->0.2323     n=4-->0.1238     n=5-->0.0633     n=6-->0.0320     n=7-->0.0162
