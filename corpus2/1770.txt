I have a question regarding the use of `Parallelize`. In the help one can read that “`Parallelize[Table[expr,iter, …]]` (which is equivalent to `ParallelTable[expr,iter,…])` will give the same results as `Table`, except for side effects during the computation.” Ok, here I have an easy code where I use an `If`-conditional inside my Table:               arrayA=Table[RandomReal[{-1,1}],{i,1,1000}];     arrayToBeFilled=ConstantArray[0,1000];     Parallelize[Table[If[arrayA[[i]]<=0,arrayToBeFilled[[i]]=arrayA[[i]]+5,     arrayToBeFilled[[i]]=arrayA[[i]]-5],{i,1,1000}],Method->Automatic];//Timing      I do not get any useful result except my unaltered initialized array, but if I use the same code without `Parallelize`, it works fine (and even faster)! Since my real code (in principal the same as above but with more calculations) takes some time for evaluation, I hoped that I could increase the speed by using `Parallelize`. But it seems that either I am doing/understanding something wrong or that something is wrong with `Parallelize` by itself. Can somebody tell me what the case is? I also would be happy if somebody could tell me a better way how I could increase the speed of such code as in my example.
