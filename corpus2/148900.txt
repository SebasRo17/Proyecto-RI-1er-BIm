I've considered making modules and the like for various languages and other open source things. Where documentation is not specified but rather is communal de facto standard or entirely ad hoc; should I try to improve from that standard in my code if it is not in-line with what I've learned to be good documentation from reputable sources ( _Code Complete_ et al)? Or should I maintain consistency over all, regardless of quality?
