I want to find the numbers $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ of the plane $ax + by +cz +d = 0$ which make the distance from the point $M(1,2,3)$ to the plane equal to 2. I tried               SetSystemOptions[       "ReduceOptions" -> "ExhaustiveSearchMaxPoints" -> {10000, 100000}];          Clear[n, M];     n = {a, b, c};     M = {1, 2, 3};     TraditionalForm[Simplify[a  x +  b y +  c z + d == 0]] /.       Solve[{Abs[n . M + d]/Norm[n] == 2,         1 <= a <= 10, -5 <= b <= 10, -5 <= c <= 10, a > b > c}, {a, b, c,         d }, Integers]      The set of equations in _Mathematica_ 's output contains duplicates, for example: $8 x+6 y-40=0$ and $4 x+3 y-20=0$. How can I eliminate the duplicates?
