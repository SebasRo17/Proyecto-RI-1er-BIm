I am given this set of code and need to suggest ways to improve the code's cohesion and coupling of the classes. But I thought these classes are quite well de-coupled since it looks like they are making use of events. And in terms of cohesion, all the init() calls are placed together, everything seems quite alright to me.               public class A     {         private C t;         private B g;         public static void main(String args[]) {             // Creates t and g.             t = new C();             t.init();             g = new B();             g.init();             g.start(this);         }         pubic void update (Event e)         {             // Performs updating of t based on event         }     }          public class C     {         public C() { ... }         public void init() { ... }     }          public class B     {         public B() { ... }              public void init() { ... }              public void start(A s) {             e = getNextEvent();             while (e. type != Quit)                 if (e.type == updateB)                     update(e) ;                 else                     s.update(e) ;             e = getNextEvent();         }              public void update(Event e) { ... }         }     }      Are there still ways to improve the classes cohesion and coupling? It looks ok to me but I think I am missing something out. Thanks for any suggestions on this.
