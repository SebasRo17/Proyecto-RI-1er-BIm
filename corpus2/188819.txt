I'm working in a software development area in my university, and we've noticed we need some system to track errors and bugs, who and when it is dealt with. I've researched some software management/bug tracking applications, with Redmine being the one that appeals to me the most because of its simple UI (actually I discovered that our server has one system, Trac, already installed, but it has never been used at its time and my colleagues told me it would take the same time to use any). However, a colleague told me also that he has the idea of implementing a _customer issue-tracking system_ in the medium/long term (he told me about creating tickets for users' problem, search into a knowledge base of common problems, and mark frequent problems to deal with them. It seems that things like OTRS are close to what he was thinking about. He's also researching about ITIL). As far as I know, the developer issue-tracking system and the client problem- tracking system are different, and they must have some kind of integration between them. **Or aren't they?** In case it does, my question is: Is it possible to integrate Redmine (or Trac, if it's easier, or in general a project management/bug-tracking system) with this kind of customer issue- tracking systems? Do I have to worry about changing my project management system in the future to implement that? Or is the implementation easier with some of them?
