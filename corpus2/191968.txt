I have a very interesting situation. Management has strictly asked to do unit testing for the code being developed and divided the task in such a way that few are developing the code and others are writing the test cases for the code. Now developer keeps on refactoring the code and others keep on changing the test cases. I told them that this is not the best practice(since person who is developing the code need to write test case), but they are not willing to listen me and citing all kind of examples from their past experiences where work is divided like this way. How should I convince them or deal with this situation. Edit: I am looking for some argument/proof which could make them think. * * * Note I asked management about reasons for this and they told me that we are just dividing the workload. I opposed for this and told them that it is not best practice, then they started citing some of their past experiences. Actually, one of team members has accepted the task in past. At that time I tried to convince him to oppose this and now they are saying if he can do why can't you. I have accepted to do as of now but I want to stop this as practice. To my best I want to demonstrate something that can convince them.
