I never developed for the Cloud, and to tell you the truth I am not fully 100% sure of what Cloud is when coming down to servers and services. I am starting to develop an App where I will need to be able to scale as needed. The App has a lot of User entries as well as file uploads. Think is as a "forum" (this is the closest model that I can think that applies to my App). User will be able to register, create "threads", create "polls", answer, and vote. They can also upload images, videos, and audio files. The person that previously created the website used 'Auto-increment" fields to keep track of the user ids. while rebuilding the page I was thinking to drop that part and use UUID() for all the users entries, this, I believe might solve the concurrency of entries at the same millisecond or weird locks or duplicate ids or possible other problems... but... other than that, I do not have a clue of what the "cloud" would do. Those are my questions:   * I will use MySQL as DB, will I have to connect to different DBs to write to alleviate the stress or I should not even worry about that because the "cloud" will take care of that? (I will have replication for the reads)   * When accessing files, will I have to know on what server the files where uploaded to be able to serve them, or will the "cloud" magically do that ?   * If I increase the "cloud" space by adding a new server, what should I know about it? simply deploy it and everything is up and running or will I need to do something to my code to tell "hey, there is another instance, now do this and that differently" Thank you and I hope you understood what I meant.
