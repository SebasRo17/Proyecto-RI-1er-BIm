I am about to take the Java 6 SE Certification Exam on Thursday. Just wondering if any of you found anything unexpected on these exams or things you wished you had paid more attention on. Any general tips, tricks, or warnings, would be greatly appreciated. (Please don't waste time trying to tell me that I am wasting my time/money, because I am just doing this so that I can get an instant A in my Java class.) Thanks!
