I would like to plot convex polyhedron with 100 faces, which could be used as a die. My first attempt was asking for Conway's Hecatohedron. Unfortunatly, it can not be used as a die. Now there are two objects which would satisfy what I need; and I would like to know how to plot them in Mathematica: 1) A 100 faces Spericon. A picture can be seen here. 2) A Bipyramid with 100 faces. And a follow-up questions: Are there other objects which would represent 100-sided dice? Maybe a generalisation of Archimedean solids?
