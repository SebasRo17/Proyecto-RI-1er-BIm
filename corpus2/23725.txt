I have an undirected graph $G$. How would I randomly assign directions to some fraction $p$ of the edges? How might I do this efficiently / quickly provided I have a large graph structure? For example, to assign a graph random edge weights, I might write:               GraphWithRandomWeights = Graph[EdgeList[G], EdgeWeight -> Table[RandomReal[{-1, 1}], {abc, 1, Length[EdgeList[G]]}]];
