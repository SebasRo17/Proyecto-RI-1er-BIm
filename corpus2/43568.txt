I am new to _Mathematica_ and if this is a simple query - please excuse me for the same. I am trying to solve a equation which is a function of two variables. From the solution, I need to store the values of two variables, satisfying this equation into a table to be used for further calculation. The code is as given below :               Remove[Global]          x = 2 r Cos[v + u + γ] - r Cos [(2 v) + u + γ]        (*x coordinate*)     Nxu = D[x, u]     Nxv = D[x, v]     Nx = Nxu Nxv                                          (*normal to x*)          y = 2 r Sin[v + u + γ] - r  Sin[(2 v) + u + γ]        (*y coordinate*)     Nyu = D[y, u]     Nyv = D[y, v]     Ny = Nyu Nyv                                          (*normal to y*)          z = p u                                               (*z coordinate*)     Nzu = D[z, u]     Nzv = D[z, v]     Nz = Nzu Nzv                                          (*normal to z*)          re = 27.5     r = 16.5     g = ArcCos[((5 r^2) - (re^2))/(4 r^2)]     p = 108/(2 π)     γ = 45° 2 Pi / 360     A = 50 + r     γc = 46° 2 Pi / 360          Equation of meshing      EM [u_, v_] = Simplify[(A - x + p Cot[γc]) Nz + (A Cot[γc]) Ny + z Nx ]          ug[thet_] := With[{u = thet}, NSolve[EM[u, v] == 0 && 0 <= v <= g, v, Reals]]     Map[ug, Range[0, 2 Pi, 0.01]]
