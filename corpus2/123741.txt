I am basically a java programmer who wants to move to .net. I haven't worked in .NET companies so I don't have any idea about the tools they use. In a Java company people use Maven, Hibernate and frameworks such as JSF or Tapestry. My questions are: What are the tools/frameworks that .NET/C# companies use? Do they use ASP.NET MVC? Do they use any ORM tool? Do they use any framework? I will be happy if someone could tell me about this.
