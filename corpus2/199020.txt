I hold a bachelors in CS, but generaly, i call myself a beginner in programming. With an emphasis in focusing on learning to code and make Android Apps. I have gone through this common (http://developer.android.com/training) tutorial. Read through, and close to the end so as to get a general understanding. Done their example of Hello world. The next i want is a set of codes that i can go through, practice with them so as to build my skill to a harder level. I really want this so bad, and i want to do App development as a carrier. I appreciate any advice given.
