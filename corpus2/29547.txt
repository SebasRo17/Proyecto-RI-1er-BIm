I have a simple module like               BCdet[x_, y_] := Module[       {AuxMat},       AuxMat = Mat /. {f -> x, A -> y};       Det[AuxMat]       ]      where `Mat` is a normal matrix 12x12 with parameters `f` and `A`. The above defined module returns a complex number and it works without any problems. Then I would like to find root of its real part for given `A=trailA` and for a complex `f`               FindRoot[      Re[BCdet[f, trialA]],      {f, 2.5 + 0. I},      StepMonitor :> Print["Step to f = ", f]      ]      Unfortunately, this does not work at all. I cannot get any result. I use `StepMonitor` to check it, however, it does not give any output. Any idea where might be the problem?
