I'm trying to implement the paper titled An Image Signature for any Kind of Image, but I'm having trouble understanding what they mean in this paragraph: > For each column of the image, we compute the sum of absolute values of > differences between adjacent pixels in that column. We compute the total of > all columns, and crop the image at the 5% and 95% columns, that is, the > columns such that 5% of the total sum of differences lies on either side of > the cropped image. We crop the rows of the image the same way (using the > sums of original uncropped rows). First, what do they mean by "sum of absolute values of differences between adjacent pixels in that column"? If start at the top-left pixel and work downwards (down the column), we can compute the difference between (0,0) and (0,1), but what about the next pixel? Am I supposed to compute the difference with just the pixel below, or the pixels on either side, or perhaps even the 4 or 8 neighbours? And then, as I understand it, we sum these differences for each column such that each column is reduced to a single number? Then we use this information to crop the _left_ and _right_ edges of the photo, right?
