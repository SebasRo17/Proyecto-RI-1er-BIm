I have an image which looks like ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cET4A.png) from How to convert an image to a graph and get the positions of the edges? which by using `MorphologicalGraph` becomes a graph that is a collections of polygons:               i = Import["http://i.stack.imgur.com/cET4A.png"];     g = MorphologicalGraph[i,           EdgeStyle -> Directive[Orange, Opacity[.5], Thickness[.01]],          GraphStyle -> "ThickEdge"];     Show[ColorNegate@Dilation[i, 1], g]      I am wondering if, for each polygon, it is possible to extract the number of edges?
