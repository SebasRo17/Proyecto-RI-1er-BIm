I want to print a notebook that owns syntax color,I use the Szabolcs's method               SetOptions[$FrontEndSession, PrintingStyleEnvironment -> "Working"]      Then I can achieve a PDF file shown as below: ![Working Enviroment](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CoA15.png) However,when I change the `PrintingStyleEnvironment to "Printout"`               SetOptions[$FrontEndSession, PrintingStyleEnvironment -> "Printout"]      ![Printout Enviroment](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3tM4q.png) I feel the fontsize in the `Working Enviroment` is more large than `Printout Enviroment`. So my question is: **How to make the fontsize in`Working Enviroment` be same with `Printout Enviroment`.** **I feel the fontsize in`Printout Enviroment` is very suitable.**
