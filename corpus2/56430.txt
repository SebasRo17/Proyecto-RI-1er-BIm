There are several web frameworks for Haskell like Happstack, Snap, and Yesod, and probably a few more. In what aspects do they differ from each other? For example:   * features (e.g. server only, or also client scripting, easy support for different kinds of database)   * maturity (e.g. stability, documentation quality)   * scalability (e.g. performance, handy abstraction)   * main targets Also, what are examples of real-world sites / web apps using these frameworks? Many thanks.
