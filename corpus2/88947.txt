Whenever I start to solve some complex problem and try to solve it by program. I feel demotivated. Instead of feeling excited about it I feel like I wont be able to solve this program its very difficult. I know I can solve it but because of these feelings its takes long time to solve it. Whenever I get a change to solve some tough problem this fear will come to my mind and it will stop me from thinking or will tell me you wont be able to do this etc. This fear has taken over me since long time. I know this is psychological fear but it disturbs me a lot. It stops me from becoming the best programmer I always wanted to be. Please help.
