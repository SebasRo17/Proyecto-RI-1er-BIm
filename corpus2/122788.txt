So my professor was giving back some feedback on a project I've been working on. He docked a few marks for this code:               if (comboVendor.SelectedIndex == 0) {       createVendor cv = new createVendor();       cv.ShowDialog();       loadVendors();     }      This is in a combobox "index changed" handler. It's used when the user wants to create a new vendor, my top option (index 0, that never changes) opens the "Create a new Vendor" dialog. So the content of my combo box ends up looking like this:               Create New Vendor...     Existing Vendor     Existing Vendor 2     Existing Vendor 3      His problem is with the first line code:               if (comboVendor.SelectedIndex == 0)      He claims that the 0 should be a constant, and actually docked me marks because of that. He claims I shouldn't use literals in my code at all. The thing is, I don't understand why I would want to make that code in that situation a constant. That index will never change, nor is it something that you would need to tweak. It seems like a waste of memory to keep a single 0 in memory that's used for a very specific situation and never changes.
