I need to rebuild an old huge website and probably to port everyting to `ASP.NET` and `jQuery` and I would like to ask for some suggestion and tips. Actually the website uses:   * `Ajax (client site with prototype.js)`   * `ASP (vb script server side)`   * `SQL Server 2005`   * `IIS 7 as web server` This website uses hundred of stored procedures and the requests are made by an `ajax call` and **only 1 ASP page** that contain an huge `select case` Shortly an example: JAVASCRIPT + PROTOTYPE:               var data = {         action:     'NEWS',         callback:   'doNews',         param1:     $('text_example').value,         ......:     ..........};     AjaxGet(data); // perform a call using another function + prototype      SERVER SIDE ASP:               <% ......     select case request("Action")     case "NEWS"         With cmmDB             .ActiveConnection = Conn             .CommandText = "sp_NEWS_TO_CALL_for_example"             .CommandType = adCmdStoredProc                   Set par0DB = .CreateParameter("Param1", adVarchar, adParamInput,6)             Set par1DB = .CreateParameter(".....", adInteger, adParamInput)             ' ........ ' can be more parameters                  .Parameters.Append par0DB             .Parameters.Append par1DB                  par0DB.Value = request("Param1")             par1DB.Value = request(".....")                  set rs=cmmDB.execute                  RecodsetToJSON rs, jsa ' create JSON response using a sub         End With     .... %>      So as you can see I have an `ASP` page that has a **lot of CASE** and this page **answers to all the ajax request** in the site. My question are:   1. Instead of having many `CASES` is it possible to create dynamic `vb` code that parses the `ajax` request and creates dynamically the call to the desired SP (also implementing the parameters passed by JS)?   2. What is the best approach to handle situations like this, by using the advantages of `.Net + protoype or jQuery`?   3. How the big sites handle situation like this? Do they do it by creating 1 page for request? Thanks in advance for suggestion, direction and tips.
