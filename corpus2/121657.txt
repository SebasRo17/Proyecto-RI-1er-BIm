I'll preface this with I don't know if anyone else who's been programming as long as I have actually has this problem, but at the very least, the answer might help someone with less xp. I just stared at this code for 5 minutes, thinking I was losing my mind that it didn't work:                   var usedNames = new HashSet<string>();         Func<string, string> l = (s) =>             {                 for (int i = 0; ; i++)                 {                     var next = (s + i).TrimEnd('0');                     if (!usedNames.Contains(next))                     {                         return next;                     }                 }             };      Finally I noticed I forgot to add the used name to the hash set. Similarly, I've spent minutes upon minutes over omitting context.SaveChanges(). I think I get so distracted by the details that I'm thinking about that some really small details become invisible to me - it's almost at the level of mental block. Are there tactics to prevent this? update: a side effect of asking this was fixing the error it would have for i > 9 (Thanks!)                   var usedNames = new HashSet<string>();         Func<string, string> name = (s) =>             {                 string result = s;                 if(usedNames.Contains(s))                     for (int i = 1; ; result = s + i++)                         if (!usedNames.Contains(result))                             break;                 usedNames.Add(result);                 return result;             };
