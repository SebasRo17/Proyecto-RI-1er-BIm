Say you've started an open source project and are posting it on a public repository. (like I have, using Codeplex.) One of the key files just makes the connection to the database, contains the login/password, and is just included from any other source file that needs a database connection. What's the best way to share the project without giving out your password? So far I've specifically removed it before committing any changes, but I'm thinking there has to be a better way.
