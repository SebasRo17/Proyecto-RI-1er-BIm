I know PHP and Ruby. Using a PHP Rails clone (not out of choice), called Symfony, (which is apparently the best PHP framework), I notice that it's a clone of Rails. I think Symfony is stupid and that (SensioLabs is a clever business) because Rails already exists. Apart from open-source projects gaining money, I don't understand why people are making Rails clones in PHP, when Rails already exists. Why not use Rails? Surely DHH coded Rails with Ruby for a reason. Using Symfony, I notice that something doesn't quite feel right but I don't know what it is. I learnt Rails through a crap Sitepoint ebook and forgot it, so now I'm learning it through the PragProg ebook and I love that ebook. I don't fully know Rails, but I understand how it works (thanks to Symfony). I would love finish getting through the whole ebook so I can make 2 Rails apps. I remember Rails being more fun than Symfony using the Sitepoint ebook that I couldn't finish, and that had nothing to do with Ruby's pretty syntax.   1. Why is Rails coded in Ruby?   2. What is it about PHP Rails clones, that don't feel right?   3. What is it that Rails is doing, that Rails clones aren't doing?
