If I have a function, that returns a function, for example:               f[a_] := a^2 * # &      then               f[3] == 3^2 # &      Is there a way to tell mathematica that I want part of the function evaluated, so that               f[3] == 9 # &      Obviously this example is quite simple, but in general the evaluation may be slow, and better if it's only performed once. I tried wrapping the important part (in this case, a^2) in 'Evaluate', but that didn't help. Thanks!
