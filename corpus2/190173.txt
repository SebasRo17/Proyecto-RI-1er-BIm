I'm currently seeking a job. I've got a good CV, but little industry experience, and so my difficulty is that I'm not entirely certain what I'm looking for. **What I've done** is a good BSc in Computer Science, and an extensive six- year stint as an all-purpose programmer in a military unit. I won't go into the details, but I've worked on a fairly large number of projects, with huge variety but each of fairly limited scope. I'm also, so far, very much a generalist - I don't have a specific domain I specialize in. **What I've enjoyed most** has been in the realm of design - the object-oriented design of modules, APIs, project architecture, what-have-ye. **As an eventual goal** I believe I'd like to see myself as a software architect. **What I'd like right now** is a position where the OOD features significantly - where I can learn and develop my skills, and eventually practice OOD at a rather larger scale than I have so far. Obviously, nobody has pure OOD as a job description; that's not what I'm expecting and it's not what I'm looking for. But I'm somewhat unfamiliar with the major sub-fields of the software engineering job market, and I my knowledge of major current technologies is pretty basic. I'm finding it very hard to tell from a job description (and even from speaking to an interviewer) whether the job is likely to have a major design element. So many positions I see could involve lots of OOD, or none at all - or at least, so it seems to this inexperienced job-seeker. It seems to depend so much on the precise nature of the job, and on how precisely they use tech stacks I don't know (and won't even know the names of without serious digging, or accepting the job :P). **What can I look for in a position to find a job with a focus on OOD?** Are there particular fields, company-types, or positions I should seek or avoid? Are there questions I can ask at interviews that will help me out?
