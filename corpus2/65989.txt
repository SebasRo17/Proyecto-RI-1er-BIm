In the below Sequence  diagram, when the user have entered the Username and Password, I have to do the authentication. Now you can see two details **valid details** and **invalid detail** in the diagram , which i will return when the **user password match** and **miss-match** respectively. Now My big question is which one i have to draw first, either **valid details** or **invalid detail** , how I know which one will come first.
