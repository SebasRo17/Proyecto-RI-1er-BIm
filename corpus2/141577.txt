some background:   * work with multiple team mates   * each work on our own MBP   * I'm setting a build machine that we can `git push` to in order to generate a build (aim to allow anyone to push to the build machine and then generate an archive, upload to testflight and send on its way)  problem:   * getting my apple developer certificates on the build machine.  I installed Lion, XCode, etc and I signed into my developer account through Xcode organizer, provisioning profiles download,etc. but beside each one it says: `valid signing identity not found` I also download my certificate from the developer.apple.com page, imported it into keychain, etc but no luck. Anyone else have a similar issue? Or maybe hints to fix? Thanks
