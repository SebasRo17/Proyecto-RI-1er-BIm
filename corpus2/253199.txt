I am trying to find a way to organize the branches in my repository in a sensible way. I would like the main branch to contain only "clean" commits: features that are (mostly) complete, no superfluous code that has no role in the current version of the application, etc. I thought that for each feature I should have a separate development branch, and once that feature is complete, it should be merged into the main branch. It this a valid way to organize your repository? Can you recommend a good naming scheme for the development branches? What other ways to organize your repo can you recommend?
