I'm wondering what you call an applications that are not hard coded around any database structure? Let me give a small example: I have one application where the views, the controllers and the model are tailored to the information and fields in the model, and thus the database. I have a second (theoretical) application where the views and controllers are completely generic; I could change the fields in my database and make some minor adjustments to model classes and the application still works for editing/adding information. I wouldn't try to create an application on either of these principles, but I'm wondering what you would label them as.
