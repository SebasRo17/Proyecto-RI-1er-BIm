I keep getting the following question in interviews; and judging from the reactions I've gotten, I'm not giving the best answer. "What methodology do you use for developing user interfaces?" Which seems like a rather broad question. Besides dividing work between markup, stylesheets, and javascript (control logic), what are the best practices? What am I missing in this question? Any thoughts?
