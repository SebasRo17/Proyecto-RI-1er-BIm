I am trying to plot the partial sums and the cesaro means of the function $\sqrt{|x|}$ and for $a_{n}$, I obtained the following code which contains FresnelS.               (-((Sqrt[2] FresnelS[Sqrt[2] Sqrt[n]])/n^(3/2)) - (Sqrt[2] FresnelS[Sqrt[2] Sqrt[Abs[n]]])/Abs[n]^(3/2) + (2 Sin[n \[Pi]])/n + (2 Sin[\[Pi] Abs[n]])/Abs[n])/(2 Sqrt[\[Pi]])      Now my question is is it possible to graph such function using Mathematica? I have tried many examples using trial and error and some of the my examples also contain BesselJ which can't be graph. Hence I would like to know if it is true that if there is BesselJ and FresnelS in the code, then the graph cannot be drawn using Mathematica. Please correct me if I am wrong. I am graphing out its graph using this code:               f[x_] := Sqrt[Abs[Mod[x, 2 Pi, -Pi]]];     s[k_, x_] := ???     partialsums[x_] = Table[s[n, x], {n, {4}}];      c[n_, x_] := (1/n) Sum[s[m, x], {m, 0, n - 1}]     Plot[Evaluate[{f[x], partialsums[x], c[{4}, x]}], {x, -Pi, Pi},     PlotLegends -> {"f(x)=x", "Fourier, 4 terms", "Cesaro, 4 terms"},      PlotStyle -> {{Blue}, {Dashed, Thickness[0.006]}, {Red,Thickness[0.006]}}]
