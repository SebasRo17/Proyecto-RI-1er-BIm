How would one approach the following question: We have two strings: a normal alphanumeric string and a pattern string. the pattern string can be composed by alphanumeric chars plus the char "?" and "*" We want to check if the first string match the pattern, where the ? means that every char (alphanumeric) is permitted in that position, while * allows to have a sequence of alphanumeric chars.
