I work in France as a Java programmer, mainly in French, but am a native English speaker. My level of French is pretty good (French wife!), but one thing I have problems with is working out whether to use English terminology or a French equivalent. Examples:   * lock (as in a synchronisation lock) - do I use the verb "locker" or do I use verrouiller?   * shard (databases) - "un shard" or "un tesson" (which means a shard of glass) ...and so-on... So, what do people recommend? Can anyone point out some good websites for translating this kind of terminology? The usual online translation tools are a bit too everyday English/French, not the slightly more specialised version that I find myself needing.
