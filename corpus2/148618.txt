I've some application on the Google Play, free to download, but I have some people reporting things like: "There has been problem installing on my htc x." How do I help these people? I could reply and ask things like their android version and what not, but this won't really help me debug it, since the error occurs on installation! Any general ideas on how to handle this? Maybe some tips about general android installation issues, or on how to help the people?
