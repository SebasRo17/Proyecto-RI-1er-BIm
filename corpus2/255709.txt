i use notepad++ with npp ftp plugin for editing webpages.I would like to have a similar plugin for sublime text. what i want to achieve by ftp plugin for sublime text is same functionality of npp ftp plugin.   1. Npp ftp plugin provides sidebar view of files.   2. npp ftp plugin allows to download file and make changes , whenever file change is made , the file in ftp server is also updated by just saving the file. issue with sublimetext ftp plugin is it doesnt allow active editing of ftp files. file i download is not linked to server.so i have to manually upload every time to see change.
