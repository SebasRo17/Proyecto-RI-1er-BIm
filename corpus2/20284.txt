I'm having problems working with the output from `DSolve` whilst in a module. To handle the result outside a module typically I would do something like                f[t] = y[t] /. solution      But inside a module my `t` is now `t$` followed by some numbers. How can I create and return a function from the output of `DSolve` inside a module? * * * Here is my code:               Module[{equations,solution,h,t},       m=1;       g=9.8;       equations = {y''[t]== -m g,y'[0]==100,y[0]==0};       solution = Flatten@ DSolve[equations,y,t];       h[t] = y[t] /. solution;       h[1]]      I get `h = 100. t$16608-4.9 t$16608^2`, but `h[1] = h$16909[1)`.
