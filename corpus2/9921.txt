When I created a _Mathematica_ script, I found that all my lines were commented out (when opened with `vi` or `gedit` or any other text editor). So I either need to get rid of the `(**)` manually or through a bash script before I run my _Mathematica_ script from a unix terminal. To create my script, I include the shebang `#!/usr/local/bin/MathematicaScript -script` on the first line and then save my file as a `.m` package. The resulting file looks something like this:               (* ::Package:: *)          (* ::Input:: *)     (*#!/usr/local/bin/MathematicaScript-script*)          (* ::Input:: *)     (**)     (*f[x_] := x*)      **Why are my lines commented? Is there anything I need to do?**
