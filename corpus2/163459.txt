I am reading Microsoft Visual C# 2010 Step by Step which I feel it is a very good book on introducing you to the C# language. I have just finished reading a chapter on interfaces and although I understood the syntax of creating and using interfaces I have trouble of understanding the point on why should I use them? Correct me If I am wrong but in an interface you can only declare methods names and parameters.The body of the method should be declared in the class that inherits the interface. So in this case why should I declare an interface if I am going to declare the entire method in the class that inherits that interface? What is the point? Does this have something to do with the fact that a class can inherit multiple interfaces?
