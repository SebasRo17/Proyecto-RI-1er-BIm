I would like to restrict the Locator inside Manipulate to a certain graphic. For example if I display two graphs, I would like to be able to click on the right one and use this information in other places (for example in the title and the left graph). By design, `Manipulate` assigns the `Locator` to the **first** graphic object that it displays (see under Details and Options). How can this be overcome? Here is an example snippet:               Manipulate[      sin =       Plot[Sin[x], {x, -5, 5}, ImageSize -> Medium,         Epilog -> {Red, PointSize[Large], Point[p]}];      cos = Plot[Cos[x], {x, -5, 5},         PlotLabel -> "I would like to have the locator on this graph!",         ImageSize -> Medium, Epilog -> {Green, PointSize[Large], Point[p]}];      Column[{Style[StringForm["Title `1`", p], Large],        Row[{sin, cos}]}, Center],      {{p, {0, 0}}, {-5, -5}, {5, 5}, ControlType -> Locator}]      ![example output](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6lJCR.png) I know this can be done using `Dynamic`, but then I loose some features of manipulate, such as "Paste Snapshoot", "Make Bookmark" and `SaveDefinitions`
