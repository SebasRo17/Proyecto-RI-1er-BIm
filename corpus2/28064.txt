Let's say I have a list of pure functions that are nice algebraic expressions: say               l = {(#1 - 1)&, (#1^2 + #1)&, (#1^3 - 1)&}      What's an easy way to get a pure function that will give the product of these expressions? For example, in the above I'd like to get a function f with               f = (#1 - 1)(#1^2 + #1)(#1^3 - 1)&      I've tried `(Times @@ Identity @@@ l)&`, but this just gives `(#1 - 1)(#1^2 + #1)(#1^3 - 1)`. Essentially, it seems my difficulty is converting a `List` of `Function` expressions to a `Function[Times[...]]` expression, and I can't see how to "strip off" the functions without messing up the referencing of the `Slot[1]` expressions inside. Thanks for any help.
