In my project (and I am sure many others), I need to copy a subset (R2) of one bitmap image (R1), into a region (R3) in another, where the destination region can be any size (stretching and scaling where necessary). ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fuZqL.png) I am sure this is a solved problem but I cannot find any examples; **what is the most straightforward algorithm for performing this operation?** (Linear interpolation would be sufficient for filling in the pixels when the source is scaled upwards, if that is the quickest (computationally) method)
