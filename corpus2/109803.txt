I've been thinking recently about how and where I keep my code - I work across multiple locations, with at least three different computers and I'm considering how I manage my code across these machines. I've got a dropbox account, which I use. For non sensitive files this is fine, and I do keep some sensitive files in there, but in a TrueCrypt file - this won't work large scale as the entire TrueCrypt file would need to be uploaded for any change. I don't feel safe putting my, or my employers, code on DropBox because of several security issues and news that they can access everyones' files. I have a github account where I store my code (open and closed source), but I don't want to have to always push up to GitHub, also I work a lot on the train so I can't push as I don't have a stable data connection and chances are that I'll forget to push or grab data at some point and then I'll be stuck! So - with that in mind, I'd like a discussion about storing code in the cloud:   1. Is keeping source code in the cloud dangerous?      * I understand the implications of keeping employers code in the cloud, but are there alternatives, given that a good number of VPN/RDC solutions that I've used are slow to the point of unusable? (this may be a point against my/my employers network speeds rather than the actual programs - but it's a impediment)   2. Is there a good cloud based service with good encryption, good uptime, diff, auto sync?      * Is there one aimed solely at developers? If not, does anyone want to start one with me? (joking but at the same time, it could be a good business venture - drop me a line if interested)   3. What do you use? Does it work? how would you change it?
