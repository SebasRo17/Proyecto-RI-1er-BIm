I have a fairly simple folder structure where the main classes are in a folder, and any classes used by those classes are in a subfolder with the same name as that class.               /exampleClass.php     /exampleClass/usedByExampleClass.php      I am trying to come up with a simple autoloader for this naming convention. So far, my idea is to use underscores in the class name wherever there might be a forward slash in the class path. This way I can simply replace all underscores with forward slashes in the autoloader, and load the class file. This means that the class name found in file:               /exampleClass/usedByExampleClass.php      would be:               exampleClass_usedByExampleClass      These class names end up being very long however, and I would like to shorten them while still having a simple autoloader for this folder structure. Any ideas or thoughts on how to achieve both short class names and a simple autoloader for this folder structure?
