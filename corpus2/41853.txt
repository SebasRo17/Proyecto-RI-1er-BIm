I'm trying to replicate the pendulum DAE example in the Documentation Center (example/ModelConstrainedSystemsAsDAEs) using Mathematica 9's vector support with NDSolve. So far I have:               deqns = {m X''[t] == \[Lambda][t]-{0, m 9.81}};     constraints = {Norm[X[t]] == 1};     initialConditions = {X[0] == {1, 0}, X'[0] == {0, 1}};     params = {g -> 9.81, m -> 1, l -> 1};          pendulumSol =       First[NDSolve[{deqns, constraints, initialConditions} /.         params, {X, \[Lambda]}, {t, 0, 15},           Method -> {"IndexReduction" -> Automatic}]];      but am getting:               NDSolve::ndincd: "Initial conditions for derivatives of the                        function X[t] do not have consistent dimensions."      Is this an issue with NDSolve properly identifying the vector nature of the equations, or have I overlooked something? Any help would be appreciated.
