Here is a CDF file with the dockedcells toolbar (at the top). I'm trying to see how he created and positioned the logo, the formatting buttons, table of contents, etc, through a source code of it, but I can't select it like a cell and say 'show expression'. Primary Questions: How to see the 'source code' of DockedCells? Can you do this in a FreeCDF as well as a Notebook? What is the difference between the two formats in regard to seeing source code? Secondary question: How can I see what differs from third party notebooks compared to default mathematica settings? So far I know that Option Inspector and Edit->Preferences and Edit Stylesheet show you most stuff, as well as view expressions in cells, but all of this still didn't show me anything about the dockedcells!
