I am about start my first project with client, However I will work as a consultant. So do I need to get developer certificate and post my client's app in app store? Or I should ask my client to get the license and then I help them deploying the app on their name? They don't want company name to be my organisation but they want their company name to show up in App Store. However the developer of app is my organisation not them. How to deal with this situation?
