Could you help me with what Mathematica is doing here, in the last lines? (The rest is here for context.) I removed the output to let you simply run this. Thanks.               k=10/3     u[c_,l_]:=Log[c]-Log[1+l^(1+k)/(1+k)]     T[z_]:=(1-0.84/1.3) * z     lType[n_]:=ArgMax[{u[n l-T[n l],l],l>=0},l]     zType[n_] := n lType[n]     Type := InverseFunction[zType]     Type[5345]     Type[2]     Type[4324424]      With a much longer version with some context, you can also switch to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10641713/mathematica-define-inverse-only- where-it-exists Or please reconsider the same code with some output to see what my problem is with the inverse:               k=10/3     10/3     Utility function as in Saez 2001 allowing for income effects:     u[c_,l_]:=Log[c]-Log[1+l^(1+k)/(1+k)]     Actual tax schedule (approximate)     T[z_]:=(1-0.84/1.3) * z     Equation 14:     lType[n_]:=ArgMax[{u[n l-T[n l],l],l>=0},l]     zType[n_] := n lType[n]     Type := InverseFunction[zType] does not seem to work.     Type := InverseFunction[zType]     Type[5345]     5030.985810589009`     Type[2]     (zType^(-1))[2]     Type[4324424]     (zType^(-1))[4324424]
