If I have a vector of the form (xp+y, x+yp) do you have a simple way of creating the following matrix and vector from it: `{{p, 1}, {1, p}} * {x, y}`, such that after multiplying the matrix with the vector, I get the original vector back. If I have the following variables defined as such:               v1 = (a1 + 1) *(b1 + 1) *(c1 + 1)*(d1 + 1) *(e1 + 1)  -1          a1 = (x11*f11 + x21*f21 )          b1 = (x11*f12 + x21*f22 )          c1 = (x11*f13 + x21*f23 )          d1 = (x11*f14 + x21*f24)          e1 = (x11*f15 + x21*f25)      is there a fast way to convert all the numbers appearing next to letters for example 11 next to x in to subscript? My goal is to create a vector consisting of several elements that look like V1.
