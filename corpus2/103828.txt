I started coding WPF applications a several months ago and now I am asking myself if there are some style guides for XAML. I do not need to get explained the benefits of Binding, Converters, Styles, Templates etc. My question is more basically. Is there an official (or unofficial) „best practice“ about the order of attributes etc: For instance:               <ComboBox Grid.Column="0" Grid.Row="0"               Name="CellType"               ItemsSource="{Binding EditorTypes}"               SelectedItem="{Binding EditorType}">      Is there something like   * always attached properties first [last]   * always declare a column [row] in a Grid, even if there is only one  Are there some rules/guides I should read to make my code look more common?
