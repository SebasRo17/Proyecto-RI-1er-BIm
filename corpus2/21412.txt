I'm working in development for 4 years, and 3.5 in PHP - why I don't seem to be able to be selected in an interview. I want to know what special things the interviewer wants to see in candidates - for senior PHP developer roles. Interviewer asks me 10 questions and I'm able to answer only 5. Does selection depend on these things? It doesn't mean that I can't solve the problem, I can google the question, I can ask on forums. Why don't they understand that a man can't remember all the answers for each and every question? Especially programming ones. Please advise.
