Is there any way to change the thickness of line without changing the width? For instance, the following example shows that as thickness increases, the white gap decreases. Is there any way to maintain the gap?               Show[         ListPlot[{{0, 2}, {13.4, 2}}, PlotRange -> All, Joined -> True,                  Mesh -> None, PlotStyle -> {Gray, Thickness[0.01]}],         ListPlot[{{14.7, 2}, {24, 2}}, Joined -> True, Mesh -> None,                  PlotStyle -> {Gray, Thickness[0.01]}]     ]      ![thin lines with gap](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UTdOv.png)               Show[         ListPlot[{{0, 2}, {13.4, 2}}, PlotRange -> All, Joined -> True,                  Mesh -> None, PlotStyle -> {Gray, Thickness[0.05]}],         ListPlot[{{14.7, 2}, {24, 2}}, Joined -> True, Mesh -> None,                  PlotStyle -> {Gray, Thickness[0.05]}]     ]      ![thick lines without gap](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TVtxR.png)
