I want to make a list (efficiently) which is the set of lattice solutions of the following equations (depends on $k$): $x_0\geq 0$ and $x_i\in [0,4k]$ for $i=1,\ldots,4$ satisfies $x_0+x_3\leq k+3$, $x_0+x_2+x_3\leq 2k+7$, $x_0+x_1+x_2+x_3\leq 3k+11$, $x_0\leq 15$, $x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4=4k$. How can I do that? EDIT: For example, by doing the following I can make a list of (easy) lattice equations: $x,y\in[1,5]$, $x+y\leq 5$.               Flatten[Table[{i, j}, {i, 1, 5}, {j, 1, 5 - i}], 1]      But I want to make this using if sentence.
