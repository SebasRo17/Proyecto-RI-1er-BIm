I know that language is just a tool and it's all about creating product. But if you are all about enterprise and than you change to mobile development - how do you manage it?   If I am used to PHP and it's framework and switch to Ruby - how do I deal with it? With learning and getting experience with Rails, with Ruby language and so on.   What if I was C++ programmer working on standalone programs? And than I switch to Python/Django for web? In general, here are my questions for all the examples above:   1. Is it possible to switch your specialisation as software developer? From web-development to enteprise, from standalone to mobile, etc. If yes, how? Or should I stick with one path to become expert in it?    2. How do you learn new languages? I mean, there are new frameworks you need to learn, and if it's different development sphere - say, mobile after web-development - you need to learn basic stuff for this sphere, right? How do you handle it?    3. Is switching language/career path hard in terms of getting new job since you dont have any experience in this language? Do you downgrade in salarys?  _**Please explain it all to me! How do people handle it? I am 100% sure I love development, atm I love PHP/RoR and web-development, so I use PHP as my main language at fulltime job, but I don't want to stick with it forever and I want to be able to change languages or/and maybe development direction (mobile, standalone, enterprise). How do you do it without hurting your career, or is it impossible?_**
