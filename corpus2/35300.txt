We know that in Mathematica there is some default precision, which you can also change. This means, that after a certain decimal(fixed by the precision), the computer puts pseudo random numbers. I am looking for a function F that would put everything zero after a certain decimal. Let us say I want this to be the fourth decimal, then F[0.12345678]=0.12340000 Does such function exist? Thank you
