I am using Genymotion to test an app. The app is basically a browser that connects to my website. I do not have the app's source. I do the development and testing of the website in a domain like this: dev.mywebsite.com The app connects to mywebsite.com. Genymotion allows me to use an HTTP proxy. My question is, is there any software for windows or linux that would work as a proxy and redirect all requests to mywebsite.com to dev.mywebsite.com ?
