I have a directed acyclic graph $g$, and I'd like to re-order the vertices in this graph object such that when I call               VertexList[myGraph]      the vertices appear in topologically sorted order. The naive solution is to make a new graph as follows:               myGraph = Graph[TopologicalSort[g], EdgeList[g]]      but it seems that the graph object sorts its vertices. So this method is no good.
