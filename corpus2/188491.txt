We're looking into improving our testing process for some of our applications, and the idea that's been put forward it to write unit tests in Groovy and automatically run them with Maven. The first application to get this treatment is written in Java, but I've been told that some of the classes being tested need to be renamed as ".groovy" files * and they will then be compiled as Groovy classes, not as Java classes. This renaming can all be done using Maven and Ant, but I'm concerned that if we compile our classes as Groovy classes, we're not actually testing them as Java classes, which is how they will be deployed. During the demo, it was also shown that Groovy does not compile to the same bytecode that Java does. There was at least one Groovy-specific member that was added, called "metaClass" (there were others, I didn't get a good enough look at the screen). Apparently this is necessary for the testing framework they want to use, which is named Spock. Am I right to be concerned about this? Does it matter? * I've been told this is for technical reasons that have to do with the way the application is built. I've been told that this does not apply to _all_ classes, but to some.
