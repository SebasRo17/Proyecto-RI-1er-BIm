I know the syntax, rules applied to abstract class and I want know usage of an abstract class > Abstract class can not be instantiated directly but can be extended by other > class What is the advantage of doing so? How it is different from an Interface? I know that one class can implement multiple interfaces but can only extend one abstract class. Is that only difference between an interface and an abstract class? I am aware about usage of an Interface. I have learned that from Event delegation model of AWT in Java. **In which situations I should declare class as an abstract class? What is benefits of that?**
