Suppose there are `n` lines for a hotline. Whenever a customer calls the hotline, the call is forwarded to one of the `n` lines. And I want to assign percentage of calling to each of the n lines. Suppose there are two lines and one line is assigned 60% and other is 40%, the total number of calls is 10 so the first line would receive 6 calls and second will get 4 calls. I know the percentage of calling to each line in advance but the problem is that I don't know the number of calls that would be received in a day. **How can I distribute the number of calls without knowing the total calls?**
