I'm having problems with changing some parameters with "manipulate" in a piecewise function. The code i'm working with is:               f[x_] := -x /; x <= 0     f[x_] := 3 x + x^2 /; 0 < x <= 3     f[x_] := (-3 x + 28 + n) /; x > 3     Manipulate[Plot[f[x], {x, -5, 15}], {n, 0, 15, 1}]          The problem is that if I leave the n the last part of the function won't even show up. Is there any easy way to fix this or is some extensive coding needed?
