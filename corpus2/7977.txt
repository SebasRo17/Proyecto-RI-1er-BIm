I have an list:               l = {{4,5},{7,8},{9,5},{3,2},{1,2},{13,12}}.       I want to take the elements in the list in the sequential order. For example the first element in the list is `{4,5}` and I want to select the first member in the sub-list, `4`, then I want to go to the second element in the list `{7,8}` and to take the first element `7`. This process continues up to `{13,12}` and selecting `13`. How can I do this?
