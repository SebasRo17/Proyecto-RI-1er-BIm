I have written some code that requests some calculations from an SQL server every N seconds and uses a palette:               CreatePalette[Dynamic[DateListPlot[...]]]      I create many copies of this notebook, each with different parameters, and launch as many independent kernels. But there is a problem. Frist, I launch the 1st palette on kernel1. Next, I start a 2nd palette on kernel2, (Evaluation->Notebook Kernel), but when I do that, the first palette thinks that its kernel is kernel2. How can I set the kernel for `CreatePalette` ?
