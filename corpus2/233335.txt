What would be the best way to store data in a database for geographical calculations? Say I have an `ItemsForSale` table paired to a `Users` table which holds their geo location. I know I can use latitude and longitude to look up items that are within a certain mile radius by using Lambert's formula for long lines or the Haversine formula but I am not sure if there is a better approach for this.
