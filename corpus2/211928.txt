I have recently started a new job and am being forced to use VS 2005 and .NET 2. This has been quite painful for a number of reasons, but the one big change from VS 2005 to its successors was the introduction of LINQ and extension methods. A common pattern that I used to follow when using enumerations was the following:               foreach(var myObject in myObjects.Where(x => x.Property == someValue)     {         //Do some stuff     }      What I am having difficulty with is coming up with a succinct way of expressing the same statement in C# 2. The best I have come up with is the following:               foreach(MyObject myObject in myObjects)     {         if(myObject.Property == someValue)         {             //Do some stuff         }     }      Is there a more effective or efficient way of writing this code? How would you write C# 2 code so that it can most easily be transformed into C# 5 code (we will be upgrading to VS2012/.NET 4.5 after the next release)?
