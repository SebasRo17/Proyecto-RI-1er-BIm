I would like to copy the address of a hyperlink in _Mathematica_ using the keyboard. I found code for copying hyperlink addresses in `ContextMenus.tr`:               MenuItem["&Copy Address", FrontEndExecute[      {FEPrivate`FrontEndExecute[FrontEnd`CopyToClipboard[       CurrentValue[{ButtonBoxOptions, ButtonData}]]]      }     ], MenuEvaluator->None]      but using this to make a keyboard shortcut in KeyEventTranslations.tr as follows doesn't seem to work.               Item[KeyEvent["c", Modifiers -> {Control, Option}], FrontEndExecute[      FrontEnd`CopyToClipboard[ CurrentValue[{ButtonBoxOptions, ButtonData}]]]     ]      (`KeyEvent["c", Modifiers -> {Control, Option}]` didn't seem to work at all as a shortcut combination, but other combinations that worked for other actions didn't work for copying the hyperlink address.) One problem is that I'm not sure whether the hyperlink has to be selected or what.
