I know this has been asked a lot, but I'd like to know what to present myself as on my CV and to future employees. I'm 24, and began as a C#/ASP.NET developer after graduating from University in 2010 (I studied Computer Science). Since then I have worked for a relatively small software development house (about 8 employees), and since early 2012 I've been essentially the most senior .NET developer (the others in the company have more experience but only in drastically different/outdated languages, and are just learning .NET). My roles there are designing and developing applications. I don't usually write the specs, but the specs are essentially the customers requirements - all the technical details including the design of the database and application are up to me. I also have 3 MCTS certificates and I'm working towards an MCPD. As I've essentially only got around 3 years experience, I'm a bit unsure of how to present myself - clearly I'm not what most would constitute as 'senior'! Would you class me as a software developer, or something more?
