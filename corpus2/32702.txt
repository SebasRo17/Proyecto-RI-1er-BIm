I am planning to implement an official Java specification in a different programming language. Would this be a copyright violation? Hypothetical examples:   * a **JMX** "wrapper" library for C++ which can control a Java application over JMX, and uses similar concepts and class/method names as the Java implementation   * a **JavaMail** API and implementations (for different .Net network libraries) for C#
