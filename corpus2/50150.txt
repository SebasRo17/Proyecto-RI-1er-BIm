Programming languages can often be described as **verbose** or **terse**. From my understanding, a verbose language is easy to read and understand, while a terse language is concise and neat, but more difficult to read. _Should there be other things to consider in the definitions?_ It seems much of the popular programming languages of today are verbose, and these terms two terms are only used to describe a language as being more or less, relative to than another language. _How do we determine if a programming language is more verbose/terse over another?_ Example: Is C# more verbose than Java?
