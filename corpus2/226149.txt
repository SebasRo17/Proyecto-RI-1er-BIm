I am implementing an ecommerce database. This is slightly different than most as the 'products' that are for sale are for services provided. For example a user (vendor) of the system may define a service to 'wash your car'.               Table: Services     --------------------------------------------------     | ID (pk) |      Title       |    Description    |     --------------------------------------------------          1       Home Services      wash your car      I have omitted a number of columns, but should still be able to make my point. A client can then purchase the `Home Services`. So I have an `orders` table with a FK to the the `Services` table. Standard ecommerce stuff. The issue I have is what happens if the vendor decides to slightly update the description or even the title? This may have the affect of changing the entire service. For a normal commerce site, you'd add a discrete product. If this product changed, you would create a new product and discontinue the old one. With the packages, we need to allow updates as the description is the product and the sales pitch (maybe thats my problem though - maybe separate the two?) so I have to allow changes. For example they could change the description to 'wash your car and clean your house'. The obvious issue with this is that existing orders will still reference the same PK on the services table but the service is now different. I'm wondering what the best solution is to allow changes to be added, but maintain the correct data for existing orders. One solution I thought of is to not update the row, but add a new one and a version number               Table: Services     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------     | ID (pk) |      Title       |            Description             |  Version |     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------          1       Home Services     wash your car                           1          2       Home Services     wash your car and clear your house      2      We can now access the correct information for previous orders, and existing customers can purchase the new home services option. This feels like a sensible way to do it, but want to see if anyone knew of any other solutions? One other solution is to allow updates on the services table, but then for each order, save the description and title (similar to how sometimes in commerce schemas the final price is saved directly to the order). Issue I have with this is a lot of duplicate data being saved.
