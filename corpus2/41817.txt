An ellipse degenerates into a line segment when the defining constant distance from the two foci is the actual distance between the two foci. The ellipse closes into a line segment. The following code shows a family of concentric ellipses that should converge to a line segment when the constant is set to 5. However it doesn't plot the line segment even if I increase the MaxRecursion very high.               ContourPlot[Evaluate[Table[Sqrt[(x + 3)^2 + y^2] + Sqrt[x^2 + (y - 4)^2] == n, {n, 5,      6, .01}]], {x, -4, 1}, {y, -1, 5}]      Is there someway to get Mathematica to actually plot the line segment of the degenerate case of an ellipse?
