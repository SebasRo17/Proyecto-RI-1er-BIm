In any open file within Visual Studio, there is the ability to scroll all of the code out of sight". In other words, there is heaps of white space below the code lines that one can scroll to. This to me is of no use, and when I pull my mouse wheel down with aggression, my code disappears off the screen. Is there a way to turn this annoyance off? Also, can someone explain to me any logical reason as to why it's even there? ps: I tagged this question as visual-studio since I'm pretty sure it's been in every version of VS that I've ever used... though I'm currently using visual- studio-2010 ![This space is completely useless](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HKsUI.png) ![Now it's even worse because I scrolled to the bottom \(note the line #46\)](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QPfVf.png) ## EDIT Jon Galloway pointed me to another thread stating that it was added by popular request. Still makes no sense why they wouldn't make it a switchable feature on/off
