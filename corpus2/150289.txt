During an interview I was asked to implement a random generator in java without using any existing random number libraries that takes as an argument int n, and returns a random number between 0 and n. This was the implementation I provided:               public static int random(int n) {         int r = 0;         for (int i =0; i <n;i++) {             r+=helper();         }         return r;     }          // helper that returns 0 or 1     private static int helper() {         long t = System.nanoTime();         if (t%2 == 0) {             return 1;         } else {             return 0;         }     }      He said it's not right but he wouldn't tell me what he was expecting. Why did he say it's wrong? How would you have done it differently?
