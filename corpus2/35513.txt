My question is related to Change all Options of Plot Dynamically where _Mathematica_ remembers the series of changes in the appearance of a drawing using `Plot` or similar commands like `ParametricPlot` etc. I would like to generalize my question: I want to use the `Show` command for making a nice drawing. I am going to use `Plot`, `ParametricPlot`, `ListPlot`, `Graphics`, etc., so I need   1. a popup menu with these commands    2. An `InputField` for the data or functions or graphics primitives to be ploted and    3. a popup menu with the corresponding options. For example, if I select `ParametricPlot` then I will take the list of options for this command. The series of changes in the drawing have to be "recorded" so that the user could make any possible adjustments at any time! How would I build such a canvas on which the plots can be added and modified step-by-step?
