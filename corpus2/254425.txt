I'm learning NodeJS and rewriting some code to see how it compares. For one script, I am trying to take dates in the form of strings and turn them into JavaScript Date objects to perform calculations on. I managed to do this, by converting the string into an array and processing each character. It looks so ugly though, I'm wondering if there is a cleaner way, like the equivalent to sprintf or something. I'm sure I can find a module but am wondering if there is a native way in JS. This is what I have:               var a = '081320141900'.split('');     creationDate = a[0] + a[1] + "/" + a[2] + a[3] + "/" + a[4] + a[5] + a[6] + a[7] + " " + a[8] + a[9] + ":" + a[10] + a[11];     console.log('Creation Date: ' + creationDate);      Output:               Creation Date: 08/13/2014 19:00      Again, the above works fine, just wondering if this can be done cleaner.
