I have taken over development of a JSP/Struts application. Right now it's a bit of a mess, and I'm finding the JSP pages with Struts tags to be insanely verbose. Has anyone migrated a Struts application to Groovy/Grails? Can it be done incrementally, page by page? @4bu3li: I was thinking of replacing the JSPs one by one with Groovy HTML builder code. IMO struts tags are a masterpiece of verbosity and obfuscation, and I'm tired of matching open and close tags. Right now the team is just me and one other guy, and I know Groovy better than I know JSPs and Struts. We are reworking the entire site, so it's all going to be rewritten somehow. But I can't stop maintenance, so I need to incrementally rewrite it page by page. Could I just start reworking Struts action methods to return Groovy-generated content?
