In many English-based programming languages like C++ and JavaScript, there exist long keywords like `function`, `namespace`, `exception` (in OCaml languages) and such. Do you think shorter keywords like `func` should replace them? Why or why not? What about replacing them with digraph operators? The long keywords we will be mainly talking about, but not limited to, are mainly from curly-brace imperative languages: `function`, `namespace`, `implements`, `instanceof` and `synchronized` (I always misspell that). You should also show the examples from your favourite programming language.
