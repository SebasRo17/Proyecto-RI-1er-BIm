I'm trying to make a function that generates a tree for spin spin analysis in spectroscopy. I though it would be pretty easy, but I'm totally stocked. The tree should look something like this: ![Spin Spin analysis](http://i.stack.imgur.com/62ZXp.jpg) where the listed frequencies are the distance between the "generations". I have tried with this: `FoldList[{#1 + #2, #1 - #2} &, 0, {jad,jab,jac}]` where I get the right x-values, but rearranging these values to give me the right lines is where is where it all stops for me. What should I do?
