Well, actually it's a assignment project and I've already implemented a simple yet functional forum with NodeJS. But now we've been required to **use ORM frameworks to refactor part of your code worth refactoring**. As I use Node.JS, there's no such _type-safe_ benefits from ORM I could get. Besides, the code is already functional and I just don't see what good ORM could bring to it... (Requests are handled pretty swiftly and independently... I don't think I would like to cache tons of `Object`s from database to `request.session`...) My question is, what possible benefits will an ORM bring to a stable NodeJS project?
