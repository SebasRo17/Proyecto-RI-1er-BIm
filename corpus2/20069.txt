I have a 2D data set in the form of:               data={{Category, Integer}, {Category, Integer},{Category, Integer}...}      It is a pretty simple data set with four categories and several hundred rows. I am looking to make a scatterplot of the data resulting in a visualization with four columns of points, one for each category (placing categories on the X-Axis). This should be a very easy plot to produce using:               ListPlot[data]      Mathematica returns a blank plot with no error messages. I have also tried using DistributionChart with the following code:               DistributionChart[data, ChartElementFunction -> "PointDensity"]      Do I need to transform the categorical values to numeric? If I run this in R, it can identify they categories and handle appropriately. Update 1: Here is an example of what I get from R. The data set is movie ratings. It is out of scope for this posting, but I also like the Jitter function in R (as seen in this image) which seems not to have an equivalent function in M9. I usually play with opacity when I have many overlapping data points. ![Movie Ratings Scatter Plot in R](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Fyg4C.png) Update 2: Correct. The data is more accurately written as such:               data = { {{cat1, d11}, {cat2, d12}, {cat3, d13}, {cat4, d14}},  {{cat1, d21} ...}, ...}
