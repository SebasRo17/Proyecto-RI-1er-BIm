I want to plot some flow lines for a certain vector field, but _Mathematica_ doesn't seem to plot the entire flow line, only a small piece of it. How can I fix this?               VectorPlot[{Re[Sqrt[x + I y]], Im[Sqrt[x + I y]]},      {x, -1, 1},      {y, -1, 1},      VectorPoints -> Fine,       StreamPoints -> Coarse,      StreamStyle -> Red,      StreamScale -> None]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/skPZv.png) ### Update: I feel dumb for not realizing the discontinuity, but I'll mention that what I really want are flow lines of slope fields, not vector fields. I didn't see how to do this in _Mathematica_ "directly," and hence used VectorPlot. How can I plot the lines of a slope field?
