Our team works with a large number of different APIs and services, and we also have our own internal tooling and services we maintain as well. Right now, we do not have a good centrally managed system to list which projects we used a certain API on, or to attach documentation for all of our utilities/apis. I believe what I am looking for is some type of team wiki, but we weren't impressed with the search capability of the the solution we tried (Sharepoint). Are wikis the right way to approach centralize documentation? What types of things should I be looking out for when creating a centralized documentation system?
