I am quite familiar with TCP and UDP. I understand the process by which TCP establishes connections and other theoretical facts about TCP but when reading up about TCP hole punching for NAT Transversal, I have become stumped by how connect(), accept() and listen() is done in TCP. Is it a single or multiple sockets that are used for all this in TCP and is is this done the same way in UDP
