I have a web app that occasionally (after some idleness) will block a very simple request for small chunks of data (30~50 kb) up to 20 or so seconds. Assuming I can't refactor or modify the API, is there some pattern in javascript or jquery to accommodate a situation like this? I'm thinking to set a timeout for 5 seconds or so for the api call and retry the ajax request -- via jquery's $.ajax() with the timeout argument. I imagine this could be the equivalent of the user refreshing a slow-loading page. Thanks for your thoughts.
