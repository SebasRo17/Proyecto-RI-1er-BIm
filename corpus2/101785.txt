After I started working at a company, I found out that the job is to maintain a software product. Most of the work that I'm doing is finding and fixing bugs. It's not easy work. However, there is no new feature development. I am worrying about this, as it might mean I won't ever get the chance to focus on development. What can I do to transition from a job that's maintenance-only to one where I'm creating and designing software?
