Mathematica provides several mechanisms for checking arguments and trapping errors in a function definition. Typical methods are : Definitions with argument patterns, definitions with `Condition`, definitions with `Which` or `Switch`. All of them combined with `Message` I have also seen a technique which uses `Throw` and `Catch`. This is probably not so well-known. Perhaps someone could explain how it works and possible pros and cons/limits?
