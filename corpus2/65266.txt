I'm interested to know the implementation of the 'new message' in gmail for example. I know that ajax is used, but what else it is used on the server and client side. Can you explain me the scenario? Gmail is just a sample to sustain my question. I'm interested about the cheapest solution which allow to display new content in asynchronous manner without a user triggered event. If you know a resource which explains the optimal way of implementing such app I will appreciated. TY
