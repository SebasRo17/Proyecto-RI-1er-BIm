Sometimes when I do, for example, a series expansion Mathematica gives me output that it won't take as input. For example if I do a series expansion:               Series[Hypergeometric2F1[a,x,y,z], {a,0,0} ]      produces:               Out[xx]= 1+ a Hypergeometric2F1^(1,0,0,0)[0,x,y,z] + O[a]^2      If I literally then click on this cell and evaluate it as input, or alternatively cut and paste this term into another input line and evaluate it returns the following error:               Syntax::sntxf: "(" cannot be followed by "1,0,0,0)".          Syntax::sntxi: Incomplete expression; more input is needed .      So it doesn't seem to like the exact form as input that it just gave me as output. What gives? EDITS: 1) I apologize for the formatting errors in the posting and the confusion that resulted, that should be fixed now. Thank you to those that pointed them out. 2) I have tried the suggestions to use `InputForm[%]`-the thing this, the expressions I am dealing with are very long, and when I put it into input-form they become unwieldy. I would prefer a way to retain the standard-form expression and manipulate that - but this might be impossible (it seems like it is impossible). Thanks for the help so far anyway.
