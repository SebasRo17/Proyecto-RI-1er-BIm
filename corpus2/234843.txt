Referring to the image here: ![http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:X86_Paging_4K.svg](http://i.stack.imgur.com/B5cyA.png) From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:X86_Paging_4K.svg Could somebody please explain something for me? I don't get exactly how this works. As I understand it the page "directory" contains an entity which essentially points to the beginning of the "page table". However, surely all of the entities in the page "directory" would contain the exact same value? Or, does this mean we have 1x page "directory" but N page "tables" (at the same level in the page multi-level hierarchy")? If there are N page "tables" and one page "directory" I get why the PD would point to one of the N PTs. If there aren't then I am really confused.
