I generated with               Tuples[{{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {1, 2, 3, 4, 14}, {1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 4},             {1, 5, 6, 7, 8}, {5, 6, 7, 8, 10}, {5, 6, 7, 8}, {5, 6, 7, 8}}]       elements like `{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}`, with all the possible combinations but I want to exclude elements with the same numbers in different places like `{1,1,3,4,5,6,7,8}` or `{1,2,3,5,5,6,7,8}`. How can I do that in a simple way?
