I am creating a new project from scratch and have decided to use a 3-layer model. I am using:   * the 1st layer for business entities,   * the 2nd layer for business logic,   * and the 3rd layer for data logic layer. Do I need to create different projects for these different layers or do I need to create different _folders_ in one project? What are the pros and cons of both approaches?
