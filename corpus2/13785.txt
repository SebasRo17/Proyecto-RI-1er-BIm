How exactly is a custom stylesheet processed? Which style depends on (inherits from) which other style. Consider e.g. setting a font. I would expect that setting the font for "Section" to YY after setting the font for "All" to XX would result in the font being YY for Sections and XX for everything else, but the "All" overrides it. For "Text" and "Section" its works as expected. "All" seems to be a global override (at least for the `FontFamily`. Can someone clarify this?
