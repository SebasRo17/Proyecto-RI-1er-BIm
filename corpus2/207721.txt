Each website has visitors, and each visitor might be a potential customer (lead), thus it's really good to do whatever a marketer can do to attract that lead and turn it into a real customer. However, some marketing strategies work on the gender of the lead. In other words, men would be attracted in one way, and women in another way. I see that there are some studies on **gender recognition** based on some physiological and facial patterns like: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6249810 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5268753/face-gender-detection-library http://www.advancedsourcecode.com/gagender.asp However, in online marketing, which is a hot topic in the realm of Internet, you can't see the face of the visitor of your site. But still based on some preferences and some attribute there might be chances that you guess the gender of the visitor, which might increase the profit overall by absorbing more customers through good strategies. For example women usually like pink color and men usually like online games. But I wonder why till now no study has been done for that? In a world where Google and Facebook and internet giants try to understand their users more and more, seems a little odd that websites which have many visitors (like news websites cnn, bbc, msn, yahoo, etc.) has done nothing or few things to handle this concept. Imagine how much work can be done once you understand that the visitor is male, or female. So, are there any technical limitations for not working on **gender recognition** just the way we've worked on **handwriting recognition** and **speech recognition** and **face recognition**?
