I've been looking into regex lately and figured that the `?` operator makes the `*`,`+`, or `?` lazy. My question is how does it do that? Is it that `*?` for example is a special operator, or does the `?` have an effect on the `*`? In other words, does regex recognize `*?` as one operator in itself, or does regex recognize `*?` as the two separate operators `*` and `?`? If it is the case that `*?` is being recognized as two separate operators, how does the `?` affect the `*` to make it lazy. If `?` means that the `*` is optional, shouldn't this mean that the `*` doesn't have to exists at all. If so, then in a statement `.*?` wouldn't regex just match separate letters and the whole string instead of the shorter string? Please explain, I'm desperate to understand.
