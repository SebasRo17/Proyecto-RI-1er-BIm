I've worked in a number of small teams over the last 9 years. Each had the obvious good practices, such as short meetings, revision control, continuous integration software, issue tracking and so on. In these 9 years, I've never heard much about development methodologies; for example, there's never been a "we're doing scrum", or "lets do agile", or anything more than a passing reference. All of the teams seemed to function fine, without following much process, we were just freeflowing and just naturally worked well. Has anyone else progressed for long periods of time without encountering scrum/agile/etc? The only exposure I've had to these is through sites like this one. I read questions like http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/16905/sprint- meetings-what-to-talk-about ... and all the talk seems to describe almost robotic like people who follow a methodology finite state machine. Is it really (though exaggerated) like that? I wonder if the people posting on the internet just loud supporters of "best practice", with similar textbook views, not really reflecting how people work... Or that I've encountered some teams making their processes up naturally. Furthermore (I am in the UK, which may be relevant)... I think if a methodology were introduced to any of the teams I'd work on, they'd just reject it as being silly and unnecessary... then carry on. I'd tend to agree, following processes seems a bit unnatural. Is this typical or common?
