I would like to know what is the best way to configure one `GridLine` for the hour in `LightGray` and another for the days in `Gray`. In my tests, the `FrameTicks` are superposed by the GridLines and I don't know how to control the color. The data label should appear just for days. Here is my attempt that I consider very clumsy.               data={#,RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[0,1]]}&/@RandomReal[{3564979299,3565355902},1000];          DateListPlot[data        ,AspectRatio->0.2        ,DateTicksFormat->{"Day","/","Month"}        ,GridLines->{{#,LightGray}&/@DateRange[{2012,12,12},{2012,12,31},"Hour"],None}        ,FrameTicks->{Automatic,{DateRange[{2012,12,12},{2012,12,31},"Day"],None}}        ,Epilog->{Gray,Line[{{#,Min@data[[All,2]]},{#,Max@data[[All,2]]}}]&/@AbsoluteTime/@DateRange[{2012,12,12},{2012,12,31},"Day"]}     ]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cMXPW.png) I don't like to use `Epilog` for that. It would be nice if I could have subticks between the days ticks too, one subtick for each hour, with no label.
