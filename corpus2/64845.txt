I read this in _TCP/IP PROTOCOL SUITE_ second edition, written by Behrouz A. Forouzan and Sophia Chung Fegan. > In traditional Ethernet, the minimum frame length is 520 bits, the > transmission rate is 10 Mbps, the propagation speed is almost the speed of > light, and the collision domain is almost 2500 meters. So what is **transmission rate** and **propagation speed**? Why they are not the same?
