I would like to automatically linearize some long equations in the scope of variational calculus. Here follows an example of what I need to do : Given two variables $a_1 = q_1 + \delta q_1$ and $a_2 = q_2 + \delta q_2$ and a product $${a_1}^2\, a_2 = {q_1}^2 q_2 + 2q_1q_2\delta q_1 + q_2{\delta q_1}^2 + {q_1}^2\delta q_2 + 2q_1\delta q_1 \delta q_2 + {\delta q_1}^2 \delta q_2$$ I would like to eliminate any variable preceded by the $\delta$ symbol which power is superior to 1 (make it equal to zero), and any product of two variables preceded by the $\delta$ symbol (make the product equal to zero also). So as to obtain : $${a_1}^2\, a_2 = {q_1}^2 q_2 + 2q_1q_2\delta q_1 + {q_1}^2\delta q_2$$ I first tried the `Assumptions` options while expanding :               a1 = Subscript[q, 1] + Subscript[\[Delta]q, 1];     a2 = Subscript[q, 2] + Subscript[\[Delta]q, 2];     Expand[a1^2*a2, Assumptions -> Subscript[\[Delta]q, 1]^2 = 0]      Which returned the following :               Set::write: Tag Rule in Assumptions->Subsuperscript[\[Delta]q, 1, 2] is Protected. >>     (Subscript[q, 1] + Subscript[\[Delta]q, 1])^2 (Subscript[q,         2] + Subscript[\[Delta]q, 2])      Of course it didn't work. Truth is that I don't know how to start this... Does someone has any ideas? I also tried :               a1 = Subscript[q, 1] + Subscript[\[Delta]q, 1];     a2 = Subscript[q, 2] + Subscript[\[Delta]q, 2];     b = Expand[a1^2*a2];     Assuming[Subscript[\[Delta]q, 1]^2 == 0, b]      which didn't work either and returned :               \!\(     \*SubsuperscriptBox[\(q\), \(1\), \(2\)]\      \*SubscriptBox[\(q\), \(2\)]\) +       2 Subscript[q, 1] Subscript[q, 2] Subscript[\[Delta]q, 1] +       Subscript[q, 2]      \!\(\*SubsuperscriptBox[\(\[Delta]q\), \(1\), \(2\)]\) + \!\(     \*SubsuperscriptBox[\(q\), \(1\), \(2\)]\      \*SubscriptBox[\(\[Delta]q\), \(2\)]\) +       2 Subscript[q, 1] Subscript[\[Delta]q, 1] Subscript[\[Delta]q,        2] + \!\(     \*SubsuperscriptBox[\(\[Delta]q\), \(1\), \(2\)]\      \*SubscriptBox[\(\[Delta]q\), \(2\)]\)
