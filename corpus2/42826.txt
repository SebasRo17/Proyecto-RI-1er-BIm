The following code successfully manages to plot the cross-section, and give me the maximum depth of a weld pool, for a given set of parameters. What I would ideally like to be able to do is to plot a graph of how the the maximum depth of a weld pool varies with a parameter (ie. `v` between `0.915` and `1.5`). I think I am essentially looking to make a for loop so I can plug many different values for v in, However `Do` does not seem to work in this case. Any help would be greatly appreciated!               k = 15.75;     α = 5.79*10^-6;     T = 1015;     η = 0.6;     Q = 600;     v = 0.915;     y = 0;          g[x_?NumericQ] :=        Quiet[ FindRoot[T == (η Q)/(2 π k Sqrt[x^2 + y^2 + z^2])*Exp[                                                (-v (x + Sqrt[x^2 + y^2 + z^2]))/(2 α)],                         {z, -0.0001, -0.1, -0.0000001}][[1, 2]]]          p = Plot[ g[x], {x, -0.00001, -0.0037}, Filling -> Axis,      FillingStyle -> Orange, AspectRatio -> Automatic]          FindMinimum[g[x], {x, -0.001}][[1]]
