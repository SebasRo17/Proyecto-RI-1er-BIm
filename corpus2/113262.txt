I have heard people say that variables should be declared as close to their usage as possible. I don't understand this. For example, this policy would suggest I should do this:               foreach (var item in veryLongList) {       int whereShouldIBeDeclared = item.Id;       //...     }      But surely this means the overheads of creating a new `int` are incurred on every iteration. Wouldn't it be better to use:               int whereShouldIBeDeclared;     foreach (var item in veryLongList) {       whereShouldIBeDeclared = item.Id;       //...     }      Please could somebody explain?
