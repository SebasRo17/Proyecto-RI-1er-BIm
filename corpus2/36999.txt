I'm plotting results from NDSolve, and I'd like to clip them with their value at the point where the line is clipped. So where the curve ends at the edge of the plot, there would be a number indicating the y-value of the curve at that point. If that's not possible or too complicated, how can I include the end value of the plot in the legend? here's my plot command:                   Plot[{     Evaluate[Ca //. {parameters}] //. soln,     Evaluate[Cb //. {parameters}] //. soln,     Evaluate[Cc //. {parameters}] //. soln,     Evaluate[Ci //. {parameters}] //. soln,     Evaluate[Cd //. {parameters}] //. soln,     Evaluate[Ce //. {parameters}] //. soln,     Evaluate[Ch //. {parameters}] //. soln}, {w, 0, 500},      PlotRange -> All,      PlotLegends -> {Subscript[C, methane], Subscript[C, ethane],      Subscript[C, ethylene], Subscript[C, inerts], Subscript[C,      benzene], Subscript[C, naphthalene], Subscript[C, hydrogen]},      AxesLabel -> {"w", "C"}, AspectRatio -> 0.8,      PlotLabel -> "molar concentration vs catalyst weight"]
