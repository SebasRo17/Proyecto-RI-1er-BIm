I've recently worked on a project where the Team lead was commenting he needed to figure out which stories we are going to be working on in a scrum. It was my understanding that stories are prioritized and perhaps a number of stories are added to a sprint from that list. At this stage during our scrum the developers each pick a story they are going to implement and off they go. I suppose if a number of stories have dependencies them the team lead might help facilitate the story priority within the sprint itself but not actually dictate which developer does which? None of us are juniors in the team and we all have equal knowledge about the domain. Our experience of particular facets of the layers i.e. UI, database, infrastructure vary but not dramatically so. So my main question is as to the role of a Team lead (and other developers I guess) within a sprint itself and delegation of stories. If it helps, the project was a MVC .NET application with some database backing. Our team consisted of 4 developers, 1 tester and a Project manager.
