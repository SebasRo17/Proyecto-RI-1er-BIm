Look here: a typical holy war on tabs vs spaces. Now look here: elastic tabstops. All problems solved, and a bunch of very useful new behaviours added. ![elastic tabstops](http://i.stack.imgur.com/60RvQ.gif) Are elastic tabstops even mentioned in that tabs vs spaces discussion? Why not? Are there drawbacks to the elastic tabstop idea so serious that nobody has ever implemented them in a popular editor? **EDIT** : I apologise for putting too much emphasis on "why aren't they mentioned". That wasn't really what I intended; _that_ question is possibly even off topic. What I really mean is, what are the biggest drawbacks of this that prevent wider adoption of an obviously beneficial idea? (in an ideal world where everything supports it already) (Turns out there's already a request on the Microsoft Connect for a Visual Studio implementation of elastic tabstops, and a request in Eclipse too. Plus there's a question asking about other editors that implement elastic tabstops)
