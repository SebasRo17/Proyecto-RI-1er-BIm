I've been in my current position in a non-IT unit for about a year. I was hired mostly to do content management and simple web master type tasks. Due to a mix of diminishing IT support and expanded unit/productivity expectations, as well as my own motivation to acquire new skills, I have slowly taken on what I would describe as a front-end web developer role. Nothing I would describe as 'mission critical', but certainly things you wouldn't hire a non- programmer to do. I only took a few CS classes in college and although I do some freelance web designing and developing, I'm growing concerned about getting in over my head without the appropriate grounding. I would like to ideally have IT support, guidance, code review, programmer-level pay, etc. Unfortunately, I'm finding that organizational and semantic divisions really won't allow me to be a 'programmer', since I don't work for an IT-related unit. Management is roughly aware of the issue, but I don't feel they are taking it seriously, so I'm planning on addressing it with them. When I do, I want them to hear the: "I'm a motivated employee looking to take on more responsibility" instead of "I have limited and untrustworthy skills, I need IT's help!" What suggestions do you have for me to address (to management) the issue and articulate a solution?
