I want to create a two-dimensional plot using data from an external file. This file contains several triplets of numbers. The first two columns indicate the x and y position, while the third one works as an indicator for every (x,y) point. The desired plot should depict each point as a colorful dot and the color of each dot should be assigned according to the value of the third column. I used `ListDensityPlot` to create my plot but for a strange reason it joins all the points together and of course spreads the colors. This is the code I used:               SetDirectory[" ... To be inserted ... "];     data = Import["Esc_data.out", "Table"];     S1 = ListDensityPlot[data, Mesh -> None, ColorFunction -> "Rainbow",      PlotLegends -> Placed[BarLegend[Automatic, LegendMargins ->      {{0, 0}, {10, 5}}, LegendLabel -> "\!\(\*SubscriptBox[\(log\), \(10\)]\)(Tesc)",     LabelStyle -> {FontSize -> 15, FontFamily -> "Helvetica"}],      Right], PerformanceGoal -> "Quality", FrameLabel -> {"x", "y"},      RotateLabel -> False,      LabelStyle -> Directive[FontSize -> 17, FontFamily -> "Helvetica"],      ImageSize -> 500]      The correct plot should be the following: ![correc plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BsorZ.png) It took me two minutes and four lines in `gnuplot` to create this plot! So, it must be achievable in _Mathematica_ too. However, I couldn't find out how to control the size of the dots and mainly how to "tell" to the program not to join the points between them. The data file can be obtained here or here. Many many thanks in advance! * * * I modified VLC's last version like this               Clear[colorbar]     colorbar[{min_, max_}, colorFunction_: Automatic, divs_: 150] :=      DensityPlot[y, {x, 0, 0.1}, {y, min, max}, AspectRatio -> 10,      PlotRangePadding -> 0, PlotPoints -> {2, divs}, MaxRecursion -> 0,      Frame -> True,      FrameLabel -> {{None,       "log10(\!\(\*SubscriptBox[\(T\), \(esc\)]\))"}, {None, None}},      LabelStyle -> Directive[FontFamily -> "Helvetica", 15],      FrameTicks -> {{None, All}, {None, None}},      FrameTicksStyle -> Directive[FontFamily -> "Helvetica", 15, Plain],      ColorFunction -> colorFunction]          With[{opts = {ImageSize -> {Automatic, 500}}, cf = "Rainbow"},      Row[{ListPlot[List /@ data[[All, {1, 2}]],      PlotStyle -> ({PointSize[0.0045], ColorData[cf][#1]} & /@         Rescale[data[[All, 2]], {1.5, 5}]),      PlotRange -> {{-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}, AspectRatio -> 1, Frame -> True,      AspectRatio -> 1, RotateLabel -> False, Axes -> None,      FrameTicks -> True, FrameLabel -> {"x", "y"},      LabelStyle -> Directive[FontFamily -> "Helvetica", 17],      ImagePadding -> {{60, 10}, {60, 20}}, opts],      Show[colorbar[{1.5, 5}, cf], ImagePadding -> {{10, 60}, {20, 10}},      opts]}]]      Now the frame labels of the main plot are shown. However, the colorbar is larger than the square. I want the height of the colorbar to be the same as the height of the square. Finally, how could I merge in a `Show` this plot with the following contour               V = 1/2*(ω1^2*x^2 + ω2^2*y^2) - ϵ*x^2*y^2;     ω1 = 0.4; ω2 = 0.4;     ϵ = 1;     xmin = 1;     hesc = 0.0064;     C0 = ContourPlot[V, {x, -xmin, xmin}, {y, -xmin, xmin},      Contours -> {hesc}, ContourStyle -> {Gray, Thickness[0.003]},      AspectRatio -> 1, ContourShading -> False, PlotRange -> All,      PlotPoints -> 200, ImageSize -> 500];      ![new plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BukCx.png)
