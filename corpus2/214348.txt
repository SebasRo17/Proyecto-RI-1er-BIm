This is a theoretical question, but after many years of programming in what I now realize is "normal" imperative technique, using C++ mainly, I've discovered this other world of functional programming, which I stumbled upon accidentally while casually learning JavaScript. This has led me to wonder if you could technically replace any complete state- oriented program with a different implementation that is purely functional and without state? It's an intriguing idea and I must admit that there is a clarity and elegance in functional programming that has really blown my mind.
