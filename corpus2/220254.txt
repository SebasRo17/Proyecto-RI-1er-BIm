I am making a hybrid Android app. At first I decided to use localStorage, after spending 2 days, I realized that it is very strange and so dropped it. Then, I picked up indexedDB, after spending today's whole day and actually getting the output in Google Chrome, it is not running inside a WebView of the android app. And I never used Web SQL database at all because it was deprecated. Anyhow, it has come to my notice that PhoneGap still uses Web SQL and android's browsers support it. Why was Web SQL deprecated in the first place? And will it be a good idea for me to go with Web SQL now?
