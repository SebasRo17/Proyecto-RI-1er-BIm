I have a set of data $y_i (z_i)$ with errors $\Delta y_i$, that can be found here Here Thus first, I call the data               dataSN = Import["Cat3_0mod.txt", "Table"];     sigdata = dataSN[[All, 4]];     lendata = Length[zdata];          fitSN = Table[{dataSN[[i, 2]], dataSN[[i, 3]]}, {i, 1, lendata}];      I want to fit these data to a complicated model $$ Y(z) = 5\log \Bigl((1+z)\int_0^z \frac{dz'}{a+bz'+cz'^2}\Bigr)+25; $$ With help of a previous post NonLinearFit with "complicated" integral model I used 'NonLinerFit'               ModelSN1[z_] =        Simplify[5 Log[10, (1 + z) Integrate[1/(a + b x + c x^2), {x, 0, z}]] + 25,          Assumptions -> {z > 0, -b^2 + 4 a c > 0}];          fit =        NonlinearModelFit[fitSN, {ModelSN1[z], -b^2 + 4 a c > 0},         {{a, 0.000254}, {b, .000016}, {c, .000016}}, z, Weights -> 1/(sigdata)^2];      Even the fit looks fine ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/u0GAe.jpg) The reality is that the fit is complex ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/xxzF9.jpg) I Have some problems making the fit   1. Even I put conditions over the parameters $a,b,c$ the fitted model is complex. I tried to put as condition that the whole term inside $\log$ should be positive, but it does not work.   2. I want to make confidence regions on this fit using               band1SN[z_] = fit["MeanPredictionBands", ConfidenceLevel -> 0.68];       band2SN[z_] = fit["MeanPredictionBands", ConfidenceLevel -> 0.95];      but _Mathematica_ does not make it, an error related with the fact of assuming a constrained model appears. Of course, if the fit is complex, the confidence regions could not be calculated. I appreciate your help.
