I have a Weighted Graph of `g` which looks like this.               vertex = {a, b, c, d, e}     SeedRandom[1]     g = Graph[#[[1]] -> #[[2]] & /@ Permutations[vertex, {2}],      VertexLabels -> Placed["Name", Center], VertexSize -> 0.3,      EdgeWeight ->      RandomReal[{10, 20},      Count[#[[1]] -> #[[2]] & /@ Permutations[vertex, {2}], _]],      EdgeLabels -> "EdgeWeight"]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/eBCao.jpg) Could you please help me to merge two or even more vertices from `g` (Please just `g` I used `Permutations` just to build a graph), in the way that in the end, I have a graph with added up the weights of the previous edges.For example, if vertices `a` and `b` merged together, in new vertex all of weights from old edges added up together to have new edges weights with connected vertices?
