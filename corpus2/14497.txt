An earlier post was migrated to Physics.SE and we determined that if this converged, we would have a constant close to the mass of the proton in kilograms. This constant is constructed by summing the reciprocals of the products of all the numbers between consecutive squares. Per this:               SumConvergence[10^-26/Pochhammer[m^2 + 1, 2 m], m]        (* True *) we have convergence and thus a constant. However, the following:               Sum[10^-26/Pochhammer[m^2 + 1, 2 m], {m, \[Infinity]}]        outruns the precision. My question: Is there a way to use this sum to create the constant to a specified accuracy?
