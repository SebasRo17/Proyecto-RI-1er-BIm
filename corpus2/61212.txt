I just got out of school. And was about to make my portfolio.... but really all my code looks so simple that I wonder what are good enough code snippets to add to a portfolio ??? Or is my view of grandeur so high that I am just over thinking this.... And I say snippets because well no one wants to look at a project right ? and there is also all those nda's which are a pain... Please if you can include examples, would be great, especially portfolio snippet examples as I can get at a look at how they present it. thanks...
