I am having difficulties with a code I am trying to run. Essentially I want to `Read` in a large `.mov` video file (60000+frames). Then take each frame individually, process it (e.g. crop and identify particles, I can do these steps) and `Export` a text file with processing data (can do), plus the cropped image. I am not sure which functions/the setup to use for reading in a video and exporting an image sequence. I have looked at `Import` with `.mov` files, and can identify the number of frames in the movie:               videof = Import[path <> file <> ".mov", "FrameCount"]      as well as view a single frame               frame1 = Import[path <> file <> ".mov", {"Frames", {n}}]      however there is something wrong in the second line of code; no matter the value of `n` I always get the first image. Advice is much appreciated.
