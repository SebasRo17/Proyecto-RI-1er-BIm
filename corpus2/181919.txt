I'm a Web Developer about to unlock the "First Class Library Published" achievement in my career and I'm sweating bullets (literally - I was up all night stressing out). I'd love to tap the experience of the community to see if anyone has any suggestions or recommendations for making sure this goes as smoothly as possible. Are there any specifics or gotchas I need to be aware of? Anything special about the build process that can come back to bite me? Here's where I'm at:   * Library is unit tested and has approx 97% code coverage   * API is well documented and xml docs for intellisense support have been created   * I've ensured that public/private class accessors are accurate and correct. The same goes for all getters/setters   * Error handling isn't as graceful as I'd like it to be, but I'm up against a deadline and have accepted that its an "as good as its going to be" for now   * No friendly logging. Debug.Writeline was used extensively...I've learned recently that this is a reflection of my inexperience :( Your advice is greatly appreciated! The library will be used to generate reports. Standard hat -- connects to readonly database, performs calcs, formats and outputs data to response stream. * * * I was tapped as a fringe resource to fill in for one of the programmers that quit, and this task was given to me as a "cut your teeth" project. The class library is going to be released for other programmers in the company to use while they write production code.
