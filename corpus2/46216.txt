I added an image of my equations at the bottom. I dont understand why it is not solving. This is 3 systems with 2.order diferantial equations. I also put my initial conditions. But it is not solving. Without initial conditions it is not solving, too. May you please help me, why it is not solving. Am I writing codes wrongly. Here is my code:               deq2 = DSolve[{              D[T1[t], {t}, {t}] == -1.062880475*10^7*T1[t] + 845.813407*T2[t],               D[T2[t], {t}, {t}] == 281.937803*T1[t] - 1.135556134*10^6*T2[t] -                1.807293611*10^6*T3[t] + 854.700858*(1 - 555.5555556*t)*Exp[-194.4444444*t],               D[T3[t], {t}, {t}] == -1.036565839*10^10*T3[t] - 6.506256977*10^9*T2[t],               T1[0] == 0, T1'[0] == 0, T2[0] == 0, T2'[0] == 0, T3[0] == 0, T3'[0] == 0},              {T1[t], T2[t], T3[t]}, t]      I tried also another way.               {T1[t], T2[t], T3[t]} = {T1[t], T2[t], T3[t]       } /. Dsolve[{             D[T1[t], {t}, {t}] == -1.062880475*10^7*T1[t] + 845.813407*T2[t],              D[T2[t], {t}, {t}] == 281.937803*T1[t] - 1.135556134*10^6*T2[t]               -1.807293611*10^6*T3[t] + 854.700858*(1 - 555.5555556*t)*Exp[-194.4444444*t],              D[T3[t], {t}, {t}] == -1.036565839*10^10*T3[t] - 6.506256977*10^9*T2[t],              T1[0] == 0, T1'[0] == 0, T2[0] == 0, T2'[0] == 0, T3[0] == 0, T3'[0] == 0},              {T1[t], T2[t], T3[t]},              t] // FullySimplify // First      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/tTuSC.png)
