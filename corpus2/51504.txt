Is it possible to compute $\Delta F=\nabla^2 F$ for $F=F(x^1,x^2,…,x^D)$ with $D$ finite? I seem to be only able to specify spherical coorindates, for example, if I want to leave standard Cartesian coordinates. The function I'm actually using looks like this $F(x^1,x^2,…,x^D)=f^1(x^1)\times f^2(x^2) \times … \times f^D(x^D)$ (separation of variables). Is there a way mathematica can do this?
