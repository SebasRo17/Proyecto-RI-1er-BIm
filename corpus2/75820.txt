I am currently a C# developer with a pretty shaky understanding of threading. Both of these links have been suggested in other posts: http://www.yoda.arachsys.com/csharp/threads/ http://www.albahari.com/threading/ Should I go back to basics and maybe look at some computer science texts on the subject? I really feel that if I jump in and use the c# libraries I won't really have a solid foundation of knowledge to build on. I think I need to learn this subject from scratch like a com sci student, then use the C# libraries. Can anyone suggest an approach to learning threading, maybe some links and or project ideas? Thanks in advance! Edit, thanks for all the replies. Some people have mentioned that a book might be a good idea, can anyone suggest one? I'd prefer something language agnostic. Does anyone know what class would this stuff be covered in in a Computer Science degree? I'm trying to google for some free online notes and assignments.
