Planck's law dependent on frequency rho is as follows:                  B[T_, h_, rho_, k_, c_] := (2 h rho^3)/c^2 1/(Exp[h rho/(T k)] - 1)      As you can see, the denominator can only be zero for rho = 0. All the rest are nonzero constants. Curiously if we try to plot it               Plot[B[5800, 6.626 10^-34, rho, 1.38 10^-23, 299792458], {rho,        0.1 10^-6, 3 10^-6}]      It will return "Infinite expression 1/0. encountered" and the plot will be blank. In fact, substituting any value for rho appears to result in this error (out = ComplexInfinity). I have no experience with precision, but I don't see any other possible reason. Anyway to solve this?
