I'm a junior developer joining a QA team at my company. The QA team I had been interacting with while working as a developer was very solid and the business had been very good about encouraging and funding good, solid automated testing techniques and hiring people who were good at it. However, this new team I am joining looks like it might be a little more reactive in nature, blending some of the testing responsibilities (as I understand them) with ops work and not doing a lot of proactive regression testing. I'm hoping dearly that I am wrong, but the fact is I could be right as well. Does anyone have any good advice for promoting automated testing? Bear in mind that I'm not a manager or lead, and also not even an experienced tester. But on some level, it feels like some of these principles should fall into common sense. Am I wrong for thinking that? If not, what should I do?
