I attended a in-person interview recently and performed well. But surprisingly I got rejected. When I asked the HR for reason, he contacted the technical interviewer and told me that I was syntactically wrong while coding. I used Google Guava for coding. So my code looked like this: `List<String> items = Lists.newArrayList()` instead of `List<String> items =new ArrayList<String>();` I know that the code will compile and work as expected.Is it ok to use third party libraries like Google Guava in interviews?
