Could somebody explain why               test = Compile[{{x}},           Return[x];         ];     test[0.]      returns               Compile::cret: "The type of return values in Return[x]; are different. Evaluation will use the uncompiled function. "      while               test = Compile[{{x}},           Return[x]         ];     test[0.]      works as expected? Notice that the only difference is the semicolon at the end of `Return`.
