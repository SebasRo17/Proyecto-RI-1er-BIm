Inspired by simon woods's wonderful shadow function, I want to add drop shadows to all the text of non-input/output cells in a notebook, something like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/hokkY.jpg) By using simon woods's shadow function, I can take some text and add shadow to it:               style["Some text","Text"]//shadow[#,#]&      And then paste the resulting image back. But I can't automate this process. My question is   1. how to make a function that take a notebook as input, and output a "shadowed" version with all the text of non-input/output cells having shadow?   2. If 1 can be done, is it possible to reduce the size of the "shadowed" notebook? As all the text is replaced with images, the notebook may be large. Thanks very much!
