Let $n$, $m$, and $q$ be positive integers (with $m > n$), and $A$ be a matrix over $\mathbb{Z}_q^{n \times m}$. Using Mathematica, I want to find the shortest non-zero vectors $x \in \mathbb{Z}_q^m$ such that: $$Ax=0 \pmod q$$ Note: By "shortest," I mean the vector with the smallest Euclidean norm. I'm not sure if this vector is unique. If it's not, I want a list of vectors with smallest Euclidean norm. * * * **Example:** Let: $n=2, m=3, q=7, A = \left(\begin{matrix} 2 & 1 & 6\\\ 1 & 3 & 1 \end{matrix} \right)$. Then, the following vectors are solutions to {1,1,3} $\quad$ Norm = $\sqrt{11}$ {3,3,2} $\quad$ Norm = $\sqrt{22}$ {2,2,6} $\quad$ Norm = $\sqrt{44}$ {5,5,1} $\quad$ Norm = $\sqrt{51}$ {4,4,5} $\quad$ Norm = $\sqrt{57}$ {6,6,4} $\quad$ Norm = $\sqrt{88}$ Therefore, the vector {1,1,3} is the shortest solution. * * * **PS:** I used an exhaustive search to find the above solutions. My approach takes a long time for even small choices of $n$ and $m$, say $n=2, m=8$. Please offer an approach which can at least find solutions for such small parameters. **Edit:** As Michael suggested in a comment, I demonstrate the "exhaustive search" code I used. I'm not proud of it at all, as I just wrote the code to find an example for this question.               A = RandomInteger[6, {2, 3}];     x = {a, b, c};     Table[       If[Mod[A.x, 7] == {0, 0}, Print[{x, x // Norm}]],          {a, 0, 6}, {b, 0, 6}, {c, 0, 6}]
