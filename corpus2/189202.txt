I've been hired by someone to do some small work on a site. It's a site for a large company. It contains very sensitive data, so security is very important. Upon analyzing the code, I've noticed it's filled with security holes - read, lots of PHP files throwing user get/post input directly into mysql requests and system commands. The problem is, the person who made the site for him is a programmer with family and children who depend on that job. I can't just say: "your site is a script kiddie amusement park. Let me redo it for you and you'll be fine." What would you do in this situation? ## Update: I followed some good advice here and politely reported to the developer that I've found some possible security flaws on the site. I pointed out the line and said there could be a possible vulnerability for SQL injection attacks there, and asked if he knew about it. He replied: _"sure, but I think that to exploit it the attacker should have information on the structure of the database; I have to understand better"_. ## Update 2: I said that's not always the case and suggested he follows this Stack Overflow question link in order to deal with it properly: How to prevent SQL injection in PHP? He said he would study it and thanked me for telling him before. I guess my part is done, thanks guys.
