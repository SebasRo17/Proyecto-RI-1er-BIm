A problem I am occasionally facing is to simplify an equation not to it's shortest form but to a form that is simple by other means. Often, this is grouping the term according to certain functions, for example exponential functions from a Fourier series. For example,               1 Exp[i k t] + 2 x Exp[i k t] + (2 x + 1) Exp[i k t]^2 // Simplify      will give `E^(i k t) (1 + E^(i k t)) (1 + 2 x)`. Instead,               (2 x + 1) Exp[i k t] + (2 x + 1) Exp[i 2 k t]      is often desired. Is there any simple[1] way to achieve that? [1] I once achieved that using the `FourierTransform` and replacing the `DiracDelta` with 1 or 0 to get the coefficients, but that is neither elegant nor always possible.
