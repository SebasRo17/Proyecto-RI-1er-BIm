The notebook expression resulting from ...               nb = CreateDocument[ExpressionCell[Defer@Random[], "Input"]];     FrontEndTokenExecute[nb, "EvaluateNotebook"];     NotebookGet@nb      does _not_ include the output of `Random[]` as I might have expected from the `FrontEndTokenExecute` command. Instead `NotebookGet@nb` acts as if `FrontEndTokenExecute` was _not_ evaluated despite its execution in the frontend? I guess this is due to the separation/communication between the frontend and the kernel but can output from evaluations in a generated notebook be grabbed in a single kernel call? See answer below:
