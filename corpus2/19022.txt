**What you have**   1. A pattern, with certain part of it labeled  As an example â€” Label: `wally`              pattern = h : HoldPattern@f[x, __, 3[5], wally_, y]        2. An expression that matches a pattern such as:              expr = f[x, 9, v, h[v], 3[5], v, y]      **What I want** The position of the part of the expression `expr` that matched the label `wally`. In the above example, that would be               gimmeWhattaWanna[expr, pattern, wally]     (* {{6}} *)      **Note** If the labeled pattern is a sequence such as `wally__`, either finding the position of the first, or the first and last, are acceptable. If the labeled pattern is repeated such as in `f[wally_, 2, wally_]`, then a list of the positions seems the most natural solution. However, a solution that limits itself to non-repeated labels, or even non-sequence ones is useful.
