I would like to create a `Manipulate` slider that iterates over a discrete set of items. Something like the following               Manipulate[u, CharacterRange["a","z"]]      produces a drop-down menu, which doesn't have a great interaction style. I must move the mouse back up to the top to get a new item, taking my eyes off the display back to the controls, rather than being able to just slide around without having to look at the controls too often. Even better would be some kind of keyboard control that would let me left-and- right arrow my way through a collection. Then I'd never have to take my eyes off the target display. But that would be too intuitive [sarcasm].
