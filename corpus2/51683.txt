![What I am trying to do:](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fw1Yu.jpg) I have been Mathematica user for a considerably short while. I have learned some of its functionality using wolfram how-to resources and the documentation. I am having difficulties constructing something similar as shown above. I was wondering if anyone could give me pointers to resources that would allow me to achieve visuals as presented in the image attached with this question. My objective is to use a slider to manipulate triangles height and as the slider moves text appears, color changes and values at milestones become visible. Many thanks in advance!
