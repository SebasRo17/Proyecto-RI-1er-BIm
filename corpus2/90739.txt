I am a computer science student currently in my 2nd year of bachelors. My problem is pretty straight forward yet still so far has not been self- resolvable. It is simply is that I am tired of programming. I don't know why but it just happened. When I started my first course in c++ I was very excited. So excited that I finished two heavy c++ books within 2 months and was way ahead of my class and my own expectations. It was like I can easily develop algorithms and code them. I explored C++ a lot, > but for the past 2 semesters I am pretty much not into coding and I have > lost a great amount of interest or passion for it. I love programming as well my CS degree.But even with that i am not able to set things up. Kindly tell me what to do? I have started C# and XNA Game development on my own but still it's like I am pushing myself. Can anyone give give suggestions to wake up the coder inside of me?
