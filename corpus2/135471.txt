I've a c# file that will contain, most likely 10,000+ lines of code. I'd like to break this file into tabbed segments, so I can organize each method into a certain tab and label the tab something like : initial setup, helper functions,execution logic,list structures,global variables, etc. If I were using PHP I would have separate files and use include(); to include the separate files. What can be done, following the same style, with c#?
