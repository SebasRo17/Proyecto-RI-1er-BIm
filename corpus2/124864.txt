I'm trying to add Continuous Integration to a project. According to Wikipedia, one major piece of CI is automated builds. However, I'm confused about what, exactly, that means, as the CI and build automation articles seem to disagree. **Specific points of confusion: what does "automated build" mean _in the context of:_**   * a project using an interpreted language, such as Python or Perl?   * building from source on an end-user's machine?   * an application that has dependencies that cannot be simply pre-compiled and distributed, such as a database in an RDBMS local to the user's machine?
