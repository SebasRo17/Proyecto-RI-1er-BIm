I'm trying to grasp the new control system functions in Mathematica 8. I'd like to connect a controller model to a model of a plant to simulate the behavior of the system. I define a simple servo model:               servo = StateSpaceModel[{x''[t] == u[t] - x'[t]}, {{x''[t], 0}}, {{u[t], 0}}, x[t], t]      where `x[t]` is the position of the servo and `u[t]` is the input (voltage). and a simple PID controller:               pid = TransferFunctionModel[5 + 0.01*s - 0.00001/s, s]      Now I _assumed_ that I could link the PID controller to the servo model using `SystemsModelFeedbackConnect`:               loop = SystemsModelFeedbackConnect[TransferFunctionModel[servo], pid]      But the system doesn't behave as I would have expected:               input = UnitStep[t - 1] - 0.5 UnitStep[t - 10];     output = OutputResponse[loop, input, t];     Plot[{input, output}, {t, 0, 30}]      ![Plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/m2OFY.png) There's a lot of overshoot because the PID is not optimized at all, but I would have expected that the P part of the controller would pull the output to the (target) input eventually. But it seems as if the P factor scales the input, rather than the error.
