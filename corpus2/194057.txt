We're using MySQL with Sequelize.js as the ORM. What we're wondering is whether a DOA layer of abstraction is worthwhile. Here are our options:   1. To use the Sequelize models throughout the application.   2. To abstract Sequelize by building a layer that converts Sequelize models to Backbone models so that we're using Backbone throughout the rest of the application instead. Is abstraction important in this case or is it normal to use Models from the ORM throughout the other layers?
