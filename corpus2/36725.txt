Using the same example code as in this question, is it possible to show all 10 plots (ie, each step of the manipulation) simultaneously? If a manipulate function is a series of listplots based on a single variable, is it possible to show all list plots simultaneously (ie - to overlay all listplots as one static plot). The only way I can think of doing this is copying & pasting the code n number of times, changing the variable for each one, naming each listplot & using               Show [a,b,c,d...]      but this seems fairly labour intensive!
