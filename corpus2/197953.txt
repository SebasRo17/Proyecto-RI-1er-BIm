I have some questions about VPS and web hosting. As far as I understand, VPS is a virtual machine on which we can do anything as we can do with our local machine. Install software, change settings etc. Web hosting is where we have only a folder in which we place our web site in. However, most of the provider currently advertise their service as "VPS web hosting". This confuses me, does that mean they are selling VPS service which can only host web sites? I need a virtual machine which host one RESTful Java service using Tomcat and Jersey and MYSQL at the backend. My plan was to hire a VPS machine, install Tomcat 7 and MySQL on that machine. Is this the right way to go? Many thanks.
