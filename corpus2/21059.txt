Here is a downsampled input image I converted to greyscale. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/n1063.png) To select the rectangular region of interest we first preform preprocessing:               binarizedImage =       Dilation[Erosion[        Dilation[Binarize[FillingTransform@ColorNegate@resizedGreyImage],          3], 4], 3]      And then find the relevant components and corners               regions =       SelectComponents[       DeleteSmallComponents[binarizedImage,         Method -> "Mean"], {"Rectangularity"}, 1]          corners =       ImageCorners[regions, 4, 0, 10, MaxFeatures -> 4,        "MaxRefinement" -> 0]      Here is the result:               Show[input,       Graphics[{Opacity[0.5], PointSize[.05], Yellow,         Polygon[corners[[ConvexHull[corners]]]], Thickness[0.4], Blue,         Point /@ corners, White, Text[ToString@#, #] & /@ corners, Green,         Point /@ centers, EdgeForm[{Red, Thick}], FaceForm[Opacity[0]],         Rectangle @@ # & /@ boundingBoxes}], ImageSize -> 600]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/boaEa.png) I'd like this to be more robust. I'm not sure that "Rectangularity" is the best measure, for instance, in this picture, selecting the component with highest "Rectangularity" doesn't always work:               ![enter code here][3]          DeleteSmallComponents[          ImageForestingComponents[ImageResize[input, 300]]]          % // Colorize     regions = SelectComponents[%%, {"Rectangularity"}, 1] // Colorize      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/KziGk.png) Also, I'm coding this in opencv, I'm only using mathematica to prototype so if you know the underlying methods used that would be very helpful.
