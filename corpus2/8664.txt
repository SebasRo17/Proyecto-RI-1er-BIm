I have some quantity varying with time (horizontal axis of the plot): it first oscillates then it has a jump (larger than the amplitude of the oscillations), then it continues oscillating. I have that quantity for a discrete set of cases (vertical axis of the plot). I would like to find an option for `ListDensityPlot` that would allow me to really emphasize that jump: I don't want a nice smooth color scheme but rather one that would make the small oscillations invisible and would focus on the larger jump. I can I control `ListDensityPlot` to do that ?
