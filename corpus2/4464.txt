While answering this question, I tried `TextRecognize` to read single digits. But it doesn't recognize a single digit, even though the digits are clearly readable. For example, this ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/EYX3I.png) is not recognized. This is my code:               digits = ImagePartition[Import["http://i.stack.imgur.com/cLncR.png"], 50];     Map[TextRecognize, digits, {2}]
