I am starting to design the database schema for the eCommerce element of a web service I am creating. The thing I'm trying to get my head around is how to deal with the use case of a seller (user of my web service) deleting a product. The issue I have is that this product could be referenced in a customers basket, to be paid orders, pending orders, deliveries, past orders etc... This problem is surely one that everyone developing such a system has come across. I'm just wondering if there is a best practice way to address it? Can it be addressed at the database schema level? Or maybe it just requires certain validation checks on database data before allowing a product to be deleted, or to stop an error if a customer is trying to pay for an order that had a reference to a product, but that reference has been deleted (i.e. product was deleted).
