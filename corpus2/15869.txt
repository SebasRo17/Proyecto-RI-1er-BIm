I was playing with some of the new features, and when I type e.g.               Quantity[10, "ml"] + Quantity[250 - 100, "ml"]      I get               160 mL      as expected. But when I want to solve the following equation               Solve[Quantity[x, "ml"] Quantity[5, "mol"] + Quantity[250 - x, "ml"] Quantity[7, "mol"] ==     Quantity[250, "ml"] Quantity[6, "mol"], x]      I get               {{x -> 125}}      without any unit. But x actually is in mL. So I'm wondering what I am getting wrong, i.e. why don't I get mL here? thanks!
