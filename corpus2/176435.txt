I read that Facebook started out in PHP, and then to gain speed, they now compile PHP as C++ code. If that's the case why don't they:   1. Just program in c++? Surely there must be SOME errors/bugs when hitting a magic compiler button that ports PHP to c++ code , right?   2. If this impressive converter works so nicely, why stick to PHP at all? Why not use something like Ruby or Python? Note -- I picked these two at random, but mostly because nearly _everyone_ says coding in those languages is a "joy". So why not develop in a super great language and then hit the magic c++ compile button?
