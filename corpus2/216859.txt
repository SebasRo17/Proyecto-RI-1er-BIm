Core Data seems to add a needless layer of complexity. If you want to save data created natively by the user in an app why not just use an object and then write the data all to SQLite or back to a server using a RESTful script if necessary. Android doesn't have Core Data (though if it has something similar I haven't seen it.). What the heck is the point of buggy CD except useless needless overhead for people who can't write SQL or CGI scripts?
