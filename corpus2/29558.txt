I have input this:               Integrate[1, f[t]*Exp[(v/V)*t]]      That is $\large\int 1*d(f(t)*e^{\frac{v}{V}*t})$ I expected this output: $\large f(t)*e^{\frac{v}{V}*t} + C$ but instead I get:               Integrate::ilim: "Invalid integration variable or limit(s) in E^((t\v)/V)\ f[t]. "      What am I doing wrong ? PS: in the model at the origin of my troubles t is the only variable v and V are constants
