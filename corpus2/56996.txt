I am a new Mathematica user, and I have run into a question. What is the difference between the output of the commands:               VectorPlot[{x, Sin[x - y]}, {x, -3, 3}, {y, -3, 3}]      and               VectorPlot[{1, Sin[x - y]}, {x, -3, 3}, {y, -3, 3}]      The only difference is the argument in the first braces, x and 1, but I am not sure what that means in terms of the vector field that is generated. I understand this generates two vector fields. I did not understand how the input affects the generated output, i.e., what exactly does Mathematica require the entries here to be, and how does it interpret the difference in these two arguments for the VectorField command: {x, Sin[x - y]} and {1, Sin[x - y]}.
