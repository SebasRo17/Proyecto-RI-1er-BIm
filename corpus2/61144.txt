I'm managing a team of 10 software developers and I'm looking for a tool which can be used to schedule/assign tasks. I envisage a fairly simple web-based tool which each developer signs into. Here they can see a list of tasks assigned to them. For each task it would be clear how long has been assigned (either the number of hours or number of days) and when it should be delivered. Drilling into a task would reveal any associated notes/specification, and each task would be associated with a client and a project. Each developer would 'sign off' a task when complete. An administrative interface would exist for managing users, clients, projects and tasks. Is there a free tool available which provides this basic functionality? Obviously we could write our own in a relatively short amount of time, but I'd be interesting in knowing if there are any (ideally open source) tools already out there that people have experience using.
