I am trying to run a Mathematica example concerning Mathematica interfacing issues with C programs. In particular I am trying to call a Mathematica function from C. Example `factor.c` is the best in my case. As explained here at the _Invoking the Mathematica Kernel from Within a Prebuilt Example_ section, I successfully build the examples (using the makefile through `make all`). After that I run the exaple as explained by typing:               ./factor -linkmode launch -linkname 'math -mathlink'      But I get back to my shell after launching the program with no output as I did nothing. Then I try again just by launching `./factor`, the program then asks me: `Create link:`, so I type `'math -mathlink'`, prfess ok, then it prompts: `Integer to factor:`, I type a 6 digit one and after that the program blocks (it waits for something, but after 5 minutes I kill it). Consider that I am on Unix. My Mathematica installation is in this path `/home/myuser/progs/Mathematica...`. I run the example respectively with Mathematica running and not running. Same results. How to make the example work? ### Something strange When I kill theprograms that I launch but stay on wait as I described before, it seems that they finally got killed, but it is not! When I try `ps` on my shell, they are there!!! Need to send `SIGKILL` to definetely get rid of them... ### About links... I bumped into a Mathematica function called LinkCreate. Maybe I need to run Mathematica, open a link from the interface, and then launch the example? I am trying some, so far no results, will keep on doing so...
