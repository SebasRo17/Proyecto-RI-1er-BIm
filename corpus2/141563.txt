A friend of mine told me that, the best practice is class containing `main` method should be named `Main` and only contains `main` method. Also `main` method should only parse inputs, create other objects and call other methods. The `Main` class and `main` method shouldn't do anything else. Basically what he is saying that class containing `main` method should be like:               public class Main     {         public static void main(String[] args)         {             //parse inputs             //create other objects             //call methods         }     }      Is it the best practice?
