Consider the following simple code:               f = Sin[a x];     Manipulate[       Plot[f, {x, 0, 10}],        {a, 0, 10}]      Manipulate takes `f` to be a variable which has no value. I tried to evaluate `f` as follows:                Manipulate[        Plot[Evaluate @ f, {x, 0, 10}],         {a, 0, 10}]      but now I still have a problem with the scope of `a`. I know one way to do what I want, which is to define `f` as a function of `a` as follows:               f[a_] := Sin[a x];     Manipulate[       Plot[f[a], {x, 0, 10}],        {a, 0, 10}]      But what if I have many variables and I want to manipulate over all of them? Is there any way to make `Manipulate` substitute `f` by its value and take all of its symbols as a variables to be manipulated?
