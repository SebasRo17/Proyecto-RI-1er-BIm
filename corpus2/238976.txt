I was reading a question and one of the comments mentioned that "The binary flag is only relevant on Windows". Given the context of the question and answer, I interpret this statement as `on non-windows machines, we don't need to specify text or binary mode when doing file IO` The context of the question is to read all bytes of a file into a string (presumably preserving bytes). It seems very relevant to me whether I'm reading the data as text or bytes, since reading text involves dealing with encoding. If I'm reading a UTF-16 file, for example, what I get in text mode is much different from what I get in binary mode. Assuming my interpretation of the statement is correct, is it unnecessary to specify whether a file should be opened in text or binary mode on non-windows machines? That is, all files are read in binary mode by default. Otherwise, what could the statement be referring to? (the comment received a number of upvotes so presumably this is not just one person's opinion)
