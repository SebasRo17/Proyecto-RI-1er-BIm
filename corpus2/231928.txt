At my new place of employment we have a Intranet solution containing multiple web applications hosted in IIS. Outside of the development department other departments either source or create other applications / reports that deep link into these web applications. Unfortunately, I have no direct control over these potential applications and some get created without our knowledge. This causes a problem if we need to do some re-structuring or re-factoring. I was wondering if anyone had an approach where all inbound links regardless of origin had to be registered - i.e like a link registry or some other approach on how to deal with this. This could then be used so that the impact of any re-organisation of the structure of the web application could be understood. Any help much appreciated
