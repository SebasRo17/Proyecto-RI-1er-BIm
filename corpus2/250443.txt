I'm searching for a suitable way to make web requests to databases and display results in real-time. The data will be used in an interface for staff, so there cannot be any blocking or lag as time is a key factor. So far, I've been using PHP for the backend of the system. However now that I've come to the interface, I'm slightly stuck. I've used java (android) asynchronously before, and ideally am after a similar method of processing calls. From what I've read there is no current way of using php truly asynchronously. **What** is a good web language to use for this purpose? or what are my available options?
