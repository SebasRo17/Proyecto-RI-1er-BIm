I am trying match variables with subscripts just returning true or false depending if pattern is matched. My try is to use `Cases`. However the following does not return a match               Cases[Subscript[x, 2], Subscript[x, l_] /; l > 1]      Moreover, if this would work there must something nicer than               Length[    Cases[Subscript[x, 2], Subscript[x, l_] /; l > 1]]>=1
