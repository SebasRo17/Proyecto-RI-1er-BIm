My problem is, that when a make a notebook and convert it to CDF using the 'CDF-Export', the search field, which appears on CDF player, does not work. When trying to search for a word, the computer simply makes a sound indicating that the word was not found. But when I use 'CDF-preview' before converting, the search field works just fine. I have tried it with very simple notebooks and the problem is still there. Am I the only one with this problem? Does anyone have an idea for a solution?
