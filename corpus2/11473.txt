I'm trying to rotate 4 piecewise functions around the X-axis using `RevolutionPlot3D`. The 4 functions I have are:               bottom[x_] := Piecewise[{{{2 + x - x^2/6}, 0 <= x < 3}}, Indeterminate]     side[x_] := Piecewise[{{7/2, 3 <= x < 15}}, Indeterminate]     top[x_] := Piecewise[{{{37/2 - x}, 15 <= x < 17}}, Indeterminate]     neck[x_] := Piecewise[{{3/2, 17 <= x <= 20}}, Indeterminate]      If I try to rotate all of these around the X-axis using `RevolutionPlot3D`, I get errors:               RevolutionPlot3D[{{bottom[x]}, {side[x]}, {top[x]}, {neck[x]}}, {x, 0, 20},                      AxesLabel -> {"x", "y", "z"}, RevolutionAxis -> {1, 0, 0}]      This gives me > Dot::rect: Nonrectangular tensor encountered. errors. This has worked previously with other functions. I tried only the straight lines one for debugging, that is `side` and `neck`:               RevolutionPlot3D[{{side[x]}, {neck[x]}}, {x, 0, 20},       AxesLabel -> {"x", "y", "z"}, RevolutionAxis -> {1, 0, 0}]      But this actually crashes the _Mathematica_ kernel. Any ideas how I get _Mathematica_ to show a revolution plot around the X-axis of these 4 functions?
