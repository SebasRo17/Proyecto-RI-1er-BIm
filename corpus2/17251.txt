I have a plot which is rather expensive to "present", and I want to create an animation on top of it. EDIT: "present" here does not just mean create the plot, but also to rasterize and present in on the Notebook. I tried to create the plot before by doing `plot=Plot[...]` and then use `Show[plot,Animate[...]]`, but _Mathematica_ does not allow to combine plots with Animations. If I put the plot inside the animation, it gets really slow as it re-renders the plot at each frame. * * * Another thing I tried was to present the plot as an background image of the animation, but I'm not being able to make backgrounds other than RGBColors (and I don't even know if this works). Is there any proper way of achieving this? * * * EDIT2: One example of such plot               plot = ContourPlot[Cos[x] + Cos[y], {x, 0, 4 Pi}, {y, 0, 4 Pi},      PlotPoints -> 200, MaxRecursion -> 2, Mesh -> None];      The number of `PlotPoints` is big because in my particular case the function to be plotted is non trivial, and requires a lot of resolution to see anything. (I'm not putting here the code because the function is obtained as an iterative process, and is out of the scope of this question)
