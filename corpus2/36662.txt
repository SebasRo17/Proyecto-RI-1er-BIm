I've got about a dozen programming projects bouncing about my head, and I'd love to contribute to some open source projects, the problem I have is that having spent the entire day staring at Visual Studio and or Eclipse (Sometimes both at the same time...) the last thing I feel like doing when I go home is program. How do you build up the motivation/time to work on your own projects after work? I'm not saying that I don't enjoy programming, it's just that I enjoy other things too and it can be hard to even do something you enjoy if you've spent all day already doing it. I think that if I worked at a chocolate factory the last thing I'd want to see when I got home was a Wonka bar.
