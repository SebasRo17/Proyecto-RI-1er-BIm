Moore's law is an empirical law and in simple terms states that the number of transistors on integrated circuits doubles approximately every two years. One of the consequences of Moore's law is that CPU performance doubles every 18 Months. I've seen 'Why is Moore's Law seen as an absolute truth?' and although curious does not answer my question. Currently we are partly achieving that by making multi core CPU's. **Can we still consider that speed of CPU's doubles every 18 months?** Multi-core CPU's can be looked at just as distributed computing. A "good old" single threaded sofware/algorithm won't be able to take full advantage of such CPU as before and It's not true that all algorithms are paralelizable with speed gain.
