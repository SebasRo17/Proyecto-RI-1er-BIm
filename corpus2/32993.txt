I would like to obtain the symmetry inequivalent possible occupations of indistinguishable objects in a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions. Examples:   * 1 object in a 4 by 4 square lattice has 16 **equivalent** positions -> **1 inequivalent position**.   * 2 objects in a 3 by 3 square lattice has 2 **inequivalent** positions.              000    000     000    010     110    100        * 2 objects in a 4 by 4 square lattice has 5 **inequivalent** positions.              0000    0000    0000    0000    0000     0000    0000    0000    0000    0010     0000    0000    0100    0010    0000     1100    1010    1000    1000    1000      ![Some equivalent positions in a 4x4 square lattice](http://i.stack.imgur.com/24MM6.jpg) I can search for the inequivalent positions with a bruteforce approach by applying all possible symmetries to all possible initial configurations of 1 or 2, 3 objects and so on. Anyway, I was wondering if there is a way to do this with group theory in Mathematica. I tried starting from this SO question but I didn't manage to get translations working. Thanks in advances.
