I intend to build a type of online social network in ASP.NET. I am going to host it under IIS server. The database that I am going to use is SQL Server. The site will accept a maximum 500,000 users. It will be in one language and it's targeted to people who live in countries which its main language is the language that this site will be built in. I expect the number of users who will use the application every day will be between 30,000 and 34,000. so in average it may be 2000 online users per hour. I can afford to buy Visual Studio Professional but I do not know If I will be able to afford the cost of IIS/ SQL server, etc (any other MS fees). I do not know how to calculate the cost and, with these estimates, determine how many servers I need. Waiting help from experts.
