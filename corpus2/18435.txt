Inspired from this, I tried factor following expressions, Mathematica takes a long time, I couldn't even wait for it to finish. Maple calculating it takes about 5 sec. Can you recommend an efficient method? To get the factored result please click here(generated by Maple 16).               Factor[1 - 216 x^2 - 192 x^3 + 16140 x^4 + 18816 x^5 - 547528 x^6 -        687168 x^7 + 8960886 x^8 + 12394752 x^9 - 67518888 x^10 -        108989760 x^11 + 178031596 x^12 + 374357376 x^13 + 61149384 x^14 -        96214464 x^15 + 3999249 x^16,       Extension -> {Sqrt[2], Sqrt[3], Sqrt[5], Sqrt[6], Sqrt[11]}]
