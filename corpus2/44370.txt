I want to solve a system of nonlinear two differential equations (say, in $\theta(x,t)$ and $\phi(x,t)$ with `NDSolve`, but I want to stop the evaluation when one of the functions ($\phi(x,t)$) reaches zero, or, for instance, a certain value $\bar{\phi}$. Because then I would like to study how, where and (of course) when this pinch- off happens. What is the best way of doing this, in your opinion? Putting a constraint before running `NDSolve`? I tried with WhenEvent, adding a line `WhenEvent[\\[Phi][x, t] == 0, Plot[\\[Phi][x, T], {x, 0, L}]` in the code, but it gives me               NDSolve::litarg:     To avoid possible ambiguity, the arguments of the dependent variable in  WhenEvent     (...)should literally match the independent variables      Here is the link to the shortest code I can manage to give: https://www.dropbox.com/s/4t5o53lppb2itk8/mma3.nb
