Suppose we have this differential equation: $$ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = \frac{\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}}{x+y+z}$$ I want to find $\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}$ at x=1,y=1,z=1. I tried this code but doesn't work..               eqn[x_, y_, z_] := x^2 + y^2 + z^2 == D[y[x, z], x]/(x + y + z)          Solve[ eqn[1, 1, 1], D[y[x, z], x] ]      I get an error saying "General::ivar: 1 is not a valid variable." I restarted mathematica and the error persists. * * * Too long for a comment - Your answer works, but I improvised this to my current problem and it doesn't seem to work..               Clear["Global`*"]     C1 = 10^(-10);     C2 = 0.1*C1;     R = 50;     Tb = 0.1;     Geb = 5*10^-15;     Z0 = 50;     L[Te_] := 10^-9 + 10^-9*(Te - 0.1);     Zlcr[Te_, w_] := (1/R + 1/(I*L[Te]*w) + I*C1*w)^-1;     Zload[Te_, w_] := -I*w*C2 + Zlcr[Te, w];     \[CapitalGamma][Te_, w_] := (Zload[Te, w] - Z0)/(Zload[Te, w] + Z0);     x[Te_, w_] := Abs[\[CapitalGamma][Te, w]];     y[Te_, w_] := (Abs[\[CapitalGamma][Te, w]])^2;               eqn1 [Te_, Pprobe_, w_] := 1 - 2 Pprobe*D[x[Te, w], Plocal] ==  Geb*D[Te, Plocal]     a = Solve[eqn1 [Te, Pprobe, w], D[Te, Plocal] ]     b = D[Te, Plocal]  /. a     b /. {Te -> 1, Plocal -> 1, w -> 1}
