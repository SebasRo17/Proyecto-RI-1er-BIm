I don't remember how I got to the thread, but I was reading its replies and one of them states that you should never initialize a `char[]` with a string literal. My question: Is initializing a character array with a string literal a bad practice or is that just the author's opinion? * * * Here is the original question: > **strlen vs sizeof** > > Code:               #include <stdio.h>     #include<string.h>     main()     {         char string[] = "october";         strcpy(string, "september");              printf("the size of %s is %d and the length is %d\n\n", string, sizeof(string), strlen(string));         return 0;     }      > right. the size should be the length plus 1 yes? > > this is the output > > `the size of september is 8 and the length is 9` > > size should be 10 surely. its like its calculating the sizeof string before > it is changed by strcpy but the length after. > > Is there something wrong with my syntax or what?
