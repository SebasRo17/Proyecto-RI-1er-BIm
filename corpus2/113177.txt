Well, I know that there are things like malloc/free for C, and new/using-a- destructor for memory management in C++, but I was wondering why there aren't "new updates" to these languages that allow the user to have the option to manually manage memory, or for the system to do it automatically (garbage collection)? Somewhat of a newb-ish question, but only been in CS for about a year.
