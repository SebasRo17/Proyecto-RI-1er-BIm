The famous Strassen's matrix multiplication algorithm is a real treat for us, as it reduces the time complexity from the traditional O(n^3) to O(n^2.8). But of all the resources I have gone through, even Cormen and Steven Skienna's book, they clearly do not state of how Strassen thought about it. What is the rationale of Strassen's matrix multiplication algorithm? Is this a lucky accident or is there something deeper in it?
