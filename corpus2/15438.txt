When given a single variable sequence, `GeneratingFunction` is automatically expressed in the most "direct form", for example,               GeneratingFunction[(i + 1) v[i - 1], i, x]      returns something like               2 x GeneratingFunction[v[i], i, x] + v[-1] + x^2 D[GeneratingFunction[v[i], i, x],x]      But, if I add an extra variable that does not otherwise affect the result               GeneratingFunction[(i + 1) v[i - 1, j], {i, j}, {x, y}]      then the function is not evaluated in the same way, although, it would seem that it would be correct to return               2 x GeneratingFunction[(i + 1) v[i - 1, j], {i, j}, {x, y}] + v[-1,j]      + x^2 D[GeneratingFunction[(i + 1) v[i - 1, j], {i, j}, {x, y}],x]      what is happening here, how can I make it behave in a way that would fit this intuition?
