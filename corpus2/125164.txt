When writing a resume, should I be concerned that certain open source projects I've created might be a hindrance to me because they would be perceived as reinventing the wheel? I've created a few open source libraries that might be perceived as such by hiring managers, because there are much more established tools that perform similar tasks. I have my reasons for wanting to start from scratch, but they're virtually impossible to explain on a resume and might be mildly controversial among techies. Basically, these libraries are written in D, and there was no D library that did what I wanted. I felt that creating bindings to libraries in another language instead of starting from scratch would constrain my ability to take advantage of D-specific features too much and make the libraries too brittle and hard to get up and running. On the other hand, these projects are related to the domain I'm applying for and would be a good way to show my domain knowledge. Should I put them on my resume or leave them off?
