So I've been working at a job for the past year as a .NET developer/DBA. The job is my first DBA job. Traditionally, I'm a .NET developer and have about 5 years experience in it. Does it make sense for me to continue my certs to get the MCM (assuming I'm eligible)? I'm thinking it doesn't because I've been working with SQL Server for 5 years but only as a DBA for a year. Would it help a developer to have that? Or is it useful only in switching? I became interested in SQL Server because I felt that during the recession, people were looking more and more for developers who could add value across the stack. Now, I'm not so sure...
