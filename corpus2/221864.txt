I'm using FogBugz for Project Management, and I'm unsure how to structure my cases. I have different features which require implementing as part of this project. For example, if I have a new feature to include autocomplete on a search text box, this would have cases such as:   * Method for returning search terms   * Front-end changes to request method   * Front-end changes to display search terms Should I create these as **subcases** under a "Autocomplete" case, or should they be created as top-level cases under an **area** called "Autocomplete"?
