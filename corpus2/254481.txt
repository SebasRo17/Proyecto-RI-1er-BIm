I have written a single page application that uses rest services to retrieve JSON objects. The JSON objects being returned are C# objects serialized using the Newtonsoft.JSON library. The returned JSON object contains $ref pointers to specific $id objects within the same JSON object (The question here shows an example). I need to access the actual data that the $ref points to, but I do not know how to access it without locating the original source. I've found solutions such as writing a new contract serializer and writing my own implementation of resolving the references. I feel like there should be an easier solution than these two. I've also explored the Newtonsoft JSON serialization settings; I've tried setting PreserveReferenceHandling to None, but I haven't had any success there. I'm looking for solutions other than the ones I've mentioned. I'm hoping there's a simple solution that requires very little code to implement and no additional frameworks. UPDATE I've been reading some more about this and discovered that $ref is a JSON Pointer fragment. The reference number is an ID that references an item from a different schema. That appears to be the solution, but a schema needs to be defined for it to work.
