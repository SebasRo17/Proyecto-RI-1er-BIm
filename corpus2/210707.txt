Ive just started working with Git (Github) in anticipation for an up coming project I'm project managing and designing and developing the front end of. One thing I couldn't work out is, is it preferable to publish each individual change as you make them, ie. updated sidebar js, designed new FAQ page (each as individual commits) and the back end developers would be doing the same ie. added this class, refactored this.. Or is it better to do a daily / half daily commit of all the work you've done? My thoughts were that if you do lots of small commits its easier to roll back, but also at the same time every commit you make the rest of the team has to get locally before they can commit their code. You obviously don't have this problem so much if you do daily or half daily commits, but its a little more complicated to roll back if you need to? Is there a best practice for this or is it down to team preference? Background: I'm using Github via the mac desktop app not the CL.
