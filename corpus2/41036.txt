When I tried to solve the equation below, I got the $4$ errors. Since I am pretty new on _Mathematica_ , I don't know what I did wrong. > > $24x_1+20x_2+16x_3=4$   >  $20x_1+20x_2+19x_3=36$   >  $16x_1+19x_2+38x_3=19$ This system is set to solve in Jacobi method after $40$ iterations. Initial approximation is $x_1(0)=0, x_2(0)=0, x_3(0)=0$. I would appreciate it if someone could recommend other methods that I can use for this system!
