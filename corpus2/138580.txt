I have a 3 branch setup: Dev, QA, Prod. There is a references folder where we store common 3rd party and internal assemblies. Change mgmnt has been challenging. Sometimes Devs forget to go into the References folder and check in the new version. We tried referencing Projects, which results in a reference to the bin folder. This works out fine as long as you keep the build order correct and always contain all the projects in the same solution file. This isn't always a good idea or feasible, so we went to a references folder. Continuous Integration may help alleviate some of these issues, but we don't have a CI server yet. Is there a good process for for managing the References folder that doesn't require so much manuel dev intervention? I thought about copying the files out on post-build. That doesn't solve the issue of checking the new version in so other devs can access it. We have TFS. This is for internal corporate development. Anything that requires open-source of our product is not possible. **UPDATE**   I own FinalBuilder. I am new to using it and do not know if it can benefit this process.
