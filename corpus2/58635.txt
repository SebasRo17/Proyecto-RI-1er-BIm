I have a very large sparse array, and the computation of individual matrix elements is fairly expensive. The Matrix is Hermitian and traceless, so I would like to construct only the sub-diagonal elements explicitly. A sketch of my attempt:               M = SparseArray[{}, {imax, imax}];     SetSharedVariable[M];     ParallelDo[       If[j < i, M[[i, j]] = f[i, j]],       {i, 1, imax}, {j, 1, imax}];      My understanding is that setting M as a shared variable this way is very expensive. Is there a good way to parallelize this process? Note: I have seen examples where people calculate dense matrices by constructing the submatrices on separate kernels, but for my matrix the computation time of a submatrix is difficult to estimate so trying to distribute the computation time manually is difficult.
