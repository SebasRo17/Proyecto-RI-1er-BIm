I have been programming for 6 years and I am in high school (I prefer not to disclose my age). I have dabbled in many different languages. Just to list a few: Java, PHP, C++, Python, Autohotkey, Mathematica and many more. I have a very good understanding of the basics of general programming. The only problem is I _still_ create bugs all the time. I think too often. Do you have any hints _besides continuing_ to program that will help me become a better programmer and make less errors?
