First I make `Times` orderless:               ClearAttributes[Times, Orderless];      Then I evaluate               Expand[(x (y - z)]      which produces > x y + x (-1) z But when I evaluate               Distribute[x (y - z)]      I get > x y - x z This last is what I expected from both cases. My question is: Why does this happen? My interest is both academic and practical, since I would like to use things like ExpandAll later on my code.
