Question: Is it possible to create a tubular 3D image like Extruding along a path using "Tube" function in mathematica for following images? Image (1) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nEiPq.png) Image (2) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/70QiT.png) Thanks * * * I have been playing with previous answers: 1) Extruding along a path 2) Trying to extrude a 3D image from a binary 2D image 3) How to convert a 2D image into a 3D graphics? I want to generate image like first one. Here I tried RegionPlot3D: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/o26DL.png) I want to map the image to 3D tube which has image cross section.
