We have too many technologies in IT world today. How can be best be able to clear technical funda conceptually ? How do we able to find all the concept available within technology & required to be learnt ? Programming Experince always matters, but I want to know the ideas keeping experince aside. I mean like if I start developing a project on my own hand, how do I be able to find out about which latest technology & concepts tha I should use with ? Please suggest.
