Given the increasing amount of data generated through different web services ( social network, etc), there are must be more and more programmers who are familiar with machine learning and/or statistics needed to write programs to deal with those data. I wonder if any one working in related jobs could briefly describe what are the possible daily activities. Is it more like a traditional software engineering or is it more like working as a statistician? I am personally interested in machine learning and programming. If I want to work in jobs like this, should I spend more time learning statistics or more time in the traditional software engineering side?
