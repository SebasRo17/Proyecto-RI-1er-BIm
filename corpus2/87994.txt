I want to improve my programming skills by studying famous open source projects, but I find it is easy to get lost by just jumping into their source code. So I decided to read their documentation about their design or architecture (such as UML diagrams) to get a general idea about their code's organization first. To my surprise, however, I can't find any architectural documentation for large open source projects such as Hibernate, Spring, ASP.NET MVC, Rails, etc. So I've started to wonder: How can an open source project can be successful if new-comer developers have no architectural/design documentation to read, or if the project manager just opened the source code but closed its documentation?
