With _Mathematica_ 10 came the closing dialog notebook, which probably most of you deactivated. (You can bring it back by dechecking "Always exit after closing last window" in Edit->Preferences->Interface.) I just kept it, because my _Mathematica_ installation gets non-responsive (often accompanied by the pop up of the "Progress" window) in several situations including start up. However, the default closing dialog ![defaultClosingDialog](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bUNpL.png)   isn't very functional. Therefore I'd like to customize it to get, e.g. something like: ![customClosingDialog_Explained](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BLc0s.png)   Where the "Quit" button is replaced by a "Quit Kernel" button that just quits the kernel, as there is no advantage to use the default "Quit" instead of the close window X. Furthermore I'd like to extend the closing dialog by adding additional buttons, e.g. a "Evaluate Specified Notebook" button that will evaluate a notebook file, whose path is defined in some .txt file. The only way to read the default _MathematicaClosingDialog.nb_ into Mma I found is               nb = Import[FileNameJoin[{$InstallationDirectory, "SystemFiles", "FrontEnd",                  "TextResources", "MathematicaClosingDialog.nb"}]]      The output of this import looks like a mess, though. In summary:   1. How to replace the "Quit" button with a "Quit Kernel" button?    2. How to add additional buttons, like a "Evaluate Specified Notebook" button?   3. Can the directory for the _MathematicaClosingDialog.nb_ be changed?   (I couldn't find it in the "Option Inspector".)
