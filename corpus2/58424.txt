I am new to _Mathematica_ and I just tried to play around with some integrals. But the sum rule in integration doesn't work. Here a simple example: Mathematica doesn't recognize that $\int_0^h (1-f(x)) \, dx$ and $h-\int_0^h f(x) \, dx$ are the same. With               Reduce[Integrate[1 - f[x], {x, 0, h}] == h - Integrate[f[x], {x, 0, h}]]       I just get the output of > Reduce::nsmet: This system cannot be solved with the methods available to > Reduce. >> Is that normal? If not, where is the error?
