I'm experimenting with a new platform and I'm trying to write a program that deals with strings that are no longer than 60 characters and I'd like to populate the data store with some famous or well-known small chunks of code and equations, since programming and math goes along with the theme of my software. The code can be in any language and the equations from any discipline of mathematics, just so long as they're less than a total of 60 characters in length. I suspect people are gonna break out some brainfuck for this one. For example,               #include<stdio.h>     int main(){printf ("Hi World\n");return 0;}      60 characters exactly! Thanks so much for your wisdom!
