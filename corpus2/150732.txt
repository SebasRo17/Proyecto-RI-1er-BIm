We are a group of people playing floorball together on a regular basis. Every session starts with the daunting task of dividing teams... So what would be better than an application to pick teams automatically? So, given a history of team-combinations and results, and a list of people showing up for this particular session, what would be a good strategy to find the optimal teams? By optimal, I mean teams as equal as possible. Any ideas? Edit: To make it clear, the data that I have to base the picking on, would be something like this:               [{ team1: ["playerA", "playerB", "playerC"],        team2: ["playerD", "playerE", "playerF"],        goals_team1: 10,        goals_team2:  8       },      { team1: ["playerD", "playerB", "playerC"],        team2: ["playerA", "playerE", "playerG"],        goals_team1:  2,        goals_team2:  5      },      { team1: ["playerD", "playerB", "playerF"],        team2: ["playerA", "playerE", "playerC"],        goals_team1:  4,        goals_team2:  2      }]
