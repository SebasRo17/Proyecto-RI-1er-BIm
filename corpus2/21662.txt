For the purpose of this minimal example, let's say we have a list of functions, like this:               f[y_?NumericQ] := {NIntegrate[z*y, {z, 0, 1}], a y}      I want to integrate an expression involving `f`, say               NDSolve[{y'[t] == f[y[t]][[1]], y[0] == 1}, y[t], {t, 0, 5}]      Now, the problem is that this doesn't return the expected result, because `f[y[t]][[1]]` evaluates to `y[t]` inside the `NDSolve`. How can this be done correctly?
