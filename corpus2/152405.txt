At the moment I am working on a Groovy/Grails project (which I'm quite new in) and I wonder whether it is good practice to omit the `return` keyword in Groovy methods. As far as I know you have to explicitly insert the keyword i.e. for guard clauses, so should one use it also everywhere else? In my opinion the additional `return` keyword increases readability. Or is it something you just have to get used to? What is your experience with that topic? Some examples:               def foo(boolean bar) {         // Not consistent         if (bar) {             return positiveBar()         }         negativeBar()     }          def foo2() {         // Special Grails example         def entitiy = new Entity(foo: 'Foo', bar: 'Bar')         entity.save flush: true         // Looks strange to me this way         entity     }
