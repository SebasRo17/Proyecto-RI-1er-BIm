I am working on an opensource project on github. It has a subdirectory /Vendor in which it has a **copy** of several external libraries. Original maintainer of the project updated this directory with newer copy of external library once in a while. One developer send me a pull request with idea to replace this **copy** by **git submodule**. And I am considering whether it's good idea or now. Git submodule Pros:   * Submodules were specifically designed for similar scenarios   * It removes possibility of accidental commit to Vendor which will be overwritten while next update Git submodule Cons:   * It looks like git submodules pushes complexity from maintainer to a person who will clone/pull the project (additional steps required after you clone to start working with the project: "git submodule init", "git submodule update" What's your opinion on this? One more thing. This problem is reasonably small size library with very limited external dependencies. I think any build tool would be overkill for it for now.
