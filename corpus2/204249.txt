Assume that we are developing a web application, and Hudson does typical jobs such as compile, unit test and static code analysis. But the tricky part is: Hudson **deploys and starts up application server to do integration tests** , once the previous jobs done. That means some difficult things, such as database connection, 3rd part application connection, socket port listening, environment variables, server start up failure handing, etc. We have to set up and tear down these things correctly each time, itâ€™s hard thing. Worse, the integration tests can break the integration test easily. Do you think if integration test should be included in continues integration (CI)? Can it be manually? Or simplify integration test?
