I'm making a java app. Is to solve a problem in engineering. I'm thinking that it would be nice to sell it as an app in the google chrome market, but I'm worried about security. I've been trying to find any info on the subject, but to no avail. Does anybody have any thoughts on this? how secure is the google chrome market? I mean security in the sense that someone downloads your software and uses it -and distribuites it- without permission. I would appreciate any kind of info, be it links to books or personal experiences, whatever. Thanks!
