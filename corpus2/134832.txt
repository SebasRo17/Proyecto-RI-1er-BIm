I'm a programmer. I have always worked by myself. I usually do only back-end, but now I have a webproject that I want to hand the "View" part to a designer to make it beautiful. What I'm looking for are suggestions, best practices, recommended literature to make it easy and separate (easy to merge) for both parts. I googled a lot, so what I want is your personal opinion, experience on this subject. 1 - The back-end will be Java. 2 - Besides the back-end I haven't chosen (opinions ???) on what is best (JSF, only HTML (REST)) for the frontend Any help and insight is greatly appreciated Thanks in advance
