I'm developing a new extension for an ecommerce platform, that basically builds Customer Equity and Lifetime Value. Already got that. But I'm having some problems trying to figure out a formula to rate an ecommerce customer. I'm not looking for code, but rather for a formula. I'm pretty sure I already have all vars needed, like customer sales, average sales, profit, first order, last order, marketing spent on a specific customer, discounts spent on a specific customers, shipping costs, payment costs,number of returns he made, etc. What I'm missing is a formula to rank each customer. The basic Idea is that someone from customer support will see in customer's dashboard a summary and the customer rating. Like from 1-10 So he can have a better knowledge on how to deal with it. If it's a valuable customer or someone that gives the company a very low profit and is always returning things and stuff like that. My intention here is not to discuss the way we should treat customers. My first thoughts we something like: Get current profit, add project profit, check lifespan point...
