My company is developing a .NET application that needs to work with 17 inch and 24 inch monitors using the same resolution on both. My question is whether I should expect any different behavior or layout on the two screen sizes. Theoretically since it is the same resolution there should be no clipping, overstretching or any other UI issue. Although maybe WPF does behave differently with different DPI? Now obviously it will be more difficult to read some of the text on the 17 screen monitor, and maybe some low-quality portions of images be more visible on a larger screen, but should I expect any other surprises?
