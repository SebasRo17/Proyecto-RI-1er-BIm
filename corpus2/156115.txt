I have to design a website which will have drag and drop features for creating an e-card. So you select items from a tool box and drag and drop this item on the card area. Once you have completed the design you can publish the e-card on the web by clicking "Save and publish" button. What are the possible technologies for implementing this feature? The requirement is that the application should not degrade the performance of the website, and should not take much time in publishing once the user click "Save and publish" button.
