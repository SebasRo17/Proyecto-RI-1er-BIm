I am trying to solve a (Sequence) Quadratic Programming (SQP) problem in _Mathematica_. Here’s the problem setup:               size = 9; (* for illustrative purposes, can be larger *)     (* known coefficients *)     m1 = {{a, b, c, d}, {e, f, g, h}, {i, j, k, l}};     m2 = {{m, 0, 0, 0}, {0, n, 0, 0}, {0, 0, o, 0}};     (* unknowns *)     θ = Table[{Subscript[x, i], Subscript[y, i], Subscript[z, i], 1}, {i, size}];          (* My system of quadratic equations *)     data == Transpose [m1.Transpose[θ] + m2.Transpose[θ^2]];          (*Subject to the following constraints *)     constraints =        Table[{Subscript[x, i]^2 + Subscript[y, i]^2 + Subscript[z, i]^2 == 1}, {i, size}];      Sample data:               data =         {{0.0326857, -0.23977, -0.980886}, {-0.00491715, 0.160488, -0.980237},        {-0.0189063, 0.137756, 0.969873}, {-0.0165821, -0.256267, 0.967219},         {-0.00898421, -1.00759, -0.258025}, {-0.0131764, 0.918642, 0.192466},         {-0.00673595, 0.0658302, -0.996648}, {0.00647973, -0.147268, -0.997363},         {-0.0200075, -0.164866, 0.981011}, {-0.0242359,0.0523168, 0.981269},         {-0.0132569, -1.03757, -0.0196142}, {-0.0164502, 0.94126, -0.0110496},         {-1.01661, -0.0493139, -0.0169287}, {-0.0250339, -0.0569752, 0.988069},         {0.981252, -0.048789, -0.00833748}, {-0.00965323,-0.0403172, -1.00421}};          m1 =        {{0.851943, 0, 0, 0.0154734}, {0.500424, 1.01131, 0, 0.0564313},         {-0.164399, 0.00390119, 1.00309, 0.00583693}};          m2 = {{0.00912, 0, 0, 0}, {0, -0.00320, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0.00175, 0}};
