This barchart was tricky to style, and I had to resort to the legacy `BarCharts``package. Any ideas how to omit the labels from the bottom edge? Ideally I'd also like separator ticks between the column pairs.               data = {{-2.8, -5.8, -7.4, -9.2}, {-3.7, -6.8, -8.9, -11.8}};          colour1 = RGBColor[82/255, 85/255, 255/255];     colour2 = RGBColor[132/255, 178/255, 255/255];          Quiet[Needs["BarCharts`"]]          BarChart[data, Frame -> True, AxesOrigin -> {0, 0},       PlotRange -> {{0.525, 4.825}, {-14, 0}},      BarLabels -> {"March", "June", "September", "December"},      BarGroupSpacing -> 0.3, BarSpacing -> 0,       BarStyle -> {colour1, colour2},      BaseStyle -> {10, FontFamily -> "Verdana"}, AspectRatio -> 0.4,       ImageSize -> 350]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/32bOZ.png)
