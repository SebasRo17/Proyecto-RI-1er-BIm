I watched a Google Tech Talk presentation on Unit Testing, given by Misko Hevery, and he said to avoid using the `new` keyword in business logic code. I wrote a program, and I did end up using the `new` keyword here and there, but they were mostly for instantiating objects that hold data (ie, they didn't have any functions or methods). I'm wondering, did I do something wrong when I used the new keyword for my program. And where can we break that 'rule'?
