How do I get my webpage not to go back when they hit the back button and are logged out ? how can I add a web page to be blocked like FACEBOOK doesn't let you get into their site with out having a page or a account with them, and if you try to put something in the url and try to go to something on their site it gives you a web page that says "you have to be logged in first" ? I mean I don't want someone going to the url of the "index" page before they have signed up as a member they need to make an account first then they can have access to the "index" page. How do I do this gateway? Consider I have a website so far that has a database and the website has 5 pages so far and two of them which is the login and sign up page which are both used with php and mysql and they work fine. How do I restrict access to the main website by first having the users sign up with me for an account?
