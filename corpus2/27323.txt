I can't guess the perfect title of this question, so please read my case and please help me. We have 4 different products. Each is having their own site and database, means they are totally independent. Now I want a common system that can manage "contact us" page inquiries. Moreover I can pull out the contact inquires from each database. And even I should be able to send bulk mail to all of them. etc etc. So what kind of application is this? Is there any software available? If yes then which are those? Or do I need to create a new custom application? Please advise..
