I'm learning Lisp, and I've just gotten to `let`, which I don't quite understand (the implementation of). A common definition for it is given in terms of `lambda` as a macro. However, nowhere have I seen that `let` **must** be implemented as a macro or in terms of `lambda`. Is it possible to define `let` without using a macro or `lambda`? I know it can be implemented as a primitive, but I want to know whether it can be implemented **in Lisp** without creating a macro -- by creating a special form or a function.
