I have two data sets. One is an experimental recording of an absorption spectrum, composed of regularly spaced (wavenumber, intensity) coordinates with a fine wavenumber resolution, thus making superposed Voigt peaks. The second one is computation that gives coordinates (wavenumber, intensity) for the maximum of each peak. I want to obtain a function that would   * Take X,Y coordinates of my simulated dataset   * Generate a Voigt profile (mean X from dataset, integration Y from dataset, fixed Sigma, fixed Gamma)   * Repeat for the whole experimental dataset (~150 points displayed as green bars)   * Plot the sum of all these Voigt functions The Voigt profile is not a requirement, I can work with a Gaussian to begin with. So there would only be 3 parameters, 2 from the dataset and Sigma. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/X1pBE.png) This graph was made in Origin, but I'm using _Mathematica_ 9.
