I have the following lines of code in my application:               return "Service is alive since: " + TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.toMinutes(mxBean.getUptime()) + " minutes";      It uses the following package:               import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;      My application is a web application. Does it means that I have something wrong logically if I use something from concurrent package at a web application?
