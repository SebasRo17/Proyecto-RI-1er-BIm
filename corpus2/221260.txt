While reading the difference between Compiler and interpreter , I found the following differences fromt he internet. Advantages of using compiler:   * Since compiler converts the program to native code of the target machine (object code), faster performance can be expected.   * There is a scope for code optimisation.  Advantages of using interpreter:   * Process of execution can be done in a single stage. There is no need of a compilation stage.   * Alteration of codes possible during runtime.   * Really useful for debugging the codes (because source code execution can be analyzed in an IDE)   * Facilitates interactive code development. In case of interpreter, stated as interpreter "there is a possibility of alter the code" and In case of compiler "code optimization will be there" Can anyone explain these 2 points ?
