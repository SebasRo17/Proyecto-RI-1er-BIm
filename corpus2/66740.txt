What language should I seek to learn if I would like to develop for Windows? Not command-line stuff (obviously, I guess) but with Windows Forms and such? I've used C before (when working with Rockbox), but that's it. Up until now, I've used Autoit (for basic, simple stuff), but I'm looking for something that has more flexibility and is popular inside of the PC software industry. Plus, I didn't like how easy it was to crack Autoit programs. I'm also a web developer/designer, just to throw that out there. Thanks in advance!
