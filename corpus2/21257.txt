I'm looking for a way to extract a list of variables from an expression, for example with an input like:               Leff= (mc dm^2 + mc/12*(h^2 + 3 R^2) + ma da^2 + ma/12 La^2)/(mc dm + ma da)      I want this output:               {mc, dm, ma, da, La, h, R}.      The built-in _Mathematica_ function `Variables` can do this but doesn't work with more complex expressions containing trascendental functions. Any help would be very appreciated.
