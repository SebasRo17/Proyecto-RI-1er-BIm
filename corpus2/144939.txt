We are building a Windows Mobile based application to interface with a customer's existing web application. We are reading and writing data to the customer's SQL server 2008 database. The customer wants all reads to happen through SQL views, and all writes to happen through stored procedures. But taking a look at their database schema, they have a view of each and every table. And they have a view of each and every query that would be used to read data, instead of using the existing views on their tables. They have 348 tables and 655 views so far. They want us to model our mobile application in a similar fashion i.e. create additional views for all queries that we use to retrieve data. I know this is poor design, but I am unable to list out to the customer why their view based strategy is a poor design. What is the consensus in the community on when to use views? How does having so many views affect performance of the SQL server?
