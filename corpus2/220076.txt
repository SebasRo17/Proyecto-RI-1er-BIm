I have to implement a method to save my game in such a way that I can change the storage medium with the change of only a single variable. Ideally I'd use an interface to designate the required method signatures and implement that interface with a different concrete class for each medium. For example, one for database, one for xml, possibly one for serialized objects. How exactly I initiate the save function? For example, if I have a Class of type Persistence called PersistToXML, which is instantiated to some variable somewhere upon launching the game, how best should I implement it so that I can save my relevant objects as needed? I'm hesitant to use a Singleton due to all the bad reviews I read about it, and I don't really want to have to pass this object around to every class just in case I need to save something.
