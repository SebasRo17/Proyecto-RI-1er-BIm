Hi there, mathematicians. I'm not very good at coding plots in _Mathematica_ , so I was hoping that one of you could help me solve a problem I'm having. I have the following matrix plot:               Z = {Subscript[x, 0], Subscript[x, 1], Subscript[x, 2]}     X = {{0, 8, 12}, {.1, 0, 0}, {0, .2, 0}}      Then I put it in a function as follows:               P[x_] := X^x.Z      I would like _Mathematica_ to display plots such that, whenever x iterates from 1 to 10 in the function, the x1, x2, and x3 from the matrix are respectively plotted in three plots. Can anyone help me? * * * **EDIT: Trying to be more clear** I have the matrix (mat) and the vector (v):               mat = {{0, 8, 12}, {.1, 0, 0}, {0, .2, 0}}     v = {x0, x1, x2}      Then later I define the function for population development, `pD`, taking `t` (for time in days) as its only parameter.               pD[t] = mat^t.v      Now I would like to show the development of the variables $x_1$,$x_2$, and $x_3$ assuming the values 30, 60, 30, respectively. I would do so by making plots of the three functions over the range 1 to 10 days. For each the first plot should display the values of $\{t,pD[t_{x_1}]\}$, the second the values of $\{t,pD[t_{x_2}]\}$, and the third the values of $\{t,pD[t_{x_3}]\}$. I hope this clarifies my question. Sorry for being so unconventional in the first place. However, having worked my eyes blind for quite some time, I presumed that it was anything but difficult to understand. Thanks for your patience! * * * Best regards, Brinck10
