My question is rather simple. I want to put a title into a table. For example, consider a list with depth two and a title               list = Range[4] & /@ Range[4];     title = "Bravo";      And I want to create a table from `list`, i.e.,               TableForm[list]      This will generate a table without a title. Let's say I want to make a title "Bravo" on top of the table(which is center-aligned). Can you suggest a neat way to achieve it? I looked up the possible options for `TableForm`, but I could not find a relevant one.
