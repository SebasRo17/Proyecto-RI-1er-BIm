Let me explain my need: I'm having a networked environment with 3 computers connected to a server which will be running full-time. The server also runs a FTP server. I would like to create an environment where 3 developers will be able to work on the same project. For example, if I'm creating a CRM app, I would like to split the project into modules so that each one will be working on each module like Developer A will be working on authentication, Developer B will be working on saving/retrieving data and Developer C will be working on User Interface programming. If I use Revision Control, can anyone please guide how to set it up ? Can the development of the entire app run **simultaneously** since each of the developers will be working on different areas ? How can I create such type of **multi-developer** iOS environment ?
