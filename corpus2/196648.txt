I work in a team that keeps growing. However, there are no code reviews and I see this as a problem every day. There are people with really limited skills committing code to our repository that I believe should not commit. I'm not the team leader nor am I in a management position. I already proposed code reviews about 6 months ago and there was no feedback received. Nor were there any code reviews. I know code reviews would benefit everyone including the more experienced. Has anyone had any experience trying to integrate code reviews in a team? What did you propose and how did you do it?
