This is a follow-up question from Sum of Multinomial Coefficients I have thought about the meaning of the formula I mentioned and, with help, I implemented the following code:               supp[vec_] := Module[{support = {}, i},       Do[If[vec[[i]] != 0, AppendTo[support, i]], {i, 1, Length[vec]}];       support     ];          calctrafo[n_, func_] := Module[{vecs, trafo = 0, i},       vecs = Tuples[Range[0, (n - 1)], n];       vecs = Select[vecs, Total[#] == (n - 1) &];       Do[trafo += (Multinomial @@ vecs[[i]])*func[supp[vecs[[i]]]], {i, 1, Length[vecs]}];       trafo     ];          calctrafo[7, func]      The function `supp` gives me the support of the lists and `func` is a arbitrary function. This code works well for me, but I need the code to work for large `n`, `n >= 100`. The problem lies in the function `Tuples`, which crashes for `n > 6`. Is there a way to make this work for large `n`?
