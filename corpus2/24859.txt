This is a question about manipulating sound (wav files). The goal is to produce something that sounds like a number station broadcast, see e.g., 4:00 in http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdnoAJ7KoFE It is easy to generate a random string of numbers, and send it to the linux program `espeak` (with `-v de` for German and `-w out.wav` for saving the sound as a wav file.) Now, the resulting voice is too clean to sound like a radio recording, so the challenge is to distort the sound a bit and make it sound more like a strange radio recording. Adding a little echo and some white noise maybe?
