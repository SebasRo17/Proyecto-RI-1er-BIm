Has anyone started a project to do IOC at compile time (possibly using Roslyn or Linq MethodInfo emit)? My experience with IOC containers has thus far been great, baring a few small issues   1. Many IOC containers are slow to start up, as much of the resolution logic occurs here   2. It is often hard to ensure that resolution is possible, as compilation no longer ensures that the constructor can be called   3. Often IOC containers add a small overhead to the runtime (some aren't even small, often the ones that start up quickly run slowly) It seems to me that the ideal solution would be to add a compile step to the build chain that adds a Factory class instead of IOC. Has anyone done this before? If not, why not?
