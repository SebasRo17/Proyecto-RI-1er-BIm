I have some confusion understanding the OpenUp/Basic process. It is described as an iterative process consisting of four phases:   * Inception,   * Elaboration,   * Construction, and   * Transition.  I am not clear if a single iteration consists of all these phases or if we make several iterations within a single phase and then move to next phase. In the later case, it seems to be impractical but in former case feasibility of project can not be identified. Is there anyone who has experience implmenting it in the organisation?
