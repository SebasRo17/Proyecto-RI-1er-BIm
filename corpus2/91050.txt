I want to automatically generate documentation for a java project, but I'd like to have my own custom styling for it. As an example, take the stackoverflow api (method description page), can that be done by an automated tool? Can it "take me close" to that?   I wouldn't mind having to manually change a few things to achieve the result I want (ie: it doesn't have to be 100% automated)
