I have a Java class that handles import and export of data. It started out as a simple               private void export() {     }     private void import() {     }      Of course, I wrote the export first, committed it, and then went on to write the import. But import is a keyword in Java - I can't use that as a function name. So I go back and rename both methods. I usually end up with               private void doExport() {     }     private void doImport() {     }      which is both ugly and feels contrived. What do you think of these names? Got any better suggestions? Note: I'm asking now, because it's now happened thrice and that keyword is getting quite annoying.
