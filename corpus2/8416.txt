If you run this code you will see that `DatePlus` and `DateList` are inconsistent in the format of the lowest order element of the date list.               DatePlus[DateList["2012-1-1" ], {5, "Month"}] === DateList["2012-6-1"]     DatePlus[DateList["2012-1-1" ], {5, "Month"}] == DateList["2012-6-1"]     DateList[DatePlus[DateList["2012-1-1" ], {5, "Month"}]] === DateList["2012-6-1"]     DatePlus[DateList["2012-1-1" ], {5, "Month"}] // FullForm     DateList["2012-6-1"] // FullForm     DateList[DatePlus[DateList["2012-1-1" ], {5, "Month"}] ] // FullForm      This leads to issues when you try to locate elements in a list as follows:               Position[{DatePlus[DateList["2012-1-1" ], {5, "Month"}]}, DateList["2012-6-1"]]     Position[{DateList[DatePlus[DateList["2012-1-1" ], {5, "Month"}]]}, DateList["2012-6-1"]]      What is even more annoying is that I have found that wrapping a date generated by `DatePlus` in `DateList` doesn't always fix the problem and I can not tell what circumstances are required to make it work and not work. Any insight would be appreciated. I may try to open a case with Wolfram, but my past experiences with their support team have been an unsatisfactory use of my time.
