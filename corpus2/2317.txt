Suppose one has two functions, $y(x)$ and $z(x)$, and one seeks to obtain $y(z)$ by substituting $x(z)$ into $y(x)$. Can this be done in a single step? Or must $z(x)$ first be inverted independently? For the sake of illustration, suppose the functions consist of transcendental functions combined by the elementary operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. For instance, $y(x) = a\ln x + \displaystyle\frac{\exp(bx)}{c+x}$ $z(x) = \ln x \cdot \left(1 - \cos x \exp(a^2x) \right)^{r}$
