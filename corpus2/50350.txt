A few friends and i are planning to work on a project together and we want a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT coding standard. We do NOT want to use the coding standard the libraries/language uses. Its our project and we want to mess around. So i came here to ask what you guys think are good standards and arguments for it (or what not to do and arguments against it). The styles i remember most are   * Upper casing the entire word   * Camel and Pascal casing   * Using '_' to separate each word   * pre or postfixing letters or words (i hate m for member but i think IsCond() is a good func name. SomethingException as a postfix example)   * Using '_' at the start or end of words   * Brace placement. On a new or same line?  I know of libs that use Pascal casing on all public and protected members. But would you ever get confused if something is a func, var or even property if the lang supports it? What about if you decide a public member to be private (or vice versa) wouldnt that great a lot of fix up work or inconsistencies? Is prefixing C to every class a good idea? I ask what do you think and why?
