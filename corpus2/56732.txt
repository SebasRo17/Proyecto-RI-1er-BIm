How do I read in an obj file as a `MeshRegion` so I can e.g. compute its area? If I just import the object and try `Area[O]` it tells me it is not a correctly specified region, even for e.g. the StanfordBunny. Also, how do I turn `Geometry3D` into a `MeshRegion`? For example `Area[ExampleData[{"Geometry3D", "SpaceShuttle"}]]` does not work either. It seems that geometry has more than one representation in different parts of _Mathematica_ \- bad.
