I am writing my code documentation and need to list all the _Mathematica_ built in functions I have used - explicitly written functions only. Is there a way to extract a list of all built in functions that I have used in my code? For example               Insert[{a, b, c}, x, 3]     a=1     Style["this text",Bold]     Range[1,20]     b=3     a*b      I would require a list containing `Insert`, `Style` and `Range`.
