All, the following code graphs 10 different solutions for a first order ODE and allows the user to modify certain equation parameters to see how the graph is affected:               Manipulate[     (*Find 10 different solutions for the ODE*)     eqn = {a y''[t] == b y[t] + d, y'[0] == c};     sol = DSolve[eqn, {y[t]}, {t}];     func[t_] = y[t] /. sol[[1]];     t[x_] = Table[func[t] /. C[1] -> j, {j, 1, 10}];          (*Display graph*)     Plot[Evaluate[t[x]], {t, -tmax, tmax}],           (*Variables to parameterize*)     {a, 1, 5, 1}, {b, -1, 1, 1}, {c, -10, 10, 1},      {d, 0, 100, 10}, {tmax, 1, 10, 1},          (*Aesthetic labeling stuff*)     Delimiter,     Dynamic[Style[Row[{"Input: ", a , " y''(t) = ",      b, " y(t) + ", d, ", y'(0) = ", c}], 12]],     Delimiter,     Dynamic[Style[Row[{"Output: ", func[t]}], 12]],          (*Misc. Manipulate stuff*)     ContinuousAction -> True, SaveDefinitions -> True,      TrackedSymbols :> {a, b, c, tmax, d}]      The problem that arises is the equation that is displayed after the "Output:" label. If you are patient enough, and move around the sliders (I have been varying parameter d), you will occasionally see the equation display as something like: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2S0nx.png) When it should be: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/CiBs6.png) There are also some funky little things I have noticed like the slider "dragger" in picture 1 is still highlighted even after I release it. Are there any glaring things that I am doing incorrectly that could be causing these symptoms? Is there anyone else that can reproduce the problem? One other thing - I cannot make this problem happen if I use the stepper controls instead of using my mouse to change the value of the slider.
