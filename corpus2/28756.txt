_Do not be confused with comments, those are for previous version of the question_ - Kuba Imagine I have a matrix of the form:               MatrixForm[{{1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7, 8}, {9, 10, 11, 12}, {13, 14, 15, 16}}]      I would like to apply a transform that generates a matrix of the form:               MatrixForm[{{4, 8, 12, 16}, {3, 7, 11, 15}, {2, 6, 10, 14}, {1, 5, 9, 13}}]      What would be the appropriate terminology for this transformation? It looks a bit like a 90 degree counterclockwise rotation of the elements in the matrix. Is there a simple way to do it in _Mathematica_ with large matrices?
