I want to plot the PDF of binomial distributed function and a mixed binomial distributed function, therefore I entered for the binomial distribution function the following:               Remove["Global`*"];     m = 45; (*number of banks*)     n = 5;(*number of defaults*)     AssetV = 100;(*asset value at T*)     DebtV = 80;(*debt value at T*)     μ = 0.2;(*annual drift*)     σ = 0.3;(*annual volatility*)     T = 5;(*years*)     ρ = 0.8; (*asset correlation*)          (*calculation of the individual default probabiltiy p^*, which is \     determined based on the Merton model*)                P* = (CDF[            NormalDistribution[], -(Log[                 AssetV/DebtV] + (μ - 0.5*σ^2)*T)/(σ*Sqrt[               T])])     (*generating data table, which captures the probabilities that the \     number of defaults will be greater than n1, whereas n1 encompasses \     the range from 0 to m by the step of 1 (integer)*)          dataBD = Table[       Probability[x >= n1,         x \[Distributed] BinomialDistribution[m,  P*]], {n1, 0, m,         1}]      now I want to plot everything:               pdfBD = DiscretePlot[       PDF[BinomialDistribution[m, P*], n1], {n1, 0, m},        PlotRange -> All, AxesLabel -> {"# of Defaults", "PD"},        Joined -> True, ImageSize -> 500]      so I get this plot ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dxe9p.jpg) now I want to consider the mixed binomial distribution, determiend by the following code:               dataMBD =       Table[1 -         CDF[NormalDistribution[], ((1/             Sqrt[ρ])*(((Sqrt[                1 - ρ])*(InverseCDF[                 NormalDistribution[], (n1/m)]) + (InverseCDF[                NormalDistribution[], (CDF[                  NormalDistribution[], -(Log[                       AssetV/DebtV] + (μ - 0.5*σ^2)*                       T)/(σ*Sqrt[T])])]))))], {n1, 0, m, 1}]      However, if I want to see its PDF and if I therefore enter this command it does not work:               DiscretePlot[PDF[dataMBD, n1], {n1, 0, m, 1}]      Is the error within the command above, or is there a fundamental problem based on wrong understanding? hope somebody can help me. thanks.
