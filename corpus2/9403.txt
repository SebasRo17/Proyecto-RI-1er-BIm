> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  How many monitors do you use? Why? How they are used? With inspiration from this question, I thought I'd ask my own concerning monitors. Some monitors you can turn 90 degrees so that it stands vertically positioned. I've also seen this setup be used in some offices. But which is better for programming? The way I see it, horizontally you can fit more documents side by side, but vertically you can view more code of the same document. Which setup do you prefer? How does this scale with multiple monitors?
