I watched this video and became interested in transforming an image. But I have no good idea on how to embed an image in the complex plane using _Mathematica_. I have a method that seems to work, but there has to be a better way to do this. Can somebody point me in the right direction?               a = Reverse[ImageData[ImageApplay[Mean,img]]]          f[c_] := Module[{re, im, d1, d2},        {d1, d2} = Dimensions[a];        re = Round[Re[d2 c]];        im = Round[Im[d1 c]];        If[1 <= re <= d2 && 1 <= im <= d1, a[[im, re]], 1]     ];          ListDensityPlot@Table[f[(y + x I)], {x, -1, 1.5, 0.02}, {y, -1, 1.5, 0.02}]
