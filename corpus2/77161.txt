I am reading "The Pragmatic Programmer" . The book has the following paragraph > Dave once worked on an international telex switch. Quite understandably, the > client demanded an exhaustive test specification and required that the > software pass all tests on each delivery. To ensure that the tests > accurately reflected the specification, the team generated them > programmatically from the document itself. When the client amended their > specification, the test suite changed automatically. Once the team convinced > the client that the procedure was sound, generating acceptance tests > typically took only a few seconds. I am curious to know how he created tests from specification . What format was the specification in ? How to write a program that will automatically read the specification and write test cases. Have I misunderstood the above paragraph ?
