I heard about the Supreme Court's decision today in the Microsoft vs. i4i case, so I read the relevant patent and was surprised it appears to just keep formatting codes in a separate table with pointers instead of leaving the formatting codes embedded in the text. I'm surprised no one else did that before 1998, thereby invalidating the patent, and that Microsoft couldn't uncover an example of such a system. I recall a micro-based word processor a friend and I were going to build in the 70's (never finished because the hardware never worked), and I definitely considered the tradeoff between keeping format stuff separate vs. embedded, so I would think someone in the subsequent 20 years (if not before) did likewise and actually wrote such a system. Didn't anyone implement formatting codes separate from the text before 1998?
