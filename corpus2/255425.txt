I'm trying to teach an object oriented design principles course (on SOLID) at a training institute. I also want to teach the students a few OOP design patterns such as factory, singleton and one other. I know there is no 1 to 1 match between SOLID principles and OOP Design patterns, but I want to introduce the students a pattern that is sort of inclusive of all the SOLID design principles at play. Any ideas? I'm really trying to fit in the observer pattern but want to keep it conforming with all the SOLID principles.
