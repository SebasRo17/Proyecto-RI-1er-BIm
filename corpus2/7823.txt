In the comment to this great post Roy Osherove pointed to the OAPT project that is designed to run each assert in a single test. This is written on projects home page: > **Proper unit tests should fail for exactly one reason,** thatâ€™s why you > should be using one assert per unit test. And also Roy wrote in comments: > My guideline is usually that you test one logical CONCEPT per test. you can > have multiple asserts on the same _object_. they will usually be the same > concept being tested. I think that there are some cases when multiple assertions are needed (e.g. Guard Assertion), but in general I try to avoid this. What is your opinion? Please provide a real word examples when multiple asserts are really _needed._
