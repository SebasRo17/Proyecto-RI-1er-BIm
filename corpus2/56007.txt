The first system immediately yields {}, but the second, equivalent, system yields the solution `{{k -> 4.96048, tl1 -> 1.64842, tl2 -> 2.07466}}` :               NSolve[{       (5 - k)(2940/100) == tl1^0.3,        (5 - k)(3150/100) == tl2^0.3,        4200 tl1^0.7 + 4500 tl2^0.7 == 1000000},        {k, tl1, tl2}]          NSolve[{       (5-k)(2940/100) == tl1^0.3,       (5-k)(3150/100) == tl2^0.3,        (5-k) 4200(2940/100)^(7/3) + (5-k) 4500 (3150/100)^(7/3) == 1000000},        {k, tl1, tl2}]      The second system is created by noting that `tl1^0.7 = (tl1^0.3)^(7/3)` and `tl2^0.7 = (tl2^0.3)^(7/3)` and substituting the results into the third equation. Is there a way to get _Mathematica_ to do such substitutions on its own?
