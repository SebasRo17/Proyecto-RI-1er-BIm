Please keep in mind this is not another 'How much [ _insert programming language here_ ] should I know before moving onto [ _insert framework here_ ]?' What I'd like to know is how beneficial is it to learn the those advanced concepts of a programming language when your intention is to heavily rely on its framework the majority of the time. So for example I've began to use jQuery and first took the time out to really grasp the core concepts of Javascript. Additionally I have a few _beyond the basics_ books (Secrets of a Javascript Ninja for instance) on the shelf that really delve into the language. As I skim through the pages though I find that a fair bit of it doesn't carry over to jQuery being that my main intention is DOM manipulation. The same can be said for Ruby and RoR. Will these books make me a better programmer overall? Probably. Can these topics help me become that much better with its framework? That's what I'm having a hard time understanding.
