Having   * a minimum   * a maximum   * number of ranges   * a value between minimum and maximum I'm trying to come up with a method, or two, which would calculate which range the provided value belongs to. For min=1, max = 10, number of ranges=5 the ranges would be [1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8],[9-10] The other method would behave like shown below:   * method(1)->[1-2]   * method(2)->[1-2]   * method(3)->[3-4]   * method(4)->[3-4]   * method(5)->[5-6]   * method(6)->[5-6]   * method(7)->[7-8]   * method(8)->[7-8]   * method(9)->[9-10]   * method(10)->[9-10] This would be used for generating a legend for a map where the size of the marker depends on the range a value belongs to. I wonder if there is a nice algorithmic solution for this. The numbers I work with are integers. Edit: Another example: For min=1, max = 3, number of ranges=2 the ranges would be a) [1-2],[3-3] or b) [1-1],[2-3] The other method would behave like shown below: a)   * method(1)->[1-2]   * method(2)->[1-2]   * method(3)->[3-3] or b)   * method(1)->[1-1]   * method(2)->[2-3]   * method(3)->[2-3] I don't have a preference for a) or b).
