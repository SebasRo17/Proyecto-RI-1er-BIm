In the Java world, we often talk about the JVM, and when Java was new it had the supposedly killer feature of "Write Once, Run Anywhere." From the way people talk and write, this seems different from the way that Python, for example, works. Yet I've not been aware of any way that Python code that I've written would work differently on another machine. (Though I haven't written that much Python.) So what am I missing? How is the JVM different from a Python interpreter? Is there a way that Python lacks Java's platform independence? Or is this just a cultural difference?
