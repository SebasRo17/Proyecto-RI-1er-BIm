I have a function that outputs a Manipulate (say                FAnimated[params_]:= Manipulate[F[params,t], {Time, Animator[t]}]      where `F` is some function that takes `params` and `t` and makes a plot. Suppose I make some sliders that control various of the params:               Slider[Dynamic[p1], {3, 7}]      and call               Dynamic[FAnimated[{p1,p2,etc}]].      The hope is that the sliders should let me vary parameters in my plots while they run their animation. In Mathematica 7, this works great, and runs very smoothly. In Mathematica 8, the exact same code no longer lets me drag the sliders while the animation is running, and also doesn't let me drag the sliders smoothly even when the animation is paused! So the question is, "What changes (either in `Dynamic` functionality or in some options that might possibly be set different by default) might cause this code to break?"
