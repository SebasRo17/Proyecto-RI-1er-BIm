Our company has a private GitHub repository for the project I'm working on. After a full summer of work, it looks like we'll be launching this week (wheee!). However, I want to include a "submit a bug" link in the program that leads to a form somewhere where the user can fill out a form that becomes an issue for us on GitHub. Googling around hasn't found any solution (or someone who has the same problem). Is this possible (through some API, perhaps?) or will I have to manually enter the bugs my users report?
