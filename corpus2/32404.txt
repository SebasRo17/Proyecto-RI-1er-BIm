I am very new to _Mathematica_. I have code written using for loops. I want to rewrite it using `Map`/`Thread` but I am not sure how to do it. My code takes the set `A`, say               A = {{1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3}, {1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3}}      Then it insert a arbitrary character(say $a$) to every possible positions of given element in the set `A`. So we get > >     {{a, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3}, {1, a, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3}, ..., >      {a, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3}, ..., {1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, a}} >   Then it inserts the same character again into resulting elements in following manner > >     {{a, a, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3}, {a, 1, a, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3}, >      {a, 1, 2, a, 3, 1, 2, 3}, ...., {1, 1 , 2, 2, 3, 3, a}} >   This question come from Knot Theory-Chord Diagram My program using for loops is follows.               A = {{1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3}, {1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3}};     kk = Length[A[[1]]]/2 + 1;          B = {};          For[m = 1, m < Length[A] + 1, m++,       Diag1 = A[[m]];       For[j = 1, j < (2*kk), j++,         Diag2 = Insert[Diag1, "a", j];          For[i = 1 + j, i < (2*kk) + 1, i++,           Diag3 = Insert[Diag2, "a", i];           B = AppendTo[B, Diag3];         ];       ];     ];      This is what I tried to do with element 2.               f[x_] := Insert[A[[2]], "a", x];     B = Map[f, Range[7]]];      But I don't know how to put variable `A[[i]]` instead of `A[[2]]` and also how to insert other end of $a$ to this result using map. Any comment really appreciated.
