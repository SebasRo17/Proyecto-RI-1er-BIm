I'm new to Mathematica 9, and I assume there must be an easy fix for my problem, but I have not been able to find any yet. Essentially, I want the default color for the text of all of my titles, subtitles, sections, etc., to be colored in black and not have alternate colors (red, gray, etc.). I figured out a short fix (is it really a fix?) by trying to edit a stylesheet, but now when I make an item underneath a title or section the bullet is a different color than black. I can make the text black, but the symbols that indicate an item of some sort is always a color different than black, and the colors for the symbols changed based on how nested the itemizing list is. Basically, I want everything (titles and so forth) to be in black. Text. Bullets. Titles. Etc. How can I fix this and make the changes effective for any new notebooks I create? UPDATE: The following link seems to address what I wanted: How to use version 8 default.nb style sheet in place of version 9 default.nb Of course, this just uses the Mathematica 8 nb as the default (which I think looks much better and professional). For those very new to Mathematica 9, I found the above length to be extremely helpful.
