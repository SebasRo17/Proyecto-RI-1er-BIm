I'm planning to learn **Python**. I know html, javascript, vb .net, ado .net, ms sql, and a little c#. So I have a good working knowledge of programming and capable to write various desktop and web applications. Previously I learn those languages by reading books from page 1 to the end. Then build meaningful applications. Typically I will use Wrox beginning or Sam Unleashed books. And each of those books will exceed 900++ pages. I feel this way of learning a programming language is slow and tiresome. So, this time for learning python language, my intent is to do it another way. I plan not to read book from cover to cover, but just using a few online introduction to Python tutorials. I want to build meaningful applications straight away from minimal knowledge of python and struggle all the ways to the application completion. Of course, I will consult SO and other sites to solve my python problems. Is that way of learning python viable or I should stick with reading books from cover to cover before building any meaningful application? Meaningful applications here mean real world applications like ecommerce site, blog, image converter (desktop app), password manager (desktop app), Invoicing system (desktop app), and media player (desktop app). For your information, I have created those meaningful applications in vb .net.
