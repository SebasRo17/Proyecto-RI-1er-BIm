I am developing a graph-editor that uses drag and drop to build hierarchical graphs (containing nodes and links). Each node in the graph should be linked to a table in our database (SQL Server). I did a lot of research about libraries based on javascript or/and JSON specifications to draw nodes and links. There are a lot of great examples to follow, but I have no idea about the way I can link a graph to a database (SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL...). I thought about this architecture (Question posted on stackexchange.com) I have looked at the D3 library. It creates data-driven charts, but I think it only uses flat files, and not relational databases. First can you please tell me if my architecture is well thought out? And second can you give me some ideas about the way I can link my graphs to the DBMS? Thanks a lot.
