I'm trying to plot a function inside a `Manipulate` and draw a vertical line at some $x$ position. The scale of the plot can vary a lot depending on the `Manipulate` settings. Example:               h = 1;     Manipulate[      Plot[10^f*x^3, {x, -1, 1},        Epilog -> {Line[{{0.5, -h}, {0.5, h}}]}], {{f, 0}, -5, 5}]      Now the problem is to choose a good value for `h`: If it's too small, it's not as high as the plot. If it's too large, the line isn't drawn at all. (Sidenote: Don't try to make the line dashed or dotted. Apparently the dashing/dotting is done _before_ the clipping, so _Mathematica_ just freezes up if `f` gets too small.) Ideally, I'd just want to draw a line from $y=-\infty \ldots +\infty$. Is there a simple way to do that?
