Do people develop websites from scratch when there are no particular requirements or they just pick up an existing web framework like Drupal, Joomla, WordPress, etc. The requirements are almost similar in most cases; if personal, it will be a blog or image gallery; if corporate, it will be information pages that can be updated dynamically along with news section. And similarly, there are other requirements which can be fulfilled by WordPress, Joomla or Drupal. So, Is it advisable to develop a website from scratch and why ? **Update:** to explain more as got commentt from @Raynos (thanks for comment and helping me clearify the question), the question is about:   1. Should web sites be developed and designed fully from scratch?   2. Should they be done by using framework like Spring, Zend, CakePHP?   3. Should they be done using CMS like Joomla, WordPress, Drupal (people in east are using these as frameworks)?
