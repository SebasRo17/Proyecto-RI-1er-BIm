My _understanding_ of Akka is that it allows you to define groups of mini- threads (" **Actors** ") and then have them communicate with each other (and do work) using events. My _understanding_ of ZeroMQ is that its a TCP socket library that allows threads to communicate with each other over TCP/ports. My question: these seem like very similar concepts. However, I'm sure that in reality, they are meant to solve entirely different problems. So: **Intention-wise, what is the difference between these two tools?** What different problems do they solve? Are there clear/concrete use cases where one is preferable to the other?
