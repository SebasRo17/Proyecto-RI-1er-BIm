I would like to multiply an array by each element of another array, and am having a lot of trouble finding a built-in or automated method of doing. Here is an example of what I'd like to achieve:               a = 0.5;     b = 4.0;          mat = {{0, 1}, {a, b}};     Rmat = RandomInteger[10, {4, 4}]     m11 = mat[[1, 1]]*Rmat;     m12 = mat[[1, 2]]*Rmat;     m21 = mat[[2, 1]]*Rmat;     m22 = mat[[2, 2]]*Rmat;          fmat = ArrayFlatten[{{m11, m12}, {m21, m22}}]      As you can see, the first matrix `mat` is multiplied by each individual element of `Rmat`. I feel like this should be easy, but I'm not finding a built-in function that works? Thanks!
