I've uploaded an image showing a demonstration I'd like to create, but I definitely need help. There is a lot of talent on this list, so maybe someone can help me get started learning how to add graphics to a plot and animate them. What I'd like to create is a `Manipulate` demonstration that will animate the plot of `Exp[I θ] + b Exp[-I θ]`, where `b` is a real number between 0 and 1. As you can see in the attached figure, I want to draw two circles centered at the origin, one with radius 1, the second with radius `b`. I'd like the `Manipulate` to have a slider that will allow me to vary the value of `b` between 0 and 1. Next, I want to draw the vectors `Exp[I θ]` and the vector `b Exp[-I θ]`, as pictured in the sketch. Then I want to complete the parallelogram and draw the vector `Exp[I θ] + b Exp[-I θ]`. I also want a slider for `θ`that varies from 0 to 2 π, and when I move the slider, I want to see all of the vectors move, the parallelogram adjust, and the tip of the vector `Exp[I θ] + b Exp[-I θ]` trace out the dotted ellipse. I'd really appreciate it if someone could show me how to do this. ![Exp\[I Theta\] + b Exp\[-I Theta\]](http://i.stack.imgur.com/z5xpf.png) * * * This was overlooked in the initial answers:   **How do we add the curve`Exp[I θ] + b Exp[-I θ]` to the figure?**
