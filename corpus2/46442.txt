I have a ListPlot of 100 data points in the range of 0 and 1. Now I'm trying to find a way to overlay (four) rectangles onto the listplot in 0.25 steps horizontally. Essentially I just have BinLists and try to visualize the Bins on the ListPlot with rectangles. I drew a nice little picture with paint (since I can't draw it in mathematica yet :)) which hopefully makes it a little more clearer..I only drew three rectangles.. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XSqXE.png) It seems somehow complicated to me and I don't get it to work (except with paint ^^), can someone help me out?
