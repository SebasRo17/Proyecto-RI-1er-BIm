I want to extract the `Graphics` type when I hover my mouse over an object, but I failed to do so. Below is the code I am working on. Any suggestions are welcome               m = "E";     Graphics[{        Mouseover[ {Black, Disk[{-10, 0}]}, {m = "D"; Red, Disk[{-10, 0}]}],       Mouseover[ {Black, Rectangle[{10, 0}]}, {m = "R"; Red,          Rectangle[{10, 0}]}]       ,  Text[Dynamic[m], {0, 0}]       }]
