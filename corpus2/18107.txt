I'm looking for something along the lines of WebSequenceDiagram for other kinds of UML diagram types -- use cases and class diagrams in particular. For example, the service would accept plain text input such as:               user = Actor();     admin = Actor();     register = UseCase(user);     post = UseCase(user, admin);     post_poll = UseCase(user, admin).extend(post);      ...and get the corresponding image output, without having me worry about laying out the result.
