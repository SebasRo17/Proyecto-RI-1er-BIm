I have to sketch the direction field for the following differential equation: $$\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{-0.02 y +0.00002 xy}{0.08 x-0.001xy}$$ This is the code I used, which gives an incorrect plot:               StreamPlot[Normalize[{1, (y (-0.016 + 0.00008 x))/(x (0.12 - 0.006 y))}],          {x, -200, 200}, {y, -200, 200}, Axes -> True]      ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/R72Bi.png) The following picture shows what I need to get: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OlBj6.jpg)
