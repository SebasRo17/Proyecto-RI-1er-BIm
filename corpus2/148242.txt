I'm a Mac Applications Developer with an experience of 1 year and 8 months. I need to change the company. What type of questions should I expect in an interview? I've worked on 2 projects of which the second one is a very large and have been working on that for about more then a year till now. But, none of them are in the market yet. Both are desktop applications.   * How good should I prepare for the interview?   * On what things should I concentrate more ?   * This will be my first interview as an experienced. I haven't worked on iOS. Will that be a demerit ?   * Would that be a disadvantage having unreleased projects in my resume ?   * Should I think of including the other projects on which I haven't worked(but studied) into my resume, even after knowing that it is not a good thing to do ?
