I am trying to solve the following differential equation:               delta = -(1/r D[#, r] + D[#, {r, 2}] - # l^2/r^2) &;     DSolve[delta[         g[r]] + (B l + B^2 r^2/4) g[r] == en g[         r], g[r], r]      The solution proposed by Mathematica is okay yet one can find an alternative, less complex representation with Whittaker functions. Is it possible to force Mathematica to use a certain type of function as a solution of a differential equation? We do not impose any boundary conditions. In this specific problem one can always use a transformation rule for the confluent hypergeometric function, for instance               rule = HypergeometricU[a_, b_, z_] ->        E^(z/2) z^(-b/2) WhittakerW[b/2 - a, (b - 1)/2, z];      but this is just a workaround. Perhaps there is a more elegant way. **Edit** For instance, consider the harmonic oscillator equation               DSolve[-y''[x] == y[x], y[x], x]     {{y[x] -> C[1] Cos[x] + C[2] Sin[x]}}      Is it possible to force a solution with exponential functions? Of course, the replacement rule can be used but perhaps there is a deeper solution.               {{y[x] -> C[1] Exp[I x] + C[2] Exp[-I x]}}      It would be great if Mathematica could provide a list of exemplary solutions (but this is just wishful thinking:-).
