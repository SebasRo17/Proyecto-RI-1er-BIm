I would like to know whether this PDE is solvable and if yes, for which values of $a$.               2 (y Cos[a] + x Sin[a]) - 4 (y Sin[a] - x Cos[a]) f[x, y]     - 2 (y Cos[a] + x Sin[a]) (f[x, y])^2      + ((x^2) Cos[a] - 2 x y Sin[a] - (y^2) Cos[a]) D[f[x, y], x]     - ((x^2) Sin[a] + 2 x y Cos[a] - (y^2) Sin[a]) D[f[x, y], y] == 0      I have tried to solve it for the case where $a=0$               2 y + 4 x f[x,y] - 2 y f[x,y]^2 -      2 x y Derivative[0,1][f][x,y] + (x^2-y^2) Derivative[1,0][f][x,y] == 0      on _Mathematica_ but after 3 hours it gave me no result. Then I utilized the method of characteristics and expressed the $a=0$ case as a system of three ODEs \begin{eqnarray} \frac{dx}{dt} &=& (x^2 - y^2) \\\ \frac{dy}{dt} &=& (-2xy) \\\ \frac{df}{dt} &=& 2yf^2 - 2y - 4xf \end{eqnarray} but _Mathematica_ still gave me no results. So I suspect that this PDE might not have an analytic solution. Is this PDE solvable, and if not could you please indicate a reference which indicates which cases of PDEs are non solvable? I am only interested in Analytic solutions. Any kind of help will be most appreciated. Thank you in advance.
