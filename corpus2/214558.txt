I'm very new to programming and I'm using Java. I got interested to learn programming because I want to create games. I love playing computer games and I know that game developers make money. I told myself that instead of just playing why not create my own game and probably make some money. I read some articles about game development using java and I learned about JMonkey. I just installed it in my Ubuntu PC. Should I learn first the basics of Java or I can start learning JMonkey and Java at the same time? I know that JMonkey is game engine built using Java and it provides libraries to help developers create Java games efficiently but its kinda advanced for a dummy like me.
