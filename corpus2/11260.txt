I have a long list (say, million of elements, like this one:               {{{1.0, 2.0}, 3}, {{4.0, 5.0}, 6},...}      I would like to compile a function `powq[list_,q_]` that would replace this list by a list in which the terms 3,6,.... are replaced by `3^q`, `6^q`,....:               {{{1.0, 2.0}, 3^q}, {{4.0, 5.0}, 6^q},...}      For a general function `f`, interactively, I can do it as follows:               mf[list_]:=MapAt[f, list, 2]      Then `Map[mf,list]` produces the desired result:               {{{1.0, 2.0}, f[3]}, {{4.0, 5.0}, f[6]}}      But I am having problems with defining               powq:=Compile[{{list,_Real,2},{q_Real]}},....]
