I'm finishing college for good tomorrow, then leaving my current programming job the next day. I'll be looking for opportunities, but I may end up with a month or two without a job, so with lots of free time to work on my Android development skills and improve my value for those jobs. I started thinking about what I'll be doing to make the most out of all this time, and figured I'd need a good plan. I haven't coded too much in Java, but feel like I can grasp the syntax quite quickly. I have already played with ADT and the whole Android setup a bit, but never completed an app due to lack of time. I'm looking for tips in order to finish the next month with the best skillset I can get in that time. Where to start with, tutorials, what to learn first, and so on. By the way, I do have an android device, so the emulator slowness or learning curve won't be an issue. Thank you
