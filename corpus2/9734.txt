How to obtain a fixed number of solutions to $x+y=1$? For example, I want 4 solutions: $(1,0),(2,-1),(3,-2),(-2,3)$ I want to do this also on bigger equations such as $x+y+...=1$ and then I want to plot these values on a graph. I need help only on obtaining these solutions, I've tried to do it with `Solve` but I've been unable to do so. Notice that I can do it using Loops, I'm just checking if there's a viable way through the use of `Solve` or another built-in function.
