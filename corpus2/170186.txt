I understand Objective-C categories and how they become useful, but I always have a hard time explaining the concept to other programmers that are not familiar with Objective C. Maybe I'm just bad at explaining things, but I was thinking at another way to explain it by comparing to similar features offered by other (more popular) languages. (ex : I can explain the similarities between Objective C protocols and Java Interfaces) Any examples similar to Categories ?
