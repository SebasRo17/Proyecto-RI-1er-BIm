I am studying python. Now I can write python scripts(codes) to some extent. I am interested in making GUI to those written programs.I like to do it using an IDE rather than using PyGTK or Tkinter. Can anyone help me how to start with this and link my scripts to a GUI. I downloaded a IDE called "glade". But I don't know how to use this IDE. I need some tutorial guide also. Can anyone help me.Please.Thank you!
