I am working through the Windows 8 app tutorial. They have some code about saving app data like so:                private void NameInput_TextChanged(object sender, TextChangedEventArgs e)             {                 Windows.Storage.ApplicationDataContainer roamingSettings =                      Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.RoamingSettings;                 roamingSettings.Values["userName"] = nameInput.Text;             }      I have worked with C# in the past and found that things like using constant string values (like "userName" in this case) for keys could get messy because auto-complete did not work and it was easy to forget if I had made an entry for a setting before and what it was called. So if I don't touch code for awhile I end up accidentally creating multiple entries for the same value that are named slightly differently. Surely there is a better way to keep track of the strings that key to those values. What is a good solution to this problem?
