I am manipulating partial differential equations symbolically, and would like to get the easily readable form $\rho \frac{\partial v}{\partial t}$, leaving variables implicit. Based on suggestions from How to make traditional output for derivatives I started out with               Derivative /:        MakeBoxes[Derivative[α__][f1_][vars__Symbol], TraditionalForm] :=          Module[{bb, dd, sp},           MakeBoxes[dd, _] ^=            If[Length[{α}] == 1, "\[DifferentialD]", "∂"];           MakeBoxes[sp, _] ^= "\[ThinSpace]";           bb /: MakeBoxes[bb[x__], _] := RowBox[Map[ToBoxes[#] &, {x}]];           TemplateBox[{ToBoxes[bb[dd^Plus[α], f1]],            ToBoxes[Apply[bb,              Riffle[Map[bb[dd, #] &,              Select[({vars}^{α}), (# =!= 1 &)]], sp]]],              ToBoxes[Derivative[α][f1][vars]]}, "ShortFraction",              DisplayFunction :> (FractionBox[#1, #2] &),              InterpretationFunction :> (#3 &),              Tooltip -> Automatic]]      When functions appear outside of partial derivatives, they still appear as $v(t,x)$. Trying to fix this, I tried               supressVariable[f_Symbol] :=        f /: MakeBoxes[f[t, x], TraditionalForm] :=         InterpretationBox[ToBoxes[f], f[t, x]]     SetAttributes[supressVariable, Listable]     supressVariable[{v, ρ, p, f}];      This works fine for both               f[t, x] v[t, x] == 0 // TraditionalForm      and               ρ[t, x]*Derivative[0, 1][v][t, x] +         v[t, x]*Derivative[0, 1][ρ][t, x] +         Derivative[1, 0][ρ][t, x] == 0 // TraditionalForm      producing nicely readable equations. However, the simple               f[t, x] == 0 // TraditionalForm      gives error message > An unknown box name (ToBoxes) was sent as the BoxForm for the expression. > Check the format rules for the expression and I don't know what to do with this. Can anybody help me out?
