I am going to design a MVC pattern. It could be either designed as a delegate pattern, or a Key-Value-Observing(KVO), to notify the controller about changing models. The project requires certain quality control procedures to conform to those verification documents. My questions:   1. Does delegate pattern fit better for unit testing than KVO?   2. If KVO fits better, would you please suggest some sample codes?
