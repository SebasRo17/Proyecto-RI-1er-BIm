We consider a server app development - heavily loaded with messing with big data streams. An app will be running on one powerful server. A server app will be developed in form of crossplatform application - working on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. So same code, many platforms for stand alone server architecture. We wonder what are the benefits of distributing applications not only over threads but over processes as well, for programmers and server end users? Some people said to me that even having 48 cores, 4 process threads would be shared via OS through all cores, is that true?
