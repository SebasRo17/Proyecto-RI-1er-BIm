To begin with, this isn't a question about which language one should choose :) We're considering a language switch as our general direction is changing from content-driven web sites to data/action-driven web applications. What sort of factors should one think about in order to successfully evaluate the various languages out there. A few factors I've thought of so far, along with a supposed importance level:   * Level of knowledge of language X within the company [medium/high]   * Tooling available [medium]   * Community size & activity [medium]   * Availability of developers [medium]   * Cost of developers [medium] Frameworks are also an important consideration, however I'm just trying to focus on the language-selection question first :)
