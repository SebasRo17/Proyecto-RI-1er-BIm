I am trying to fit the (probability density) histogram of some data with the exponential function, but I am having difficulties. My raw data are in file called `datachopped`. They are not 'probability density'. I want to fit the probability density histogram of this data with Exp[-x]. So I use the following command:               Histogram[datachopped, Automatic, "PDF",       Epilog -> First@Plot[Exp[-x], {x, 0, 4}, PlotStyle -> Red]]      This gives me this plot: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/hJmNi.jpg) However, I don't know how well this plot fit, i.e., how to compute the chi- squared, etc. Any help would be appreciated.
