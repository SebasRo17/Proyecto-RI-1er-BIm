I wish to produce an image with more than one composite graphics objects which have been modified using _Rotate_. I feel this should not be difficult, but haven't yet found a solution. A simple example using only _Disk_ illustrates the problem.               e1 = Rotate[Graphics[Disk[{0, 0}, {1/3, 1/4}]], \[Pi]/3];     e2 = Rotate[Graphics[Disk[{0, 0}, {1/3, 1/4}]], \[Pi]/7];      The following attempt fails:               Show[e1,e2]      > > Show::gcomb: Could not combine the graphics objects in Show[] How should this best be achieved ?
