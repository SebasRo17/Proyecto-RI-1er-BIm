I am trying to reduce my problem to a max flow problem so I can run the max flow algorithm on this problem. But there are some things that I am missing while transforming my problem. My problem is:   * there are classes with a maximum capacity   * there are students and their wish-list that includes 5 classes that they want    * students can select at most 5 classes. And the goal is:   * to maximize number of classes that students enroll. ![Image](http://i.stack.imgur.com/sjYPF.jpg) If I put students and classes as vertices (please see image above), then put a source node `s` that has an edge to each student and a sink node `t` that has an edge to each classes, what will be the edge costs?   * edge cost between classes and sink node t or   * edge cost between source node s and and students  Are the following assumptions correct?   I think the edge between students and classes cost should be 1. Because a student can only enroll once to a class in a term. I think edge cost between classes and the sink node `t` will be the maximum capacity of a class. I don't have an idea about edge costs between source node `s` and students nodes. And at the end, after arranging, do we just need to run max flow algorithm?
