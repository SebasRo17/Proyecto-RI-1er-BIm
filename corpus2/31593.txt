I'm trying to write a function in Workbench which will generate a Fibonacci sequence starting with `F0 = 0` and `F1 = 1`. So far I have this written               fibonacciSequence[n_] :=      Module[{fPrev = 0, fNext = 1, i = 0},      While[i++ < n, {fPrev, fNext} = {fNext, fPrev + fNext}];     fNext]      How do I modify the function to make it print out a list like the one below when `fibonacciSequence[15]` is called?               {0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610}      Sorry, but I am very new to _Mathematica_ and my professor didn't give us much instructions or examples of similar functions.
