I've came across a question transform this text with sed [sed only] and it got me wondering what class of problems is solvable by stream editors or programs/computational models with similar constraints. For E.g Regular expressions can solve problems that require fixed/const amount of memory (Can solve all problems that have a Deterministic Finite state automa) My question is what are the computational limits/constraints of sed in particular and any stream editor in general and what class/classes of problems can be solved by it? (after mapping it some text alphabet set if need be)
