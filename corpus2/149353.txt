This question is based on some testing I've done recently in order to better understand SQL indexing system. **Table with 500k entries, InnoDB engine** This is a simple select query on a `varchar` field. The `name` column is **not** indexed. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0IhSU.jpg) After indexing these are the results: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/LjlvL.jpg) All good until this point. When I'm trying to place a wildcard at the beginning of the search key, even though the column is indexed, the result time is the one from the non-index case: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/lEMxk.jpg) I'm wondering why is this happening? Is it because the index cannot be used any more? Is this solvable in any way? can I achieve a better search time even though I'm using `%` both at the beginning and at the end of the search string? Thank you!
