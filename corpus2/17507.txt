I have the following simple Mathematica code:               Clear["Global`*"];     x = Cos[t];     y = Sin[t];     L1 = ParametricPlot3D[{x, y, t}, {t, 0, 50},         PlotStyle -> {Blue, Thickness[0.003]}, Axes -> True,         AxesLabel -> {"x", "y", "t"}, BoxRatios -> {1, 1, 1},         AxesStyle -> Directive[Black, FontSize -> 17, FontFamily -> "Helvetica"],         PlotPoints -> 500, PlotRange -> All, ImageSize -> 500];     L2 = Graphics3D[{EdgeForm[None], Opacity[0.2], GrayLevel[0.1],      Specularity[White, 20], Mesh -> None, Lighting -> None,      Cuboid[{-1, -1, 38}, {1, 1, 50}]}];     P1 = Show[{L1, L2}, ViewPoint -> {1.3, -2.4, 1.5}]       However, when I try to export this three-dimensional plot in eps format, all the part of function which is inside the cuboid, that is when z>38 does not appear. It seems that somehow during the export the options `Opacity` is overruled. Is there a way to export this plot correctly?
