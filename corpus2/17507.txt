i was working for a company as a php developer since last two years and worked on many websites and now the company is closed along with all of its websites and so i have to look for another company to hire me. But since the websites are down i can't write them on my resume. Actually i have tried that out telling them i worked on these sites but since the company is closed the websites are closed too and they did thought that i am lying and did not hire me. i am really stuck i will have to apply as a beginner and hence won't get much salary and will very hardly get a job (if at all) since some experienced programmers will be competing me. Anyone got a solution? **Edit:** actually you guys are right, i shouldn't work for a company who doesn't trust me. And i like the Josh K's solutions the most, thanks guys :)
