On my dev team, we're doing code reviews, however not in a proper way i believe. The issues our process suffers from:   1. Not enough time is allocated for proper code review.   2. Doing reviews is not mandatory - many times it is simply not done.   3. Devs sit together for reviews, due to lack of another easy mechanism for doing it "offline" without spending both developers' time. My question is: can integration of a tool for code reviews improve the points mentioned above? Is it not needed? I would love to hear from positive/negative experiences.
