If we express conditional mortality as a vector of annual probabilities of death, like so               qx1={0.04772, 0.05854, 0.07519, 0.09659, 0.11762, 0.13904, 0.16124,     0.18363, 0.2041, 0.22319, 0.24276, 0.262, 0.27897, 0.29458, 0.31044,     0.32691, 0.34597, 0.36573, 0.38348, 0.39799, 0.40855, 0.41447,     0.41774, 0.42266, 0.43064, 0.43913, 0.44417, 0.44802, 0.45, 0.45};      we can compute the associated survival vector with               lx1=Drop[FoldList[#1 (1 + #2) &, 1, -qx1], -1]      and we can find the median life expectancy of this population with               Length[Select[lx1, # >= .5 &]]      We can combine these two equations into a single function that translates the conditional mortality curve directly into a median life expectancy. It would look like               medianLEfromQx[qx_]:=Length[Select[Drop[FoldList[#1 (1 + #2) &, 1, -qx], -1], # >= .5 &]]      And using the sample data above, we see that the median life expectancy for the population is 7 years. If we want to see the implications of reducing annual mortality by 10%, we can ask               medianLEfromQx[.9*qx1]      And we get an answer of 8 years. Fine. Here lies the problem -- I can't get Mathematica to solve for that multiplier given a desired LE.               Solve[medianLEfromQx[x*qx1]==8,x]      doesn't work (returning an empty set)               NSolve[medianLEfromQx[x*qx1]==8,x]      doesn't work, also returning an empty set, and               FindRoot[medianLEfromQx[x*qx1]==8,{x,1}]      doesn't work either, with the error message that "The Function value {False} is not a list of numbers with dimensions {1} at {x} = {1.}" What am I doing wrong here?
