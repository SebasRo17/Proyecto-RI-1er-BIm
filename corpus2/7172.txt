From the online reference: http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/Opener.html a JS function javascript:open_ES() is invoked to open all Openers within a section. Note (1) this feature is absent in the built-in MMA documentation center; (2) even online it selectively opens the EXAMPLES section (for Opener). Often I need to quickly overview all the sections including More Information, Options, Properties & Relations &c. Is there a way to program the documentation or even the Front End that contains Opener and Toggler to map them all to True? Perhaps a palette selection.
