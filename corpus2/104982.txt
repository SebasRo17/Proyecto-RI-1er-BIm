It was suggested that I take my project open source due to its size and my lack of skills, so I checked out Google Code, and started making a project and now it's asking me if I want the project to have Git, Mercurial, or Subversion code hosting. I don't even know what code hosting is, and a search just confused me more with the debates between all these things, and this is made even worse as Google Code is asking me which type of license I want. I think I'm not quite understanding what open source really means, can someone pretty much make a quick layman's cheat sheet on what all this is? Much appreciated. **Edit** There have been a lot of great responses on these three versions of code hosting, but I think I failed to communicate the real question: Basically I've no idea how this open source stuff works, why would I host the code somewhere like this? And would that mean I have to take the site off of my current hosting, or is this an entirely different type of hosting? What happens when I make my site open source, what rights do I have, what rights do I give away. How does it work, do people just come and throw code at me for free? Perhaps these are stupid questions, and if that's the case then I guess I need stupid answers, I seriously have no idea what open source is, except for the concept of sharing code...
