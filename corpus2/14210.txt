I'm calculating Fourier Coefficients by hand and trying to verify them in Mathematica. However, in Mathematica I get them wrong by a factor of 2. Is there some part of the Mathematica functions I'm missing or am I doing something else wrong? What almost makes me think there is something wrong with Mathematica is that $c_0$ should be equal to $1/2 a_0$. When computing by hand $c_0$ is indeed $1/4$ but $a_0$ should be $1/2$ (as I get by hand) and not 1 as Mathematica tells me. Here is my code:               g[x_] := Piecewise[{{0, -Pi < x < 0}, {1, 0 < x < Pi/2}, {0,          Pi/2 < x < Pi}}]          makeper[f_, L_, offset_] := f[Mod[#, L, offset]] &          gTest = makeper[g, 2*Pi, -Pi]          Plot[gTest[x], {x, -4*Pi, 4*Pi}, PlotRange -> {0, 1},       Ticks -> {{-4 Pi, -3 Pi, -2 Pi, -Pi, 0, Pi, 2 Pi, 3 Pi, 4 Pi}, {-1,          0, 1}}, Filling -> Axis]          FourierCoefficient[gTest[x], x, n]          FourierCoefficient[gTest[x], x, 0]          FourierSinCoefficient[gTest[x], x, n]          FourierCosCoefficient[gTest[x], x, n]          FourierCosCoefficient[gTest[x], x, 0]      Any help would be appreciated!
