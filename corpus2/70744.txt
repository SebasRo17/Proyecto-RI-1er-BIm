I am a junior developer (half a year out of university) currently working in a small project. The project team size about 30. I am wondering how important it is for us developers to know about the technical architecture (hardware, network, etc.) of solutions. I don't think that I can do side-projects for small firms without a strong TA background. Are there books where I could learn more on software TA and the like?
