I'm a TV producer in London but also an enthusiastic amateur coder and web designer. I started with VB6 and then moved onto C/PHP/Obj-C. I've got a couple apps in the app store, I mess around a lot with Arduino, create php CMS from scratch - but I've certainly never worked professionally as a coder. I've got an iPad app idea which I'd like to spend time and money, but it involves animation and modelling, creating a timeline UI, working with multiple camera views. Put simply, it's a complex OpenGL app, well beyond my skills. _To be clear, this isn't a zombie slasher or fantasy adventure clone - it's an app I know that thousands of well-paid TV industry pros and media students would want to spend money on._ I'd like to know from those with experience of taking a complex app from idea to delivery, whether themselves or through a dev agency, if you genuinely believe an app is worth building should you spend 12 months learning the skills and hacking early versions together - or should you get serious and employ people with money raised from various sources. Perhaps a Kickstarter? With the latter in mind, what is a reasonable amount of money you would pay for a pair of programmers to achieve this, in say six months? Standard pay for a competent opengl coder? It may well be a case of using out-of-uni programmers and splitting the company with them, plus modest expenses. I think I'm in a fortunate position that I can at least contribute to the project, through graphics, audio, marketing - just not the real heavy stuff. Any advice genuinely appreciated, Mike.
