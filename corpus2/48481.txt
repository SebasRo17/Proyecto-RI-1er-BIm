I have a few vectors defined as               V1 = Array[v1,3]     V2 = Array[v2,3]     V3 = Array[v3,3]      And I am trying to solve a very simple equation along the lines of               Norm[V1 + a V2 + (b^2)V3] == c      Mathematica succeeds without difficulty, but the result is quite dissatisfying. There are a lot of parts,such as dot products and norms, that could be expressed very concisely in linear algebra notation and are instead reported in element-wise form. I have tried a pass of Simplify, but that took long and did not help. Given that I am sticking to the nice world of finite dimensional, real-valued vectors (in fact I am using `$Assumptions = {_ [Element] Reals}`), is there any way in which I could get rid of clutter such as               V3[1] V2[1] + V3[2] V2[2] + V3[3] V2[3]      in favor of cleaner options such as `V3.V2`?
