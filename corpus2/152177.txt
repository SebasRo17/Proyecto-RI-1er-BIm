I am in the very beginning of developing an app / desktop program. I want it to be cross-platform and possibly also as a tablet version (preferably Android Icecream sandwich). Note that I need to run it offline. I thought about the following approaches:   * ADOBE Air, since I do not need much performance. Plus I did some web programming in the past which might be of some use. Afaik it would run on OS X and Windows and should run on mobile OSes, too.    * Qt. Found some nice Qt based desktop recently and read it also works on android. Plus I like the SDK.    * HTML5 / JS. Again my web background should help me here. I wont need no sever side scripts, thus it should work without installing anything but a browser. How easy could this be converted into an Android app? There might be a plethora of other (better) ways to do it, but I haven't thought of them yet. Can you help out? How would you create such an application. Would it be better to do some pure desktop client and then create tablet versions? Would you rather start to create a website and worry later on how to turn into an app?
