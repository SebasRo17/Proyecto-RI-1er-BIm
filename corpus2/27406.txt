I have a _Microsoft Word_ document in DOCX format. I need to import it into _Mathematica_ as a `String` preserving all formatting (font, size, bold/italic style, colors, etc), tables and embedded images with highest possible fidelity ( _Mathematica_ strings support formatting and arbitrary embedded expressions including images). All text should remain editable, so it should not be converted to an image. Is there a way to do this? I can convert the document to RTF, PDF, XPS, MHT or ODT format before importing, if it helps.
