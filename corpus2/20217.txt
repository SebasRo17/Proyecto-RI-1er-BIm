I need to evaluate the derivative of a function. My function looks like               approx[vector_, x_] :=  Sum[vector[[n]]*Basis[n - 1, x], {n, 1, Length[vector]}]      and I'm defining my derivative like:               ddappx[vector_, x_] := D[approx[vector, x], {x, 2}]       However if I evaluate it at a specific x I get an error:               General::ivar: 1 is not a valid variable. >>      I searched enough to know that a solution when plotting this is to evaluate it first. Something about HoldAll and so on. What I need to do is use it in a set of simultaneous equations. So I should be able to have:               Solve[{ddappx[{a,b}, 1]==0,ddappx[{a,b}, -1]==0},{a,b}]      To solve for {a,b} by setting the 2nd derivative of approx ==0 at x=1 and x=-1. However I get the               General::ivar: 1 is not a valid variable. >>      Errors again. Evaluating like                Solve[{Evaluate[ddappx[{a,b}, 1]]==0,Evaluate[ddappx[{a,b}, -1]]==0},{a,b}]      isn't working. so, any ideas? cheers EDIT: Having made the suggested change, that error is solved. However although evaluating approx works perfectly well, evaluating ddappx gives 0, no matter what I do. there is no error, just 0. I've added the whole code which goes in front just in case you think its relevant               diffeq[y_, x_] := y''[x] + y[x]     f[x_] := Cos[2*x]     Basis[n_, x_] := ChebyshevT[n, x]     approx[vector_, x_] := Sum[vector[[n]]*Basis[n - 1, x], {n, 1, Length[vector]}]          ddappx[vector_, x_] := Derivative[0, 2][approx][vector, x]      ....               approx[{0, 0, 1, 1}, x]      returns correctly:               -1 - 3 x + 2 x^2 + 4 x^3                     ddappx[{0, 0, 1, 1, 1}, x]      returns incorrectly:               0
