I have a project I shelved a while back- it was essentially a working web app built in django but I stopped working on it to work on something else. I plan on starting it up again in my spare time, but I'm wondering if it's worth converting a django project with about 5kloc to Rails. I'm considering this because I've been told that it'll be easier for other people to work on and easier to work on myself. I don't have any ruby or rails experience: is it worth learning ruby, rails and then converting my django project to Rails? I understand it's a bit of a loaded / language war kind of question but would appreciate any input.
