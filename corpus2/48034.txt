Here is an example of solving a system of parabolic and elliptic PDE: http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/tutorial/NDSolveDAE.html (see the subsection "Combined Elliptic-Parabolic PDE in 1D"). In this example the equation and the initial conditions don't depend on $x$. How can I change this solution for accounting dependence on $x$? Can this system be solved easier, just by using NDSolve? _Clarification:_ I have another problem described on the page PDE combined with ODE 1D, and in my problem the initial conditions depend on $x$.
