I have just installed Mathematica 9.0 in a x64 openSUSE 12.3 machine using `sh Mathematica_9.0.1_LINUX.sh` as superuser. I have had Mathematica 8.04 working on the previous 12.2 version with no problem. Now, after installing and running `./math` to register the activation key and get MathID and password, I get the message               `Mathematica could not find its system-wide initialization file "sysinit.m".     The following places were searched:          .           ~           /usr/local/Wolfram/Mathematica/9.0/SystemFiles/Kernel/Binaries/Linux-x86-64/Packages           /usr/local/Wolfram/Mathematica/9.0/SystemFiles/Kernel/Binaries/Linux-x86-64/SystemFiles/KernelInit           /usr/local/Wolfram/Mathematica/9.0/SystemFiles/Kernel/Binaries/Linux-x86-64/SystemFiles/GraphicsInit     Segmentation fault     `      and the same happens when I try to run `/.MathKernel` from terminal. It would also be nice knowing how to uninstall it if I am forced to switch back to the 8.0.4 version
