After 1 months research I basically give up on getting all URL's from a search results programmatically, I looked at Google Search API to find a way to get millions of search results "URL's" to be specific to a text file or something relative but no success, but I am 100% there must be a way or trick of doing it. Real Question : Is there anyway programmatically or manually I can get 1000+ search results (URLs using search query e.g. "Apple" returns million of results on google and I want as much as possible URLs of them results in a text file) Note : Don't care for any specific search engine or programming language or technique or software or just point me to right direction, but yeah I tried it with google API i can't get more then 100 results at all.
