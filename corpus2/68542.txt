I've started writing a framework in C (you may have heard of it: Raphters). Someone contacted me to ask whether I could re-license it because it would be useful in embedded products, but clause 4d (the clause that says, and I'm paraphrasing, you must allow modified versions of the library to be re-linked against your executable) would make that difficult. I like LGPL because it prevents people making modifications and keeping them secret, but I don't want to prevent people using Raphters in their embedded products. What do you suggest?
