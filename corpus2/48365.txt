I am trying to write a function that takes 3 tuples. Each tuple contains two lists which are first divided. This results in 3 lists. Then I want to take the Mean of all the columns. I can do this in two steps:               d = Divide[#1, #2] & @@@  { {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}}  , {{7, 8, 9}, {10,       11, 12}} , {{13, 14, 15}, {16, 17, 18} } }     Mean[d]      However I would like to put this all on one line. I have tried a couple different things all smilar to               Mean[#] & @ Divide[#1, #2] & @@@  { {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}}  , {{7, 8, 9}, {10,       11, 12}} , {{13, 14, 15}, {16, 17, 18} } }      The problem is the mean is not applied to the entire list but rather one level inside, which does not give the desired output. the desired out put is:               {47/80, 608/935, 25/36}
