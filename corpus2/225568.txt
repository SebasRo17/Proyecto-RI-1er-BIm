We have a pretty complex project with 100 or so classes, multiple custom elements, etc. We have a new senior programmer who will work on this project. How should we approach the task of introducing the senior programmer to the project? How can we make sure the programmer does not break some other feature while fixing the current one? I have seen too many similar situation.s Sometimes, new bugs are not noticed immediately -- but pop up months later. Shall I direct the programmer by first giving them smaller tasks and waiting for them to finish them? Or there is a better solution? I am asking this because I don't want to become micromanager but I also don't want to have nasty bugs created because of my bad approach to the new programmer.
