Consider the following case:               list1 = {q, r, s};     list2 = {{a, 2}, {b, 3}, {c, 1, f}};     Inner[{#1, #2} &, list1, list2, List]     (* Out[] := {{q, {a, 2}}, {r, {b, 3}}, {s, {c, 1, f}}} *)      However, if the last element of `list2` has `Length` 2:               list1 = {q, r, s};     list2 = {{a, 2}, {b, 3}, {c, 1}};     Inner[{#1, #2} &, list1, list2, List]     (* Out[] := {{{q, a}, {r, b}, {s, c}}, {{q, 2}, {r, 3}, {s, 1}}} *)      I would have expected (and wanted) a result like:               (* Out[] := {{q, {a, 2}}, {r, {b, 3}}, {s, {c, 1}}} *)      So,   1. Why does this `Inner` operation change if the `list2` entries are all of the same length?    2. How can I generate an output like the expected result? * * * **Edit** I came up with a potential answer to question 2:               Partition[Riffle[list1, list2], 2]     Out[] := {{q, {a, 2}}, {r, {b, 3}}, {s, {c, 1}}}      but this seems somehow too-complicated.
