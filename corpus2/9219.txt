I've heard it argued that design patterns are the best thing since sliced bread. I've also heard it argued that design patterns tend to exacerbate "Second System Syndrome," that they are massively overused, and that they make their users think they're better designers than they really are. I tend to fall closer to the former camp, but recently I've been seeing designs where nearly every single interaction is replaced with an observer relationship, and everything's a singleton. So, considering the benefits and problems, are design patterns generally good or bad, and why?
