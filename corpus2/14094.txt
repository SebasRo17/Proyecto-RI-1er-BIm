I am making some random algebra equations, and I want to have the ordering be random too, such that if my random equation generator makes `x+1`, the output stays `x+1`, without reverting to `1+x`. I have tried `ClearAttributes[Plus, Orderless]`, but it simply did not work - entering `x+1` returns `1+x`. The following sort-of works:               Unprotect[Plus];     Format[Plus[a_, b_]] := ToString@a <> " + " <> ToString@b      But it uses `Unprotect`, converts everything to strings, and also doesn't work when `b` is a fraction (fractions `p/q` are represented as `p\n--\nq`). Is there a nicer way to do this? Also, I plan to convert everything to `TraditionalForm` at the end, so using that to control ordering won't work either.
