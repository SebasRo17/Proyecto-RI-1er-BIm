I am transferring file from one server to another. So, to estimate the time it would take to transfer some GB's of file over the network, I am pinging to that IP and taking the average time. For ex: i ping to 172.26.26.36 I get the average round trip time to be x ms, since ping send 32 bytes of data each time. I estimate speed of network to be 2*32*8(bits)/x = y Mbps --> multiplication with 2 because its average round trip time. So transferring 5GB of data will take 5000/y seconds Am I correct in my method of estimating time. If you find any mistake or any other good method please share.
