I need to model a database design to provide item level permissions to users based on the user's role access. I am using asp.net with sql server 2012 I am looking at similar experience on how SharePoint provides the security trimming when we access the resources with a SharePoint site (including search results)   1. Is it a best practice to model this in the database or the application programming? (I have seen SharePoint implement this, but haven't gone in to figuring out how they have done it)   2. I will also be using lucene.net for integrating with search. So even the search results should be security trimmed. Are there any best practices/resources available to suggest how to model this permission? /Sharath
