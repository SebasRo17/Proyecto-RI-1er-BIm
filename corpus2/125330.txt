I am finding myself building up a whole bunch of JSON calls all through my application, which are basically actions spread across various controllers. I am considering creating a JSON Controller to keep all the JSON actions in one controller, so instead of;               Products/GetListJSON      I would call               JSON/Products      Might this have ramifications that I haven't considered? Can anyone think of any compelling reasons not to do this?
