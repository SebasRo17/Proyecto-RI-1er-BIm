I'm using mathematica 8.0. When I calculate NDSolve`ImplicitRungeKuttaGaussCoefficients[10, Infinity] function, it gives me some symbolic results. I trided //N and //FuÄ±llSimplify operation as in How do I work with Root objects? topic but it gave me only numerical results or some of absolute results, I didn't get all of my results, but i don't want to this. I want to absolute results for my calculation but I couldn't achieve this.For Example the first element of A matrix is :                (322 - 13 Sqrt[70])/3600      , but second element of A matrix is :                    Root[20242937658868661529 + 13567555581406269206400 #1 +         2767290377721440719680000 #1^2 +         187835459850164351232000000 #1^3 +         1303105350315444928000000000 #1^4 -         113922281443839160320000000000 #1^5 +         1236506465399482368000000000000 #1^6 -         5007540613482086400000000000000 #1^7 +         6998115764183040000000000000000 #1^8 &, 1]
