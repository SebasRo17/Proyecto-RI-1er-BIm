I got a screw .obj model with the head diameter of `2cm`, and a board .obj model of `10cmx10cmx4cm` in dimension. I would like the screw duplicated in 25 copies painted with different color and "screw" on the board in an array of `5x5` with random heights. How can I attain this in Mathematica? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7Gi69.gif)               (* assuming the .obj files are located in the c: root *)     scw = Import["c:\\screw.obj"];     brd = Import["c:\\board.obj"];     Show[brd, Graphics3D[{        Translate[         Rotate[First[scw], 2 Pi , {0, 0, 1}], {1, 0.8, -1}] ,        Translate[         Rotate[First[scw], 2 Pi , {0, 0, 1}], { 3, 1, -1}],        Translate[         Rotate[First[scw], 2 Pi , {0, 0, 1}], {5, 1.1, -1}] ,        Translate[         Rotate[First[scw], 2 Pi , {0, 0, 1}], {7, 0.7, -1}] ,        Translate[         Rotate[First[scw], 2 Pi , {0, 0, 1}], {9, 1.0, -1}]          }]      ]      With the code shown above, I got something like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ruq74.jpg) I need a better(faster) way to do this, and need to knew how to "paint" the nails and the board.
