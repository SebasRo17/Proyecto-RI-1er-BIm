I was reading through the code of StackOverflow's new SQL Object Mapper. And I noticed at the bottom of the SqlMapper.cs there is some code that I had never seen before. After reading some of the documentation on MSDN and a tutorial on MSIL this feels a little over my head. As a professional .NET developer (6 years), should I invest time to learn this? What is the advantage of understanding the ILGenerator? I hope I'm not confusing things and the question is clear. Thanks!
