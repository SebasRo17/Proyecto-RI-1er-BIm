I've got a situation where I have, say 4 symbols, `a`, `b`, `c` and `d`. This is a simplification of the issue I've been working with. Let's say I assign numeric values to these symbols:`a=1; b=2; c=3; d=4`. I now create a list: `myList:={a,b,c,d}`. I'd like to be able to say: `( # = 5 ) & /@ myList` to assign the value 5 to `a`, `b`, `c` and `d`. The code works as long as `a`-`d` are unassigned. Is there a way to do this, or am I trying to abuse the language?
