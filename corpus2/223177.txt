Currently my company has a Visual Studio solition in an SVN repo that's organized as follows:               SolutionFolder (~3.5 GB)     |-> SolutionName.sln     |-> .. Some source code folders... (~250 MB)     |-> ThirdParty (~3 GB)     |-> Tools         | -> Tool1         | -> Tool2      Tool1 and Tool2 are build independently (have their own solutions), but produce executables that are used in the main build. ThirdParty folder contains all dependencies for the project, including some pre-compiled 100+ MB .lib files and large libraries like boost. It's convenient to have it all in one SVN repo so that (1) developer has to do only one check-out, and (2) we don't need to keep track which versions of dependencies we need for each version of the build. On the flip side, it takes a while to check out this repo. What would be the best way to move this project structure to git? Presumably it's best to exclude ThirdParty and possibly Tools from the main repo, but we'd like to keep ThirdParty easily downloadable in one step, and we like it versioned (and version mismatches between main repo and ThirdParty/Tools would be bad). At this point I'm not interested in preserving history, just in figuring out how to organize such project.
