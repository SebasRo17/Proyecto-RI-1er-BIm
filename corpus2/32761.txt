How do you remove duplicate characters in a string **without converting the string to a list**. I want to delete all duplicate characters in a string (i.e. get the unsorted union of characters). For example string like `"113233454766"` should give me string `"1324576"`. Note order. I tried this:                StringReplace["113233454766", a___ ~~ x_ ~~ b___ ~~ x_ ~~ c___ :> a ~~ x ~~ b ~~ c]      But it won't give me answer. I think I'm not fully understand about pattern.
