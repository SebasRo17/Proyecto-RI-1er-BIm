In the company I'm currently working on, we've been doing pair programming for a while now. In the current project, for the last couple of days, we've been trying to make our pair programming a little better, so we even have a timer now to ensure that the swap between driver and navigator happens often enough. For changing pairs, we tried to do it in several ways. We tried changing at the _end of the week_ , but found it too long. We tried in the _middle of the week_ but we tended to forget, so we decided to do it _daily_. Problem is that there are some stories that take a couple of days, so it's a little cumbersome to do it this way. Then we changed to a " _per story_ " pair changing. But this is just a little uneven because the stories themselves most of the time are uneven as well. So, simple question: How often should you change pairs?
