When I do computations in mathematica, I generally try to make it readable for myself-in-the-future. This can be a cumbersome task in mathematica, where it often requires me to switch betwee a text cell, then back to an equation cell (or two), over and over again, to be able to label what a given equation/result is. e.g.               (text:) This is the equation for ... .... ...     In[517]:= 2 + 2     Out[517]= 4      over and over again. Is there anyway to make mathematica produce output like the following?               In[517]:= 2 + 2  This is the ... Equation     Out[517]= 4      The resulting value ...
