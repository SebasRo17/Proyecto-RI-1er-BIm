Only recently i moved into doing Asp.net web development work, with quite a fair bit on Asp.net MVC. I'm thinking of taking up some courses to further build up my profile. I'm having a touch decision between taking PMP or CEH. Would course would benefit my current career more or maybe in the upcoming 1-2 years? Thanks.
