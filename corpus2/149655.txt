With unit tests the domain is quite small, so it's easy. I used Osherove's `methodName_conditions_result()` scheme and found it very clear. But with integration tests I feel like it would make a very long name, and what do I put in place of `methodName`? How do I name integration test classes? Real world examples of integration test names are very welcome. I hope the answers will also help me to better understand these tests.
