I implemented some functionality, then a business analyst created a defect, saying that some message text is wrong. Then I reviewed the spec again and found that I'm right. I posted a spec excerpt and closed the defect. Then she reopened the defect again, saying that there was a mistake in the spec and that I shouldn't implement it mindlessly and should escalate this particular thing to her. How should I respond?
