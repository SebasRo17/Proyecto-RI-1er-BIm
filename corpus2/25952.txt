There's a server at work, which I would like to use as a remote kernel. I have access to it via terminal (server is running Red Hat, my client Windows 7). I don't know if the kernel is set up or not, so I want to check this. However, I don't know how perform this check in the terminal. All guides I have seen so far require the front end. So, is there a way to configure a remote kernel via the terminal?
