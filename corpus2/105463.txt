We're looking into our processes and client relationships at work and part of this is creating a standardised template for our development proposals that we send to clients. The development areas we cover are mainly web development and design and mobile application development. On top of this we also offer native software developments for small to large companies. What we are aiming for is a template for each development area, something we can base future proposals on. How do you go about writing something like this? Are the resources to help on the internet? More importantly maybe, what would you guys say is important to include in a proposal? This is normally pre-"indepth technical spec", but I would suggest (for instance) including a wireframe or mockup of the finished product. How detailed must you be in order to portray the project to the client and understand the needs of the project yourself in order to charge accordingly?
