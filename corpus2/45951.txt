I've a table with 3 columns. The table looks like this:               test = {       {"john", {"suzan", "jan"}, {"new", "job", "policies"}},        {"carla", {"john", "piet"}, {"route", "suggestion"}},        {"jan", {"john", "suzan"}, {"re", "new", "job", "policies"}},        {"john", {"piet", "carla"}, {"re", "route", "suggestion"}}}      I would like to select the records with has no `re` in the third column. When I select the third column like this:               test1 = Select[test[[All, 3]], #[[1]] != "re" &]      The result is: > >     {{"new", "job", "policies"}, {"route", "suggestion"}} >   But I want to select also the columns one and two. When I write:               Select[test[[All, {1, 2, 3}]], #[[3]] != "re" &]      The result is empty > >     {} >   Who has a suggestion to solve this?
