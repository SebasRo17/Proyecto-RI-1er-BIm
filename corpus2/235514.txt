We have a huge system to develop, it has 3 main functions:   1. API provider   2. Worker to automated data retrieval   3. Management of data built in workers They all share the same DB, but for scalability purposes we have at least one server for each function, that means initially we have thought on this server structure:   1. 1 server for DB (postgresql)   2. 1 server for load balancer (nginx + management section)   3. N servers for API providers (sinatra app)   4. N servers for workers (sidekiq or Resque) My problem with that is to handle migrations and models which I stated here on SO. Because I haven't found any solutions that we liked I started to think on build one rails app and ship everything inside of it (drop the sinatra and leave everything for the rails app)   1. Is this a good solution, to build a huge rails app and slicing it on each server?   2. Is this a good idea, to leave just the minimal code necessary to run a server?
