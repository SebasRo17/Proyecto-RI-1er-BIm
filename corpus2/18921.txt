How do I solve the PDE with boundary value like this $$u(t,x,y)=0, \textrm{when } F(x,y)=0$$ using DSolve? As a specific example, I want to solve heat equation $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=\alpha\left(\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}\right)$$ with a strange boundary condition $u(t,x,y)=0$ where $x^6+y^4=1$. (Or I want to solve it numerically with a strange closed curve.)
