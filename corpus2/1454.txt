I have a dialog, which, when pops up, requests input from the user. How can I set the window up that the focus is on the `InputField` of the new window (i.e. the caret stands in the `InputField`), so that when the user starts typing, it is immediately registered by the field? At the moment, I have to click inside the field first to make it the active control on screen.               DialogInput[{InputField["", String], Button["Ok", DialogReturn[]]}]
