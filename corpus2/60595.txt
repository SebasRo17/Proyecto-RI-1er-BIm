For those of you who received undergrad degrees in Computer Science, do you feel like your school prepared you well for the actual day-to-day work of being a programmer? I've often felt that my school prepared me really well to go on to a Master's Degree program, but that was at the expense of learning basic working concepts like how software shops are commonly structured and what is typically expected of a professional developer. Also, it would have been nice to learn more about the latest trends in software development so I could have known which skills were most in demand in which industries. I am not dismissing the value of the more theoretical classes I took, and I do see how they have benefited me. However, I think any CS programs that aren't already doing it should offer a half semester class in this area. It could aim for practical and up-to-date information about what should be expected from the real-world software industry. **UPDATE** : If you disagree with me and you feel that your school prepared you for real- world experience, please say so. What kind of classes did you think helped you out? As I said in the comments below, I'm not suggesting that a university's first responsibility is to prepare you for the working world. I do, however, think there can be a compromise between their goals of getting their students to embrace new ideas and helping to get them ready for life after graduation.
