Many languages define a special identifier whose value is the path to the source file currently being processed. (For example, in C, this is done through the `__FILE__` preprocessor macro.) Does Mathematica have anything like this (at least for `*.m` files)? (I could not find a tag that adequately represents the topic of this question (namely, something like "source file processing"); suggestions welcome.)
