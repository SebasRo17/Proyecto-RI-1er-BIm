I do mainly .NET work so I assume that the framework is all fine and that. But have there been reports of various tools like .NET Reflector and the like not working properly with Win 7? This is a company-wide thing so there isn't much I can do about it, but once everything is reinstalled I'm hoping to not find anything shocking. Cheers.
