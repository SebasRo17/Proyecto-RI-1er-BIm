(I posted this at serverfault and it was suggested I post here instead) I'm looking for an application recommendation to help me keep track of the discussions I have with the members of my team during our weekly 1-on-1 meetings. A windows desktop app would probably be best. For features, it should be able to manage goals, training, performance, reviews, and incidents. It should have an easy to use interface, but not as clunky as some of the tools like http://www.managerassistant.com/products.html word/notepad or excel just doesn't seem like a good fit... any ideas?
