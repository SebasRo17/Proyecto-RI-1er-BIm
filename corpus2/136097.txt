I'm applying to university _very_ soon, and I have my mind set on programming. I narrowed down my program options to **Web Services and Applications** , **Computer Applications** , and **Computer Games**. I'm leaning towards Web, since I've been developing for Web since college. **Question** So, my question is, would it be very difficult to switch career path from Web to Software for example should I find years from now that I would have preferred a different career path? **Note** The three programs are all part of a Bachelor of Computer Science and seem to share the same basic courses.
