I think this should be easy to numerically solve in Mathematica, but for some reason I'm not finding the correct way to do it. I basically want to solve these simyltaneous equiations:               NSolve[     {     -(0.7)*w + (0.3)*y + (0.4)*z == 0,     -(0.6)*x + (0.2)*y + (0.1)*z == 0,     (0.5)*w + (0.3)*x - y == 0,     (0.2)*w + (0.3)*x + (0.5)*y - (0.5)*z == 0,                                \     w + x + y + z == 1     },      {z , w , x , y}]      This is what i see: ![image](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qXG0G.png)
