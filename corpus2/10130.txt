I'm just starting out with _Mathematica_ and I'm using `MathematicaScript` rather than the GUI. However, I'm having trouble formatting a list when printing it. Suppose I have a list and I want to print it using `Column`:               list = {a, b, c};     Print[Column[list]];      Calling this outputs `Column[{a, b, c}]` rather than               a     b     c      I suspect that this is because I'm running _Mathematica_ in script mode. Is there anything I can do to display a list like this? How can I verify what the cause of my problem is from the documentation (I'm having trouble running the GUI)? The documentation doesn't say anything about `Column` only working in GUI mode. I assume that the answer to getting a list (if there is one) to display as a column will explain how to do the same for a grid with 2D lists.
