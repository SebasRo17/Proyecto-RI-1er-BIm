my visually impaired sister uses a webcam with DIY stand as a digital magnifier to read printed texts. We wanted to initiate a project to create a software - in fact only a modified webcam viewer (like Cheese in Linux). Is it possible to have one SW for both platforms (Windows and Linux) = almost the same code, same filters and GUI, and just use the video stream using some standard protocol? Because most people use Win, but we would like to support Linux primarily. I am not sure if this is possible in windows. We need the software to take the video stream and apply some color and other effects like those described in this article. The idea is to maintain only one application (best would be open-source) with a small differences for both platforms. For the GUI, the GTK seems to be optimal as it is accessible for ScreenReader SW. Such app would not only help the visually impaired but also the elderly people. So, is this possible or is this idea really stupid? thanks :-D
