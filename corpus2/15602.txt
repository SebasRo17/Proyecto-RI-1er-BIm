The following doesn't appear to work:               DynamicModule[{}, Button["Press Me", ChoiceDialog["OK or Cancel?"]]]      When I press the button labelled "Press Me", a dialog window appears, but without buttons, and then Mathematica hangs. Is this a bug, or am I attempting something that can't or shouldn't be done inside a Dynamic Module? In either case, does anyone know of a workaround? ( In my real code, I have a button-initiated process inside a dynamic module for which I want to get user confirmation ).
