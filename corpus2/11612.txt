I have two lists with the same x-values but different y-values. I have used `ListPlot` to plot and fill the space (line) between them; however, I would like the color of the fill to be representative of the difference in y-values. I have lists of the form `{{x1,y1},..}: a , b` The normalized difference (from 0 to 1) between the points: `diff`               ListPlot[{a,b}, Filling -> {1-> {{2}, Map[Hue, diff]}}]      I have tried other methods, but this one was the simplest to demonstrate my intent. I have had thoughts about `ColorFunction`, but my attempts have been met with frought. The x-values are Real.
