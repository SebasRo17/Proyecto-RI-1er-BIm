The following made me curious. Suppose you want to sum the if statement `If[x[i] < 1., x[i]^2, 0.]` over `i=1,2`, i.e.               Sum[If[x[i] < 1., x[i]^2, 0.], {i, 1, 2}].       Mathematica returns               If[x[1] < 1., x[i]^2, 0.] + If[x[2] < 1., x[i]^2, 0.].      Notice the `i`'s if the statement is true. However, I thought a more "natural" representation of the sum should look like               If[x[1] < 1., x[1]^2, 0.] + If[x[2] < 1., x[2]^2, 0.].      Does anybody can enlighten me on this one? Thanks in advance.
