I'm looking to hire developers and I wish to test them. I have been especially told by my boss that we should have programmers on board that can consult on banking sector software and I'm to come up with the test. Now I've never done Java EE development in depth and my knowledge of it isn't the greatest but I've not had any trouble understanding what I've read so far. Now I'm wondering how to construct a test to test candidates for Java EE knowledge as well as experience. And if I should make the test more conceptual like logical reasoning and pattern detection etc.
