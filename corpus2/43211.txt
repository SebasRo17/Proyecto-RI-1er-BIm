I am a PHP programmer with 1 year of experience. As I am just starting my career, I am learning a lot of things now. I can say I am a little bit of a perfectionist. When I am assigned a problem I start off by Googling. Then, even when I find a solution, I keep trying for a better one until I find 2-3 options. Then I start learning it and choose the best performing solution. Even though I am learning a lot, this process gets me labeled as a low performer. My questions:   1. As a novice, should I continue to use this learning process and not worry about my performance?    2. Should I focus more on my performance and less on how the code performs?
