When I feed a large (or small) enough floating-point number to `ToString`, it produces a two-line string, with the first line containing only the exponent of 10:               In := ToString[12345.^6]     Out :=           24            3.53954 10      This creates problems because it's very counterintuitive when written to a log file. For example `ToString[{51.5^7, 2, 3, 12345.^6}]` would be written out as                          11                  24\n{9.60839 10  , 2, 3, 3.53954 10  }      which is practically unrecognizable for what it is, especially when inserted in the middle of other output. I would like to see output like               {9.60839E+11, 2, 3, 3.53954E+24}      or, if not that, I'd be fine with something like               {9.60839*^11, 2, 3, 3.53954*^24}      What can I do to print out floating-point numbers in a format suitable for single-line output?
