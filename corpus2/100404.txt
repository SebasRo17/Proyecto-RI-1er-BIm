I got a new MacMini a little while ago because I already had a monitor, keyboard, mouse, etc so I just wanted something cheap I could play with for Apple development where I could just change plugs to the computer I want to use. The biggest problem is that my keyboard is a standard (or not so standard being a DasKeyboard) keyboard in regards to the Control-Windows-Alt key setup. As all good developers should, I have trained my fingers' muscle memory to work well with common Windows-based (and Linux for that matter) keyboard shortcuts. I've actually instinctively hit `Control-Shift-B` to "compile" a Word document before (/facepalm). I tried remapping the `Command` key to be my keyboard's `Control` key, and that alone takes care of most of my problems. `End` and `Home` buttons are another issue altogether, and trying to highlight words using `Control` (aka the `Command`) causes frustration as well. I've considered just getting myself a wireless Apple keyboard just for the MacMini and forcing myself to learn things their way. Or perhaps resetting my current key mappings and trying to force learn everything in an Apple-ish way on my standard keyboard (so I just need to get used to using `Alt` instead of `Control`). Has anyone else run into this problem? How did you go about solving it?
