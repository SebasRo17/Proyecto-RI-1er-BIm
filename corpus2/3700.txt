I need to use `If` but with only one option that is if "a" then do "b", else do nothing. So I wrote `If[a,b]` but the problem is that if it is not `a` it returns `Null` in my output. How to avoid this? Here is the specific example I was working on. I am looking for the number of comparisons performed by the quick sort algorithm. Here is the code from Rosetta code with my additions               QuickSort[x_List] :=       Module[{pivot, aa = 0, bb = 0}, If[Length@x <= 1, Return[x]];       pivot = First[x];       aa = If [Length[Cases[x, j_ /; j < pivot]] > 1,          Length[Cases[x, j_ /; j < pivot]] - 1 , Sequence[]];       bb = If [Length[Cases[x, j_ /; j < pivot]] > 1,          Length[Cases[x, j_ /; j > pivot]] - 1 , Sequence[]];        count = count + aa + bb;       Flatten@{QuickSort[Cases[x, j_ /; j < pivot]],          Cases[x, j_ /; j == pivot],          QuickSort[Cases[x, j_ /; j > pivot]]} ; Return[count] ]      now if you run `QuickSort[{4, 3, 2, 1, 5}]` you will get `2+2 Null` instead of 4
