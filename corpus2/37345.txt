I have wondered more and more often lately how the size of an image is handled when displayed or exported. The documentation implies that the via `ImageSize` the size could be set in printer points (per inch). That does however not correspond with the displayed graphics (for instance `ImageSize-> {72 1, 72 1 }`) does not render a generic plot with the expected size of one inch square. (UI magnification at 100%) I am using Mathematica 9 on OS X 10.9 and usually use .eps for exporting plots (since .pdf export doesn't really work that well with fonts and all)
