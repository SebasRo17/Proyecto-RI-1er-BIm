Since a long time I have thrived for being able to program something I can take with me - a very small computer like a programmable calculator, gameboy, pocket PC or cellphone. However, I didn't find anything fitting yet! The thing I'm looking at is the price, because I can't afford to spend too much money on it.   * What are some cheap portable programmable devices? All I'd need is support for uploading assembler code from my computer. I don't care about the display, a simple LCD would be sufficient. Same goes for the buttons I have looked at programmable calculators, portable gaming consoles such as the PSP and more, however didn't find anything that fit :(
