I'm trying to plot this:               i = 0.01;          ListLinePlot[Table[Cos[x]^p, {x, 0, π/2, i}, {p, 0, 1, i}],                   ImageSize -> 400, PlotRange -> {{0, 100}, {0, 1}}]               ListLinePlot[Table[Cos[p x], {x, 0, π/2, i}, {p, 0, 1, i}],                   ImageSize -> 400,   PlotRange -> {{0, 100}, {0, 1}}]      When `i = 0.001`, it takes a lot of time to render and my computer become unusable. Is there something I can do for rendering it faster or at least making the process slower so I can use my computer normally? I have a Nvidia GTX460 video board and I know about the CUDA link, but if it's not asking too much, I'd like to get advice from someone who has more experience than me at such matters.
