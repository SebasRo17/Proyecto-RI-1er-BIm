This is a basic question but I haven't found any answer yet :/ Available appearances for `Button[]` are mentioned in `Help`, those are `"Palette"`, `"FramedPalette"`, `"DialogBox"` and so on. But is this all? How could I get to know? For example there is also used in Help `"NoOp"` option in `MouseAppearance[]`. Are there any others in addition to those mentioned in `Help`. Is there somewhere more info about styles but for different functions too?
