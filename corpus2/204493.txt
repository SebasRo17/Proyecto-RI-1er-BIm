I'm developing a simple 'voting' system for any type of group (political, working team). I was wondering what could be a good system to 'certificate' the votes? For example, a simple db structure is:               PollID, UserId, ChoseID (what user chose), DateTime      What can I do to certify that the vote has not been tampered with? Adding a KEY field resulting from an algorithm? Anything else ?
