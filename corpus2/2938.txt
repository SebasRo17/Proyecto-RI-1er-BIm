`Graphics` only supports machine precision numbers (i.e. number that can be converted to machine precision). Take for example               Graphics[Point[{0, Exp[1000.]}]]      which produces an error because `Exp[1000.]` is too large to be representable as a `double`. What is the _simplest_ way to deal with situations like this? Replacing all too large numbers with just some arbitrary very large machine precision number is fine, as they'll be outside the plot range anyway. I'm sure there must be some built-in function that can fix this easily.
