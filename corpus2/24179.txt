I'm experimenting with embedding a CDF on a Wordpress site and while it mostly works, the plots are running out of room along the right edge. It seems like if the images were floated left they would fit and look like the output does in MMA. This might have a simple answer, yet how to force the plot output to float left? See http://nomtbf.com/2013/04/weibull-vs-exponential-pdfs/ for an example of the issue.
