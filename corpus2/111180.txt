In an application that allows users to define their own tables and columns (details of that are not the focus of this question, but imagine a tool that lets users create their own forms and automatically handles storage, just to get the idea) is it better to store each table and column they create in a "table" table and a "column" table, or to dynamically create tables and columns? This "one table to rule them all" question is somewhat related, but in that case the "table" table is more clearly a bad idea. In this case, if you don't go that route then all your queries will have to be dynamically generated. Even though the argument "don't write yet another application designer tool for non-programmers, so you can keep adding features until you are basically having users develop in a crummy version of, say, Visual Studio, using your custom crummy language" is pretty reasonable, I've had a lot of projects with some version of the user defined tables requirement and this question is about _how_ to implement it. _Whether_ to implement it is another question, but probably too specific to particular applications to be a good question here.
