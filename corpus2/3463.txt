To replace a single variable by another variable, one can simply use the the replace all (`/.`) operator (e.g., `x/(y*z) /. x -> w` returns $\displaystyle \frac{w}{yz}$). How does one replace an expression consisting of multiple variables? Trying to replace the denominator in the previous expression by a single variable fails with the following syntax:               x/(y*z) /. y*z -> w     x/(y*z) /. y*z :> w     x/(y*z) /. (y*z) -> w     x/(y*z) /. (y*z) :> w     x/(y*z) /. Times[y, z] -> w     x/(y*z) /. Times[y, z] :> w      **Edit:** By applying `FullForm`, I see that the variable substitution can be made by the following lengthy expression:               x/(y*z) /. Times[Power[y, -1], Power[z, -1]] -> w^-1      However, this now fails in a case such as the following:               (x + Log[y*z])/(y*z) /. Times[Power[y, -1], Power[z, -1]] -> w^-1      Now one must use something like the following (which does not work).               (x + Log[y*z])/(y*z) /. {Times[Power[y, -1], Power[z, -1]] -> w^-1, Times[y, z] -> w}      Is there a more general way to replace variables with delving into the full form representation?
