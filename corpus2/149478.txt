Ok not really sure if I'm right. I only recently learned that I needed to have contravariant interface to be able to pass that interface as a parameter in C# and this feature was only added in .NET 4.0. So obviously there is some reason you can't do this Covariant or Invariant interfaces and it probably has something to do with passing in, getting out the generic class. I'm not really sure what the limitation here is, and know that I've seen where Contravariant interface can be used where the others can't where can I use Covariant (when is that neccesary?). This is all out of curiosity (I'm very interested in programming concepts surrounding some languages). I would love to see (link would be fine) some examples of why it is necessary to use these features, what would break if you would allow covariant/invariant into contravariant scene and vice versa and where each one shines.
