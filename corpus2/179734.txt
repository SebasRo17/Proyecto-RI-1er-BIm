We want to allow the same core service to be either fully implemented or, as other option, to be a proxy toward a client legacy system (via a WSDL for example). In that way, we have both implementation (proxy & full) and we switch which one to use in the configuration of the app. So in a nutshell, Some desired features:   * Two different implementation (proxy, full) instead of one implementation with a switch inside   * Switch implementation using configuration: dependency injection? reflection?   * Nice-to-have: the packaged delivered to the client doesnâ€™t have to change depending on the choice between proxy or full   * Nice-to-have: Client can develop their custom implementation of the Core Interface and configure the applciation to use that one With this background, the question is: What alternatives we have to choose one implementation or other of an interface just changing configuration? Thanks
