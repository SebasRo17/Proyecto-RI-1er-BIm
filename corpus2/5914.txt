I often need to solve equations for numerical coefficients while preserving numerous variables (e.g. to preserve scaling relations). Thus I end up with a set of solutions like $$ \left\{-\frac{(0.156113\, +0.0384783 i) d^{6/13} f^{6/13} m^{16/13} r^{9/13}}{g^{9/13} L^{6/13}}, -\frac{(0.156113\, -0.0384783 i) d^{6/13} f^{6/13} m^{16/13} r^{9/13}}{g^{9/13} L^{6/13}}, [...] , \frac{0.160785 d^{6/13} f^{6/13} m^{16/13} r^{9/13}}{g^{9/13} L^{6/13}}\right\} $$ where [...] is possible _lots_ more, ugly solutions --- while I just want the last one (for example). **How can I select only the solution with the type of numerical coefficient I want (e.g. Real, or real & positive, etc)?** Solve[eq,var, **dom** ] doesn't seem to work with 'inexact coefficients', and trying things like 'Select[...]' seem to have the same problem. I've found I can brute force proper selection if I just replace every variable with unity (i.e. {Sols} /.f->1 /.d->1 /.m->1 $...$ But that realls sucks... Any help would be appreciated, thanks!
