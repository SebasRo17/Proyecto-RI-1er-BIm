I've been trying to get loglog plots in 3D, but to no avail. My initial approach was to take the logarithm inside the plot i.e               Plot3D[Log[10,function[a, b]],{a, 1, 100000},{b, 1, 1000000}]      but now I'm looking for a way to logarithm-ise the axes as well. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
