In software design, we usually take care of UML diagrams and architecture design. But in case of a data analysis software, we must pay attention to design algorithms and stuff like that. Consider the case of a face detection software which needs AI. Do we need to design AI part of the software explicitly in software design? **P.S:** My manager says that it must set clear in feasibility study and be so clear that we could design it in design steps. Is he correct?
