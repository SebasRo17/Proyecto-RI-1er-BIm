I took the example from this question modified a bit: What is the point of the prototype method?               function employee(name,jobtitle,born)     {     this.name=name;     this.jobtitle=jobtitle;     this.born=born;     this.status="single"     }     employee.prototype.salary=10000000;     var fred=new employee("Fred Flintstone","Caveman",1970);     console.log(fred.salary);     fred.salary=20000;     console.log(fred.salary)      And the output in console is this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YfGwp.png) What is the difference `salary` is in constructor but I still can access it with `fred.salary`, how can I see if is in constructor from code, status is still employee property how can I tell for example if `name` is the one of employee or has been touch by initialization? Why is salary in constructor, when name,jobtitle,born where "touched" by `employee("Fred Flintstone","Caveman",1970);` «constructor»?
