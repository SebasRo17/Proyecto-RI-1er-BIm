I've been developing a free, open source Java database abstraction project (jOOQ) and I have released first stable releases from November 2010 onwards. Feedback has been quite good and constructive, and I am very motivated to continue my work. In the mean time, to get more attention and feedback, I have published articles on   * http://java.dzone.com/   * http://www.theserverside.com/   * http://www.infoq.com/ (they didn't publish my article, though) These are some sample articles so you know the type of article I want to publish:   * http://java.dzone.com/announcements/simple-and-intuitive-approach   * http://java.dzone.com/articles/2011-great-year-stored What other resources would you recommend? Where else should I publish, knowing that   * I want to reach Java/SQL developers and architects / technology decision makers   * I can publish in English, German, French   * I think that my project is suitable for both beginners and pro's (in Java and SQL, or programming in general)
