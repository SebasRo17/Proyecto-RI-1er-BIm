I am a teenage hobbyist in high school, and I mostly release my software as open source; therefore I have little experience actually selling software, let alone in a specific area -- Android phones. Now, I have received requests from several users of one of my applications (basically, an advanced calculator) to create an Android version of it. It is written in C, but I saw the Android NDK and it looks like I could port it _relatively_ easily; also, I believe it would make a lot of sense to have such an app on a phone. I do not have an Android phone myself, and so the incentive is simply potential revenue from the app. However, I have several questions that I am not able to answer myself. So, first, do you think it makes sense at all? Would such an app generate enough revenue to compensate for the porting time? More generally, how much revenue can one expect from an Android app (just looking for a rough approximation, I really have no clue about this)? Secondly, is such porting feasible without actually having an Android phone (I might get access to some for final testing, but I won't have it full-time), justing using the emulator? And last, I have read the standard Google words that publishing is super-easy, etc. Is that actually true? For example, is it necessary to put in substantial advertising work to make the project a success? Thanks a lot!
