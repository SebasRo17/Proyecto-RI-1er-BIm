I'm trying to create a specific outline format to match some course materials I am required to submit in a particular way. I know how to create auto-numbered cells using `Automatic` numbering. The structure I am looking for is something like   * Section 1     * Subsection 1     * Subsection 2     * Subsection 3   * Section 2     * Subsection 4     * Subsection 5   * Section 3     * Subsection 6 etc. I know these is a way to NOT have the `Subsection` cells go back to one at each `Section` heading, but I can't find the way to make that happen. I'd like to be able to move the `Section` cells if necessary but have the `Subsection` cells number from $1$ - whatever and not reset in each section. Is this possible? Any help is appreciated.
