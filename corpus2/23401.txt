I wanted to expand the function $(x+2)^{x+2}$ around $x = -1$, that is, using               Series[(x + 2)^(x + 2), {x, -1, 2}]      and _Mathematica_ returns the same expression. Why does this happen? The first term of a series expansion is simply $1^1 = 1$. However, I cannot even get this, from               Series[(x + 2)^(x + 2), {x, -1, 0}]      ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fC9Oo.png)
