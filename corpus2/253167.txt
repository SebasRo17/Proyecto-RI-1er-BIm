With centralized source control like Perforce and SVN, when they create a branch, they create a whole new directory. However, git and other distributed source control solutions, in my experience, are able to update the branch in place as it were. That is, they apply the differences between the two branches to the files. This seems to me to be the far superior option as it saves huge amount of duplication for large projects, quicker to switch branches etc... What is the reason for this? I can't see any reason why there being a centralized authority affects the clients ability to diff the two branches and modify the changes.
