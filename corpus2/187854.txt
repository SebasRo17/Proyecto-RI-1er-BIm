From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming Extreme Programming is a software development methodology which is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. My Team Lead dislikes Extreme Programming as   * May take more time to complete the project.   * Increases initial cost (20% or more).   * Constant interaction is tiresome.   * Unit tests is hard for database, distributed and GUI. Is there any evidence to support these claims about Extreme Programming or are these fabrications? What arguments can be made where Extreme Programming can actually be harmful to a team or project?
