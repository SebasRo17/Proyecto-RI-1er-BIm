I have been using the function `HistogramList` to generate frequency tables off a data set. The code looks like this:               frequencytable=HistogramList[dataA,{-0.5, 6.5, 1},"PDF"][[2]]      with a numerical output of: > 0.0152, 0.0937, 0.0234, 0.2969, 0.2500, 0.0781, 0.0312 Here is my question. I would like to add the three numbers at the right hand side to one another. Next, I would like to add the three numbers at the left hand side to one another. Last, I would like to subtract the sum of the three numbers on the left from the sum of the three numbers on the right. How do I do that?
