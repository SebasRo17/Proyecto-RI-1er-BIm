I read through a few discussions in SE about Cloud Computing . From them, I understand cloud as "computing / data-storage facility that is owned by a different entity; using hardware & software architecture that make it easily scalable on-demand, therefore support rentable-scalability models." Also, "the owning entity has a big-size data center, where virtualisation concepts are put to use to cater to multiple different customers from same hardware". Plus "redundancy, security etc are assumed to be taken care by the provider. " I read a discussion in SE about explaining Cloud Computing to grandmother. The 'garden vs supermarket', 'own-house vs hotel' examples suit perfectly. With this understanding, I am unable to visualise 'private cloud'. Frankly, 'private cloud' sounds like an oxymoron to me. (relate with 'private supermarket' , 'owned hotel' etc). Pardon my ignorance. So, what is 'private cloud' ?
