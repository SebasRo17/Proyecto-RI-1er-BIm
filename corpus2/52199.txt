I have this experimental data set which I know should follow the Complementary error function. My goal is to find the **Ïƒ of the associated gaussian distribution**. However, I cannot seem to do it in any way using `NonlinearModelFit`. Could you please give me some hints? The data is in a list of lists, e.g.:               data = ToExpression@Import["http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=BtcXHh9c"];      And when plotted it looks like this: ![ListPlot\[Transpose@data\]](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YzFbh.png)
