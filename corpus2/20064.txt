In another post (Is it possible to prerender animation in Wolfram Mathematica?) I got a good way to prerender frames in order to get a smooth animation using ListAnimate. I need to save the Animation in a CDF document so it can be viewed by people using Wolfram CDF Player and not needing to run cells, so I use SaveDefinitions->True within the ListAnimate command. The problem is, when using rasterized frames, ListAnimate never runs and apparently causes a memory overflow. How can I solve this? I use this code for example (which doesn't run when SaveDefinitions is set to True):               exampleFrames =       Table[        DensityPlot[         Evaluate[          Exp[-((x - Cos[t])^2 + (y - Sin[t])^2)/.025]          ],         {x, -1.5, 1.5}, {y, -1.5, 1.5},         ColorFunction -> GrayLevel,         PlotRange -> All,         PlotPoints -> 30,         Frame -> None,         PlotRangePadding -> None         ],        {t, Pi/50, 2 Pi, Pi/50}        ];          rasterizedFrames = Map[Image, exampleFrames];          ListAnimate[rasterizedFrames, SaveDefinitions -> True]      I need this for my dissertation so any help would be really appreciated.
