I hope somebody can help me in this (I guess) simple question: I have a list of variable names `ls={w0,w1,w2}` and another list of values `v={0.1,0.2,0.3}` What I'd like to do is to get the names of the variables from ls and assign to these variables the values in v, that is, to end up with variables w0,w1 and w2 that have the values `0.1`, `0.2` and `0.3`. I've tried things like `ToExpression[ls[[1]]] =ToExpression[v[[1]]]` but I keep getting messages of the form `Set::write: Tag ToExpression in ToExpression[\\[Omega]0] is Protected.` >> Can anybody tell me of a simple way to achieve what I'm looking for? Thanks...
