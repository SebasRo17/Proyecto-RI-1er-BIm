I want to build a trivia app where people can take part in an in person trivia competition from their phone browser. Like, the question comes up on the screen and everyone can answer from their phone. I feel like this is probably already a thing, and would like to contribute to an existing project instead of building from the ground. But I cant find anything like this. Is there anything like this?
