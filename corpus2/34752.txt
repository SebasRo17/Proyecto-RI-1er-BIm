I would like to create a function that acts on whether the input is even or odd, e.g.:               In[644]:= f[a_] = If[EvenQ[a], 2 a, 3 a];               f[2]          Out[645]= 6      I've determined (I think) that this is because `a` is an expression and `QEven` returns false for expressions. How do I hold off evalution of this until input is given? I thought something like `Defer` would work but then it is never evaluated (see below)!               In[641]:= g[a_] = If[Defer[EvenQ[a]], 2 a, 3 a]          Out[641]= If[EvenQ[a], 2 a, 3 a]          In[643]:= g[3]          Out[643]= If[EvenQ[3], 2 * 3, 3 * 3]      Apologies if this gets asked a lot - I assume this is a common issue, but I was unable to come up with appropriate search terms to describe it (I'm not very familiar with Mathematica terminology yet). Thanks!
