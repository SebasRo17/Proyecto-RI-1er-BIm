I'm thinking about open sourcing a project of mine. I'd accept contributions under a CLA that grants me a copyright license (I'll explain what I mean at the end of this question). â€” Now, if someone submits a contribution, is it then okay that I write `Copyright (c) 2013 My-Name` at the top of each file? And mention any contributors in a separate document only, and refer people to the Git commit log and to GitHub statistics if they want details on individual contributors? I think this should be fine with `Copyright (c) My-Name`, since I've been granted a copyright license? If it's not okay, then I suppose the copyright-info-preamble of each source code file would have to include the name of all contributors to that file? Which doesn't seem practical (if there are very many contributors). * * * Here I'll try to explain what I mean with a _"a CLA that grants me a copyright license"_. This is an edited excerpt from a CLA by Google: > .2. [...] You [ _that is, the contributor_ ] hereby grant to [ _My-Name, > that is, me_ ] and to recipients of software distributed by [ _My-Name_ ] a > perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable > copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly > display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and > such derivative works.
