The following code shows that edge labels "cover" edges in `GraphPlot3D`               GraphPlot3D[{{1 -> 2, "1\[Rule]2"}, 4 -> 1, {2 -> 4, "2\[Rule]4"},          1 -> 5, 2 -> 5, 5 -> 4},              EdgeRenderingFunction -> ({If[#3 =!= None,                  Text[#3, Mean[#1], Background -> Yellow], {}], Line[#]} &)]      But if I change `GraphPlot3D` to `GraphPlot`, the edges will go across the labels. How can I keep the labels with the highest z-index? Thank you. **Snapshot** `GraphPlot3D` ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YHrfB.png) `GraphPlot` ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/k4Q3e.png)
