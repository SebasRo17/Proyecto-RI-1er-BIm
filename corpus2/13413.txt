I don't know whether this is a correct question or not, but I played from two days on this problem and still I didn't find a solution. ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zKNjo.png) The save button is enabled whenever we have to specify width,length,height and middleheight of a `Graphics3D`. `Graphics3D` appears whenever we have clicked on the save button depending upon width, length, height and middleHeight values. This is my application concept. For this purpose I wrote a huge amount of code, but I show here only a little bit of the code related to `Graphics3D` and also the sizes of the `Buttons`,`InputFields`and the application-window Size.               Dynamic[Pane[                  Manipulate[designSpace, Paneled -> False,AppearanceElements -> None                            ](*Manipulate is closed here*),              Scrollbars -> {Automatic, Automatic},AppearanceElements -> None, ImageSize -> {560, 310},Alignment -> {Center, Center}                 ](*Pane is closed here*)            ](*Dynamic is closed here*)      Note:In the code designSpace is `Graphics3D` related code. The application window size is {580,480}, `Buttons`,`InputFields` sizes {160,60}, pane size {560,310}. Concept-wise it is working fine but the problem is:   1. `InputFields` and `Buttons` are blinking at the `Graphics3D` rotation time.   2. Some orange box appears around the `InputFields`,`Buttons`and `Graphics3D` whenever we have to double click on the application.   3. If we have clicked on any wall of `Graphics3D`.`createDialog` will appear in that we have to specify the positions, some `Image` overlap on that wall depending upon that specification. The third point concept is not working. This overlaps with the concepts that I already asked about in my earlier posts, but I still don't get it.
