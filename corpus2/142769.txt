Consider:               public class CtorInjectionExample     {         public CtorInjectionExample(ISomeRepository SomeRepositoryIn, IOtherRepository OtherRepositoryIn)         {             this._someRepository = SomeRepositoryIn;             this._otherRepository = OtherRepositoryIn;         }              public void SomeMethod()         {             //use this._someRepository         }              public void OtherMethod()         {             //use this._otherRepository         }     }      against:               public class MethodInjectionExample     {         public MethodInjectionExample()         {         }              public void SomeMethod(ISomeRepository SomeRepositoryIn)         {             //use SomeRepositoryIn         }              public void OtherMethod(IOtherRepository OtherRepositoryIn)         {             //use OtherRepositoryIn         }     }      While Ctor injection makes extension difficult (any code calling the ctor will need updating when new dependencies are added), and method level injection seems to remain more encapsulated from the class level dependency and I can't find any other arguments for/against these approaches. Is there a definitive approach to take for injection? (N.B. I have searched for information on this and tried to make this question objective.)
