How can I draw the 5 interlocking Olympic rings with Mathematica? ![Olympic rings](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fJthQ.png) (SVG version) * * * **Edit** Hard choice, but some pretty cool answers here. I didn't have 3D answers in mind when I posted the question but without a doubt they look much better than the 2D. Very subjective choice for the selected answer but I do like @cormullion's answer.
