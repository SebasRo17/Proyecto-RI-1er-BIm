I am trying to create a plot using `ListLinePlot` in which the x-axis is represented in a logarithmic scale, and is reversed (so larger values are on the right side). I have found that `ScalingFunctions -> {"Reverse"}` will reverse the axis and `ScalingFunctions -> {"Log"}` will scale the axis to a log scale, but the two commands will not work together. Does anyone have any ideas?
