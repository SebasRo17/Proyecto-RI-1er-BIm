I am currently a high school student, I've been assigned to manage a group in my school to develop a mobile app and the problem is that all of us have no experience in making a project in a team and the greater problem is that we have only till the end of the month to submit the app. Can I have some tips to overcome these problem? Also we decided to do the app in Python with Kivy, we know Python.
