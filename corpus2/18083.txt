I wish to solve the following second order partial differential equation $$u_{tt}=c^2 u_{xx}$$ with the initial conditions $$u(x,0)=e^x,\quad u_t(x,0)=\sin x$$ In _Mathematica_ , I evaluated the following code:               DSolve[{D[p[x, t], {t, 2}] == c^2 *(D[p[x, t], {x, 2}]),              p[x, 0] == Exp[x], D[p[x, t], t] == Sin[x]},           p[x, t], {x, t}]      _Mathematica_ responded with > DSolve::deqx: Supplied equations are not differential equations of the given > functions. I think the problem lies in the initial conditions. How can I fix this code?
