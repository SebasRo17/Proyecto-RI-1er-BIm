`FinancialData["name"]` and `FinancialData["name", start]` return respectively; the last known price, and the daily closing values for dates from start until the current date, for the financial entity - `"name"`. One of the possible entities quoted is `"Currency exchange rates"` and while the Documentation's claims hold for the first case ...

There is no mention of this particular missing data in the Documentation although apparently there can be periodic issues with the data sources and while directly accessing these sources offers a possible workaround, this only applies if the sources themselves provide API's for this historical data (which _doesn't_ appear to be the case for one such source - _Yahoo! Finance_ ) The documentation goes on to say: > `FinancialData`provides gateways to external financial data sources. Its use > is subject to any restrictions associated with those sources, and may > require additional licensing. This is perhaps one such instance although few other claimed currency properties seem to be available and/or relevant (at least with my connection?)
