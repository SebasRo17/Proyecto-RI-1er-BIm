I DumpSaved some data from my home laptop, uploaded it onto google drive and now I am trying to open it at my school computer but I am getting errors, even though the data is in the correct directory. My data is bunch of data for different parameter values that I have stored as a function.               out[] := Cases[DownValues[out], _String, Infinity]     out[ToString[DataStep1[[l, 3]]]] = outNR     DumpSave["Renegotiation.mx", out]     << Renegotiation.mx      The data can be found here: The details of DumpSave says that "Files written by DumpSave can only be read on the same type of computer system on which they were written." What is a "type of computer system" ? Both my laptops are PCs with windows. Is there no way for me to read my data at the school laptop? In any event, can you please suggest how I can store data that I can open on different computers?
