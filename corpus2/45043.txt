I would like to input a pure function into a custom written package, but am running into a variety of errors. The package I have created is as follows:               BeginPackage["functions`"]          CosCoeff::usage="CosCoeff[m] returns cheb coeffs of order m of Cosine[2 Pi t]";          Begin["`Private`"]          ClearAll["Global`*"]          CosCoeff[m0_]:=     Module[{m=m0},     f[t]=Cos[2 Pi t];     Tn[t] = ChebyshevT[j, 2*t - 1];      wt[t] = 1/Sqrt[t - t^2];           p=Table[Chop[NIntegrate[f[t]*Tn[t]*wt[t], {t, 0, 1}]/(N[Pi]/2.0)], {j, 0, m-1}];     p[[1]]=p[[1]]/2;     p     ]          End[]     EndPackage[]      This package as stated creates a table containing "m" shifted-Chebyshev coefficients for the function `Cos[2 Pi t]`. How can I input any function, say Sin[2 Pi t], instead of writing a different module for every function I need to use?
