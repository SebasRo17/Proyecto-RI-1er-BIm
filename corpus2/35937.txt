Ok so here is the question: What are the advantages and Disadvantages of Using an Aspect Orientated Programming Paradigm. My advantages and disadvantages thus far: ## Advantages:   * Complements object orientation.    * Modularizes cross-cutting concerns improving code maintainability and understandability.  ## Disadvantage:   * Not the easiest of concepts to grasp - not as well documented as O-O   * O-O goes far enough in the separation of concerns...  Would anyone like to challenge any of these/ add their own? Many Thanks, J
