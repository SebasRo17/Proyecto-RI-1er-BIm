I have this Mixture Distribution of two Normal Distributions:                mix[p_, μ1_, μ2_, σ_] :=       MixtureDistribution[{p,       1 - p}, {NormalDistribution[μ1, σ],       NormalDistribution[μ2, σ]}];      Say $x_1, x_2$ are samples from this mixture. Set $y=x_1+x_2$, so that $y$ is the sum of two samples from the mixture. I now generate 100 $y's$ (with arbitrary p, mu and sigma, each is a sum of two $x$:               mixdat = RandomVariate[mix[0.75, 0.5, -1.5, 0.2], 1000];     mixdatSum =      Total[RandomVariate[mix[0.75, 0.5, -1.5, 0.2], 2]] & /@ Range[100];      mixdatSum contains these 100 values. Now given the data in mixdatSum I want to estimate the Distribution Parameters. So a natural way to solve this would be:               FindDistributionParameters[mixdatSum,      TransformedDistribution[x1 + x2,      Thread[Distributed[{x1, x2},      MixtureDistribution[{p,        1 - p}, {NormalDistribution[μ1, σ],        NormalDistribution[μ2, σ]}]]]]]      Problem is, the sum of a mixture does not follow the mixture distribution, so this does not work and I get lots of errors. However I want to treat the sum of a mixture AS IF IT WERE following the same mixture, for approximation purposes. Is there a way to do this?
