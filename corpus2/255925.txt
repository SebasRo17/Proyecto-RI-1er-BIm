I am looking to build a time management "app" that can be downloaded and used on an individual basis throughout my company. In theory, this app would be used to track time spent on several different projects, thus a need to store/track time based on username or employee ID seems like it would be the best route. I was looking to do this via C# WPF. My confusion arises from the architecture: Do I deploy a separate database per download? Or do I host one main database located on a client/server the entire company can use? From my perception - I don't necessarily see any privacy concerns or a need for a login management system. Simply username (as the PK), project name, hours and date would essentially be all fields in the table. While I say I am going to build it for internal use within my company, it is actually not going to be used BY the company - merely for personal tracking per project. This data will likely not be used (unless the company mandates it) by anyone else other than the person who is on the project.
