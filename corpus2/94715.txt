First I would like to say that I'm not developer, but I love to code whenever I can. I mainly use Perl which is the language I use when doing System Administration. For different reasons (that I'm not sure of) I recently have been told to learn Java by my manager, so I'm starting to do so. I was thinking that I should take advantage to the situation to build some Android Apps. But it seems that Objective C has increased in popularity recently because of the iPhone and iPad. I want to know if it's worth it to develop with Java for Android compared with to develop with Objective C for iPhone (or iPad). Of course, not based on the APP functionality, let's say someone has developed the APP X for both platforms. In which platform would it become the worthiest? And no, I'm not gonna learn both (sadly ain't got much time) Thank you!
