I have two objects, one is a User object and the other is a Content object. The User object has properties like 'reads_articles' or 'reads_books'. The Content object has properties like 'is_article' or 'is_book'. If the two properties match up (i.e. the User reads_articles and the Content is_article), then the User can see the Content. Basically, I am looking for the best solution to approach this without using a switch() statement. I am also wondering if maybe I'm making this too difficult and/or a design pattern is overkill here. Preliminary research has suggested that the Strategy pattern may be the most appropriate, but I'm having a hard time modeling this problem to that pattern. I don't want to hard code the tests - I would really like to come up with a general solution that examines the properties of both classes, and determines whether the Content can be viewed by that User. Clarification: My end goal is an algorithm that will examine the properties of the User and the properties of the Content, and see if they match. Basically, I want to see if the two objects have matching properties (without hardcoding the properties themselves into the algorithm) and do some actions. Not sure if what I want is a pipe dream, so I thought I would ask. Thanks for the help!
