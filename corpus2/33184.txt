I have an expression with subscripted variables. I would like to replace all those terms with other symbols. For example, $P_1 + P_2^3 \rightarrow P1 + P2^3$ I used the following code but it doesn't work               X = Subscript[P, 1] + Subscript[P, 3]^2 - I*Subscript[P, 5]     X /. {Subscript[P, n_] -> Pn}      If I replace `Subscript[P, n_]` with `P[n]` then it works (e.g. $P_1$ will be replaced with `P[1]`) but I don't want the bracket. I want `P1` instead. Is there any way to solve this?
