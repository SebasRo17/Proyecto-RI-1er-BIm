So my copy of the classic book, Mastering Regular Expressions, just arrived, and I'm scanning through it. The cover (third edition) says, "for Perl, PHP, Java, .NET, Ruby, and More!" Well, it does have a full chapter for each of Perl, PHP, Java, and .NET - but no chapter on Ruby, or, more importantly to me, on Python. Although the index lists a few points of Python's differences (such as how it handles newlines), there's not even a table of them, much less an entire chapter. Which of the four covered languages, is Python's regex engine most similar to? More importantly, _how_ similar, and what are the major differences? Note - I don't mean how regexes are _used_ in Python (versus, say Perl) - I know and use the `re` module. I'm only interested in the syntax differences of the _actual_ regexes.
