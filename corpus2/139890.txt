What's the role of a Project Manager in Scrum? I have heard that it is not advisable for the PM to be a SCRUM Master which I can see as making sense as the PM oversees the project whereas the SCRUM Master is more concerned with managing the work packages. To my mind it would seem that having a PM as SCRUM Master goes against managin by exception, one of the principles of PRINCE2. The PM should be more concerned with:   * establishing the scope of the project, ensuring the business case for the project remains valid   * planning the number of iterations   * maintaining the overall project plan including software release dates   * acquiring external resources needed by the Scrum team e.g. users for User Acceptance Testing   * managing risks and issues which are escalated by the Scrum team   * communicating with the executive including reporting progress Could any PM's (or SCRUM Masters) experienced in managing agile projects using SCRUM give their experience/opinion on whether the two roles could/should be combined?
