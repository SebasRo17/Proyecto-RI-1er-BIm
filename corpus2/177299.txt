We are a group of people who are about to start a software cooperative, which means all of us (and other future workers) will be the owners of the 'company' rather than having bosses and employees. We do this from ideological reasons but also because we believe this allows many advantages - power of democracy (see SE..) , motivation, creativity, good work relations and atmosphere and more. We do face some questions about how exactly ownership of our products should be split, should we give different percentage for different people which put in a different amount of work hours or brings expert knowledge. We want people to feel they get what they deserve, not more, not less, and we're not sure just splitting it even will give this feeling. What are some good guidelines for solving these questions in a cooperative?
