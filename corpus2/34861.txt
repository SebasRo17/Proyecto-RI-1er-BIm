Microsoft has moved away from the COM stack, VB6 is so last century and .Net rules the (MS) roost. Yet I find myself still banging out reams of VBA code am I dinosaur? The need for VBA is a new project automating Excel seeing as you ask. I've tried to doing the same kind of thing using VSTO and it was just too damn buggy/hard/inefficient with a broken development model. I can't get rid of the feeling that I'm missing something, OTOH I really can't see a better way of solving this problem. What are your thoughts?
