One of my _Mathematica_ interests is in problems related to the formatting of output. Getting nice formatting from _Mathematica_ is often frustrating, but occasionally _Mathematica_ will delight me by making a formatting task, which I anticipated would be difficult, easy. I want to share one such recent experience by posing it as a question. > Can you create a 10-row, 5-column table in _Mathematica_ presenting the > results from running a dice game simulation in which a pair of dice is > rolled 50 times? The table should look like this: ![dice.png](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YhzUZ.png) Your solution may show a different sequence of dice rolls. Note that rolls of seven are highlighted in red. That feature must be reproduced. I post this question, not because it is difficult (it isn't), but because I had fun with it myself. I will post my answer in 48 hours, providing nobody posts an equivalent answer beforehand.
