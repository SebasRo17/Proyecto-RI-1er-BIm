I am a new learner of C language, my question is about pointers. As far i learned and searched pointers can only store addresses of other variables, but cannot store the actual values(like integers or characters). But in the code below the char pointer c actually storing a string. It executes without errors and give the output as 'name'.               #include <stdio.h>     main()     {     char *c;     c="name";     puts(c);     }      can anyone explain how a pointer is storing a string without any memory or if memory is created where it is created and how much size it can be created. I tried using it with the integer type pointer               #include <stdio.h>     main()     {     int *c;     c=10;     printf("%d",c);     }      but it gave an error               cc     test.c   -o test     test.c: In function ‘main’:     test.c:5:3: warning: assignment makes pointer from integer without a cast   [enabled by default]     c=10;     ^     test.c:6:2: warning: format ‘%d’ expects argument of type ‘int’, but argument 2 has type ‘int *’ [-Wformat=]     printf("%d",c);     ^      Pointers stores the address of variable then why is integer pointer different from character pointer. If there is something i am missing about of pointers plz explain. Thanks in advance.
