I'm looking for something similar to `AbsoluteOptions` but that can be evaluated inside the function. That is, I want to read the absolute settings of options specified in the current context. For example, instead of:               AbsoluteOptions[      Plot[       Sin[x]       , {x, 0, 2 Pi}       , PlotRange -> Automatic       ]      , PlotRange]      > {PlotRange -> {{0., 6.28319}, {-1., 1.}}} I would like to have something like               Plot[      Sin[x]      , {x, 0, 2 Pi}      , PlotRange -> Automatic      , Epilog -> Inset[        "PlotRange is " <> ToString@AbsoluteOptions[PlotRange]        , {4, 1}]      ]      > ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mt4I6.png) is it possible to read the absolute settings for options associated with the current function environment?
