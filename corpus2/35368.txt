Say I've got a polynomial of $4$ or $5$ variables (we'll say $d_1$, $d_2$, $d_3$, and $d_4$). How would you collect the terms where each $d$ is raised to an even power? It collects the terms of the polynomial that are of the form $$ d_1^{2 \cdot k_1} \cdot d_2^{2 \cdot k_2} \cdot d_3^{2 \cdot k_3} \cdot d_4^{2 \cdot k_4} $$ for $k_1,\dotsc,k_5$ being integers. Example: $$ d_1^2 \cdot d_2^4 \cdot d_3^2 \cdot d_4^0 + d_1^0 \cdot d_2^3 \cdot d_3^2 \cdot d_4^3 $$ would take the $$ d_1^2 \cdot d_2^4 \cdot d_3^2 \cdot d_4^0 $$ term and not the $$ d_1^0 \cdot d_2^3 \cdot d_3^2 \cdot d_4^3 $$ term.
