I have a web service. Right now, I have passwords stored in plain text in a MySQL table on my server. I know this isn't the best practice, and that is why I am working on it. Why should passwords be encrypted if they are being stored in a secure database? I realize that if someone hacks in to my database they will get everyone's password. But I have other problems if someone gets in my database, for example, deleting data. The scenario I can think of is that you are hacked. You restore a database from a couple of hours ago and everything is well. However, if your passwords are plaintext... The thief has all the passwords and you have to reset them all. Hassle to your users. If the passwords were encrypted, you could just restore to previous database. Is this correct thinking?
