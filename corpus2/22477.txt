So I have this dynamical system given by: $$ \left\{\begin{aligned} x' &= a(y-\phi(x))\\ y' &= x-y+z\\ z' &= -by \end{aligned}\right. $$ where $\phi(x) = \mu x^3 - \nu x$ and $a,b,\mu,\nu$ are positive real parameters. Obviously, the origin is an equilibrium point. I now want to determine what kind of equilibrium this is, which depends on the signs of the real parts of the eigenvalues of the matrix of the linearized system. The linearized system is given by: $$ X'=AX\\ A=\begin{pmatrix} a\nu & a & 0\\ 1 & -1 & 1\\ 0 & -b & 0 \end{pmatrix} $$ The characteristic polynomial is then given by: $$ p(\lambda)_{a,b,s} = -\lambda^3 + (a\nu-1)\lambda^2 + (a\nu-b+a)\lambda + ab\nu $$ which is pure hell to solve (which may have something to do with the fact that this family of systems is chaotic...). Anyway, I tried throwing this into Mathematica and it just spits out about 4 pages of symbols. Then I tried `Reduce` in order to find out whether these eigenvalues had negative or positive real parts. Sadly, this gives me about 15 pages of symbols, which doesn't really help. Does anybody know a good way to deal with this? # Tl;Dr How can I compute the signs of the real parts of above matrix A, for all possible values of $a,b,\nu>0$? Criteria for them to be positive will also do. # Edit I tried the following input:               A[a_, b_, \[Sigma]_] := {{a*\[Sigma], a, 0}, {1, -1, 1}, {0, -b, 0}}     eig[a_, b_, \[Sigma]_] := Eigensystem[A[a, b, \[Sigma]]]     Table[Reduce[eig[a, b, \[Sigma]][[1]][[i]] > 0, {a, b, \[Sigma]}, Reals], {i, 1, 3}]      The output is displayed by Mathematica as:               A very large output was generated. Here is a sample of it:     {<<1>>, <<1>>, <<1>>}      Basically it is a list with a lot of different cases. This is of course to be expected, but the real problem is that there are tons of `Root`s in it...
