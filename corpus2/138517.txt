Java is known to be portable; _"compile once, run anywhere"_. I know this is often true because I have many times deployed **jar** or **war** without any cross-platform troubles. Still, I am left wondering if this is always true. For example, Swing applications look different between different OS platforms. Also, JDK-1.7 is still a preview release for Mac OS X. _**So, what are the common problems that prove that Java applications are not entirely cross platform?_**
