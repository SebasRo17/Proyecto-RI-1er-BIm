I'm interested in how browser layout engines like gecko, webkit and trident are architected from a high level. what are the key abstractions? how are they layered? what are the inputs/outputs for the different abstractions? Is there a diagram or article that explains this particularly well? I am sure the implementations vary, but I'm generally curious about how all the pieces fit together. I realize webkit is open source and I can just look at the code, but I wouldn't know where to start.
