Based on the following Code (yet the white text in the image is added with PPT), I would like to have an image fit within one of the rectangle. For Example the image from there : http://dailytechgadgets.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/old-ferrari.jpg 2 main problem : Although I know about Texture[], I have not been able to use it in my rectangle, nor drawing the correct polygon, or the correct vertex coordinates. The image might not be of the same ratio, so I would like to crop it accordingly. I have not been able to yet without deforming the image. My Ideal OutPut below : ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZxLCi.png)               c0 = {RGBColor[23/85, 29/255, 142/255], RGBColor[244/255, 1, 59/255],            RGBColor[1, 0, 32/85], RGBColor[18/85, 72/85, 197/255]}          Graphics[{EdgeForm[Thickness[.005]], White,       Rectangle[{0, 0}, {160, 90}], Black, Opacity[.7],       Rectangle[{0, 0}, {80, 63}], White, Opacity[1],       Rectangle[{80, 0}, {160, 63}], Opacity[1],       Flatten@({Flatten@(Table[            RandomChoice[{GrayLevel[.15], c0[[#]]}], {3}] & /@           Range[2, 4, 1]),        MapThread[        Function[{Xs, Ys},          Rectangle[{Xs, Ys}, {Xs + 16, Ys + 9}]], {Flatten@          Table[Range[0, 32, 16], {3}],          Flatten@(Table[#, {3}] & /@             Range[63, 81, 9])}]}\[Transpose])},       Method -> {"ShrinkWrap" -> True}, ImageSize -> 500]
