I have a bivariate normal distribution and I am trying to calculate the probability of finding a point at a certain distance from the mean, so far with limited success. My approach has been to build the two normal distributions, and then form a product distribution:               px = NormalDistribution[-3.89764, 0.08369444426];     py = NormalDistribution[1.29137, 0.0175124];     pxy = ProductDistribution[px, py];      I can plot this and things look fine, but I can't seem to get the syntax correct for the probability calculation. I want to calculate the probability of finding x between -3.98529 and -3.80999, and y between 1.27792 and 1.30482. I can do this in 1D if I take just one of the normal distributions and do:               prob = Probability[x > -3.98529  && x < -3.80999, x \[Distributed] NormalDistribution[-3.89764, 0.08369444426]];      although so far I haven't been able to extend the syntax to the 2D case. I'm still reasonably new to Mathematica and any help will be much appreciated!
