I want to `NMaximize` an expression for example, say $f(x_0,x_1,\dots)=x_0+x_1+2 x_2+...$ subject to the constraints $(x_1+x_1^2+x_2+x_3 x_1+...)/(x_0+x_0^2+x_1x_2+...)$ and there are a certain number of these constraints such that the constraints are $ \geq 0$ and also we know that $f(x_0,x_1,\dots)\geq0$. How do I do this??? Is there is literature available for these kinds of problems and even problems that are more complicated than this??. I have tried `NMaximize` and `NMinimize` for this problem and these do not give me the correct results that I expect. Further the `NMaximize`/`NMinimize` even says that no solution is found. How do I tackle such problems???
