Here's an equation that I need to solve for $t_k$ $$ \theta_0 = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{2(w_x - m)}{p - g {t_k}^2 - 2 t_k w_y}\right) - {\frac{1} {r}} \left( \left(\frac{m}{t_k}\right)^2 + \left( \frac{p - g {t_k}^2}{2t_k} \right)^2 \right) $$ All other variables ($m,p,r,g,w$) are constants. _Mathematica_ **fails** solve it with the constants in place, but **succeeds** when the actual values are substituted in, so I know it's **possible**. Unfortunately, I need the general form for a computer program. I'm certain it's failing due to the $tan^{-1}$. So is there a way to convince _Mathematica_ that the $tan^{-1}$ won't do anything funky on the interval in which I'm interested and just solve for the general case? Here's the code.               ass[c_] := c /. {p -> -400, g -> -4/50, m -> -300, a -> 0.45/50, r -> 27, u -> -2.3, v -> 0}     vx[t_] := (m/t) - u     vy[t_] := (p - g t^2)/(2 t) - v     rat[t_] := Simplify[-vx[t]/vy[t]]     ksq[t_] := (vx[t])^2 + (vy[t])^2     wholeWeak[t_] := ArcTan[rat[t]] - 1/(2 r^2 a)*ksq[t]
