Suppose a piece of software is distributed under some permissive license, e.g. BSD. Now, I modify this software and want to distribute my derivative work. My questions:   * Who is the owner of the derivative? Is it the original author, the new author or there is joint ownership?   * Is a copyright notice (say under the original copyright) sufficient to establish the new ownership?
