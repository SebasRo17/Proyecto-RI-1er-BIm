I'm starting a game project in C++ using the SFML. It provides various classes for handling graphics, input, etc, but I would like to wrap it all up in a single `Media` class. I believe that by doing so, I could simplify my effort and have the class take care of the details, limiting the amount of code I have to write and therefor limiting chances for a bug to sneak past my eyes. However, I have read several times that monolithic, do-it-all classes such as this might not be a good idea. Why is that?
