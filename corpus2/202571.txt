At a recent job interview, I couldn't answer a question about SOLID \-- beyond providing the basic meaning of the various principles. It really bugs me. I have done a couple of days worth of digging around and have yet to come up with a satisfactory summary. The interview question was: > If you were to look at a .Net project that I told you strictly followed > SOLID principles, what would you expect to see in terms of the project and > code structure? I floundered around a bit, didn't really answer the question, and then bombed out. How could I have better handled this question?
