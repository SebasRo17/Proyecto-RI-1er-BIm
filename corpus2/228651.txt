I am a member of a small team who developed software to control the hardware of a robotic device. Now the customer demands to see our commercial code. Our promise was just to develop the software and make his machine work. (He failed to program the robot himself, that is why he hired us). But the project did not start as a hiring agreement, more as a develop and make it work, we did lots of research to make his robot even possible to work I wonder if we should give the source code? I have serious doubts about releasing the code. I believe the customer is planning to steal our c++ / c# code. We provided him the executables installed on the finished programmed robots. Our code wasn't developed just for his robotics device, but is part of our libraries we use commonly in various projects. When can a customer claim that he owns software? And when he does what does it mean. I mean having the c++ code, having a disassembler code, having c# code? Where does it end? We gave our software to an escrow agent, and we believe that is fair. But giving them our code seams to us unfair, knowing that customer will then go on to develop based upon our code. Parts of the code also use a home developed software protection, which we cannot give due to that it is used in other products.
