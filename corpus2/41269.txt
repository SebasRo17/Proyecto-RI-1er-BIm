Is there a way to fully specify the ordering of elements in an algebraic group? (This ordering affects the output of several other group-theoretical operations.) For example, how can I set the ordering of elements in `SymmetricGroup[3]` to be precisely this               Cycles[{{}}],     Cycles[{{1, 2, 3}}],     Cycles[{{1, 3, 2}}],     Cycles[{{1, 2}}],     Cycles[{{1, 3}}],     Cycles[{{2, 3}}]      The docs say that one can control the ordering of group elements by specifying a suitable value for the `GroupActionBase` option, but I have not been able to come up with a value for this option that will result in the ordering shown above.
