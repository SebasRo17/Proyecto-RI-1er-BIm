I know that Subversion (what we're using at work) can be configured to require comments on commits, however I'm not in a position of power to simply turn this on. I know that _my_ reason for commenting my commits is because it is useful, if only as a memory-jogger, to quickly understand the reason behind the commit. However, this doesn't seem to be enough to combat the two responses I always get:   1. It takes too long and I just want to get my changes into the repo.   2. It's easy enough to just look at the diffs. I even show them the value of simply putting in a JIRA issue ID and how it automatically gets tied to the issue, but still no dice with them. Worst of all, the person who _can_ make the call is in the same camp: doesn't want to bother and is fine with looking at diffs. I know it's the right thing to do, but how can I make them see the light? Even if I can't convince my fellow devs, how can I convince management that it's the right thing to do for the business?
