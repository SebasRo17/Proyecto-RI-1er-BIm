I've recently "discovered" mind mapping and even found some people here recommending it. It seems like a real handy tool, but I'm not really sure how to apply it to my work and/or hobby projects. I _really_ want to organize my time and work, because I feel like my projects are stagnating lately, and that doesn't really feel nice. So I'm interested in any tips you have if you're using mind maps, how do you organize your projects, TODOs, ideas..? For example: do you keep separate mind maps for projects, tasks, ideas, or do you have separate mind maps for each project? How do you organize your project mind maps? Please share your thoughts and ideas. (Feel free to suggest alternative methods if you think mind maps suck, but state your reasons) _[Can we make this community wiki since there is no "right" answer?]_
