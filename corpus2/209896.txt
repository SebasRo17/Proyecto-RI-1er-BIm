I have a controller in my mvc4 web application in which there is an action that needs to call another function. What happens in that function i.e. the return value is not important for my action. How i can call that function and never wait for it to be executed? I think it can be done by async but my point is not to use resources, just call the function and never wait for it what ever happens. Please give me some advise.
