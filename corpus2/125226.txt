Im researching TDD, I'm not really sure how to write a test before I have written production code. The problem is that TDD states that you make assertions and then write your code so that these assertions pass. But You have not created any classes yet (as part of the production code) so how are you meant to write the tests if you dont have any classes with which to assert. Hope someone can explain....
