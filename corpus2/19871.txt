I want to use custom transformation functions in Simplify, but mathematica does not seem to use them properly. Consider the following               t1[a]:=1     t2[b]:=0     FullSimplify[a+b, TransformationFunctions->{t1,t2}]      As intended this evaluates to `1`. However, if I add the standard transformation functions nothing happens:               FullSimplify[a+b, TransformationFunctions->{Automatic,t1,t2}]      This gives `a+b`. Why did Mathematica forget about my custom functions? Ideas?
