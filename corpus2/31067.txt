Is it possible to revert a notebook to its earlier version via the Mathematica's Notebook History panel? It would be nice if I could select a point in time in the bottom graph and revert back to that version: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wyPoB.png) When hovering over the blue dots on the upper graph, you can see the previous and the current contents of the changed cells, so Mathematica must store this somewhere. Maybe this could even be used instead of a better undo implementation.
