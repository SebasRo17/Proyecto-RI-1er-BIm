Though my question my be related to this one, it doesn't look like it can easily be solved in the same way, so I hope not to be double-posting. I am trying to insert a framed number/text into a graphics using `Epilog`. The text (black), the background (white) and the frame (coloured, e.g. orange) shall be of different colours. As a minimal working example, the following code indeed produces the desired result:               Graphics[{       LightGray, Disk[],        Inset[Framed[Style[ToString[text], Black, 50],         Background -> Pink,          FrameStyle -> {Orange}]]}]      ![first example](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vFvKQ.png) Yet, when I try to change the background colour to `White`, it simply is ignored!               Graphics[{       LightGray, Disk[],        Inset[Framed[Style[ToString[text], Black, 50],         Background -> White,          FrameStyle -> {Orange}]]}]      ![second example](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GlKCt.png) I know I could also apply the `Background` to the `Inset` rather than to the `Framed`, but that unfortunately results in the background colour slightly extending beyond the frame. I am using Mathematica version 6. Any help on this would be greatly appreciated!
