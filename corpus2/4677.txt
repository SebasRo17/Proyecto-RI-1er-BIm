I would like to solve for $P(t)$, in Mathematica, a Volterra integral equation of the 2nd kind. It is: $$P(t) = R_0(t) + \int_0^t P(t') R_0(t-t')dt'$$ I know the function $R_0$ and would like to find a general way to solve for $P(t)$ given any $R_0$. I am aware that it is a convolution and can be solved in Laplace domain but I do not want to do it that way since inverting the transform brings about a whole other set of problems for me.
