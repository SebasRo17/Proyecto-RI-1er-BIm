Given three vectors, `{2, 0, 0}`, `{0, 2, 2}`, `{2, 2, 3}`, how could I see if they are all on the the same line, plane, or all of r3 in _Mathematica_? I can graph them all, like:               data = {{1, 2, 3}, {3, 4, 5}, {5, 6, 7}};     Graphics3D[Arrow[{{0, 0, 0}, #}] & /@ data]      but how can I say take two of them, draw a plane from them, and visually see the 3rd vector in relation to the plane?
