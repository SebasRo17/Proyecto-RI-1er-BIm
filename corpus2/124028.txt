I have a CS undergrad degree and have been programming for several years with my current company, messed around with Objective-C by making a few console apps and a few simple apps that I ran in the simulator: all basic stuff. My company asked me to take on our in-house iOS development and they offered to send me "away" for training. Has anyone been to either the Big Nerd Ranch or AboutObjects iOS training? Was it a worthwhile experience? Did you learn anything you couldn't have learned from books or other resources?
