# Context I'm trying to setup a connection between _Mathematica_ and Google Docs. Specifically, I would like to be able to **export** data to a Google Spreadsheet (Note: if the spreadsheet is public it's very easy to import data to _Mathematica_ , so the problem here is only how to **export** data to a Google Spreadsheet). I have little knowledge of Java, but as far as I could read in many posts and documentations (for instance, here, here, here, here, here, here), there are several Java commands and classes involved in the process. I believe there are basically two steps involved in this problem: **1)** Get the OAuth authentication from Google (you can get familiar with OAuth here); **2)** Export to Google Spreadsheet using GoogleData libraries (found here). I know there is a commercial package doing exactly that (link), but I would like to be able to control everything from _Mathematica_. # Attempt As said, I have little knowledge of Java. So this is not a serious attempt to solve this problem, but only a concatenation of ideas (hoping someone could actually help me in the process). I believe the first step to achieve the _Mathematica_ -Google Docs connection is to modify the Google Account security definitions (admin.google.com/AdminHome) to allow API access and also generate an OAuth- key. So far, so good. From now on, I'm completely lost. I believe the next step would be: **1)** Create the OAuth token using the OAuth-key from Google. Something like this:               token = HTTPClient`OAuthAuthentication[     "ConsumerKey" -> "mywebaddress.com",      "ConsumerSecret" -> "OAuth-key from Google",      "RequestEndpoint" -> "https://accounts.google.com/OAuthGetRequestToken",     "AuthorizeEndpoint" -> "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",      "AccessEndpoint" -> "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token"];      Do I need anything else inside the token?) **2)** URLFetch the data with the correct methods A list of methods to manipulate a Google spreadsheet can be found here. However, I'm not able to put them in the correct syntax inside _Mathematica_. Something like this:               url="https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/cells/{spreadsheet_key}/{active_sheet}/       private/full/{active_cell}/sheet.setColumnWidth(1, 200)"     URLFetch[url,"OAuthAuthentication" -> token]      So, when I try to use the code above I get the following error messages: > HTTPClient`OAuthSignURL::nopt: The option OAuthAuthentication is missing in > HTTPClient`OAuth`Private`OAuthURLFetchList[https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/cells/{sheet_key}/{sheet_sheet}/private/full/{sheet_cell}/sheet.setColumnWidth(1, > 200),{CredentialsProvider->None,<<1>>,<<1>>,OAuthAuthentication-><<30>>[<<30>>[<<30>>[<<30>>[<<1>>]]]]}]. > General::stop: Further output of HTTPClient`OAuthSignURL::nopt will be > suppressed during this calculation. I'm clearly doing lots of wrong things, however I believe someone in MMA.SE could help me to achieve this connection between _Mathematica_ and Google Docs.
