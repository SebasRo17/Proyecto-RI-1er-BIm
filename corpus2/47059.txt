For example, after some computations mathematica outputs $$ \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k g_k z^{k+4}}{(1-z)^3} $$ and we assume that $$G(z)= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} g_k z^k $$ so the question is: how to force mathematica to simplify the first sum into the form $$ \frac{z^5}{(1-z)^3} G'(z) $$ **Edit** : In fact, the sequence `g[k]` and its generating function `G[z]` are unknown and I would keep them in a symbolic way. So the _Mathematica_ code could look like this:               G[z_] := Sum[g[k]*z^k, {k, 0, \[Infinity]}]     Some_function[Sum[k*g[k]*z^{k + 4}/(1 - z)^3, {k, 0, \[Infinity]}]]      > >     z^5/(1-z)^3 G'[z] >   I mean, after defining function `G[z]` (maybe it should be defined in some other way), one can use `Some_function` to transform some series into the formula that operates on the function `G[z]`. So the question is how to write such `Some_function`? I hope that clarify the problem.
