I couldn't imagine using terminology like "code smell", scrum "chickens", "pigs" at my workplace. These types of terms just wouldn't fit in to my environment. My co-workers would look at me, and tell me to grow up, or stop being offensive or similar. Does anyone else find terminology used on this site, or other related terminology uncomfortable to use at work?
