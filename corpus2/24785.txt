Values like a +0. I are really annoying. Answers from How to reduce expressions with complex coefficients in the form of a+0.*Iï¼Ÿ Is there a way to globally set when to treat a very small number as zero? give me some clue, but I find `$Post = Chop[#, 10^-16] &;` doesn't work, for example :               Print[MatrixForm[FourierDCT[FourierDCT[{0, 0, 1, 0, 0}, 2], 3]]]      gives (0. -5.55112*10^-17 1. 1.38778*10^-17 1.38778*10^-17 ), which means the small digits still exist.
