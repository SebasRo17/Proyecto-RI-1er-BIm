I saved a expresion to a file like this               Export["file.dat",Compress@myExpression];      Then (i don't know why) when I import the file i get the compressed expresion embedded in a nested list like this:               test = Import["file.dat"] (* test -> {{ compressedString }} *)      So I use this to Uncompress the expresion:               myExp = Uncompress@First@Flatten@Import["file.dat"];      And I get my expresion back correctly, but i get these msg               Union::normal: Nonatomic expression expected at position 2 in <<1>>. >>     Union::normal: Nonatomic expression expected at position 2 in <<1>>. >>      Should I worry about those msg? Why am I getting those? You can check for yourselves: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/35192406/bad.dat
