I have a function recursively defined as follows: $a_{n+1}-1=(a_n-1)\times lpf(a_n)$, whe $lpf(x)$ is the least prime factor of $x$. Now, given an initial value of $a_0$, I would like to find the smallest value of $a_n$ such that $a_n$ is prime. Here is my attempt at a code, with $a_0=6$. `NestWhileList[((#1 - 1)*FactorInteger[#1][[1, 1]] + 1) &, 6, ! PrimeQ]` However, my code always simply returns the initial value of $a_0$. What am I doing wrong here?
