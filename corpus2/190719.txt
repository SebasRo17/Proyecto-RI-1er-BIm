What is the difference between the terms _concurrent_ and _parallel_ execution? I've never quite been able to grasp the distinction. The tag defines concurrency as a manner of running two processes simultaneously, but I thought parallelism was exactly the same thing, i.e.: separate threads or processes which can potentially be run on separate processors. Also, if we consider something like asynchronous I/O, are we dealing with concurrency or parallelism?
