I have some legacy code, which uses _Lisp_ as it's scripting language. To broaden, ease and accelerate scripting I'd like to replace _Lisp_ by _Javascript_. In order to be able to built on all present scripting files, I first need to translate all `lsp` to `js`. Now I found _parenscript_ but am not yet sure what it is good for (seems to modify Javascript to be able to run lisp, which is not what I want). Also there are some converters on the web, which seem to work quite well. Has anyone already done this and can share some experiences, best pracises and tools?
