I touch-type since several years, but very often I need to switch between different applications. For text editing I don't need the mouse, but as soon as I need a web browser, I switch to the mouse. I guess I loose a lot of time and energy doing this. Since I do web development I often switch between keyboard and mouse. Do you have a working solution? Please don't tell me about browser plugins you have never used yourself. Thank you.
