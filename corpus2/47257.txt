I am referring to this example at the reference page for the extreme value distribution: http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/ExtremeValueDistribution.html#6764486 The first three commands seem to be running ok, but the last line of code just will not stop evaluating on my machine (MathematicaMark9 result > 1.5) - somthing seems to be very wrong:               Show[DiscretePlot[Mean[max\[ScriptCapitalD]], {n, 2, 100}, PlotStyle -> Orange],       Plot[approxMean, {n, 2, 100}, PlotRange -> All, PlotStyle -> Directive[Thick, Dashed]]]      What am I doing wrong? Or is that a mistake in the documentation or an error in Mathematica 9.0.1? _Edit: I added the_ `bugs` _tag because it seems clear by now that this is really a bug in Version 9.0.1, see answer and comments below._
