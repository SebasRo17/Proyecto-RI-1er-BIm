My question is related to C++ but it comes from Java actually. When I was programming Java I had multiple classes, which were derived from a base "Test" class. Their purpose was to test things - run tests (unit tests/not unit tests). In order to run a test, I had a `public static void main` in every class. So the matter of running such a test was to click run in _Eclipse/Netbeans_ , whatever good IDE. I know this question maybe IDE dependent, it actually boils down to a makefiles, but is it possible to maintain a similar structure in C++ IDEs? Actually my question is: **how do you deal with tests?** Do you put a huge main method with some switch/enum based statements to run the tests or make different build configurations for each test, or have different solution to this? I know this question won't get a straightforward answer, but I'm curious how to deal with it so I can choose something for myself.
