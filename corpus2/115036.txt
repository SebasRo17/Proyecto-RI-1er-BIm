I have a website that allows users to register for accounts, login, and renew an annual membership fee. They can also update their personal profile, their personal profile, look at a list of their employees, make bulk payments for their employees, view receipts and invoices, etc. For non-members it's a regular website with a lot of pages, but for members, it has quite a few member only areas, with more to come (Such as forums). It also has a job listings page, course registrations, etc. **What are some useful "metrics" I can collect to give me meaningful information about the site, that I can share with my clients.** I really don't know a lot about collecting data about this kind of thing, and would like to learn. I already have a dashboard where the admins can view/export registrations this week and registrations by week for the past 30 weeks. I've been able to show them that registrations spiked after sending out an email about the new system. I'm think I'll also be adding stats about how often users update their profiles and how many users have updated their profile that day/week. Thanks
