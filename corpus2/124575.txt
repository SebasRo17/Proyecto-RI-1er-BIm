I get the impression that in practice, debuggers are rarely used for Rails applications. (Likewise for other Ruby apps, as well as Python.) We can compare this to the usual practice for Java or VisualStudio programmers --they use an interactive debugger in a graphical IDE. How do people debug Rails applications _in practice_? I am aware of the variety of debuggers, so no need to mention those, but do serious Rails programmers work without them? If so, why do you choose to do it this way? It seems to me that console printing has its limits when debugging complex logic.
