I'm trying to split the strings of chemicals into their elements and numbers. See this example `"Fe3O4"` will be split into `{"Fe","3","O","4"}` I've tried using `StringSplit` and various `_LowerCaseQ` type patters but it isn't working. I've also tried using `StringSplit[#,""]` to split everything and then finding the lower case characters and putting it back together but I haven't got it to work. Any solution would be greatly appreciated.
