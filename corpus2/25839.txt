Say in Documentation Center -> ImageData -> EXAMPLES ->   Basic Examples you find an image of a planetary body (Mars?). Can one obtain the file source for this image wich is copied   into a Mathematica line? The image is originated for shure in   Mathematicas images samples somewhere in its folders.   What I mean however is to get the info rigth from the picture   in that Notebook.
