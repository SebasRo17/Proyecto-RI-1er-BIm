I just wonder what is the biggest trouble developers encounter when debugging? I can think of three answers but I am not sure whether they are correct:   1. **Trouble in locating the bug?** But most of the times the crash stack traces can provide enough info in locating the bug.   2. **Trouble in figuring out the reason and fixing the bug?** But if you can locate the bug, then probably you got the rough idea of how to fix it.   3. **Trouble in applying the fix?** Probably, some tricky bugs force developers to make changes in a lot of places, thus breaking the structure/design of the original program. But I'm not sure whether this is a trouble.  This question may be too general, but I'll be happy if I can get some feedbacks from you guys. Also, if you have other troubles in debugging please point out. Thank you a lot!
