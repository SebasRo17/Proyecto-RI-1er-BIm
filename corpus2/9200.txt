I have a generic mouse with back/forward buttons. Those buttons are recognized by the system - I can use `xev` to see that they generate events for buttons number 8 and 9. I am so used to using them for web browsing, that I sometimes end up pressing them when I'm browsing through Mathematica's help system. Is there some way to bind those buttons to the back/forward functions in the help system? I looked around in the settings but haven't found anything. I'm using Mathematica 8.0 in Linux, if this is relevant. Any ideas?
