It seems that when I run `Play` in Mathematica, something as basic as               Play[Sin[440 * 2 Ï€ * t], {t, 0, 1}]      the output generates correctly. However, when I actually hit the sideways triangle to play the sound, the user interface freezes, and I have to kill Mathematica. This isn't an issue where everything works but the sound doesn't play. It freezes and I have to kill the program. I tried emulating OSS using ALSA by running `aoss mathematica` (I have `alsa- oss` installed.) The sound still didn't play, but several errors appear on standard out/error:               ALSA lib pcm.c:2239:(snd_pcm_open_noupdate) Unknown PCM cards.pcm.rear     ALSA lib pcm.c:2239:(snd_pcm_open_noupdate) Unknown PCM cards.pcm.center_lfe     ALSA lib pcm.c:2239:(snd_pcm_open_noupdate) Unknown PCM cards.pcm.side     bt_audio_service_open: connect() failed: Connection refused (111)     bt_audio_service_open: connect() failed: Connection refused (111)     bt_audio_service_open: connect() failed: Connection refused (111)     bt_audio_service_open: connect() failed: Connection refused (111)     ALSA lib pcm_dmix.c:961:(snd_pcm_dmix_open) The dmix plugin supports only playback stream      **Does anyone know how I can get my sound to play in Mathematica 9.0.1, given that I tried emulating oss in alsa and it still doesn't work? Thanks.** Note: I'm looking for a solution that makes Mathematica compatible with notebooks someone sends me. I found solutions that use `$SoundDisplayFunction` to play the sound using alsa rather than display a sound dialog, but this doesn't work for notebooks I receive from people with working sound.
