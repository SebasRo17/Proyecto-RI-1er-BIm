The Linux kernel is often listed as a code base which you are recommended to read and, even if it is poorly commented (or the files I have looked at have all been), it does have some really good code in it. Now, putting the Linux kernel aside, which other operating system kernels do you recommend people interested in systems programming and/or operating systems to study? **Why?** What is so great about the code base? Would it show you very different approaches from what the Linux kernel has gone with? Do they use interesting technologies? Something else...? That the kernels are under an open source license is more or less necessary.
