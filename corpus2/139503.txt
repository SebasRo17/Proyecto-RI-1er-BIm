The project I am putted in is running awful. :-) Main Problem is a missing architecture and a missing guidline how to organize projects. In this case I have done a sample project architecture with UML class and component diagrams and layer diagrams. The main problem is, that I have to present this architecture to the management. But the management is not familiar with UML or Layer Diagrams and for most of them its not possible to understand the logic behind it. In that case I want to present the management a visualized project structure with easy understanding. I've searched for some ressources and examples with easy understanding visualizations, but was not able to find one. So my question is how you would visualize your software architecture to the management, which techniques do you use? Little Note: its a very big sharepoint project with more than 50 sub projects.
