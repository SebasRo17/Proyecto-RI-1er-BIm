I'm a web programmer, but I haven't found many opportunities to take advantage of a formal education in computer science. Maybe I'm not looking in the right places, but it seems to me like most of the web jobs I come across are CRUD, web forms, and data grids. For these jobs a formal CS background doesn't seem necessary, and you could do fine with O'Reilly cookbooks in jQuery, CSS 3, PHP, SQL, or ASP.NET MVC. What kinds of web developer jobs exist that really let you apply your computer science background? Do I need to branch out into other areas of programming to take full advantage of my degree?
