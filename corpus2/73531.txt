Every time I read about Oracle programmers etc, I get confused. I don't know what exactly they do. From my understanding, application programmers need to develop the core functionality. The libraries they use might help in GUI development or database connectivity but the functionality that makes that application that application must be programmed and that makes every application different (well some could be tweaked versions of others). In this relation, isn't database programming basically creating table and aren't these tables processed in response to SQL statements which are issued by an application which usually is the front end? So is table creation such a big deal?
