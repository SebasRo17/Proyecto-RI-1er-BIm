At the bottom of the html document produced by Mathematica is a link to Wolfram's site. It says: Created by **Wolfram _Mathematica_ 8.0** I think it would be nifty to have the option to precede that link with a custom link. For example: Copyright 2012, **Fred Daniel Kline** - foo@bar.com _Note: I prefer my email as an image to prevent netbots from grabbing it._ Perhaps we could have a special cell that, if present in the notebook, would be displayed automatically. Edited: Also would like this option for pdf's.
