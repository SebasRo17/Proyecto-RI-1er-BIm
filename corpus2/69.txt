If I draw graphics like this, I get exactly what I need:               Graphics[{{Blue, Disk[{0, 0}, 10, {0, Pi/2}]}, {Red,         Disk[{0, 0}, 3, {0, Pi/4}]}}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GAtsU.png) But I need to accomplish this task with `Overlay[]`. Here's the code:               graphics1 = Graphics[{Red, Disk[{0, 0}, 3, {0, Pi/4}]}];       graphics2 = Graphics[{Blue, Disk[{0, 0}, 10, {0, Pi/2}]}];       Overlay[{graphics2, graphics1}]      And I get this as output:   ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/allsb.png) How can I position these graphics according to coordinates?   Thank you for any suggestions or answers.
