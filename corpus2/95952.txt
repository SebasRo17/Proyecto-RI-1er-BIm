First, some background: I've been programming for about 12 years now. I am intermediate to advance in C# and a couple other managed languages, but never messed with anything native. I understand the concepts, just never had the time to dip into C/C++ and the like. Now, I am currently enrolled in the Game & Simulation Development course at DeVry, which gave me access to VS2010 (Finally!). After playing around with it, I noticed the default templates for MFC are...well, beyond words. (In a good way. - Referring to the wizards that generate a VS or Office-like interface for you.) Now that I've seen what is possible with MFC, I would love to learn how to use it to make awesome tools, but I don't know where to get started. The MSDN tutorials are pretty much useless, and I've been told that Ivor Horton's VC++ 2010 book is the best, but it doesn't seem to take into account (at least to me based on the more complext UI) the complexity that's added with what the new wizards generate. So I really have 2 questions:   One, is what is taught in his book sufficent for MFC in general? That would assume the "complexity" I'm perceiving is just cold feet. Two, does anyone know of a good resource to learn how to work with MFC that use the new VS and Office-like interfaces? Thanks ahead of time. **UPDATE** : It seems most of you guys are vehemently opposed to using MFC, so I'll add a bit to this question. The reason I want to use MFC is because the Visual-Studio-like interface seems like a very efficient way to lay out a lot of tools like the property view and such. The MFC wizard in VS2010 gives me all this by default. My ultimate goal is to create an application similar to GameMaker, but with a VS-like interface. (Personal improvement project; I know it's been done to death.) So with that said, is there a way to create a Visual Studio-like shell application without MFC (maybe using Qt, or even with the VS2008 shell)?
