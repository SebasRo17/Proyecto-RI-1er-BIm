I wanted to try this product when I heard there was a free version of Visual Studio. So I downloaded something from Microsoft called "Visual Studio Express 2012 for Windows Desktop" and I never really used it much. Now when I start it, for the first time in awhile, it says that the product has expired. I was under the impression that it was simply freeware, so is it true that there is no permanently free version of this IDE which anyone has the freedom to download without cost? My theory is that Microsoft's website is finicky about easily finding what you want there. So maybe I just downloaded the wrong thing. I went to this page: Microsoft Under some purple header text titled "Visual Studio Express 2012" and some sub-text that says "Visual Studio Express 2012 products provide free development tools for creating modern applications on the latest platforms." I feel like it has just got to be the right place to download the IDE. So I clicked for Windows Desktop, downloaded it, installed it. Product has expired. Conclusion? It is not free. I thought I would ask here if this is true so that I can be certain. I still think Microsoft is just finicky though. Maybe I should have downloaded 2010?
