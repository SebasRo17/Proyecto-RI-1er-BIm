So the question is this: wherever you sit down and do your magic, is it neat and organized or chaotic and in disarray ? Do you find that your level of organization follows linearly with your current position in the project? (ie. The project is on track and life is good, few bugs and major milestones are being met, desk is clean enough to do brain surgery or the project is way off track, bugs are flying everywhere and my desk is a dumpster)
