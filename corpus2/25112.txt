I have two vectors $A$ and $B$ of length (say) $50$ or so, and I want to determine whether there is any correlation between their entries. I computed their correlation directly and found it to be positive, but I also wanted to compute a $p$-value to confirm the implication that the entries are not completely independent. However, when I asked _Mathematica_ to compute the following: > >     PearsonCorrelationTest[A, B, "TestDataTable"] >   It gave an answer, but it also gave the following warning: > PearsonCorrelationTest::nortst : "At least one of the p-values in {0.508..., > 0} resulting from a test for normality, is below 0.025. The tests in > {"PearsonCorrelation"} require that the data is normally distributed. I couldn't find any further documentation on what _Mathematica_ was doing. What assumptions on the vectors $A$ and $B$ is required for `PearsonCorrelationTest` to give a sensible answer?
