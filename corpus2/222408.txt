My office department logs in to the ISP Server through a keep-alive-browser login page. This, for better performance, is encapsulated in to a small python script. This is what it does (Pseudo code)               1.CheckForActiveInternet     2.if not active          Login          KeepAlive     3.else          report      In step 1, a host like "www.google.com" is checked for active connection. A status code is returned and this is exactly what my doubt is; what would this code be? **200** or **202**? Incase google redirects to .co.** urls the status code would be **302** which even complicates it further since our ISP redirects too, when there is no active internet connection.   You could see that if we check **302** for deciding on weather or not we'd be needing a login, it could be either the google redirecting or our ISP itself. So what could be done here? The current script checks:               if status in (200, 202, ""):         Connection is Active      This is quite vague isn't it? When is an empty string returned as status code? A non-redirecting site like wikipedia.org might do the trick I thought, but I don't know how feasible this method would be.
