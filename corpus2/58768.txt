I am about to form a small consulting company and with a few friends and I am curious about how/what you do to amaze and create happy long lasting clients? This is of course besides the standard points like delivering on time, charge fair amount, deliver quality, and deliver what they really want. What other techniques do you use to amaze and create long lasting clients? (and to stand out compare to the competition) For example:   * Gifts?   * Happening and events?   * Night out at the pub?
