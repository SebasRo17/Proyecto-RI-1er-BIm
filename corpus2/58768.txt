I would like to know how we find the length of the intersection of two surfaces. For instance, in the following example,a surface intersects with a plane: ![Intersection of two surfaces](http://i.stack.imgur.com/E94iu.png) How do we find the length of intersection which is highlighted in the region? Is there a general method for computing the length in a given region for a surface and a plane? Here is the code for the above example:               h = Exp[-x^3 - y] - 1 - t ;     g = y - t ;          ContourPlot3D[{h == 0, g == 0}, {x, -4, 4}, {y, -4, 4}, {t, -4, 4},      MeshFunctions -> { Function [{x, y, t, f}, h - g]},      MeshStyle -> {{Thick, Blue}}, Mesh -> {{0}},      ContourStyle ->      Directive[Orange, Opacity[0.3], Specularity[White, 30]]]      It is the intersection of the function $e^{-x^3-y}-1=z$ and $y=z$
