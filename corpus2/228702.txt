**My situation:** I'm currently intern in a big company, developing an automation tool (for company internal use only). There are about 30 persons in the team, but we are only 3 developers, all interns (in master degree). The core of the software and the UI were made by experienced employees but three years ago. **The problem:** A lot of the technologies used can be upgraded (.net 3.5 to 4.0, using LINQ for Database interactions, Forms to WPF ...) and the User Interface is really not ergonomic. **What I want to do:** I would like to upgrade it and remake the UI, to improve performance, maintainability and ergonomy but my managers - business analysts - don't feed the need for improving a software that works fine. **Why I can't:** They want us to do new automation tasks, they think it would be a waste of time to do the upgrade and they are not sure we will success to do completely what I am aiming for. **My Temporary solution:** As I am motivated and really think the upgrade is necessary, I spend some evening and week-ends developing the new version, hopping once it's done I can show them and they will like it. But all this _working time_ is not payed and I don't have that much so I still hope to have like a full working week at the office to work on it. **My Question:** What is the best way to try to convince my managers that time used to develop the upgrade won't be a waste of time (knowing that all the technical arguments won't be understood)? I also don't want them and my coworkers to misunderstand my motivation with a tentative to show off or some other selfish intentions.
