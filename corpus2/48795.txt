I'm applying for a company far away and if I get an interview it will probably be done remotely. I have been searching for advices regarding this but all tips seem to be directed at face-to-face meetings (things like "shake hands firmly"). What are the differences? How can I make the best out of those differences? Update: This is a software developer position, so there's also something about technical questions (such as, I can Google anything that they ask ;) This question also applies to any freelancers who are dealing with customers, or recruiters who are interviewing remotely. I hope that makes it relevant to this site. It may also help if you keep answers programers-related.
