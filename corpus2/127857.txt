I have my own idea for a web application, and I am not a programmer. The application will work similar to Facebook and Twitter, profiles and feeds. I have learned some computer science theory, all the way up to OOP, but have no practical experience. Without any experience, is there a way I can evaluate the different language and platform choices available to me? What kind of things should I be looking at? Ease of setup? How many followers it has? How can I evaluate whether a language will have the capabilities I need?
