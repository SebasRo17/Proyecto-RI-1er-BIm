When it comes to visual analysis, large datasets or data with intricate internal details often makes plotting in 2D useless, as the outcome is either just a fraction of the full dataset, or no details can be observed in the mess of datapoints. **How can one make the process of changing the plot range and/or zooming, panning, etc. less tedious** than doing it programmatically and iteratively, from time to time? I often meet with this issue, and developed various methods to deal with it (like this). Though I have now a working solution that I would like to share (see below), I also am highly interested in what kind of methods and tricks others invented to visualize and manipulate complex 2D data with ease.
