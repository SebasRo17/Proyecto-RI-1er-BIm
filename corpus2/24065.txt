I want to pass a list of pure variables to a function, in which the ordering of the variables matters. For instance, if I want a palindrome, my function might be:               func[{#1,#2,#2,#1}&]      I want to be able to generalise this to an arbitrary number of variables:               func[{#1,...,#n,...,#1}&]      So what I want is a simple way to write a function g[n] that calls func with n variables. How to achieve this? I've tried generating the list {#1,...,#n,...,#1}& with a Table, but it seems Mathematica is not interpreting the ampersand correctly.
