I'm wondering if it is possible to link Excel and _Mathematica_ in real time, so that _Mathematica_ can be used as a computing and "storage" tool. Suppose I have an Excel spreadsheet **with an active DDE link** : ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vEZBx.jpg) I would like to know if it is possible for _Mathematica_ to communicate with Excel in real time **and** store every cell update in Excel. I know there is a package called ExcelLink, with several functions to link _Mathematica_ and Excel. So, if I use, for instance `ExcelRead["A2"]` I get the correct value > 19.36 However, it is not dynamic! I can get dynamic values by using               a=Dynamic[Refresh[ExcelRead["A2"], UpdateInterval -> 0]]     b=Dynamic[Refresh[ExcelRead["B2"], UpdateInterval -> 0]]      However, when I try to add `a+b` I get > 19.36+28.56 And, worse, If I use               Dynamic[a+b, UpdateInterval -> 0]      I get > 19.36+28.56 So, here arises my **first problem** : although _Mathematica_ reads the values in real time from Excel, I'm not able to perform any calculation with them. Is there any way to do it? My **second problem** is: how can I write dynamically the values I'm getting from the DDE Link inside Excel itself? I need to write **every updated value** in Excel in a sequence like shown below ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/csuAE.jpg)
