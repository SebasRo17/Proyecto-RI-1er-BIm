I was asked this interview question at a top internet website company recently. Certain empty glasses of water are arranged in the following order ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/g0TS4.jpg) > When you pour liquid into the 1st glass if it's full, then the extra liquid > would be flown into the glasses 2 and 3 in equal quantities. When glass 2 is > full, the extra liquid would be flown into 4 and 5 and so on. Given an N > liters of liquid and maximum capacity of each glass is 1 litre, give the > amount of liquid present in any glass if you empty N liters of liquid by > pouring into glass by filling out the function getWaterInBucket(int N, int > X) where X is the glass number. So for example if I want have 4 liters at > the beginning and I want to find the water in glass 3 the function is > getWaterInBucket(4, 3) How do I solve this programmatically? I basically tried to find a math solution(e.g Pascals triangle) to it. The interviewer said not to because it'd get tough quickly(damn). So I said let me consider it to be a tree so I can add a parameter like this getWaterInBucket(BTree root, int N, int X) and then try some recursive solution for each level , he said that you can't add parameters(damn).All this led me to think that I missed something obvious, some trick, did I? It seemed like he was more confused about how to solve it than I was, which is never good in an interview.
