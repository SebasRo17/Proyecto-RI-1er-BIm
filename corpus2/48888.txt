I am trying to plot slope field for $\ddot{a}(t)$ for this differential equation but I don't know how to $\frac{d}{dt}\ddot{a}(t)=2\frac{\dot{a}(t)}{a(t)}\ddot{a}(t)$ I want to show that already accelerating solutions (with $\ddot{a}$ small and positive) are driven to accelerate even more, and already decelerating ones (with $\ddot{a}$ small and negative) are driven to further deceleration. So essentially I want to find out what $\dddot{a}(t)$ would look like with respect to time.
