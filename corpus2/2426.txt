I'm trying to make seamless tiles - images that can be repeated on a grid without it being obvious where the joins are. So far, I've followed the classic strategy of getting the edges working correctly:               i = ImageResize[ExampleData[{"TestImage", "Mandrill"}], 300];     requarter[im_] :=       Module[{width = First[ImageDimensions[im]],          height = Last[ImageDimensions[im]]},         iq = ImagePad[          ImagePad[im, {{width/2., width/-2.}, {0, 0}},            "Periodic"], {{0, 0}, {height/2., height/-2.}}, "Periodic"]];          irq = requarter[i]      and this quartered will tile well, except that the seams going through the middle (formerly the edges) have to be smoothed out. Somehow I need to blur these lines slightly, or make them overlap in some way, without affecting the rest of the image. What's the best way to do this? Perhaps the classic approach is wrong? ![an unfortunate quartered mandrill](http://i.stack.imgur.com/h3VyK.png)
