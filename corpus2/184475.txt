TL;DR: Why use something like Apache Archiva or Sonatype Nexus as an artifact repository instead of Subversion? The build system I use currently has a lot of binary blobs (images, sound files, compiled binaries, etc), both as input and output to our builds. Our system for managing these is very ad hoc; some are checked into our Subversion repository alongside our code, some are stored elsewhere outside any formal version control. I'm looking at consolidating this, so we have something that's more self- consistent and easy to use, and which separates binary artifacts from code. Google tells me there are a selection of artifact repositories available (Archiva, Nexus, Artifactory, …), but from reading around, I can't see any advantage to using these over Subversion. That will look after the binaries for us – it already does that for some of our binaries, we'd just want to rearrange the repository layout to separate them from code – and has the notable advantage that we already have Subversion servers and expertise. So. What's the advantage of using a dedicated artifact management system over using a general version control tool like Subversion?
