My experience has been that we now see more of a discussion about apps than just a discussion about websites that was before. Do you agree? When is it more appriopriate to speak about apps as compared to web and websites? In general I'm much in favor of leaning towards to perspective of apps rather than web/sites/domains since the latter depends so much on name and you couldn't make a thing such as a whitelabel project as a website - it has to be an app. So I seem to arrive at the conclusion that apps is the wider context and therefore is preferred, especially if the project is a whitelabel software development that a client should be able to take and "brand" for instance such as taking the stackoverflow project and banding it to a new forum which is the way I supposse things work when we get a new forum.
