I have a bulk emailing service within the system which allows for a template to be used. When the mail is sent the template is parsed or run through a parser to replace tags with actual information. i.e "[Foo] has logged in" is parsed to "Bar has logged in" Is it better to have 1 service for sending and parsing emails (concurrently), or to have 2 services, one which only checks for pending emails and parses them, and another which only sends emails who have already been parsed?
