Specifically what are some examples of where ideas of the masses where just wrong. Why did people latch onto the ideas in the first place? And why were the ideas dismissed? Or perhaps the ideas are still alive and well and if so why? For example I might describe CORBA (and other similar technologies) as something that attempted solve the problem of communication between components of software. Many felt it was necessary to define contracts between various components. Ultimately, HTTP + JSON solved the problem for the masses and other various RPC mechanisms such as Thrift and Proto-bufs have popped up.
