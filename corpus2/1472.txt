I know, of course, how to draw a triangle in the plane given the vertices:               Graphics[Polygon[{{1, 0}, {0, Sqrt[3]}, {-1, 0}}]]      But I'm not sure how to simply draw a triangle if all I care about is the length of the sides. (I'm happy to place one of the vertices at the origin and place one of the sides on the non-negative side of the x-axis, but that doesn't really matter.) Is there a straightforward way? This raises the additional question, "how do I draw a triangle in Mathematica, given three angles?" (Say I want to it to reside somewhere in the unit circle.)
