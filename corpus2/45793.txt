I'm using _Mathematica_ 9.0.1 on Windows XP and my drive letters are assigned as follows: `C:` and `D:` are hard local disks, while `E:` is assigned to some removable media. Now, the situation is as follows               DirectoryQ[# <> ":\\"] & /@ {"c", "d", "e"}      returns `{True,True,True}`, even when an optical disk isn't in the drive. To outflank the problem I use a `directoryQ` function, defined in the code below. However, it obviously fails against a full hard disk or when I don't have write access. Therefore, I' m wondering about the kind of check `DirectoryQ` basically performs. Is there a better solution to fix the problem?                  directoryQ[unit_]:=Module[            {root,file,ret},            ret=False;            root=unit<>":\\";            file = FileNameJoin[{root, "testFile.txt"}];            If[              DirectoryQ[root],              Quiet[Export[file,"test","Text"]];              If[                FileExistsQ[file],                DeleteFile[file];                ret=True              ];            ];            Return[ret];     ];          directoryQ["c"]     directoryQ["e"]
