I'm trying to diagonalize a certain 2 x 2 matrix, but _Mathematica_ refuses to find the eigenvectors. In particular, when I input               Eigenvectors[{{1.8741*10^7 + 1.40161*10^6 B, 2.79374*10^7},                    {2.79374*10^7, -3.1235*10^7 - 1.40161*10^6 B}}]      (B is a parameter). I receive the error > Eigenvectors::eivec0: Unable to find all eigenvectors and the bogus output > >     {{0, 0}, {0, 0}} >   On the other hand, _Mathematica_ has no problem with the eigenvalues, for some reason. Can someone help me figure out what's going on here?
