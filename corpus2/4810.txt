I am trying to plot values that occur in different days and times. I am using `DateListPlot`, but it plots all the values for a day in the same day. Is there a way to somehow "expand" the x-axis to show the hours?. Is there anything such as a "TimeListPlot" ? Example:               dateValues={{{2011, 2, 11, 14, 56, 0.}, 107}, {{2011, 2, 11, 14, 57, 0.}, 104},      {{2011, 2, 11, 14, 59, 0.}, 97}, {{2011, 2, 11, 17, 5, 0.}, 96},      {{2011, 2, 11, 17, 6, 0.}, 94}, {{2011, 3, 11, 9, 34, 0.}, 102},      {{2011, 5, 11, 12, 37, 0.}, 100}, {{2011, 5, 11, 12, 38, 0.}, 99},      {{2011, 7, 11, 14, 53, 0.}, 121}, {{2011, 7, 11, 14, 55, 0.}, 106},      {{2011, 7, 11, 14, 56, 0.}, 106}, {{2011, 7, 11, 14, 57, 0.}, 107},      {{2011, 7, 11, 19, 6, 0.}, 111}, {{2011, 8, 11, 18, 58, 0.}, 106},      {{2011, 8, 11, 19, 0, 0.}, 102}, {{2011, 8, 11, 19, 1, 0.}, 103},      {{2011, 9, 11, 17, 42, 0.}, 95}, {{2011, 9, 11, 17, 46, 0.}, 94},      {{2011, 9, 11, 19, 9, 0.}, 102}, {{2011, 10, 11, 19, 5, 0.}, 106},      {{2011, 10, 11, 19, 6, 0.}, 107}, {{2011, 10, 11, 19, 8, 0.}, 97},      {{2011, 11, 11, 11, 48, 0.}, 107}, {{2011, 11, 11, 11, 49, 0.}, 106},      {{2011, 11, 11, 11, 50, 0.}, 106}, {{2011, 11, 11, 11, 51, 0.}, 91},      {{2011, 11, 11, 11, 52, 0.}, 92}, {{2011, 11, 11, 11, 53, 0.}, 123},      {{2011, 11, 11, 11, 54, 0.}, 120}, {{2011, 11, 11, 11, 55, 0.}, 98}}      Then, if you plot it:               DateListPlot[dateValues]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5JbkV.png) You get all the first 5 values in the same column. Lets try to plot more than one value in the "relaxed" axis that @doctor_image created:               dateValues2={{{2011, 2, 11, 14, 56, 0.}, 107, 60, 51}, {{2011, 2, 11, 14, 57, 0.}, 104, 60, 50},      {{2011, 2, 11, 14, 59, 0.}, 97, 60, 46}, {{2011, 2, 11, 17, 5, 0.}, 96, 65, 49},      {{2011, 2, 11, 17, 6, 0.}, 94, 66, 71}, {{2011, 3, 11, 9, 34, 0.}, 102, 66, 51},      {{2011, 5, 11, 12, 37, 0.}, 100, 65, 59}, {{2011, 5, 11, 12, 38, 0.}, 99, 66, 53},      {{2011, 7, 11, 14, 53, 0.}, 121, 83, 44}, {{2011, 7, 11, 14, 55, 0.}, 106, 59, 37},      {{2011, 7, 11, 14, 56, 0.}, 106, 62, 35}, {{2011, 7, 11, 14, 57, 0.}, 107, 69, 50},      {{2011, 7, 11, 19, 6, 0.}, 111, 66, 49}, {{2011, 8, 11, 18, 58, 0.}, 106, 67, 55},      {{2011, 8, 11, 19, 0, 0.}, 102, 64, 50}, {{2011, 8, 11, 19, 1, 0.}, 103, 68, 53},      {{2011, 9, 11, 17, 42, 0.}, 95, 60, 47}, {{2011, 9, 11, 17, 46, 0.}, 94, 58, 43},         {{2011, 9, 11, 19, 9, 0.}, 102, 61, 54}, {{2011, 10, 11, 19, 5, 0.}, 106, 69, 49},      {{2011, 10, 11, 19, 6, 0.}, 107, 68, 51}, {{2011, 10, 11, 19, 8, 0.}, 97, 60, 47},      {{2011, 11, 11, 11, 48, 0.}, 107, 68, 53}, {{2011, 11, 11, 11, 49, 0.}, 106, 66, 47},      {{2011, 11, 11, 11, 50, 0.}, 106, 64, 49}, {{2011, 11, 11, 11, 51, 0.}, 91, 71, 77},      {{2011, 11, 11, 11, 52, 0.}, 92, 72, 82}, {{2011, 11, 11, 11, 53, 0.}, 123, 85, 57},      {{2011, 11, 11, 11, 54, 0.}, 120, 82, 62}, {{2011, 11, 11, 11, 55, 0.}, 98, 81, 77}}      I managed to plot them on a regular graphics, but can not use the "relaxed axis":               With[{labels =      Rotate[DateString@#, (3 \[Pi])/2] & /@ dateValues2[[All, 1]]},      ListPlot[{dateValues2[[All, 2]], dateValues2[[All, 3]],      dateValues2[[All, 4]]},      Ticks -> {Transpose[{Range@Length@labels, labels}], Automatic},      Filling -> {1 -> {2}}, Joined -> {False, False, True}]]      ![Blood pressure and pulse plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/23YBj.jpg) It is a visual way to plot blood pressure and pulse. Any suggestion on how to use the "relaxed" axis?
