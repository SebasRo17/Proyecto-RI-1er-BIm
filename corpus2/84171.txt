I was presented with a new problem recently, to provide an estimate for a project in which I must use a framework (and potentially bits of another framework) that I am unfamiliar with. It's much easier for me to provide estimates when I'm at liberty to use what I'm familiar with, but it was as though a crippling paralysis by analysis had kicked in when an estimate was requested for work in unfamiliar territory. My solution, in retrospect, was wrong. I merely began working. How might I better estimate projects and tasks when I am required to work with unfamiliar languages/technologies/frameworks?
