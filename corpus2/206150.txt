If I have a method taking input and giving output, it's a no-brainer that tests should be written. But what about things like validation rules? For example, I add a validation rule that a certain property must be at least 5 characters long. Should I then write a UI test to check for an error message when the form field is empty? Assume that the validation library itself works fine, **the only thing I do is add a one-liner to specify this rule**. I'm leaning towards no, because I'd only be duplicating the validation rules, and if the rules itself are set up incorrectly, the test will probably also be incorrect. However, I'd very much like to hear people's opinion and experience on this.
