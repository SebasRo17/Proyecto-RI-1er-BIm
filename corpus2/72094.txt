French is my native language and I just realized that the `#` in `C#` is the same character as for the _diese_ music character that raises a note by a half tone. Also, As I made my music elementary class in french, I did not realized that the C was also a musical note, as in french we use _do_. With a little searching, I noticed that this link was made on purpose. So, here is my question: Is that link obvious for English native speaker? Does that link automatically activate some bell as the for the BASIC acronym and a fundamental piece of knowledge, or the SOAP acronym and the cleaning compound.
