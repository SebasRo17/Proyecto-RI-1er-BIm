I'm trying to create a stylesheet, but the process has become painful. I'm sure that this has to do something with resetting something in Mathematica everytime I make changes to the stylesheet. To explain my problem better I will describe the steps I take to create a very simple stylesheet with only one style defined. In a new notebook enter the following:               CreateDocument[{       Cell[StyleData[StyleDefinitions -> "Core.nb"]],       Cell[StyleData["Title"],        ConversionRules -> {          "TeX" -> {"\\title{", # &, "}"},          "HTML" -> {"<h1 class=\"Title\"\n>", # &, "\n</h1>"}          },        FontSize -> 26,        FontWeight -> "Bold",        FontColor -> RGBColor[0, 0, 0]        ]       },      StyleDefinitions -> "StylesheetFormatting.nb",      Editable -> True,      Saveable -> True      ]      The new notebook that appears will contain two cells. It will have the style as all the stylesheets that you have seen and you will be able to edit and save it. Save this notebook in `$UserBaseDirectory/SystemFiles/FrontEnd/StyleSheets/`. I name this notebook `Style01.nb`. Once you have this enter this command:               MathLink`CallFrontEnd[FrontEnd`ResetMenusPacket[{Automatic, Automatic}]]      I found that command here, this command resets the menu so that _Mathematica_ can list your stylesheet in the menu. At this point we are ready to use the stylesheet. Open a new notebook and create a `Title` cell. Save this notebook as `TestNb.nb` in a directory of your choice. Go to `Format > Stylesheet > Style01`. # Test 1: The current view should be this: ![pic01](http://i.stack.imgur.com/RMqFN.png) Now we select the `Title` cell in `Style01.nb` and we show the expression by going to `Cell > Show Expression`. The next screenshot shows the view with the modifications: ![pic02](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BV3QT.png) Now we change back the title cell to how it was originally by doing `Cell > Show Expression` again. In a mac we can press `command + shift + E`. Now we see that the changes took effect. ![pic03](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nLxcw.png) No problem there. We can repeat this procedure to keep adjusting the `Title` cell. # Test 2: Now lets see if our conversions rules work. Lets create a new notebook called `ExportNb.nb` in the same directory as `TestNb.nb`. Put the following in it:               nb = NotebookOpen[NotebookDirectory[] <> "TestNb.nb"];     ExportString[nb, "HTML", "FullDocument" -> False]      This is what I obtained after evaluating those commands: ![pic04](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dDSK1.png) The conversion rules took effect. But, I made a mistake (purposely made when I created the style sheet). The angle bracket should have been on the top. In any case, let us correct this mistake: ![pic05](http://i.stack.imgur.com/O7pih.png) After we revert back, and save `Style01.nb`, we try to see if the new conversion rules will work. Unfortunately, the changes in the `ConversionRules` do not take effect. I have found that if I quit the Kernel by going to `Evaluation > Quit Kernel > local` and then I run the commands again then it works: ![pic06](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3zoGl.png) # Conclusion and Questions: It seems that if we want to the way your notebook looks like you can create styles and you will see how the changes take effect after you modify your stylesheet as I described in Test1. But, if you are to export your notebook as an HTML file or Tex, then you better beware of the `ConversionRules`. I'm sure you will keep making many mistakes when you change the `ConversionRules` but you will not be able to see the change of this unless you restart the kernel. Questions: Is there any way for Mathematica to know that there has been changes in the conversion rules? Is there something that we need to restart other than the Kernel to see that this changes have been made? If restarting the kernel is the only way, is there a command to restart it? I'm getting tired of having turning it off and on all the time manually.
