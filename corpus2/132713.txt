I need to manage attachments on my Spring web application and I thought to use an open source repository. My app it's a job approval system using **J2EE / SPRING 3 Framework** and **Postgress DB** to allow user to tracks the job,right through every step of the approval process. It is a fully managed, collaborative system that operates from a central server and is accessed by a standard internet browser. An user should be able to add an attach to a request or an approval step, so, I though to use **Jackrabbit** with **Postgres database persistence manager**. I took a look to this post: http://onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2006/10/04/what-is- java-content-repository.html?page=1 It's really interesting but, I've some question about this kind of solution :-   * I seen that Jackrabbit standalone as a Derby database embedded solution for persistence, is it enough for a professional use of the repository with more than 50 request / days (with attachment) ?    * Is there a reason for which I should use another database manager for persistence instead of the default one ?
