I've recently finished the _The Three Signs of a Miserable Job_ by Patrick Lencioni and one of his core ideas is that you need to have _some_ form of measurement. I have a pretty standard internal developer job where I work on new tools and do some support/bug fixes for past tools I have written. For purely personal fulfillment reasons, what things would you measure on a daily basis? (This is not a report to managers and not something to game, just something to help me mark progress). The goal is to find things that measure not just productivity, but how good of a job you are doing (so a customer service person might record positive interactions in addition to number of calls taken). My stab at this would be to measure two things every day: support requests opened/closed and number of checkins to source control. I understand if this gets closed, but once again this isn't a question about management, its about personal development as a programmer/software developer.
