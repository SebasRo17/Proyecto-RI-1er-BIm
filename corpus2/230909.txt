In the page at http://pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.indenting.php, it is advised to use space instead of tab as it causes issue with diff, patches. Here is the excerpt from the page. > Use an indent of 4 spaces, with no tabs. This helps to avoid problems with > diffs, patches, SVN history and annotations. So, my question is if we are using tabs everywhere, how it is going to affect these commands?
