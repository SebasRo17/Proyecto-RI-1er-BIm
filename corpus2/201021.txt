I'm reading Pro PHP and jQuery and want to rebuild the example. The author is creating a database connection class:               class DB_Connect {          protected $db;          protected function __construct($dbo = NULL){          if (is_object($db)) {               $this->db = $db;          }          else {               // Constants are defined in /sys/config/db-cred.inc.php               $dsn = "mysql:host=" . DB_HOST . ";dbname=" . DB_NAME;               try {                   $this->db = new PDO($dsn, DB_USER, DB_PASS);               }               catch (Exception $e) {                   die ($e->getMessage());               }          }     }       This class is then extended by the application's main class, in order to get access to the database object. Why is this done that way? Couldn't we rather create an instance of `DB_Connect` in the main class? What are the benefits of that approach?
