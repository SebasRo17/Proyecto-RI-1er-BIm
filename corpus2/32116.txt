I have the equation                y = a + b Exp[-x/c]       data = {{462.36, 8872}, {408.18, 8780}, {374.4, 8915}, {322.8, 8937},             {274.00, 8919}, {243.03, 911â€Œ4}, {209.32, 9277}, {178.91, 9394},             {140.71, 9508}, {113.08, 9592}};            nlm = FindFit[data, y = a + b Exp[-x/c], {{a, 100}, {b, 100}, {c, 10}}, x]            Show[        ListPlot[data,           PlotStyle -> {Darker@Green, PointSize[0.03]}],        Plot[y/. nlm, {x, 1, 600}]]       The above is how I currently have everything working and graphing. Update I have actually got almost everything working I have theline bieing drwan the only issue I am having is that the first 2 points of data and the beginning of the line being drawn actuall start before the y axis on the graph so if you look at the graph it is skewed to the left. I am trying to understand what value I will need to change to move this back to the right and I am struggling a little bit. any help will be appreciated. how can I enter that into the `FindFit` function?               FindFit[data, model, parms];      I have my data I just can't figure out how to get this into the `model` and `params` correctly. This is the eqaution that was given me for the data and just don't know how to input it or to show that it is going to be an exponential curve.
