I'm a new person to AI field and I have to research and compare two different architectures for a thesis I'm writing. Before you scream (homework thread), I've been reading on these two topics only to find that I'm confusing myself more.. let me first start with stating briefly what I know so far. **Subsumption** is based on the fact that targets of a system are different in sophistication, thus that requires them to be added as **_layers_** , each layer can suppress (modify) the command of the layers below it, and there are inhibitors to stop signals from execution lets say. **PCT** stresses on the fact that there are nodes to handle environmental changes ( ** _negative feedback_** ), so the inputs coming from an environment go through a comparator node and then an action is generated by that node, HPCT or (Hierarchical PCT) is based on nesting these cycles inside each other so a small cycle to avoid crashing would be nested in a more sophisticated cycle that targets a certain location for example. My questions, am I getting this the right way? am I missing any critical understanding about these two models? also any idea where I can find simplified explanations for each theory (so far been struggling trying to understand the papers from Google scholar). * * * **Edit:**   * The acceptable result would be to compare and contrast subsumption with PCT as alternative control structures in behaviour-based robotics.   * The experiments will be done on Mindstorm NXT 2.0 robot and the implementation will be done using PureData.   * I'm not seeking complex behavior, only several models that will demonstrate capabilities of PCT and Subsumption and come up with weaknesses and strengths about each approach.   * As for the other points 'rwong' mentioned, I don't believe they're part of my research scope. _**my main target here is to get he concepts fully understood as this is my critical phase to implement a fully correct solution that would allow the comparison_**
