I have conducted a chemistry experiment and obtained a list of concentrations of a reactant against time. I plot a graph of this using Mathematica's `ListPlot` functionality, as follows:               ListPlot[{{0, 0.562}, {10, 0.523}, {20, 0.480}, {30, 0.438}, {40, 0.398}, {50, 0.357},      {60, 0.320}, {70, 0.285}, {80, 0.255}, {90, 0.230}, {100, 0.220}}, Joined -> True,      InterpolationOrder -> 2, Mesh -> Full, AxesLabel -> {"Time (s)", "[A] (moldm^-3)"}]      This produces the graph below: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/z7ds6.png) However, I wish to calculate the rate of reaction, for which I need the first derivative at $t=0$. I want to be able to get the interpolating function used by the `ListPlot` function when I specify `InterpolationOrder -> 2`, is this possible? Thanks in advance!
