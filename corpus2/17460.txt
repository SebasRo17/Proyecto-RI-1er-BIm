I would like to convert a list of $n$ complex equations to a list of $2n$ real ones. At the moment I am doing it like this:               eqs = {a + I b == 0, c + I d == 0}     Flatten[{ComplexExpand[Re[First[#]]] == 0 & /@ eqs,                ComplexExpand[Im[First[#]]] == 0 & /@ eqs}]       I would like to know how I can write this more compactly, since I'm basically using the same command twice, with the only difference being changing the function `Re -> Im`. Perhaps I can use a pure function to map over a list of these 2 functions? Thanks!
