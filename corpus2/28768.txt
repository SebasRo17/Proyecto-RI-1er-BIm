Here's a simple Manipulate example:               f[x_, a_, b_] := a x + b     Manipulate[      Plot[f[x, u[[1]], u[[2]]], {x, -1, 1},       PlotRange -> {-1, 1}], {{u, {1, 0}, "a/b"}, {-1, -1}, {1, 1}}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DoAo8.png) I would like to be able to control `a` and `b` with individual 1D sliders as well, such that all controls are dynamically updated. How can I achieve this?
