Suppose that a complex valued function `f[z]=f[x+i y]=u[x,y]+i v[x,y]`. I want to plot3d its real part by coloring it with respect to its imaginary part. For instance, if `m` and `M` are the smallest and greatest values of the imaginary part, I want to color the graphic from white to black depending on the value of the imaginary part (`m` is white, `M` is black). I would be very glad if you can help me.
