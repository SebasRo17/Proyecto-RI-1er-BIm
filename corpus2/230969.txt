I'm programming in Java, in a very OO style, by myself. Never had the chance to work with other programmers (I'm not a professional, at least yet). Out of curiosity, I wanted to ask: How does working with a team on a project work, especially when working on an OO project? How does splitting tasks work? **How do you develop something that will succesfully work with something another programmer developed?** How and when do programmers communicate? Thanks
