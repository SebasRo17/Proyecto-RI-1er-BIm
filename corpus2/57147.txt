I found this happen @ _Mathematica 10_ pre test version and formal English version.   * Copy a file from windows, then paste into FrontEnd cell, you'll get a path, such like `"C:\\Users\\Hyper\\Documents\\b"` This is Ok. However, in the Chinese character case               "C:\\Users\\Hyper\\Documents\\新建文件夹"      This is bad. [It's fine before version 10.0]   * choose a file then Shift+Right-Mouse-Click, and `Copy as path`, then paste into FrontEnd cell, you'll get a path, such like `file1="C:\Users\Hyper\Documents\b"` `file2="C:\Users\Hyper\Documents\新建文件夹"` `file3="C:\Users\Hyper\Documents\b\新建文件夹"` So, two methods to get path from windows system both work badly, ie `FileExistsQ[file1]==>False` `FileExistsQ[file2]==>True` `FileExistsQ[file3]==>False` I have many old files in Chinese path, they cannot be dealt conveniently by _Mathematica 10.0_ @Windows now. I should manually delete a backslash in the path string, and if I use another method to get file path, \b, \hello these names are annoying. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7kTqs.jpg) Is this a simple bug? Why not just keep it the same as that in Version 9?
