I am trying to start learning the `J2EE` part of `Java`. But I don't know where to start. I am familier with `Core Java` and mainly, I want to learn `JPA` and basics of `Hibernate` and `Spring Framework`. The main reason for this is I am working on a project which is using all these things. And most of the code is being developed by some senior guys and I have to make some modifications in that. So basically I need to understand their code. Can someone give me a sort of roadmap, like which things I need to know beforehand and in what sequence should I go? Any reference material, like links, books?
