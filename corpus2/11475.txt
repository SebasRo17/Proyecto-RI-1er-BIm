I'm working in some web scraping using Mathematica, and today, to speed-up the process, I used bash commands (xargs with parallel options with curl and wget) using `ReadList` or `Run`. I would like to do all this inside Mathematica, but I miss multi-thread capability with asynchronous evaluation. I could use more cores, but it's not the answer because the lag is due to time lag, not lack of processor capacity. In bash I can do things like:               cat url.txt | xargs - n1 - P20 wget      Even with 4 cores it distribute the download process in 20 processes. In Mathematica I can do this:               data = ParallelMap[Import,urlList]      But you get limited to cores number. I thought that it would be natural to be multi-threaded if Mathematica is able to use multiple cores. Any clues?
