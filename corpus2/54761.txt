Is there a way to configure Mathematica so that the code does not move around while one is typing? It is driving me crazy and I can't see what I am typing as the code is being reformatted _while_ typing. This is standard notebook, V10. Here is a small animation to show the problem. This happens while I am changing some code, where I see other lines are moving based on what I type in a different line. This below is just an example. This happens in many other cases. I once tried a code cell, but that caused many other problems, so I do not use Code cell anymore. Is there a setting or some solution to prevent this? I am on windows 7. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/5wT60.gif) Here is the actual code snippet above if needed.               SetDirectory[NotebookDirectory[]];     Do[      fileName = "ode" <> ToString[i] <> ".tex";      DeleteFile[fileName];      PutAppend[TeXForm[ode[[i]]], fileName];      res = DSolve[ode[[i]] == 0, y[x], x];      PutAppend[TeXForm[res], fileName];      , {i, 10}]
