So now Eclipse has offered Xtend and JetBrains is offering Kotlin - both of which seem to be watered down versions of Scala. My question is why? I've played with Scala a bit and it's not _that_ hard. Is this just a reaction to the inherent difficulty of the leap from imperative to functional or is there something else at work here? * * * EDIT: Apologies. Rereading the question as I originally posted it I can see where it sounds a bit like trolling. The way I phrased the question just seemed to be the best way to ask the question. I have seen blog postings to the effect "Scala is too hard/Scala is too complex" and also "Kotlin is an attempt to do Scala but simpler". I'll leave the phrasing as it was originally but I honestly wasn't trying to troll.
