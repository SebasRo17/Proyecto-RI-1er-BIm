I am looking for a recommendation of a best practice for XML comments in C#. When you create a property, it seems like that the expected XML documentation has the following form:               /// <summary>     /// Gets or sets the ID the uniquely identifies this <see cref="User" /> instance.     /// </summary>     public int ID {         get;         set;     }      But since the signature of the property already tells you what operations are available to the external clients of the class (in this case it is both `get` and `set`) I feel like the comments are too chatty and that perhaps the following would be sufficient:               /// <summary>     /// ID that uniquely identifies this <see cref="User" /> instance.     /// </summary>     public int ID {         get;         set;     }      Microsoft uses the first form so it seems like it is an implied convention. But I think that the second one is better for the reasons I stated. I understand that this quetion is an adept for being marked as not being constructive, but the amount of properties that one has to comment is huge and so I believe that this question has its right to be here. I will appreciate any ideas or links to official recommended practices.
