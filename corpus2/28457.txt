Is it possible to create a logarithmic slider similar to this one that responds to a change of the variable value? That is, when the slider is moved, the variable value should update. When the variable value is changed separately, the slider position should update too. The ultimate aim is to use this in `Manipulate` and have both a text input and a logarithmic slider input for the same parameter. * * * The post I linked to does not address changing the slider position when the variable is changed elsewhere.
