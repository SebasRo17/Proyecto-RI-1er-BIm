i've taking part in some conversations around here and it seems like choosing a programming language is an event like, wether you like coca-cola or pepsi, you cant like both. Sometimes its even worse, some people dont consider there are any other programming languages there expect the ones they prefere. Well my question is: Is THAT important the programming language decitions? Or maybe its a marketing scheme where companies buy it and then programmes suffer it? And further more, it should not be the other way around, companies ask for general developing skills and then train their human resources to accomplish a goal ( if the problem is concurrent, then use your concurrrent skill to develop in this specific language)?
