When dealing with a project that has many different files, I always seem to loose track of how the parts interact with one another. I've never really had much of a problem understanding smaller components in isolation, but as the complexity of the project increases, I find myself unable to mentally construct an understanding of what is going on. I notice this especially with OOP projects, as the number of methods and source files increase. My background: I'm a self-taught web programmer. I've dealt mostly with python for quick and dirty scripts, but I've also done a few basic django projects. I like web frameworks such as flask, because in the simplicity of a single-file layout, I can easily keep track (mostly) of what is going on. I now find myself in a situation where I need to interact with a large Zend Framework PHP project that someone else developed, and I'm overwhelmed with trying to understand the code spread out to numerous files. **What techniques and processes have you found useful to understand a large code base that someone else has developed? Is there any particular diagram that you find helps you grasp the larger picture?**
