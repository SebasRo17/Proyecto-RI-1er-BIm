So, why do websites have to ask (spoken) language and country when the browser can tell them that? Edit: Specifically, I mean why not use the accept-language section in the http header, set by the language settings in the browser, not based on the IP address. This question focuses the websites that put up a wall, forcing the user to select a language before using the website, that should instead make available an easily accessible setting. Edit: This is a user experience question, focused on the point that the user should have set the language settings in the browser when they first set up their computer (if the user is smart enough, or can ask someone smart enough).
