I'm thinking of implementing the following referral code scheme to sell my software:   * Anybody can obtain a referral code. They just provide an email and I send them the code.   * With that they can recommend the software to their friend, etc.   * Each time someone buy a license using a referral code, I give 10% of this license to the referrer   * They can do that as many times as they want What do you think? Can you see any potential problem with this scheme? Do you think it will work?
