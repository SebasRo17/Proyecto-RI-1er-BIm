If I do back to back calls of `Eigenvalues[]` and `Eigenvectors[]` can these be assumed to order the values and vectors the same, or is each independent? Related to this is a curiosity about the performance of a pair of calls like this. Are Mathematica optimizations done at an expression level, or if a result from one could help another later (or previous) calculation, is it able to reorder internally and/or make use of previous calculations?
