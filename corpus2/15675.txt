**Is there** a Built-In Mathematica Function to extract a Sub matrix from a huge **external** file? Functions getting pieces of internal nested Lists, (arrays) are in place. Example:               a = {{a1, a2, a3, a4},{b1, b2, b3, b4},{c1, c2, c3, c4}}          Part[a[[1;;2, 3;;4]]]      Give the partial section               {{a3, a4}, {b3, b4}}      Now one example external .csv text file:               a1, a2, a3, a4          b1, b2, b3, b4          c1, c2, c3, c4      The function Import["file",{1;;2, 3;;4} should read in               a3, a4          b3, b4      The external file is just a very large huge two dimensional Array of csv values.
