I have 10,000 addresses from a city, which all have a region field in the database. When a new address is entered, then I want my software to automatically detect the region of the address . I think it should be implemented with some sort of machine learning algorithm. How can I do this? And with every newly inserted address, the machine should learn to detect the region of the new address. Is there any library for machine-Learning algorithms (like aforge.net for neural networks)?
