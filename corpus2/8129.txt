I have 2 `InputFields` and 2 `Buttons`. I would like that when the user clicks the Pi `Button` or -Pi `Button`, that value will be assigned to that `InputField` only where the cursor was (either the first input field or the second).               Button["Range", (DialogInput[{range1 = 0, range2 = 0},      Column[{"Enter the Range",       Panel[Column[{InputField[Dynamic[range1], Number],          InputField[Dynamic[range2], Number],          Button["-Pi", (range2 = -3.14159;)],          Button["Pi", (range1 = 3.14159;)]}]]}]]), Method -> "Queued"]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ofOzG.png)
