At first let me apologize. I should have read the policies of this forum before attempting a post. I was more accustomed to a moderated forum like MathGroup than such an active one like the StackExchange. Let me also thank from this position the following people that answering in my previous questions. **Szabolcs kguler eldo Chenminqi** I really hope that I did not forget anyone! So in order to say a thank to these people and summarize for future reference the results I made the current post. The codes are based to replies I recieved. I wish that this will make up for any incovenience I caused:-)! Let me state the problem now. I have the following list of parametric equations (of an ellipsoid)               lst = {10*Cos[u]*Sin[v], 3*Sin[u]*Sin[v], 2*Cos[v]};      I also have the following functions of (u,v)               dam = 3*Sqrt[2]*Sqrt[(Cos[u]^2*(409 - 391*Cos[2*u] + 1800*Cot[v]^2))/(109 -              91*Cos[2*u] + 450*Cot[v]^2)^2];       I want a parametric plot of `lst` according to the values of `dam`. I found the maximum value that `dam` can take.               Cases[Flatten[Table[{u, v, N[dam]}, {u, 0, 2*Pi, Pi/10}, {v, 0, Pi,          Pi/10}], 1], {a_, b_, c_ /; c > 1}]          FindMaximum[dam, {{u, Pi/10}, {v, Pi/2}}, WorkingPrecision -> 30]     maxDam = %[[1]]      Next, I define the color function               colFun = Function[{u, v},         Evaluate@Hue[Rescale[FullSimplify@dam, {0, maxDam}]]];      And now the plots.               g1 = ParametricPlot3D[lst, {u, 0, 2 π}, {v, 0, π}, Mesh -> False,        ColorFunction -> (colFun[#4, #5] &), ColorFunctionScaling -> False,        PlotPoints -> 100, ImageSize -> 800, ViewPoint -> {2, 2, 1}];          g2 = Plot3D[dam, {u, 0, 2 Pi}, {v, 0, Pi}, Mesh -> False,        ColorFunction -> colFun, ColorFunctionScaling -> False,        PlotRange -> All, PlotPoints -> 100, ImageSize -> 400];          Row[{Show[g1, ImageSize -> Large], Show[g2, ImageSize -> Medium]}]      At this point I have one question. See the extremities of the ellipsoid. There, after the purple color, comes the red and again (it seems to me) purple. Can anyone figure out what is going on? Now, regarding the color bar.               {min, max} = {0, maxDam};     ParametricPlot3D[lst, {u, 0, 2 π}, {v, 0, π}, Mesh -> False,       ColorFunction -> (colFun[#4, #5] &), ColorFunctionScaling -> False,       PlotPoints -> 100, ImageSize -> 800,       PlotLegends ->        BarLegend[{Hue, {min, max}}, ColorFunctionScaling -> True]]      I want now to see a different color scheme. I tried               coldata = ColorData["Gradients"];          col = Table[{i, coldata[[i]], ColorData[coldata[[i]]]}, {i, 51}];          Table[{min, max} = {0, maxDam};      lst = {10*Cos[u]*Sin[v], 3*Sin[u]*Sin[v], 2*Cos[v]};      colFun =        Function[{u, v}, Evaluate@col[[i, 3]][Rescale[dam, {0, maxDam}]]];      ParametricPlot3D[lst, {u, 0, 2*Pi}, {v, 0, Pi}, Mesh -> False,        ColorFunction -> (colFun[#4, #5] &), ColorFunctionScaling -> False,        ImageSize -> 800,        PlotLegends -> BarLegend[{col[[i, 3]], {min, max}}]], {i, 51}]      Still, not satisfying with the coloring I tried the following function which I found here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5753508/custom-colorfunction-colordata-in- arrayplot-and-similar-functions               jet[u_?NumericQ] :=       Blend[{{0, RGBColor[0, 0, 9/16]}, {1/9, Blue}, {23/63, Cyan}, {13/21,           Yellow}, {47/63, Orange}, {55/63, Red}, {1,           RGBColor[1/2, 0, 0]}}, u] /; 0 <= u <= maxDam          {min, max} = {0, maxDam};     lst = {10*Cos[u]*Sin[v], 3*Sin[u]*Sin[v], 2*Cos[v]};     colFun = Function[{u, v}, Evaluate@jet[Rescale[dam, {0, maxDam}]]];     h = ParametricPlot3D[lst, {u, 0, 2*Pi}, {v, 0, Pi}, Mesh -> False,        ColorFunction -> (colFun[#4, #5] &), PlotPoints -> 100,        ColorFunctionScaling -> False, ImageSize -> 800,        PlotLegends -> BarLegend[{jet[#] &, {min, max}}]]      Now, the coloring scheme is great. But again it appears to exist the above mentioned problem with the extremities color rendering. Last but not least, is it possible to make a function like `jet` above according to combination of colors {green, yellow, orange, blue, red}? Dimitris
