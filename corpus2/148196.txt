I have an interview for a position and was told that I would have to do some coding test, given a laptop in a specific, by myself, in a specific time- period of 45-60 mins.   This is the first time for me for something like this, and I was wondering how could I prepare best? Do you have similar experience?   What do this kind of tests are about?   Any example?
