I have worked on C before and have never tried my hands on any web application creating framework. After some convincing from one of my friends I thought of giving Rails a go. Before starting to work on Rails I have just started learning Ruby a little and hence some curiosity to know what is being talked about the framework. In the last few days, I have seen a lot of criticism of Rails as a framework. Should I try my hands on Rails or should I try something else? Is python with Django the way to go? Is Nodejs the way to go? Is there some other ruby based framework which can work for me? Please suggest with an open mind. I want to be absolutely clear in my mind before I decide. [Note: The question was closed on Stackoverflow and I was suggested that the this is a better place]
