I would like to create a histogram for human population by age, but the $2010$ census data I have available is for five uneven cohorts: ages $0$-$17$, $18$-$24$, $25$-$44$, $45$-$64$, and $65+$. My county has the following data: `{86031, 26671, 91927, 93983, 32232}`, for a total population of $330844$. The corresponding histogram bins should have widths `{17, 7, 20, 20, 20}` and heights `{86031/17, 26671/7, 91927/20, 93983/20, 32232/20}`. I will eventually want to make this pretty by adding labels, etc., but I don't see how to even get started.
