I'm an undergraduate student starting to look for internships. I understand a lot about how to embellish a real-world resume--emphasizing tasks done at previous jobs and whatnot--but I'm not sure if it will translate well to low- experience internship resumes. Internship Resumes are marked by:   * Few to no past Software-related full-time jobs or internships   * Few to no non-school-involved Software-related activities Obviously if you have no experience or activities to list, you're pretty well stuck. So let's assume we have one of each. I'm basically wondering:   1. What is a company looking for most from Intern candidates? Past work, GPA/coursework, Outside projects (Open Source, etc), certain skill sets (languages)   2. Should I be emphasizing _tasks_ , or _jobs/positions_ when listing my experiences?   3. Are skills important to list? If so, which ones in particular?
