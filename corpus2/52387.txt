I want to deblur a blurred image of a plate licence of a car. I need to deblured it. I have used the ImageDeconvolve[] function and Sharpen but the problem is still difficult because I need to estimate the kernel or the PSF function. A lot of techniques have been used to estimate the PSF. I wondered How the Fourier transform of the blurred image can gives us an idea about the PSF function. Any help?               psfMotion[dim_?NumberQ, theta_?NumberQ] :=       Module[{PSF},         PSF = ConstantArray[0.0, {dim, dim}];         PSF[[Ceiling[dim / 2.0], All]] = 1.0 / dim;         Return[ImageRotate[Image[PSF], theta  Degree]];        ];     psf = psfMotion[14, 0];     Table[ImageDeconvolve[licence, psfMotion[2, \[Theta]],        Method -> "RichardsonLucy", MaxIterations -> 15], {\[Theta], 0,        180}]      Image: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2HYeW.png) licence ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qkXP2.png)
