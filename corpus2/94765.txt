I am trying to find a way to make the projects I work on more transparent to the business size, even though backend programming is not quite visible all the time. So in order to this I want to try ATDD and building acceptance tests with `Cucumber`. Is there a friendly way to show these tests to the business - I still think that running them from the command line is as cryptic as things were until now ? I am thinking of a web interface or something like that.
