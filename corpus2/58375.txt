In version 10.0.0 under Windows I am observing the following behavior:               Do[Module[{foo}, foo[x_] := 1; foo[0]], {10}]          Names["foo$*"]      > >     {"foo$593", "foo$594", "foo$595", "foo$596", "foo$597", "foo$598", >      "foo$599", "foo$600", "foo$601", "foo$602"} >   I am aware that in past versions `Module` Symbols were sometimes not garbage collected but never in such a simple case as this as far as I know. The code above returns `{}` in version 7, as one would expect. Do I have something wrong with my configuration or is this behavior reproducible?   Assuming the latter is there an explanation for this other than a bug?
