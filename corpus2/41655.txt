After watching "The Social Network", a movie about Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook, I had a productivity spike as it inspired me to learn many different languages and software. That spike has been deteriorating somewhat and I don't feel like watching the movie all over again so I was wondering if anybody had any other similar success stories/links/articles/whatever. Mainly about successes that started for people in college.
