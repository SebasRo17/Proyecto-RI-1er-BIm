So there is an insurance company which wants to move long term its proprietorially written software for different insurance products to a new platform / framework / concept / something. One of the applications is ~700 pages big. We would require some workflow application (ibm websphere products?). Transaction control, historisation, support for running batches, integration of different systems (basically our DB2 is on a host zOs system). The front end is a web gui. The business logic code is written in C++. We would like to move step by step to the new environment. What would be good options?
