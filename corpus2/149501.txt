Background: I'm an experienced Java developer, know basic Javascript, HTML, and CSS (and find it easy to figure out how to do something), and have a little experience in Python. I've seen Ruby before and edited a few lines of existing scripts. I'm curious not so much about any given technology, but mainly about what my thought process should be when deciding which technologies to use. Let's take a simple application - maybe an online address book where I can enter contact information, and create groups of contacts. How should I go about evaluating the options that are out there? The number of frameworks out there is daunting to say the least. This should be a learning experience for me, but also I want the knowledge that I gain to be relevant, and I'm afraid of using something that I'll never use again.
