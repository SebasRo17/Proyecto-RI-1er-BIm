Stock options don't make much sense, since the company's private. [It still does, if you are a facebook of sorts AND the regulatory system permits sites like secondmarket, but I digress.] I could think of some:   1. Health benefits to parents and parents-in-laws   2. Sponsoring a fuel-saving bike to drive to office    3. Gift cards for occasions like completion of 1, 3, 5 years of service I really could do with more suggestions here. **EDIT:** Thanks everyone for the response. To summarize, here are the additional things my HR could do:   1. Matching contribution to employee retirement fund provided the employee contributes   2. Funding continuing education, professional courses etc.   3. Company subscription to ACM, IEEE, Safari Books etc.    4. Meal vouchers   5. Membership to gyms   6. Hosting a recreation room at office   7. Spot bonuses    8. Time off for code spikes in recognition of individual contribution    9. Sabbaticals
