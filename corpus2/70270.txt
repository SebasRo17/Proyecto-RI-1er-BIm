I am a php beginner coder. I always find myself in a mess when I try to alter or add something to my scripts. Because they are not well organized. So, I want to learn how to organize my code, so it becomes easy later on to change it. Also, there is a lot of code snippets that I use frequently in all of my scripts. Like the database codes. Is there is a way to arrange those snippets?
