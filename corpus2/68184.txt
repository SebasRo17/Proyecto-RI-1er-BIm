My employer has been looking for a new web developer as well as a DBA for a while now with little success. I just saw the job description, and now I can understand why we are getting no interest - they have lumped together three jobs into 1 position: web developer, DBA, and marketing SEO/Analytics expert all under the title of "Webmaster". It's hard enough to find someone who can do any of those individual things well, let alone somebody who can do it all (or wants to be called "Webmaster" these days). Part of their motivation is, no doubt, saving money by hiring 1 person to do three jobs and underpaying that person. But now I have to deal with interviewing people for this position (that is, if we ever get an applicant), and trying to figure out what this person is _really_ going to be doing once hired. Have you had experience with this sort of thing? Either as an applicant or as an interviewer. And how did you deal with it? Assuming that rewriting the job description to something more realistic isn't an option, what would be the best way of handling this (finding the right person, interviewing them effectively, etc.)?
