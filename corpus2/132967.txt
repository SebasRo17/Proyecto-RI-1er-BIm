I know that Jenkins is focused on continous building/testing, monitoring of batch jobs about the project. We have a legacy project which such condition : 1)Has a development team. 2)It has SVN for source code management 3)Some cronjobs for some operations. 4)Compile&Build don't take too much time, there is no very complex dependencies. 5)It doesn't have any automated test/junit classes and will not have. I'd like to ask to experienced users about Jenkins, is it still worth to use Jenkins for central build&management of the project ?
