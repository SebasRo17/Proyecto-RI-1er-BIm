I have an animated plot of the kind               Manipulate[      plot1 = ParametricPlot3D[randomsample[s], {s, 0, t},                                PlotStyle -> Red,                               Evaluated -> True];      plot2 = ListPointPlot3D[coord3D[t]];      Show[plot1,           plot2,           AxesOrigin -> {0, 0, 0},            PlotRange -> {{-3, 3}, {-3, 3}, {-3, 3}},           ImageSize -> Large,           AspectRatio -> 1,           ViewPoint -> viewpoint,            PlotLabel -> Style["time " <> ToString[NumberForm[t, {4, 2}]] <> " whatevers", 20]]      ,      {t, 0, 15, ControlType -> Animator},      {{viewpoint, {Infinity, 0, 0}},       {{3, 3, 1} -> "3D",        {Infinity, 0, 0} -> "Front",        {0, 0, Infinity} -> "Top",        {0, Infinity, 0} -> "Side"}}]      making use of source data such as               coord3D0 = RandomReal[{-1, 1}, {450, 3}];     ρ0 = Norm /@ coord3D0;     θ0 = RandomReal[{0, 2 Pi}, 450];     vθ = RandomReal[{-10, 10}, 450];     θ[t_] = vθ/ρ0 t + θ0;     kvectors = Normalize /@ MapThread[        Cross,        {Evaluate[Normalize /@ RandomReal[{-1, 1}, {450, 3}]], coord3D0}];     coord3D[t_] = Simplify@Chop[        coord3D0*Cos[θ[t]] + MapThread[Cross, {kvectors, coord3D0}] Sin[θ[t]] + MapThread[#1 (#1.#2) &, {kvectors, coord3D0}] (1 - Cos[θ[t]])];     randomsample[t_] = RandomSample[coord3D[t], 30];      The point is, it works, but it runs _reeeeeeally_ slow on my laptop. Now my question is threefold:   1. How can I make it run faster?   2. Did I do something specifically wrong or have I somehow run into Mathematica's limitations as regards 3D animated plotting? Could it be that this is not the way I'm supposed to be combining plots inside a `Manipulate`?   3. What _are_ Mathematica's "practical" limitations in this respect? I.e., how can I make a reasonable guess as whether an animated plot will be able to run smoothly? How much is too much? **EDIT:** The problem seems linked to the `ParametricPlot3D` code, since the `ListPointPlot3D` runs smoothly by itself, while the parametric plot doesn't. Heretofore I have tried using a `RegionFunction` specification and an `Exclusion` specification in place of its dynamic upper limit, both unsuccessfully.
