I always wonder when conducting an interview why a director or VP of Engineering is involved? If a team of engineers and hiring manager want to hire a person, I don't ever see a director or VP would veto, unless the candidate said something egregious. Is this just to make the candidate feel they are valued? What's the rationale?
