In programming we're often faced with a choice: cover each conceivable use case individually, or solve the general problem: ![XKCD - The General Problem](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/the_general_problem.png) Its obvious that solving the immediate problem is faster, however creating a generalized solution will save time in the future. How do I know when it's best to try and cover a finite list of cases, or make a generic system to cover all possibilities?
