I am specifically looking for language influences (as opposed to framework). At first glance C# seems to be an evolution of C/C++ or Java. But we know C# has the same designer as Delphi, and he even acknowledged some similarities and said "good ideas don't just go away." The one example I see of something in C# that is not in Java or C/C++ is properties. Is that it? Are there others?
