In _Mathematica_ 7 `Row` and `TeXForm` work harmoniously:               {x^a, Sqrt@b, ArcSin[c]} // Row // TeXForm      > >     x^a\sqrt{b}\sin ^{-1}(c) >   As LaTeX: > $x^a\sqrt{b}\sin ^{-1}(c)$ Unfortunately this is broken in more recent versions. _Mathematica_ 10 returns: > TeXForm::unspt: TeXForm of TemplateSlotSequence[1,] is not supported. >> This error was reported in version 9 as well. An attempt at a workaround is to substitute `Grid` for `Row` but the LaTeX code generated is different:               {{x^a, Sqrt@b, ArcSin[c]}} // Grid // TeXForm      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XXm7I.png) And it formats differently: > $\begin{array}{ccc} x^a & \sqrt{b} & \sin ^{-1}(c) The documentation for `TeXForm` indicates that it is extensible with rules for `Format` but I could not fine a rule that worked. While I can manually convert a single Row as follows:               StringJoin[ToString /@ TeXForm /@ {x^a, Sqrt@b, ArcSin[c]}]      > >     x^a\sqrt{b}\sin ^{-1}(c) >   (Though note that one must copy as **Plain Text**.) However attempting to make this a `Format` rule results in double-conversion and I get this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8mkuh.png) * * * ### Is this indeed a bug as I believe? ### What is the best work-around for the problem, preferably automatic?
