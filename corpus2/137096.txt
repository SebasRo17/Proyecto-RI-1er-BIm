This is really perplexing me. We have a 'definition of done' and it includes dev 'done', unit tests 'done', dev test 'done'. However we also have a user acceptance test that needs to be 'done' but the business wants to know when users stories are complete so that they can see stuff (the uat really isnt a priority until release). But because this is outside of the initial done (where we pass our user stories) how can we say its done? And where does this fit into estimating? Where can I find information on integrating testing with a scrum process? I think I need to read up this...
