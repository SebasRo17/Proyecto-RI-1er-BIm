At my company, I develop and maintain all the operational reporting used by management to run the business. There is no reporting position on the application development team. I've taken it upon myself to step in and attend design review meetings to give input to the development team on how changes will impact reporting, consult on how modify designs to avoid impacting existing reports and what I will need in new development to be able to report on the data. It's been my experience that reporting is a key functional position on an enterprise application development team. I'm hoping to find some documentation that supports that concept as an industry standard or Best Practice. Can anyone help me there?
