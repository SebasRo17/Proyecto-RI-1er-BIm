Being a programmer is not just grokking the latest cool technology or debugging a sneaky code error , we have to speak to our coworkers, project manager or boss, in the most effective way possibly; we have demos, interviews, code reviews and so on where this skill is pretty crucial. Personally, as a solo programmer (since 2008) I have not invested much time on improving this skill and I would like to know whay you are doing to improve it.
