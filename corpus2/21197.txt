I am doing vector analysis. I have figured out that the following expression won't be simplified in _Mathematica_ :               Simplify[Dot[x, y] - Dot[y, x]]      I think the reason is that x and y could be matrices, so generally the operation does not commute. But for a vector, the commutation relation should hold. What I don't know is how to tell _Mathematica_ to consider x and y to be vectors. Also, how can I expand `Cross[x + y, z]` to be `Cross[x, y] + Cross[y, z]`? I tried to use `Expand` and `ExpandAll` but neither worked. BTW, in _Mathematica_ , is it possible to define a abstract row/column vector without explicitly specifying the number of entries?
