Supposed that:               list = {2, 3, 5, 7, 9};     sublist = {{3, 3, 5}, {2, 2, 2, 7, 9}};      I want to change each sublist in sublist as following:   1. Find the positions of elements in sublist in list.So, > >     {3, 3, 5} -> {2, 2, 3} and {2, 2, 2, 7, 9} -> {1, 1, 1, 4, 5}. >                 sublist1 = {{2 ,2, 3}, {1, 1, 1, 4, 5}};      2,Change each sublist in sublist1 to sparsearray: > >     {2, 2, 3} -> {0, 2, 1, 0, 0} and {1, 1, 1, 4, 5} -> {3, 0, 0, 1, 1}. >                 sublist2 = {{0, 2, 1, 0, 0}, {3, 0, 0, 1, 1}};      How to do it?
