Take this plot for instance: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/iNYGc.png) It shows power in W, but I'd like to see it in ÂµW, so that I get 200, 400, 600,..., which is much more readable. Is there a way to do this without scaling my function and PlotRange by a factor 10$^6$? **edit** re _szabolcs_ 's comment   I already tried               Ticks -> {Automatic, Table[200 x, {x, 5}]}        but that seems to put those tick marks where they belong, namely at 200 W, 400 W, etc.(which is 240 km up the graph), not at the gridlines.
