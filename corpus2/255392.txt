My example is in Rails/rspec, but is more generic in nature. I have an (abstract-y) class of `Events` which are attached to another (abstract-y) class, `Assets` (. Now, I'm testing using FactoryGirl and I'm not sure how to create events which are truly orthogonal to assets. If I build an event, it's only valid when it belongs to a asset, so am I supposed to build dozens of events, each of which has its own asset?
