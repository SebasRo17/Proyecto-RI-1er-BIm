I have a method that looks like this:               Public Function NormalizeStreetAddress(country As Namespace.Country,                                            streetAddress As Namespace.StreetAddress) _                                        As Namespace.StreetAddress                  Dim _streetAddress As New Namespace.StreetAddress = streetAddress                  If My.Settings.Streeteable = True Then                 Dim _AddressCustom As New Namespace.AddressCustom                 _streetAddress = _AddressCustom.NormalizeStreetAddress(country, streetAddress)             End If             Return _streetAddress     End Function      I receive a streetAddress object, but inside the method I need to use another streetAddress object which I called _streetAddress â€” is that following the standard? A friend of mine told me that object names such as _yourNameObject are for global variables, but I can't find info about this and I want to make this method more readable.
