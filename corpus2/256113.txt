We are a really small (1-3) Ruby shop building a Rails application and need to pick one of the 3 (we've narrowed down to) JS Frameworks. Assume plenty of development experience overall but very little front end JS Framework experience (little with Backbone but absolutely nothing with the other two). If productivity and speed of development (and the need to do lesser rewrites down the road - where the road could be 6-12 months long) along with community support are key metrics, what would be a reasonable recommendation amongst these 3? And by Backbone, I am assuming the need for Marionette or Chaplin (most likely the former). I have to say that I like the fact that Backbone starts off in a rather minimalistic fashion allowing one to add the necessary modules progressively as opposed to starting off with them all (akin to Sinatra vs Rails) but having said that, I've chosen Rails (equally familiar with Sinatra at this point) simply to not worry about adding the dependencies one by one. So, I am a little unclear about the right choice and simply fear losing couple of months of development effort in the event Backbone loses traction in the community and/or it becomes difficult to find the necessary add ons or something like that. (Forgive the rambling - guess this is what happens after 2-3 sleepless nights of JS Framework comparisons).
