**Major deviation from my original post** I realize that the long code I originally had was very discouraging to debug and did not attract any answers. So I have decided to revamp this question significantly (I hope this is acceptable). Please visit the edit history for older versions of this question. **Game Plan** I hypothesize that there are multiple errors in my script the is causing the kernel to crash. But since I can not identify them all at this time, I plan to identify one problem at a time, get solution, implement it in my code and repeat the process of identifying the next problem and posting it on this page, till all the issues are resolved. **Problem 1.** The following code compiles fine:               a=Compile[{{p1,_Real,0},{p2,_Real,0}},Max[0.,Min[p1,10.]-p2],RuntimeAttributes->{Listable}];          b=Compile[{{p1,_Real,0},{p2,_Real,0},{p3,_Real,0},{p4,_Real,0}},       Max[0.,Min[(20.-p1) 5.-p2-p3,10.]-p4],RuntimeAttributes->{Listable}];          ab=Compile[{{p1,_Real,0},{p2,_Real,0},{p3,_Real,0},{p4,_Real,0},{p5,_Real,0}},        Min[a[p1,p5],b[p2,p3,p4,p5]],RuntimeAttributes->{Listable},        CompilationOptions->{"InlineExternalDefinitions"->True}];          f=Compile[{},Module[{k0=Table[0.,{10}]}, ab[k0,k0,k0,k0,k0]],CompilationTarget->"C",       CompilationOptions->{"InlineExternalDefinitions"->True}];      But when I execute `f[]`, the kernel crashes. I am guessing, it is to do with mixing Scalars with Vectors in the `a` and `b` functions. But that is what I thought `Listable` takes care of. Any thoughts?
