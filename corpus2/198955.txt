I'm confused on what can specifically be done with Visual Basic programming. I read that you could do anything with it such as create games, so does this mean it could be used to make games that could be uploaded to a website like Kongregate? I'm just wondering what specific things you can do with Visual Basic. Like Objective-C can be used to make apps and Java could be used to make Android apps. What can Visual Basic be specifically used for?
