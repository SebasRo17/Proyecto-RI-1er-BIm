I'm sure lots of you have experienced this problem. A website or web application is running and is live. You want to upload the next version, but you haven't figured out everything, like setting a value to false in configuration file, inserting another record into the database, and doing lots of minor stuff which can sometimes count to 20 or more parameters. As soon as you upload the new version, everything breaks. Now, fixing the problem may only take up to 20 minutes, but the overall stress that you tolerate, and the financial and goodwill damage to the company are sometimes not forgettable. What are the ways to reduce these types of bugs which arise from the initial configuration of new version deployment? PS: Please don't mention check-lists, cause we already have them. The problem with check-lists is that, they should always get updated, but they won't.
