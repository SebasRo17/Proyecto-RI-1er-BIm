I have a set of data supported over a region in 2D. I want to use RegionPlot and ContourPlot on interpolations of my data, but want to restrict the Plots to the region over which my data is supported. Paste of the supports of my data. I easily find the region with ConvexHull from the ComputationalGeometry package: > Graphics[Polygon[l2[[ConvexHull[l2]]]]] ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mHv8V.jpg) Now I want to turn the information into something I can use as RegionFunction for the ContourPlots and as restrictions in RegionPlot. Can you show me a way?
