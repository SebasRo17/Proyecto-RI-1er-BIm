I am currently on a paid internship, and have been tasked with maintaining an obsolete system that has been developed by multiple developers (at different times) over the course of the past 5 years. Management agrees the "system is on life support", and I receive a fairly regular supply of bug reports from end users currently using the system. Management now wants to extend the project for another year, and in the process nearly triple the user base. As an intern (or any entry level position) how do I "push back"? I've already written a report stating my concerns, albeit in an open-ended document. Is there protocol or document type for suggesting changes? Am I in a position to make suggestions, or should I simply continue to support the old system?   * To clarify, software development is not my company's primary business. As such no internal protocols exist. Additionally, the project has no formal documentation at all, and no requirements documents either. The development is very ad hoc.
