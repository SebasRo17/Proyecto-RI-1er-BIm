I'm being asked to implement IDisposable on objects that are 100% managed resources, which contain no streams, and no large resources. I understand the importance of properly disposing of large resources and unmanaged resources, but what about the other side of the equation? For an object that doesn't benefit from implementing IDisposable (small fully managed objects), what negative impact can GC.SuppressFinalize have, if any?
