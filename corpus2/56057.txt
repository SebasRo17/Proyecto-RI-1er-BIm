I get no solution when I run the following command:               NDSolve[{       x'[t] ==          0. {{0}, {0}, {1.}} + {{0, 1., 0.}, {0, 0., 1.}, {0., -0.156816, -0.523512}} . x[t],       x[0] == {0, 0, 0}},        x, {t, 0, 1}]      The kernel just keeps running forever until I kill it. If I remove the `0\. {{0}, {0}, {1.}}` term, then it works fine. I'd appreciate your help with this issue.
