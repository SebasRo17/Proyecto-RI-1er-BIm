Does anyone have any experience with brain storming software for early stage design work? If so, do you have any recommendations for particular software to use? Or to avoid? To pre-empt certain possible answers: I'm aware a blank bit of paper serves well but I'm interested in using software in this instance.   1. So I can refine the results easier than copying it out into paper.   2. Easily move the results between locations/store in dropbox. Some further information: Brainstorming is perhaps a misnomer in this case, more of a brain shower. The software would be used by 1 person only (me) for my personal projects. Of course anything that can also deal with a more corporate setting would also be good as if I use it and like it I may try to introduce it to my team. Further further info: After asking this question I found Xmind, and I've been playing with it for half an hour or so. My first impressions are that it is pretty good.
