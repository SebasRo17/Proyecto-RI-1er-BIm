When I make a web app I test my work on the browser to see if I receive any errors and fix them. I have made complex applications and testing this way has been easy and fast. I have watched many videos on youtube regarding phpunit and cannot find a purpose for it. Why is this library useful? Is phpunit more for php framworks like cakephp or zend? I dont use any framework just core php. Would or can phpunit be useful for me? If yes, how? There is also xdebug but I'm not sure if it relates.
