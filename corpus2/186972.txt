I think I can count WebAPI out, but WebForms, WebPages, and MVC are all possibilities. I want to create an asp.net web site that is primarily static content and links to other sites. The only "fancy" bit will be a Bing map with pushpins that I add - but even these are static. And there will be a photo gallery. Oh, and ads, too. And, finally, it needs to work well on phones and tablets as well as desktop browsers. Which asp.net technology "flavor" is most suited for this type of web site? ## UPDATE In VS 2012, Web Pages projects are not available beneath Templates | Visual C# | Web. What _is_ there:               ASP.NET Empy Web Application     ASP.NET Web Forms Application     ASP.NET MVC 3 Web Application     ASP.NET MVC 4 WebApplication     ASP.NET Dyanmic Data Entities Web Application      Does this mean that Web Pages are passe, or that Web Pages and Web Forms are the same thing?
