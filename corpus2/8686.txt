It seems that `ImageCrop` allows one to specify the _final_ size of the image. For example, `ImageCrop[image, size, spec]` crops image `image` to size `size`, and one can specify which side of the image the pixels should be taken from, using `spec`. But, what if I don't know the final size `size` of the image? What if I just want to snip 10 pixels from the right side of the image? I might want to do this for a series of images, whose sizes are not known (at least immediately).
