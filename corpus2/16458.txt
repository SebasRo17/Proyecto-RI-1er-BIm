I have been trying to simulate the process of the theatre puzzle from the _Joy of X_ (Strogatz). The puzzle, and some relevant material are here. My simplistic coding for this process follows:               seatchoice[u_] := Module[{r, s}, r = RandomReal[]; s = RandomChoice[u];         If[And[MemberQ[u, s + 1], MemberQ[u, s - 1]],           If[r <= 0.5, Complement[u, {s, s + 1}],Complement[u, {s - 1, s}]],            If[MemberQ[u, s + 1], Complement[u, {s, s + 1}],            If[MemberQ[u, s - 1], Complement[u, {s - 1, s}],             If[And @@ (# >= 2 & /@ Differences[Sort[u]]), u,              If[Length[u] == 0, u,               seatchoice[u]]]]]]];      emptyfraction[v_] := N@Length[FixedPoint[seatchoice, Range[v]]]/v;      I have consistently found despite simulations for 100, 1000,2000 seats (recursion and iteration limits are exceeded for large inputs) that expectations are consistently approx 0.124 (versus expected approx 0.135) with narrowing bounds with increasing sample size or sample number. Further, the closed form for the expectation of number of empty seats suggests this approaches limit from above. **Question:** Is this related to dependencies/other in my coding of puzzle; related to pseudorandom number generation in Mathematica; other issues A visualization from my code is appended. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fIkL8.gif)
