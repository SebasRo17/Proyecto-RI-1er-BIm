I tried for example               Thread[FileDate[FileNames["new*", "h:\\temp\\", 1]]]      It gives > FileDate::fstr: File specification > {h:\temp\NEWEA7D.tmp,h:\temp\NEWEA7E.tmp,h:\temp\NEWEAAE.tmp} is not a > string of one or more characters. >> but still gives the right answer               Out[13]= {{2013, 11, 18, 23, 14, 32.}, {2013, 11, 18, 23, 14,        32.}, {2013, 11, 18, 23, 14, 32.}}      Why is there a error message? How to avoid it?
