I had a blog which was written in my native language, but now I'm wondering if I should switch to english because of a wider audience given that the technical field's default language is English. For sure, I want to share my knowledge, but at the meantime I'd like to get hired or be recognized from my peers. Reputation can be important and it can help in making my professional network larger. Do you have any feedback? Btw, my native language is french if that matters.
