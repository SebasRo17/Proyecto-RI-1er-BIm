In the real world , why do we need to implement method level security ? We either have a web application or a desktop application , where the user accesses the user interface (and therefore directly cannot access the method) . So where does accessing methods directly come into picture here ? edit : I ask this question because I am experimenting with spring security , and I see authorizing users for accessing methods . something like :                @ROLE_ADMIN     public void update() {           //update     }
