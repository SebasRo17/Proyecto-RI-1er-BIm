I am starting to write a webservice, and I've built with nodeJS and a RESTfulish approach. From what I gather:   * The advantage is that you don't have to duplicate code.   * The disadvantages are that you:      * will update the public API frequently, but should be solved with versioning     * can't really make service specific caching and optimizations What is considered best practice? Do sites such as Stack Exchange, Github, Twitter, etc use their own APIs for their clients?
