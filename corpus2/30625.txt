I am currently trying to solve and understand a problem about packing the maximum of squares into a circle. What I am trying to do, is to calculate the maximum number of variable sized squares (with fixed side) into a circle of variable diameter. For example the result you get at WolframAlpha typing 'pack squares of side 50mm into a circle of diameter 300mm': Densest known packing: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/D26ua.gif) Furthermore, I would like to be able to add a variable for horizontal and vertical spacing between each square. I have found this to be exactly what I am trying to understand and build.
