I've recently convinced the team that we could upgrade from php5.4 to 5.5 -- but, unfortunately, it seems I overlooked that php-apc is no longer supported in php 5.5 -- which is fine and dandy, but we could use a replacement for apc_define_constants() Thus, I've heard about the wonders of hidef -- but, I cannot seem to find any documentation for it, anywhere -- I got it installed, after a bit of kajiggering, but I'm not sure what to do next... How could I go about unwrapping the various functions included in the pecl hidef package ? Or, at the very least, how can I use it to define constants?
