The main reason I use Shelve is to be able to quickly develop code without worrying about db table structure. Unfortunately changing a class name from, say, 'class1' to 'class2' gives "AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'class2'" on the next run. What is the canonical way to rename a Shelved class? What other similar surprises are lurking deeper into the Shelve db structure?
