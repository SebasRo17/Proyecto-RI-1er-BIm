For solo projects, do you keep your build / management tools on your local machine, or on a separate server? If the server is not guaranteed to be safer or more reliable than my own machine I struggle to see the point, but maybe I'm missing some things. Note that I'm not debating the value of continuous integration or having a staging environment etc.. just the question of whether it exists on separate hardware.
