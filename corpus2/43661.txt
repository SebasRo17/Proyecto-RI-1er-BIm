Consider the following substitution               Derivative[2, 0][S][th, ph] /. S -> Function[{th, ph}, SphericalHarmonicY[3, 0, th, ph]]      which gives correct answer. While for some cases, eg.               Derivative[2, 0][S][th, ph] /. S -> Function[{th, ph}, SphericalHarmonicY[3, 3, th, ph]]      will produce the               Infinity::indet: Indeterminate expression (0 24 \[Sqrt]70 E^(-I \[Phi]) ComplexInfinity)/(12 \[Sqrt]35) encountered. >>      error. Of course the command               D[SphericalHarmonicY[3, 3, th, ph], {th, 2}]      will produce the desired output. So the question is what is wrong with the substitution rule?
