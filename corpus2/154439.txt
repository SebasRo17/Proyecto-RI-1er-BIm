When writing unit tests, is it worth spending the extra time to make the code have good quality and readability? When writing tests I often break the Law of Demeter, for faster writing and to avoid using so many variables. Technically, unit tests are not reused directly - they are strictly bound to the code so I do not see any reason for spending much time on them; they only need to be functional.
