I originally asked this on plain old stack but it was closed for being too open-ended. (Which was a good call as this is a better place for such questions.) Original Link: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15132135/opengl-image-load- store-atomics-applications So, I've been spending the last couple months or so getting familiarized with the latest OpenGL 4 features when I find myself with free time. (Things like transform feedback, tessellation, compute shaders, etc..) I've finally taken time to mess around with using Image Load-Store textures, and while the idea of being able to atomically read/write to any texture from any GPU core regardless of shader stage seems incredibly powerful, I could not think of interesting applications utilizing the unique facilities these textures provide. Even after consulting "the google" for interesting applications, I was left empty handed. So, are there any WOW-THATS-COOL or even DAMN-THATS- HANDY applications you can think of? Application 1 (Suggested By Nicol Bolas): "Search for order-independent transparency. That requires atomic image operations."
