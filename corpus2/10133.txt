* * * ## Basic Issue: I'm trying to understand the proper use of `NumericQ`'s "magical" capabilities. Please consider the examples below. Actual question and some links are at the very end. * * * ## Example 1: Many of you are aware that `NumericQ` can be used as follows, without unprotecting:               In[1]:=              Remove[x, y];             NumericQ[x] = True;             (*and apparently using TagSet instead of Set makes no difference because \             you can't direct, let alone see, where this type of info is stored \              anyways.*)      The following output is as expected:               In[3]:=              NumericQ[x]             NumericQ[y]          Out[3]= True     Out[4]= False      Go ahead and make the following assignment:               In[5]:= x = y          Out[5]= y      The following behavior is interesting, but quite reasonable. It seems logical that setting `x` to `y` would somehow globally overwrite the "magical" numeric property:               In[6]:=              NumericQ[x]             NumericQ[y]          Out[6]= False     Out[7]= False      ### _Hmmm... #1_ ...Well, at least I thought it would have 'overwritten' the behavior!!               In[8]:=              (*Note: Could also use Clear[x] or ClearAll[x] *)             x =.             NumericQ[x]          Out[9]= True      * * * ## Example 2: Now suppose we had made the assignment `x = y` _first_ (before evaluating `NumericQ[x] = True`):               In[12]:=               Remove[x, y];              x = y          Out[13]= y      ### _Hmmm... #2_ Now _Mathematica_ has pushed the numerical property onto `y` as well.               In[14]:=               NumericQ[x] = True              NumericQ[y]          Out[14]= True     Out[15]= True      * * * * * * ## Question: How can one put `NumericQ[x] = True` to good/powerful use---and just as importanltly, in light of the above examples, how can it be used safely? (i.e., Can this behavior be localized somehow? Used safely within a package? ---intuition makes me wonder if the only way to isolate the behavior would be to store impacted symbols in a junk context or something.) **Links of Interest:** @Szabolcs 'Mathematica Tricks' page; scroll down about half way or search for `NumericQ`: http://web.ift.uib.no/~szhorvat/mmatricks.php MathGroup Discussion: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/comp.soft- sys.math.mathematica/buxdxzwV4bY
