Suppose I have a PHP object, let's say: companyObj.               class companyObj     {       private company_name;       private company_address;            public function print_contact()       {         //logic       }     }      This is the object I wrote, and shared with the teammates. Now I would like to make it more powerful, like this:               class companyObj     {       private company_name;       private company_address;       private company_contact_person;            public function print_contact()       {         //logic updated       }     }      Now, how can I notify my teammates that my object had more attributes that they can set? Instead of sending e-mail to everyone in the development team, how do I make the team know what's going on, when I don't want my teammates to waste their time to look at what is changed at the source code level?
