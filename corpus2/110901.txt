We release a number of small plug-ins that go along with our software. Each plug-in allows our software to talk to a single manufactuer's hardware. I would like to devise a system for keeping track of plug-in releases. ## Example info that should be stored:   * Hardware manufacturer name   * 32-bit? 64-bit? both?   * What modes of operation does the hardware support?   * What versions of the manufacturer's driver have been tested with the plugin? ## Desirable properties of the system:   * Able to synchronize with version control software   * Stores data in human-readable text file (also good for differ tool)   * Free visual, spreadsheet-like editor available   * Able to do simple analysis like "What is the oldest plug-in?" I've got to imagine that someone else has tackled this problem already. Right now my best guess is XML/JSON with a visual editor, but I have been disappointed in the editors I've tried so far. I'd like to get input from some more experienced developers. Thanks!
