> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  What's the history of the non-official pronunciation of SQL? I hear it every so often, "In sequel server...", and for some reason I cringe every time. Maybe it's because SQL doesn't mean sequel, it means Structured Query Language. However, I hesitate to mention anything because it is a little bit nitpicking after all. I do see the resemblance between SQL and sequel, but it's still wrong, is it not? Where does this way of phrasing come from?
