I was reading Joel Spolsky's mercurial introduction when it struck me: > "And now what they do is this: each new feature is in a big #ifdef block. So > they can work in one single trunk, while customers never see the new code > until it’s debugged, and frankly, that’s ridiculous." Why is this so _ridiculous_ anyway, isn't this, if nothing else, simply simpler to handle? It's nothing fancy but does the trick - at least if you are already "married" with subversion. What is the downside? I kind of don't get the argument.
