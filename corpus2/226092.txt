Suppose in a manufacturing environment, there are certain stock materials available for use in a product. For example, there are only a few different sizes of copper tube, each having a specific thickness and diameter combination. For the purposes of clean and minimal code as well as the ability to control the available options, is an `enum` a good fit for this combination of data? I was thinking I could make an `enum` with a member for each valid stock item (representing metal, physical measurements, etc.), and then provide extension methods on the `enum` to return the mentioned details. The stocks available for use may change over time, so maybe an `enum` is not the best answer. Is there a better way to express the valid combination of related values? I am using c#.
