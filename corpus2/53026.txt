I'm hoping to get some tips and advice on how to educate the rest of the company on how to submit proper bug reports. Currently we get tickets like:   * When I click this link I get a 404. (They include the page that 404s and not the page that caused it)   * Sometimes the right column flows into the button column. (no screenshot or additional information)   * Changes to xxx does seem to be working right. (EOM) Does anyone have a bug submission process/form that guides users into submitting as much information as possible?
