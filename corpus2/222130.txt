A block is a list of statements to be executed. Examples of where blocks come up in C are after a while statement and in if statements               while( boolean expression)         statement OR block          if (boolean expression)         statement OR block      C also allows a block to be nested in a block. I can use this to reuse variable names, suppose I really like 'x'               int x = 0;     while (x < 10)     {         {             int x = 5;             printf("%d",x)         }         x = x+1;     }      will print the number 5 ten times. I guess I could see situations where keeping the number of variable names low is desirable. Perhaps in macro expansion. However, I cannot see any hard reason to need this feature. Can anyone help me understand uses of this feature by supplying some idioms where it is used.
