I am about to develop a ASP.NET MVC 4 project that will make use of maps. Our company has it's own map API which is very basic at the moment, but is intended to be further developed in future to match some specific customer needs. The project will have a mobile/tablet interface in addition to it's web interface and needs to be developed now. So we have planned to start use the Google Maps v3 API. I would like to encapsulate the API, so our applications don't have Google API specific calls. The same approach as if I would like to use som external API i C# and wanted to encapsulate it in order to be able to switch API in future without having to re-code the entire application. But I haven't been able to find similar examples, so the following questions arise:   1. Is it a good and reasonable approach? Let me hear your pros and cons.   2. How would it be done in practice?
