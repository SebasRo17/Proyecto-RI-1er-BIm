In my current job, dba's and programmers are divided in tasks. Any code that needs to be written in procedures dba's write, and programmers do only application code. The strange thing is that whenever a task needs to be defined/specced, programmers get the task, and we have to define all the procedures needed and what they should return. Is this a common practice in software development? Are programmers generally the ones tasked with building requirements for the database side?
