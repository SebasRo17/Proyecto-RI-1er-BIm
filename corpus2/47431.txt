Are there any resources for sound synthesis using Mathematica? This page, Mathematica: Audio Synthesis Software, refers to other software packages, e.g. Max/MSP and Csound, for real-time synthesis. However, I would like to use Mathematica's signal processing capabilities for analysing the sound effects of various filters, before I have to delve into some other package. `Play` and `Sound` do not seem to have any real-time capability. _Max/MSP features image_ ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nxJAc.jpg) **Edit** The immediate stumbling block is the lack of real-time control when using `Play`, e.g.               EmitSound[Play[Sin[500 t^2], {t, 0, 10}]]      For instance, the played sound wave doesn't seem to be easily manipulated.                Manipulate[EmitSound[Play[Sin[500 a t^2], {t, 0, 10}]], {a, 1, 4}]      Note. You may need to quit Mathematica to stop the above command. If the emitted sound can be manipulated then filter effects could be applied in variable magnitudes.
