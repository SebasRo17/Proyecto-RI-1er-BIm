We have reached the point in our project where we have almost a thousand tests and people have stopped bothering with running them before doing a check in because it takes so long. At best they run the tests that are relevant to the piece of code that they changed and at worst they simply check it in without testing. I believe this problem is due to the fact that the solution has grown to 120 projects (we usually do much smaller projects and this is only the second time we do TDD properly) and the build + test time has grown to about two-three minutes on the lesser machines. How do we lower the run time of the tests? Are there techniques? Faking more? Faking less? Maybe the bigger integration tests shouldn't run automatically when running all the tests? **Edit:** as a response to several of the answers, we already use CI and a build server, this is how i know the tests fail. The problem (actually a symptom) is we keep getting messages about failed builds. Running partial tests is something that most people do but not all. and regarding the tests, they are actually pretty well made, they use fakes for everything and there is no IO at all.
