While analyzing a large system of ODE's, I defined a particular ratio `p`, which contains some variables that are represented by `InterpolatingFunction`s by `NDSolve`.               p = Sum[(c[i][t] + ac[i][t] + ct[i][t] + bmct[i][t] +       ambmct[i][t]) i, {i, 0, 6}]/(6*0.58)      To plot `p`, I put `p` with a transformation rule inside of a `Plot[]`, like so:               Plot[p/.tsol,{t, 0, timeduration}]      where `tsol` stores `NDSolve`'s output. Plotting of `p` works fine and yields a nicely oscillating plot. How do I extract values of this new InterpolatingFunction `p` for certain time points `t`? Ironically enough, I do manage to calculate the derivative of this function, along with the points where the slope is 0. This more trivial looking problem, however, is giving me headaches... Thanks!!
