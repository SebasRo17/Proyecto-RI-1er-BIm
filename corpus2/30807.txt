A power series expansion of a multivariate function can be performed with the `Series` command, which performs each expansion consecutively. The results can be a bit clunky, however. Often "mixed" terms will show up. For instance, a function f(x,y) expanded to the first order about zero in x then y will often have terms `a*x*y` with `a` some constant. Since we've aske for a first-order expansion, terms like `a*x*y` are undesirable. It is easy-enough to fix this in the two-variable case with something like this.               ReplaceAll[#,{x*y :> 0}]&      But in n variables, an explosion in the number of possible combinations becomes prohibitive to use this "by-hand" type of fix. Is there an elegant solution to this? I could write a routine to generate all combinations and corresponding list of replacement rules, but this seems... excessive. Is there a better way to perform the expansion that avoids this? Or is there an elegant simplification method?
