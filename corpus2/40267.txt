In _Mathematica 9.0.1_ , I want to write a user-defined template for a function that I wrote: `myfunc`               Remove[myfunc]     myfunc::usage = "myfunc[x,y,z] is a function.                      myfunc[x,y,z,w] is another function."      with the result: ![User-defined template for myfunc](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ho9Nr.png) As you can see, within the description "myfunc" is (in my opinion) unnecessarily repeated. In fact, templates for built-in functions do not behave that way. For example, look at the template for the `Integrate` function: ![Build-int template for Integrate](http://i.stack.imgur.com/hkIab.png) The function name "Integrate" is not repeated in the description. How do I tell _Mathematica_ not to repeat the name of the function inside the description?
