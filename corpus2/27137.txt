This is probably a very stupid question, but I've been fighting with it for quite awhile now. So suppose you have a module:               Test[g_] := Module[{r = g, r2},     r2 = g + 2;     Return[{g, r2}];     ];      That module returns two values such that you can plot them (I've tried it with and without the {} around the function):               Plot[{Test[g]}, {g, 0, 100}, PlotStyle -> {Red, Blue}]      I need to have them colored. I realize I can do this:               Plot[{Test[g][[1]], Test[g][[2]]}, {g, 0, 100}, PlotStyle -> {Red, Blue}]      However, Test is just an example to ask this question, my real module takes a half an hour to plot (it is doing a bunch of maximizations, etc). So, doing the last option would double that time. (and I want to make a bunch of plots). So, does anyone know how to color the lines when in the first form such that I'm not running the module twice?
