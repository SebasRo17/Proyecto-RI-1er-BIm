I am creating an application that visually displays world regions, e.g. to place markers within an administrative region. Does a dataset exist with geometrical or geographical (long/lat) descriptions of the world's current country borders (and possibly other administrative divisions)? Ideally the dataset would be in a format that I could easily generate border images of the size that I require.
