_**Note** : I asked a very similar question on StackOverflow but did not get much attention, so was directed to http://programmers.stackexchange.com as licensing issues seem to have more interest here..._ I am not an expert in Google Maps policies although I am aware that downloading / caching map tiles is not encouraged at all. In Android, developers were given the MapActivity and MapView classes which attempt to provide all possible services for displaying map tiles and even modifying them on the fly if needed, but they are pretty useless for me as I would like to use map tiles as a texture on a 3D OpenGL object. I'd like to know under which conditions the use of map tiles as an OpenGL texture is allowed. Anyone? _**UPDATE to clarify my question after Gavin's comment:_** **"Given that the Google Maps API does NOT provide a way to directly access map tiles as low level bitmaps, which is required by OpenGL texturing functions, is there any way to implement this without breaking Google licensing policies?"**
