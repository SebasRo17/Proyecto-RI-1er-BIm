I am seeking some ideas for how to build and install software with some parameters. These including target OS, target platform CPU details, debugging variant, etc. Some parts of the install are shared, such as documentation and many platform independent files, others are not, such as 64 and 32 bit libraries when these are separated and not together in a multi-arch library. On big networked platforms one often has multiple computers sharing some large server space, so there is actually cause to have even Windows and Unix binaries on the same disk. My product has already fixed an install philosophy of $INSTALL_ROOT/genericname/version/ so that multiple versions can coexist. The question is: how to manage the layout of all the other stuff?
