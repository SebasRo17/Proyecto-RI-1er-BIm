As the title says, I'm creating a TCP client and a server program in C++. My question is, when running the client and server on two separate machines that go through a different firewalled router over the internet, does it matter which router has ports forwarded? Ex. Can just the router used by the client machine have the correct TCP ports forwarded and the client server connection be established?
