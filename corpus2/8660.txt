We're integrating Mercurial slowly in our office and doing web-development we started using named branches. We haven't quite found a good convention as far as naming our branches though. We tried:   * FeatureName (Can see this causing problem down the line)   * DEVInitial_FeatureName (Could get confusing when developer come and go down the line)   * {uniqueID (int)}_Feature So far the uniqueID_featureName is winning, we are thinking of maintaining it in a small DB just for reference. It would have: branchID(int), featureName(varchar), featureDescription(varchar), date, who etc... This would give us branches like: 1_NewWhizBangFeature, 2_NowWithMoreFoo, ... and we would have an easy reference as to what that branch does without having to check the log. Any better solution out there?
