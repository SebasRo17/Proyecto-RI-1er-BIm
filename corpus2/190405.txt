I have a list in Python 2.7 of about 10000 point co-ordinates, like               [(168, 245), (59, 52), (61, 250), ... (205, 69), (185, 75)]      Is there a faster way to search for all the points in a bounding box, instead of just iterating over the entire list each time and checking if the co-ord is inside the 4 sides??   I'm using this "algoritm" to see if any point, which is randomly moving, has come inside the stationary bounding box..(if it helps)
