I want to scrape things from a web page. The way I want to do this is to extract the text of a DOM element (I believe this is the correct description). This means that I will to retrieve the text of an element like document.frames.item(0).document.innerhtml. Now I am looking for a tool to do this quickly by clicking on the element in a web page. IE DOM Inspector can do this, but is not free and requires admin rights on the computer. I have not been able to get the reference to the DOM element using DOM inspector plug-in for Firefox. Are there any other alternative tools?
