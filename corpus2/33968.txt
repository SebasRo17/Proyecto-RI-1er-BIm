I have been given the role to improve development in our company. The first thing I wanted to start was code reviews since that has never been done here before. There are 3 programmers in our company. I am a web programmer, my known languages are mainly PHP, ActionScript and JavaScript. The other 2 developers write internal applications in VB.net We have been doing code reviews for a couple weeks now. I find it hard to understand VB code. So when they say what its doing, for the most part I just have to take their word for it. If I do see something that looks wrong, I explain my opinion and I explain how I would address it in one of the languages I know. Sometimes my suggestions are welcomed but many times I am told things like "this is the best way of doing it in _this_ language" or "that doesn't apply to _this_ language" or similar things of that nature. This may be true, but without knowing the language I am not sure how to confirm or refute these claims. I know one possible solution would be to learn vb so I can do better code reviews. I really have no interest in learning vb (especially since I have a list of other technologies I am trying to learn for my own projects) and would like to keep this as a last resort but it is an option. Another idea that came to me is, they both have interest in C# and so do I. Its relative to them because its .net and relative to me because its more similar to the languages I know. Yet it is new to all of us. I thought about the benefits of us all collaborating on a pet C#.net project and reviewing each others code from that. I guess theres also the possibility hiring a consultant to come in and give us some code reviews. What would you recommend I do in this situation.
