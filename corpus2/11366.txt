I've noticed that the numeric approximation of `ArcTan` is a bit different from the symbolic one. If I write               ArcTan[0,0]      I obtain               ArcTan::indet: "Indeterminate expression ArcTan[0,0] encountered.      While if I write               ArcTan[0.0, 0]      I obtain               0      Instead I expect to obtain also in this case an indeterminate result. Is there some specific reason for this behavior? === EDIT === J. M. has noticed also this:               ArcTan[0, 0.0]      gives               Pi/2      === EDIT 2 === celtschk also noticed that               ArcTan[0.0, 0.0]      gives               ArcTan::indet: "Indeterminate expression ArcTan[0.,0.] encountered.      but it _does_ generate an output:               Interval[{-Pi, Pi}]
