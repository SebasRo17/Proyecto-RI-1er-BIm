I have defined a bunch of functions over several different files, and I would like a list of prototypes of all the functions I have defined in my current session (I want the mathematica equivalent of the .h file for my .c file). For example, if I defined two functions,               f[arg1_, arg2_]:= Module[...];     g[t_]:= Module[...];      Then I would want the following list (alphabetized, of course):               f[arg1_, arg2_]     g[t_]      It would be nice if the list could be exported to a notebook or pdf for quick viewing. How can I accomplish this task?
