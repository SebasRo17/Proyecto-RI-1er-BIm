There are some invisible operators in Mathematica (`\\[ImplicitPlus]`,`\\[InvisibleTimes]`,`\\[InvisibleComma]`,`\\[InvisibleApplication]`). How can I make my own that would not interfere with built-in functions (`Plus`,`Times`,`Sequence`,`Apply`)? Is there some invisible character like those different kinds of spaces (`\\[RawSpace]`,`\\[ThinSpace]`,`\\[VeryThinSpace]`, etc.) that won't be interpreted as multiplication, so that I can define my own patterns and behaviour with it? **EDIT** : OK, I think this is it:               TemplateBox[{}, "op",       InterpretationFunction :> (RowBox@{"~op~"} &),        DisplayFunction :> (RowBox@{"\[InvisibleSpace]"} &)];     SetOptions[EvaluationNotebook[], InputAliases -> {"op" -> %}]     SetAttributes[op, Flat];      Now if I type `1[ESC]op[ESC]2[ESC]op[ESC]3` it will be interpreted as `1~op~2~op~3` which means `op[1,2,3]` if `op` has `Flat` attribute, but will be displayed as `123`. I wonder why nobody came up with it, what all the gurus doing? Whatever, now I can finally create pretty EDSLs in Mathematica :D
