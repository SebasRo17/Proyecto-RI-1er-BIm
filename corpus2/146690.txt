A stack is something that piles bottom-up. Hence a call stack adds new items on the stack when functions are called with items being removed from the stack as each function ends until the stack is empty and then the program ends. If the above is correct, why do people refer to control moving "up" the call stack? Surely control moves _down_ the call stack until it reaches the bottom.
