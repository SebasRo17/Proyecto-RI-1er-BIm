Say I've got a cache memory where instruction and data have different cache memories ("Harvard architecture"). Which cache, instruction or data, is used most often? I mean "most often" as in time, not amount of data since data memory might be used "more" in terms of amount of data while instruction cache might be used "more often" especially depending on the program. Are there different answers a) in general and b) for a specific program?
