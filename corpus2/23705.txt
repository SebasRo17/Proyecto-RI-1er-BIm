**1\. My main question** I have a function with two argument slots. I wan't to apply this function to 2 lists with different length's. I thought in this solution:               Map[Map[f[# &, #], b] &, c]      But it doesn't work. Why is that? **Example**               f[x_, y_] := Sin[x y]                 b = {1, 2}       c = {1, 2, 3}      The output seems pretty close of what i wanted but not close enough:               {{Sin[#1 &][1], Sin[#1 &][2]}, {Sin[2 (#1 &)][1],        Sin[2 (#1 &)][2]}, {Sin[3 (#1 &)][1], Sin[3 (#1 &)][2]}}      **2.** It seems that i only need to take the &'s out of the square brackets. **a)** Is it so? Why? **b)** how can i do that? Thanks
