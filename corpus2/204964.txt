(On Windows 7 64 bit)... I am looking for a program, something similar to the default Windows Terminal, what I need it to do is: Load text from a given URL, split the code in two variables and then trigger a simple Windows command based on these two variables. Currently I am doing this with PHP ...               <?php      $my_vars = file_get_contents('http://site.com/data.txt');     list($var1, $var2) = explode($my_vars);     exec("my command $var1 $var2");     ?>       This does the job fine but I don't like having PHP installed on Windows for something as simple as this. I am looking for a more compact file that maybe can be triggered from command prompt and doesn't have many additional files or dependencies, I need it to run on 2-3 computers too.
