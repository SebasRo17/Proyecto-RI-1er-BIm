I can read the website blurb and be impressed by the alleged benefits, but I haven't worked anywhere or with anyone who followed the TOGAF (or any alternative) architecture framework. Our organisation has declared itself dedicated to moving from what is currently a fairly shambolic design & development model towards something approaching a modern structured process. Things like TOGAF have been mentioned as helping achieve a world-class enterprise development environment (!) but I'm convinced that no-one here really understands the real-world benefits that wholesale adoption might bring and, perhaps more importantly, the effort/pain required to achieve the same. Do you have experience in using TOGAF or similar to wrestle control in an organisation? Do you think that use of the framework brought any benefit? **Edit** : For clarification TOGAF is "The Open Group Architecture Framework", a detailed method and set of tools for developing an enterprise architecture.
