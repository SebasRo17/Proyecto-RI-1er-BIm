On the very last image below you can see a typical path of walking through Documentation Center guide pages. **What is the best way to get the graph data and visualize the whole structure of these connections starting from the main table of contents page?** An obvious thing to do is to look for example into directory:               SetDirectory["C:\\Program Files\\Wolfram\\Research                   \\Mathematica\\8.0\\Documentation\\English\\System\\Guides"]          FileNames[] // Column      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FvyYQ.png) But I am not sure what is the next most efficient way to analyze the connections. **A walk through guide pages** ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FhhTh.png) **\------------ UPDATE: image from @Leoind data ------------**               style = {VertexStyle -> White, VertexShapeFunction -> "Point",        EdgeStyle -> Directive[Opacity[.3], Hue[.15, .5, .8]],        Background -> Black, EdgeShapeFunction -> (Line[#1] &),        ImageSize -> 500};          gr = Graph[Union[Sort /@ data], style]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UG4un.png) The origin of self-loops was explained by @R.M in his comment. Almost all guide pages have their own URL at the top navigation bar. Here is the final graph with removed self-loops:               am = AdjacencyMatrix[gr];(am[[#, #]] = 0) & /@ Range[Length[am]];     AdjacencyGraph[am, style]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3nA8O.png)
