Suppose I have an expression of the form               a b c d + x y z      The `FullForm` of this is               Plus[Times[a,b,c,d], Times[x,y,z]]      Now suppose I want to set all expressions containing the product b*c to zero. The naive way of doing this is               a b c d + x y z /. Times[___, b, c, ___] -> 0      However, this doesn't work - nothing is replaced. (Background info: I'm expanding some term using `Series`, and would like to cancel out all products dx*dy, so that only first-order terms remain.) Even more confusing: if I don't use `Times` but a generic function `f` it works - even when I assign all the attributes of `Times` to `f`!               f;     SetAttributes[f, #]& /@ Attributes[Times];     Attributes[f]     f[a, b, c, d] /. f[___, b, c, ___] -> 0          ==>     {Flat, Listable, NumericFunction, OneIdentity, Orderless, Protected}     0      (If you evaluate this use a new kernel, as `f` will be `Protected`.) So: how do I replace expressions containing some product*? *: Assuming the order of the arguments is known. Don't worry about the fact that the expression for b might be on the left of the one for a; solving this would be another question.
