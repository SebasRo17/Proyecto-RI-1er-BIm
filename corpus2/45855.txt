What I want is similar to http://sensa.square7.ch/fit-snap0-4.jpg![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Mqucy.jpg)               Manipulate[{h1*h2*h3*h4},       Row[{Control[{h1, 0, 8}], Control[{h2, 0, 8}], Control[{h3, 0, 8}],         Control[{h4, 0, 8}], Control[{h5, 0, 8}], Control[{h6, 0, 8}],         Control[{h7, 0, 8}], Control[{h8, 0, 8}], Control[{h9, 0, 8}],         Control[{h10, 0, 8}], Control[{h11, 0, 8}], Control[{h12, 0, 8}],         Control[{h13, 0, 8}], Control[{h14, 0, 8}], Control[{h15, 0, 8}],         Control[{h16, 0, 8}], Control[{h17, 0, 8}], Control[{h18, 0, 8}],         Control[{h19, 0, 8}], Control[{h20, 0, 8}], Control[{h21, 0, 8}],         Control[{h22, 0, 8}], Control[{h23, 0, 8}], Control[{h24, 0, 8}]}],       ControlType -> VerticalSlider, ControlPlacement -> Up]
