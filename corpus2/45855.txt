When I changed my Facebook password yesterday, by mistake I entered the old one and got this: ![Screen capture of facebook login](http://i.stack.imgur.com/T1M59.png) Am I missing something here or this is a big potencial risk for users. In my opinion this is a problem BECAUSE it is FaceBook and is used by, well, everyone and the latest statistics show that 76.3% of the users are idiots [source:me], that is more that 3/4!! All kidding aside:   * Isn't this useful information for an attacker?   * It reveals private information about the user!   * It could help the attacker gain access to another site in which the user used the same password      * Granted, you should't use use the same password twice (but remember: 76.3%!!!)   * Doesn't this simply increase the surface area for attackers?   * It increases the chances of getting useful information at least.   * In a site like Facebook 1st choice for hackers and (bad) people interested in valued personal information shouldn't anything increasing the chance of a vulnerability be removed? Am I missing something? Am I being paranoid? Will 76.3% of the accounts will be hacked after this post?
