I want to create a table of $\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n i^k$ for $1\le k\le 5$. The output I want to obtain is a `TeXForm` output as follows. \begin{align} \sum_{i=1}^n i &=\frac1 2 n(n-1)\\ \sum_{i=1}^n i^2 &=\frac1 2 n(n-1)(2n+1)\\ &\vdots \end{align} My attempt is as follows but it does not produce what I want to achieve.               Sum[i^k, {i, 1, n}] // Table[Factor[#], {k, 1, 5}] & // TableForm
