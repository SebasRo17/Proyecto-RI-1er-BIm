I had to leave a startup about a month ago because of lack of funding. Basically, this client wanted an application to allow contractors to create, update, read, and delete yardsigns. Straight forward stuff, right? Not really. So today, I received a phone call from this same client claiming to have spoken with "someone who develops with the Ruby on Rails core team" and claimed that "developer" said that my code was "junk" and that there are no controllers and models, and that there's just ROR auto generated code (I assumed he meant 'scaffold'). It's not just "ROR" auto generated code. So the client now wants his money back and doesn't want to pay me the money he owes me. One of the controllers is just a simple create, show, delete, update, and I've included a "map" action for viewing the yardsigns (it's an app for contractors/homeowners -- the code was a day after developing but this is just one controller out of the rest of the app and is apart of the only commit I could retrieve. The rest of the code has since been deleted when my hard drive crashed a week ago so I don't have a full copy of the app myself atm). I also must tell you that he claims "the other developers ripped him off and left" which I now don't believe was the case. I believe they left because they were being taking advantage of. Am I in the wrong? I honestly don't know what to do here. Is this a case of a non technical client expecting "more lines of code" for his fairly simple/small application? What could I have added to please this client? I love to learn from my mistakes but I honestly don't think I've made any.
