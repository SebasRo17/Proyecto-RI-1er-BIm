I'm currently on a project, which integrates domain specific techniques in the modelling tool Enterprise Architect through UML Profiles. The domain specfic model almost matches the structure of the composite structure model, with a couple of restrictions though, so I'm trying to use the model as a foundation for my restrictions. The questions: 1) How can I generally extend models (like composite structure models) which themselves lie in the M1-layer of Meta-Object Facility? 2) Is the element "Part" of composite structure diagrams a metaclass itself, which can be extended by stereotypes in UML profiles? Since the literature on these topics is not very exhaustive, I'm also looking for suggestions, too.
