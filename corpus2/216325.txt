I'm trying to implement a parallel split task using a workflow system. I'm using .NET but my process is very simple and I don't want to use WF or anything heavy like that. I've tried using Stateless. So far is was easy to set up and run, but I may be using the wrong tool for the job because I'm not sure how you're supposed to model parallel split workflows, where you have multiple sub-tasks required before you can advance to the next state, but the steps don't require being performed in any particular order. I can easily use the dynamic configuration options to check my data model manually to see if the model is in the correct state (all sub-tasks completed) and can transition to the next state, but this seems to completely break the workflow paradigm. What is the proper, orthodox way to implement a parallel split process? Thanks
