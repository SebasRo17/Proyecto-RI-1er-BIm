Hello   I have recently been assigned to port and old cobol programm.   I am used to GUI and it i cant understand how TUI work!! I searched a lot through google but could find something....   I knew that console applications could output line by line but how colors etc draw to the terminal screen????How all this stuff is being drawn? .. Do terminals support it somehow?? Is there a standard??? I am really confused !
