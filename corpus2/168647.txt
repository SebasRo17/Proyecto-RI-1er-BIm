Say, my project have dependency N with version 1.0.0. Then something have changed, and I should depend on newer version - let it be 1.0.1. OK, I'm incrementing dependency version, nothing else changes in my code. It looks like I should increment my own projects' version, but how exactly I should increment? Should I increment only third number (so-called revision), or best practices here are more complicated. For example, may be, if we are changing projects' dependency minor value, we should do the same thing in the project itself?
