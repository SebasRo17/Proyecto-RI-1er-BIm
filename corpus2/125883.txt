Are there any languages that have both high- and low-level facilities? If not, is it feasible to create one? Why or why not? In theory, it would be very helpful to have a programming language that has both shell and regular programming language facilities, like Forth for example can easily be made to, and also to have high-level facilities; Forth does not seem (and it would probably take a good bit of work to make it) like a natural fit for high-level things. Of course, languages like C or C++ can be made to simulate features of high- level languages, but at the cost of ugly or difficult syntax, and the addition of considerably more complexity, or at the cost of a lot of work, which would be unnecessary since it would often be easier just to use a more standard high-level programming language. **Clarification** : Low-level meaning things like manual memory management, limited data structures, only one return value, and the like. Examples: Assembly language, C, C++ to some extent, and Forth. High-level language examples would be: Python, Perl, JavaScript, Java and C# to a big extent, Lisp.
