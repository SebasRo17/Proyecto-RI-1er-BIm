We're using JIRA with Greenhopper, and currently our business analyst has tasks for their analysis which will eventually lead to new stories placed in the backlog, running alongside the stories for the current sprint, and it feels kind of messy - especially because they don't overlap the workflow for the development stories. Is it common for this to be the case? Should it be? It feels like the analysis ought to be an external process that feeds in to the product backlog, not something that tags along the sprint backlog, but I am new to scrum. I consulted the scrum guide and didn't see anything explicit, and while we don't really have a Product Owner (although at times I would say our manager fills that role, other times so does the business analyst), I guess I could also phrase the question as: Should Product Owners track their tasks next to the stories that the development team works on?
