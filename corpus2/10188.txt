While preparing a dynamic module, I discovered a weird behaviour of Mathematica's controls when you rotate them:               Rotate[Button["Toto", Null], 0]     Rotate[Button["Toto", Null], 0.01]     Rotate[Button["Toto", Null], 0.02]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6CPkE.png) The first non-rotated button has standard Mac OS styling. The last one, for large enough rotation, uses a non-native styling, which is somewhat ugly. But the real surprise is that controls with small enough rotation are displayed with native styling (and it _is_ actually rotated, not just rounded down to the case of the non-rotated button). My point of view is that, while I can live with the ugliness of non-native buttons, I'd rather have uniformity between all my controls. So, my question is two-fold:   * How can I force rotated controls to be displayed with native styling?   * If that's not possible, how can I force non-rotated controls to be displayed with non-native styling?
