I have a list like the following:                {{1, 3}, {2, 5}, {3, 6}, {2, 4}}      I want the final list to be like that :               {{1, 3}, {2, 5}, {3, 6}}.      Here the first element of the sub list is needs to check with other sub list's first element and remove the sub list where first element repeated again. So the final list doesn't have `{2,4}` because `2` is repeated twice.
