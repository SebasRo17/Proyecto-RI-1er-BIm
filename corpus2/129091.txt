I work for a small company that has had a product development department for quite a while. What we haven't had, however, is a QA/testing group. We are looking to add a testing group, but are struggling to determine where best to put them in the organizational structure of the company. Specifically, we are going to hire a "lead tester" position. Should they be put in as part of the product development department, or should they be a new department? Should they be somewhere else? Our company is roughly structured as follows:   * CEO      * CTO        * Director Product Development       * Director Customer Care          * Developers       * VP Operations          * Network engineers     * Sales/sales engineers     * President        * Controller
