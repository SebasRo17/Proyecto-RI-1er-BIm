I'm use the Repository pattern along with EF at work. I'm wondering if there is a way for me to make an addon or somehow tap into the EF code generation of the table classes when the model is saved. So that I can automatically generate the repository stub as well. I'd also like to check if it already exists and if so not to regenerate (as the stub might have custom code for that EF type).
