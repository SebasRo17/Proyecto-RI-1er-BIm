I've read/heard that interruptions are bad for programmers. I've also read/heard that getting into 'the zone' is good. I don't doubt these assertions, but I'd like to educate colleagues (managers, mainly) and family members (for when I work from home) about the perils of interruptions and the productivity gains to be had from 'the zone'. So could anyone point me to articles and/or books that make the arguments well? Feel free to make those arguments here in an answer if you like. It would be helpful if there were some in there that were aimed at managers and non-programming colleagues.
