Considering I have some data, and I want to fit the data to a linear fit and find the average error from the linear fit, how can I do that using Mathematica? I have               temp = WeatherData[location, "MeanTemperature", {start, end, "Day"}];     Show[ListPlot@Partition[Reverse@temp["Values"], 2, 1], Plot[line, {x, 0, 40},        PlotStyle -> Red]]      Which generates ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fN4JA.jpg) How can I find the average error of this linear fit?
