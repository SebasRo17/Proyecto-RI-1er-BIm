DateList experiences some strange behavior which i cannot explain. This code works fine:               DateList[{"2012September1211:45:26", {"Year", "MonthName", "Day",         "Hour", ":", "Minute", ":", "Second"}}]      Returning               {2012, 9, 12, 11, 45, 26.}      But this code doesn't work:               DateList[{"2012October1211:45:26", {"Year", "MonthName", "Day",         "Hour", ":", "Minute", ":", "Second"}}]      Returning this error message: > DateString::str: String 2012October1211:45:26 cannot be interpreted as a > date in format {Year,MonthName,Day,Hour,:,Minute,:,Second}. >> The only thing i changed is the month from september to october. Really frustrating, i'm already staring at it for 2 hours... **Question: What am i doing wrong?**
