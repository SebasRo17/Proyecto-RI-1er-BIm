Many languages like `C++`, `C#`, and `Java` allow you to create objects that represent simple types like `integer` or `float`. Using a class interface you can override operators and perform logic like checking if a value exceeds a business rule of 100. I'm wondering if it's possible in some languages to define these rules as annotations or attributes of a variable/property. For example, in `C#` you might write:               [Range(0,100)]     public int Price { get; set; }      Or maybe in `C++` you could write:               int(0,100) x = 0;      I've never seen something like this done, but given how dependent we have become on data validation before storage. It's strange that this feature hasn't been added to languages. Can you give example of languages where this is possible?
