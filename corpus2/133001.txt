I would like to do some code review on the SVN repository used by our team. For now, I've used Eclipse: show log on trunk, click on a revision and "Compare" to see the changes. The diff renders great, but the navigation isn't practical IMO. I'm looking for a tool that could enable code reviewing with "diffs", but with an **easy navigation in the changes**. For example, being able to **filter/exclude commits** based on their names/patterns, show commits of a user, **show changes since last tag** , maybe watch commits on sensitive files, etc... An Eclipse plugin would be the best, as I could still use functionalities such as Ctrl+click on methods/classes. But any suggestion in welcomed.
