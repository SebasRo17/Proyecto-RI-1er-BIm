Can someone explain what is going on with the following ...               func[y_] := func[y] = (Print["Hello world !!!"];)          func[1]      > Hello world !!!               func[2]      > Hello world !!!               func[1] (*nothing printed*)          func[2] (*nothing printed*)      As I understand it () are used so the function remembers its values, but as you see when I repeat `func[1]`, nothing. If I take out the `y` in `f[y]`, it prints. If I define the function as `f[y_] := (...)` (without `f[y] =` ), it prints. I'm sure there is a simple explanation, any help is appreciated.
