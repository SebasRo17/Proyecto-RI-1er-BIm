Recently I was trying to make something where one could vary the parameters and press play to see how the animation changed. However, when I tried running the code it would just start automatically. Even if I pressed pause nothing would happen. I managed to narrow the problem down and have made a simple example to illustrate the issue. If I run the following code I get what I want. (i.e. press play and it starts. Press pause and it stops)               Clear[step,MyAnimation,dynamicVar]     step=0;     dynamicVar={1,2};     MyAnimation[nothing_,something_]:=Module[{},step++;something+{step,step}]     Manipulate[         dynamicVar=MyAnimation[time,{1,2}];         Dynamic@dynamicVar,         {{time,1,""},1,\[Infinity],1,ControlType->Trigger,AnimationRate->2}     ]      However, if I replace `dynamicVar=MyAnimation[time,{1,2}]; ` with `dynamicVar=MyAnimation[time,dynamicVar];` what I get is something which runs automatically and which one cannot not stop. (I know they give two different results, but the issue lies in the fact that I cannot stop it)               Clear[step,MyAnimation,dynamicVar]     step=0;     dynamicVar={1,2};     MyAnimation[nothing_,something_]:=Module[{},step++;something+{step,step}]     Manipulate[         dynamicVar=MyAnimation[time,dynamicVar];         Dynamic@dynamicVar,         {{time,1,""},1,\[Infinity],1,ControlType->Trigger,AnimationRate->2}     ]      Any advice on how to fix this problem?
