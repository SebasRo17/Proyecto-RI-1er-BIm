So, after browsing through older posts to see if anybody else could have had the same problem, I have come to the conclusion that I am stuck. That bothers me, especially because it should be straight forward. I am trying to solve a Differential Equation. The equation is: ![Image of the Differential Equation to be solved, including the time domain](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zakEH.png) I would like to find X(t), and hence plot X as a function of time. It is known that X = 0 when t = 0. I write this the following way:               solOpg13a1 =         DSolve[{D[X[t], t] == (k*(1 - X[t])*(t*Fa - X[t]*nB0))/(V0 + t*v0), X[0] == 0}, X[t], t];      Next, I prepare it for plotting by the following:               eqOpg13a1 = X[t] /. solOpg13a1 //. {k -> 5.1 , V0 -> 1500 , nB0 -> 1125 , Fa -> 6.0, v0 -> 4} // First;      Please note that V0 and v0 are not the same. X(t) works OK for values above 150 (more or less). For values of t less than around 150, I get a series of Power::infy and Infinity::indet errors. ![Screendumpt of errors and plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cB6J6.png) It should be straight forward, and so I am sorry to call for help, but I just can't put a finger on where I go wrong. The time to t_full is approximately 250 Hours (which is the unit of t). I am using Mathematica 9.
