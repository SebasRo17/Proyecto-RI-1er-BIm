Why doesn't Visual Basic.NET have the _addressof_ operator like C#? In C#, one can               int i = 123;     int* addr = &i;      But VB has no equivalent counter part. It seems like it should be important. **UPDATE** Since there's some interest, Im copying my response to Strilanc below. > The case I ran into didnt necessitate pointers by any means, but I was > trying to trouble shoot a unit test that was failing and there was some > confusion over whether or not an object being used at one point in the stack > was the same object as an object several methods away.
