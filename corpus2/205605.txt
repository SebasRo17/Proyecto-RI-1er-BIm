I need to come up with a data structure to keep information about English verb forms. In most cases a verb can be in one of 4 forms: base, present participle, past participle and past simple, for example:   * take   * taking   * taken   * took It's seemingly easy to define 4 types for each form and be over with it. However there are few exceptions that ruin this simple idea.   1. Present single third person form, which is in our example would be "takes".   2. Copular verb "to be" has multiple irregular forms in the present tense: "am", "is", "are" and "was" and "were" in the past tense   3. Verbs like "may" that don't inflect in the present single third person form: "she may". What data structure would be efficient, accurate yet unambiguous for representing such information (with exceptional cases) given the following requirements have to be met:   * for an arbitrary form answer the question what conjugations the form represents   * for an arbitrary conjugation and a form answer the question whether the form represents the given conjugation or not?
