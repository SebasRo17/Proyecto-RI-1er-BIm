I'm looking at a piecewise function of two lines, which has a kink, such as:               f1[p_] := 1.41 * p + 2*^8;     f2[p_] := 1.45 * p + 1.9584*^8;     f3[p_] := Piecewise[{{f1[p], p <= 1.04*^8}, {f2[p], p > 1.04*^8}}];      I want to work with a function which is linear on both sides of the kink like above, but is smooth in a small region around the kink as an approximation to the above function. I'd like to use Interpolation[] to find a smooth function to approximate a region of width delta p around the kink, p = 1.04 * 10^8. However Interpolation can give me a function which will just introduce more kinks out the boundaries with f1 and f2. Is there a way I can enforce boundary conditions on Interpolation[] so that it can give me a smooth function in this region? Edit to clarify: The boundary I'm considering is arbitrary; it is just centered around 1.04*10^8. For example, I tried using a region of width .01*10^8 centered around this value, so my code was:               region = Interpolation[{{1.03*^8, f1[1.03*^8]}, {1.035*^8, f1[1.035*^8]}, {1.045*^8, f2[1.045*^8]}, {1.05*^8, f2[1.05*^8]}}];      But if you plot this, it will not be smooth with the rest of the function (i.e., it doesn't have a slope of 1.41 at p=1.03*^8, and 1.45 at p=1.05*^8. I want to enforce those slopes at those values, or any other arbitrary value).
