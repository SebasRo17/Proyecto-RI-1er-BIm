Mathematica uses the ILU0 procedures automatically to precondition large sparse linear systems; e.g.               LinearSolve[mat, rhs,         Method -> {Krylov, Preconditioner -> ILU0}]; // Timing      I wish to have the incomplete factorization of the large sparse matrix A in a standalone procedure. I would be grateful if someone could give some tips or written code to provide the ILU0 or ILUT approximate inverses as standalone procedures.
