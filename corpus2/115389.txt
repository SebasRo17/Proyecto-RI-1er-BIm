I have been reviewing several resumes we have for a new position. I noticed that a few of them had many old programming language versions and old applications on their resume (e.g. SQL 4.2, VB5, Lotus 123, Novell). This left their list of computer experience very long. Do you keep it fresh? Do you show your depth of experience even though you will never use that techology again? When should you drop old technology on your resume? By keeping old technology on your resume does that do any harm in getting hired?
