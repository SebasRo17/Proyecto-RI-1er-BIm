Considering the richness of Mathematica.SE, I am quite surprised I could not find my answer... I am very sorry if it is a duplicate. Consider the following example:               With[{t1=0,t2=t1},t1+t2] (* -> t1 *)      I thought it would print `0` instead of `t1`. Indeed, a `Trace` gives:                Trace@With[{t1 = 0, t2 = t1}, t1 + t2]      (* {With[{t1=0,t2=t1},t1+t2],0+t1,t1} *)      `t1` stays unevaluated. Considering the complex usage of Hold and such attributes for a Mathematica beginner like me and the documentation that states `With` has attribute `HoldAll`, I tried inserting `Evaluate` at various places, and also tried replacing `With` by `Module` (I admit the difference between `With` and `Module` is not obvious to me), but nothing printed me `0` instead of `t1`. How can I inform Mathematica to evaluate `t2=t1` with `t1` and `t2` declared within `With`? Edit: Thanks to the first comments and answer, some usefull and closely related question and answers can be found here.
