I am intending to purchase some source code for my Delphi program. It is not too big an algorithm, but it is not available in Delphi and I'll have to translate it to Delphi. However, I have not worked in any of the languages it is offered in and I don't know which I should buy. I want the one that will translate to Delphi most easily and accurately. The three languages are: C++, Java, and C#. Which one would be easiest to convert?
