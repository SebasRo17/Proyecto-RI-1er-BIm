I am part of a Java development team with a 6 week deadline. This necessitates writing a good deal of code very very quickly. However our development team has different styles of coding. Everything from name conventions to methods of abstraction differ among our team. Does anyone know of any documents that dictate "standards" for java? To clarify, I was wondering if there was an organization that would dictate proper naming convention for variables and functions for example. This is paramount as with such a short deadline we can't afford to spend time trying to comprehend each others code.
