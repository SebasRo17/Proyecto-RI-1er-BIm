After reading the `PlotMarkers` documentation it seems to be all or nothing. For example if you wanted markers on some of you lines the code below seems possible/probable given the documentation:               ListPlot[Table[n^(1/p), {p, 4}, {n, 10}],      Joined -> True,      PlotMarkers -> {{"\[FilledSquare]", 10.9`}, None,         None, {"\[EmptyCircle]", 9}}]      But this doesn't work. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dmpwp.png) It seems that an empty string is the only way to get no markers for some of the lines if you choose markers on others. Is this correct or am I misusing `PlotMarkers`? When using an empty circle marker the background is transparent so the line can be seen underneath. If I want filled white circle with an `EdgeForm` colour that obscures the plot line I can make one and use it as a marker as per instructions in the documentation but then I run into the headache of wanting to parse the default (or other) colours to the `EdgeForm` directive. This can be developed but what a headache. Has anyone got any easy work arounds?               ListPlot[Table[n^(1/p), {p, 4}, {n, 10}],      Joined -> True,      PlotMarkers -> {{Graphics[{EdgeForm[Directive[ColoursGoHere,Thick, Thick]], White,            Disk[{0, 0}, 1]}], 0.05}}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6oia4.png)
