Recently I've read this blog about Google integrating Clang parser into their code analysis tools This is something in which C++ is at least a decade behind other languages like Java, but now that llvm-clang is almost C++ iso-ready, I think its possible for C++ code analysis tools to begin using the C++ parser effectively, since it has been designed from the ground up precisely for this I'm wondering if there are existing open source or known commercial projects taking this path, integrating with Clang to provide higher-level analysis tools?
