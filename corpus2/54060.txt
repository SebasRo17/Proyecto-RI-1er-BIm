So I know HTML5 is the "replacement" for Flash...however it's obviously not mainstream just yet......but what else is it supposed to replace. I ask this because web-dev has always been a secret kinda side-passion of mine (even though I a firmware programmer mostly doing C/Java stuff). And anyway I want to pursue a side thing at doing web design (I know basic XHTML/CSS + some CSS3) But what exactly is I guess...."pointless" to study? JavaScript I assume will always be a huge part of web design? (HTML5 isn't replacing that is it?) What about Ajax and CSS itself?) And then there's Flash....not sure if thats really worth putting effort into? Also there's Adobe Flex/Air......I'm a bit confused if you can't tell.
