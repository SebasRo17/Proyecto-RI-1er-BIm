I need to partition a bivariate data set into predetermined "n" clusters and, at the same time, to fix the centroid position of each cluster. Is the `ClusteringComponents` function useful? Thanks BR for your help. I will use your example to explain better my question I want to Split your “data” into two (n=2) clusters. Previously, I want to fix the coordinate (centroids) of the two clusters.               data = With[{\[Rho] = -0.4},      RandomVariate[BinormalDistribution[{-1, 1}, {1, 2}, \[Rho]], 10000]];          FIXEDcentroids = {{-2, 0}, {0.5, -0.4}};          Show[ListPlot[data, Frame -> True, Axes -> False],      ListPlot[FIXEDcentroids, Frame -> True, PlotStyle -> {Black, PointSize[0.02]}]]       The next step should be to "force" the clustering process to split the “data” set according the position of the two predefined centroids. If I use the `FindCluster` traditional form:               NumberOfCluster = 2;     clusterdata = FindClusters[data, NumberOfCluster];      I obtained two new centroids.               centroidFindClusters = Mean[#] & /@ clusterdata      Obviously the two new centroids are differents from those that I preselected (i.e. FIXEDcentroids). Therefore I am not able to solve my problem.... ...if were possible to write: `FindClusters[data, FIXEDcentroids]` it would be perfect......
