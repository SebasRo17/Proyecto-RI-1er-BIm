I know that many websites, video games and other software contain thousands of lines of code while being developed by a single person in a short amount of time. How are those people able to write thousands of LOC day after day? For me, it seems a huge number: I rarely write more than a few hundred lines per day, and often spend my time _removing_ code instead of adding LOCs. Is it really written by hand, or do they use some code generators?
