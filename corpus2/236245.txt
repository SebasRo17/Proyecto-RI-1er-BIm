When building a unit test, **is it appropriate to use a mocking tool to assist you in setting up an object** even if you will not be mocking any behavior or verifying any interaction with that object? Here is a simple example in pseudo-code:               //an object we actually want to mock     Object someMockedObject = Mock(Object.class);     EqualityChecker checker = new EqualityChecker(someMockedObject);          //an object we are mocking only to avoid figuring out how to instantiate or      //tying ourselves to some constructor that may be removed in the future     ComplicatedObject someObjectThatIsHardToInstantiate = Mock(ComplicatedObject.class);          //set the expectation on the mock     When(someMockedObject).equals(someObjectThatIsHardToInstantiate).return(false);     Assert(equalityChecker.check(someObjectThatIsHardToInstantiate)).isFalse();          //verify that the mock was interacted with properly     Verify(someMockedObject).equals(someObjectThatIsHardToInstantiate).oneTime();      Is it appropriate to mock ComplicatedObject in this scenario?
