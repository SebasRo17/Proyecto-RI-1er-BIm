I would like to port a large Win32 DLL to native linux in C++. I don't think I can use Wine for a DLL like mine, because users of the DLL would then also have to be in Wine, and then they would all whine... As a Windows C++ programmer, I don't (yet) have any familiarity with the GUI front-end services in linux, but if it logically runs on anything like win32 message loops, fonts, bitmaps, invalidation regions, getmessage( ) calls and so forth, it should be a fairly straight forward remapping of my existing code. So what am I looking at here, a remap or a rewrite? The path for such things must be well worn by now.
