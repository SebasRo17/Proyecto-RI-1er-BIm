I'm attempting to calculate the mean first passage time between two vertices, $v_1$ and $v_2$, provided some undirected graph $G$. However, I noticed that running the following script:               DMPG = DiscreteMarkovProcess[1, G];     Print[Mean[FirstPassageTimeDistribution[DMPG,2]]      Returns a value for the mean first passage time between $v_1$ and some $v_i$ (instead of the desired $v_2$) due to a vertex name reassignment by DiscreteMarkovProcess[]. How can I stop this, or find the mapping between vertices in $G$ and nodes in the Markov chain generated by DiscreteMarkovProcess[]?
