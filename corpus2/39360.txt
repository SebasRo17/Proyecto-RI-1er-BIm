I am maintaining a VB6 application and we are studying how to migrate to .Net We are considering doing this gradually by implementing new features in COM visible .Net classes and migrating existing functionality slowly. I found some instructive 'Hello World' examples about how to do this and it works fine with our App. But how is the real world behaviour of these hybrid applications? Are they stable, maintainable? Particular of our program is that more users on the same computer will use it by switching user accounts. EDIT: The VB6 app reads data from a USB connection and stores it in an Access database. The user can call up various views on the data. The data is cached in a hardware device, so interuptions in the reading of it are not fatal.
