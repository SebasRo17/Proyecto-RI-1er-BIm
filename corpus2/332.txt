Not all functions seem to work with `SetOptions`. e.g.               SetOptions[Grid, BaseStyle -> Directive[Red]];     Grid[{{"hello", "world"}}]          hello world      the font _is not_ red.               SetOptions[Row, BaseStyle -> Directive[Red]];     Row[{"hello", "world"}]          hello world      ...and the font _is_ red. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TWDM4.png)               SetOptions[InputField, FieldSize -> 5];     InputField[Dynamic[x]]      the input field size is _much_ larger than 5. But on the other hand               InputField[Dynamic[x], Sequence @@ Options[InputField]]      yields an input field with field size 5. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XAS9x.png) ...and so on. What is the easiest way to work out (i.e. make a list of ...) which functions can't be used with `SetOptions`?
