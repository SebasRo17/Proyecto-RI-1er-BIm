My software composed of an EXE and dependent class library dlls, built on Windows using visual studio C# Compiler. I've been able to run it directly on Mac OS X using _mono myApp.exe_ without rebuilding. Now, for the deployment, I've successfully made mono bundle using **mkbundle** with _\--deps_ option for all dependent class library assemblies. But I did **NOT** use _\--static_ option. So my application dynamically links to mono and glib. Wrapped it inside mac APP bundle, then copied the needed libmono- _[XYZ]_.dylib , and all other dependent native libs from _Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework_ into that bundle, changing each dylib id and install name to be the copy insde the bundle rather than original in Mono.framework directory. Tested the _M_ bundle in a mono free machine. the bundle worked perfectly. **My question** is, do I still need to obtain a license from Xamarin to distribute my application to end users under my proprietary license, provided that all mono native runtime libraries are in the App bundle and the user can update/replace them as per LGPL license of mono runtime? Thanks!
