I have a table of user relationship which stores who follows whom, the table structure is as follows               -id     -follower     -following      when someone follows any other user, I add a record with follower user id and id of user he is following, now my question=> When user wants to unfollow that user, I have decided rather than deleting the record I can add another column `break` at the end of this table, which I will set to `true` when user wants to unfollow, this way I can maintain consistency in the records, that is there wont be any gap like 1,2,4,7,8,9,15 if I delete records. If I dont delete the record, I can use it if that user want to follow that user again in future I can set break column of that record to `false` and the relationship will exist again..what do you guys think should I use this approach or I should delete the record? Tell me if the approach is good or there could be any issues associated with it and also tell me if there is any better way you know. Thanks
