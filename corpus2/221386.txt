I have read in several places this following rule concerning Aggregates: > Entities in one aggregate can hold references to any other Aggregate Root, > but never to an Entity or Value Object inside the other Aggregate. What can go wrong if an Entity was holding a direct reference to an entity in another Aggregate root? Can someone please explain why such rule is important? and preferably illustrate with an example, please?
