What is the most convenient way to change options such as `VertexLabels` in existing `Graph` objects? (Version 7 users note: `Graph` is new in Mathematica 8.) * * * With graphics, we can use `Show` for this, not matter what function was originally used to produce the graphic:               g = Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 10}]     Show[g, Axes -> False, Frame -> True]      Is there an analogous function for `Graph`s? Suppose we already have a graph, and now we need to show vertex labels in a different way. Here's a workaround using `HighlightGraph`:               g = Graph[{1 -> 2}]     HighlightGraph[g, {}, VertexLabels -> "Name"]      While it works, this is not really what `HighlightGraph` is meant for. * * * Please note that `Graph` objects are atomic before trying to take them apart. Also, I'm looking for the safest and most robust solution. I'm hoping there's a function I overlooked.
