I have a requirement where MS Access application needs to be re-platformed to java application.The MS access app has about 45,000 records and 53 columns with SQL connectivity.These record data need to be edited,data used to send email with pdf report attachment.Report is designed using SQL reporting services.I need to create UI to call the reporting service and generate reports.The customer wants all the 45000 records to be loaded in the single stretch in the datatable. Can anyone please suggest which is the best way to mimic this in java.Do i need to go with swing app or a web app.
