Having read many books, there is a basic contradiction: Some say, "the goal of testing is to find bugs" while other say "the goal of the testing is to equalize the quality of the product", meaning that bugs are its by-products. I would also agree that if testing would be aimed primarily on a bug hunt, who would do the actual verification and actually provide the information that the software is ready? Even e.g. Kaner changed his original definition of testing goal from bug hunting to quality assessment provision but I still cannot see the clear difference. I perceive both as equally important. I can verify software by its specification to make sure it works and in that case, bugs found are just by products. But also I perform tests just to break things. Also what definition is more accurate? Note above I am primarily referring to software testing as a process.
