I am doing out some flow charts and am wondering if I am approaching this correctly. In essence, I have several method calls and I am flowcharting each separately. However, several of these methods make a method call for some info and then continue. See this example: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bmqBD.png) I have 3 other methods that also call GetQueue() and I am wondering if I am representing this correctly. The AddQueue() flow visually looks like it is broken. NOTE: Changes made in my flowchart: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pWa9Q.png)
