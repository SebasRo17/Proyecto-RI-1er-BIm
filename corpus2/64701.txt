So when choosing what language to use for a project, in an ideal world the language is chosen because it's the right tool for the job. However, I often prefer to use a language that I am _fluent_ in rather than one I would have to learn or that I am only conversational in. Of course language fluency also entails knowledge of the applicable libraries in the language. Just because I really like a fairly general-purpose language like Java doesn't mean I should always use it, but at the same time it doesn't mean I should break out something like Perl every time there's some text processing to be done. How does one find the balance here?
