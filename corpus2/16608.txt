I'm working as a developer in a small software company whose main job is interfacing between separate applications, like between a telephony system and an environment control system, between IP TVs and hospitality systems, etc...And it seems like I am the candidate for a new job title in the company, as the person who does the proof of concept of a new interfacing project and does some R&D for prototyping. What do you think the pros and cons of such a job would be, considering mainly the individual progress/regress of a person as a software engineer? And what aspects would you consider essential in a person to put him/her in such a job position?
