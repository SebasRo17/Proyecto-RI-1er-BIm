I need to find the "Maxima" and "Minima" on a B-Spline or more correct the points where the 2nd components of the derivate equal zero. For example:               g = BSplineFunction[{{1, 2}, {2, 4}, {3, -1}, {4, 2}}] ;      dg=g';     Solve[{dg[t][[2]] == 0, 0 <= t <= 1}, t]      The problem is that "Solve" wont work for this kind of application, and "Minimize" or similar functions stop at the first finding. Any ideas?   CX
