I am a fairly adept .NET and PHP programmer. These days my pattern of choice for complex web apps is an SOA approach where I use PHP as the front end, and WCF web services as the middle tier. My ajax calls are usually to JSON webHttpBinding WCF endpoints. On the .NET side of things I am absolutely in love with the Visual Studio plugin ReSharper. So my question is as follows, I want to rethink my tool chain on the PHP side of things. On one side JetBrains, the makers of Resharper, have a PHP IDE called PHPStorm. On the other side, I can use VS.PHP and ReSharper. Does anyone use the later combination fo VS.PGP and Resharper? Can you recommend it?
