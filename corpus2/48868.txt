Under the `Style` menu, there is an entry called `DisplayFormulaNumbered`. It does exactly what it seems to suggest: it indexes the contents of the cell by an auto-incrementing number. The numbering is updated throughout the notebook automatically. For instance, if I have three formulas numbered `(1)`, `(2)` and `(3)`, and I delete `(2)`, Formula `(3)` automatically becomes Formula `(2)`. But the references to Formula `(3)` in the text of the notebook are not updated automatically. I have to manually change all of them. Is there a way to automate this task? (Sorry, I can't seem to give a better description of the problem.)
