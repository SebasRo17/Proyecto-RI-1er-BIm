So I'm learning the basics with C++, and I've created a small text based shopping mall which asks the user if they'd like to buy an item. If the user responds with yes, or any variant of yes, it'll list an array of items, from which you can then type in the name of the item you want to buy and it'll say "thanks, you've bought x item, goodbye" and the program will stop. If you decide to put no, it'll say "you have selected no, are you sure you wouldn't like to go back and buy an item". If you put yes, it'll list the array of items again for you to select, however, what i'd like for it to do is to then 'abide' by the previous if statement (as if you were saying yes to the first question). Hopefully you catch what i'm on about! Thanks. EDIT: unsure what's so unclear about the question 'what i'd like for it to do is to then 'abide' by the previous if statement (as if you were saying yes to the first question).' I'm asking if it's possible to go back to a previous if statement that's mentioned earlier on in the code, however, I realise that it's probably not possible and I'm now trying to figure out another way of doing so. Thanks.
