I don't know if this is a question, or a start of a conversation or even a completely irrelevant topic. Why isn't programming more standardised? Im really new to this and I find it hellish difficult to find the answer to even basic questions. Things like--   * How do I add validation to multiple texboxes in asp.net c# without using individual validation controls?   * How do I add the input of a texbox to an ongoing array? I'm talking about fundamental things that get used all the time. I would expect answers like "oh yeah, see jones' validation method (link) or peters' textbox to array function (link). I just thought there would be standard techniques, like in chess, for doing things that are similar. I hope this makes sense and someone can point me in the right direction if there ARE directories of standard programming technniques.
