I am learning "Programming languages principles" and there is a lot of information about stuff which make up a programming language . Unfortunately every material I came across until now has a lot of technical jargon involved and is very difficult to understand (Atleast for a beginner sincerely trying to understand the topic on his own by reading the material) . Can anyone explain me the "Subscript binding and array categories" in general .. The classification says there are five kinds of arrays -   1.Static array   2.Fixed stack-dynamic array   3.Stack dynamic array   4.Fixed heap dynamic array   5.Heap dynamic array This is what I could understand from the definitions (almost on every article on this topic I came across) . **Static array -** subscript ranges are _statically bound_ and storage allocation is static.   I understood that the space for the array is allocated in memory at compile time (before run time) . **Fixed stack-dynamic array -** subscript ranges are _statically bound_ , but the allocation is done at _elaboration time during execution_.   Now I didn't understand anything . What is meaning of the _italicized phrases_ **Stack-dynamic array -** the subscript ranges are _dynamically bound_ , and the storage allocation is dynamic “during execution.” Once bound they remain fixed during the lifetime of the variable.   I dont understand what is meant by being 'bound' ? I should be able to understand the remaining two definitions if I understand these three . I know I am asking a lot .   Thanks :) Here's a link I recently came across which I find useful for this topic . Anyone interested in this topic , check it out . :)
