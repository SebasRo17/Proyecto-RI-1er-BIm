> Highly related Nodejs: many clients requests through one socket I'm investigating a robust message passing system for this application of mine. The easyest solution would be Redis pub/sub (it's simple, effective and I'd also use Redis for caching) but as I understand it, publishing is a "one shot" operation only to actually subscribed clients. Whoever subscribes after the publishing, does not get the message. I'd like to be able to "stash" unreceived messages for a while, so if I reconnect to the channel I'd get back the messages I've not received. I know that systems like ActiveMQ with the ack and permament queue mechanism would solve this issue easily, but I'm wondering if there could be a simpler solution/approach. What do you think?
