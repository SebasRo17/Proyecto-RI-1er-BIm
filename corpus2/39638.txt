When I define functions in _Mathematica_ like:               f[x_] := 3      f[x_Integer] := 6      How is the value of `f[6]` determined?   It seems to be independent of the order they're defined (which would make the most sense). From my initial testing, it picks the most "restricted" definition, but the meaning of this is unclear if I used patterns like `f[x_ /; x > 3]` Can anyone point me to any documentation/specification about this issue ?   I've looked unsuccessfully for a while.
