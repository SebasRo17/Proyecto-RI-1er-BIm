I'm currently working on an indie project, so I don't exactly have the luxury of throughout human testing or external code review â€” however, I don't see any difficult bugs in my current code (I fix them as I see them, and most of the time they're just wrong field names and such, things that you fix in a minute or two), and I test it after implementing any feature before pushing it. Lately my LOC number was about 400 a day (for the record, it's C#), and I'm not only implementing new systems, but also rewrite things I've already written and fix some bugs. Should I be bothered? Is it the sign that I need to stop and review all the code I've been writing up to this date and refactor it?
