I need to apply some computations to a moving window of $N$ items in a time series and I am struggling with doing recursion and shifting the considered window. To illustrate, please consider the simple function below.               myFunction[state_] := Append[state[[2 ;;]], RandomInteger[10]]     initialState = {1, 2, 3};     RandomInteger[10];     state1 = myFunction[initialState]     state2 = myFunction[state1]      In reality I am doing some time series analysis. I am predicting the `t4` based on `t1`, `t2` and `t3`. Then I want to predict `t5` based on `t2`, `t3` and my predicted `t4` and so on. So after 3 iterations, I will be predicting based on my 3 first predictions
