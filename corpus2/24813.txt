Can I customize the `In[]` and `Out[]` headers? I'd like to add `$UserName`, `$MachineName` and `DateString[]`, evaluated at cell creation time, into those headers, so it's easy to know by whom and when any particular cell was generated by a glance. This is similar to why/how people customize UNIX terminal prompt.
