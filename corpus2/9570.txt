I have a big polynomial that evaluates to: $$A^2 e^2 \phi ^- \phi ^++A e \phi ^- \phi ^+ c_{2 w} g_Z+\frac{1}{2} A e g h W^- \phi ^+ +\ll13\gg,$$ which is supposed to represent some terms in the standard model Lagrangian. I need to do the following:   1. Reorganize the factors in each term so that $e$ comes before $A$ and $\phi^+$ before $\phi^-$. So that the first term, for example, would instead read $e^2A^2\phi ^+\phi ^- $.   2. Reorganize the whole polynomial so that terms containing $h$ comes first and those containing $\phi^\pm$ come last so that the above expression would start with the third term displayed above. I believe this would be done most efficiently by customizing the canonical ordering of each symbol in _Mathematica_. I'm pretty sure this can't be done â€” so what can I do to achieve my task?
