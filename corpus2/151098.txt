http://php.net/manual/en/function.mb-convert-encoding.php Say I do:               $encoded = mb_convert_encoding ($original);      That looks like simple enough. WHat I am imagining is the following `$original` has a pointer to the way the string is actually encoded. Something like `char *` kind of thing. And then there are things like what the character actually encoded. It's probably somewhere along UTF-64 kind of thing where each glyph is indeed a character. Now when we do               $encoded = mb_convert_encoding ($original);       several thing can happen:   * the original internal representation doesn't change however it is REINTERPRETED so that the code that show up differs   * the original string that it represent doesn't change however the ENCODING change. Which one is right?
