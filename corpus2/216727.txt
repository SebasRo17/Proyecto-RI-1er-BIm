Ten days ago, we fixed a bug on a large application and the hot fix has created a disappearing of some data from the user point of view ( _side effect_ ). Data are not deleted, but have been set to _hidden_ status. It could be possible to get the data back, but the thing seems to be hard: we've already spent 10 days to understand and reproduce the problem (mostly with SQL queries but sometimes it is necessary to _update_ the database to test the application logic). My questions are :   * is 10 days a normal amount of time for these kind of problems?   * should we keep on and retrieve the data or should we give up this work (so the customer-relationship person will tell these users _sorry for the loss, but your data have disappeared_ or maybe tell nothing at all)?   * what can be the signs that shows that **we should stop to search for how to solve this issue**? Edit about the context : we are a small team(3), users are not the customers, and lost data are not about the users money, bank or vital data. This is a question from a confused developer about _development methodologies_ and _business concerns_ , not about how we should deal with the customers.
