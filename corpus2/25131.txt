So far I heard about :   * Lambda calculus   * Lambda programming   * Lambda expressions   * Lambda functions Which all seems to be related to functional programming... Apparently it will be integrated into C++1x, so I might better understand it now: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B0x#Lambda_functions_and_expressions Can somebody defines briefly what are lambdas things and give an where it can be useful ?
