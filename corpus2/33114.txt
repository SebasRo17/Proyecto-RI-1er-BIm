In this simplified code below, I'd like to display two plots within `Manipulate`, and use the `Locator` controltype to set the value of `x` relative to its position within the first plot only. With the `Print[x]` command inserted it is obvious that the locator is using the coordinates of the entire graphics plane.               Manipulate[      Print[x];      GraphicsRow[{ListLinePlot[{x, {0, 0}},          PlotRange -> {{0, 2}, {0, 2}}],         ListLinePlot[{x, {2, 2}},          PlotRange -> {{0, 2}, {0, 2}}]}], {{x, {0, 0}, {2, 2}},        ControlType -> Locator}]
