Anyone knows what's the problem with the following code and how can I fix it? I am not sure that I wrote the WhenEvent section correctly. By the way, I want to solve the equations and then plot y vs. y' when x goes to zero (it is obvious that it's an interval :) ). Thanks               tmax = 300;     {{sol1}, {ps}} = Reap[     NDSolve[      {x'[t] == -(x[t] + 2 x[t] y[t]),       y'[t] == -x[t] x[t] + y[t] (y[t] - 1),       x[0] == 0.1, y[0] == 0.1,       WhenEvent[Limit[x[t], x[t] -> 0], Sow[t]]},      {x, y},          {t, 0, tmax}]]
