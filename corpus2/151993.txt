I am a Asp.Net/C# developer, I develop few projects in my spare time. I try to utilize my time as much as I can. I have been working for past 7 months. Suddenly these days I am a bit worried about learning the new stuff that is there for me as a programmer. I develop in my spare time so I don't get enough time to read books or blogs. So my question to some of you guys is how should I plan to learn new things, should I at least dedicate two-three evenings for new stuff, maybe ebooks while travelling is a good option too. How do you people plan to learn,should I also start to develop with whatever I learnt? As far as learning is concerned, should I just pick up the basics and then implement it or I should seek deeper understanding of the subject?
