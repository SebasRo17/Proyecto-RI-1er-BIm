I have a 4-parameter family of functions, which I'll refer to as `y[a, b, c, d][x]`. In this notation, `a, b, c, d` are the 4 parameters, and `y[a, b, c, d]` is a function $\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$. I would like to implement a `Manipulate`-based widget, with one slider for each of the 4 parameters, that will show a 2-D plot of `y[a, b, c, d][x]` vs `x` for any given setting of the parameters. The hitch is that the functions `y[a, b, c, d]` are very time-consuming to compute. Each plot would take about 1 minute to generate, which rules out any interactive exploration. Luckily, the functions `y[a, b, c, d]` appear to be rather smooth, so I'm wondering if there is some way to approximate the ensemble with some easier- to-compute "spline-like" functions `yApprox[a, b, c, d]`. My naive thinking about this begins with a pre-computed mesh of points of the form               {a, b, c, d, x, y[a, b, c, d][x]}      ...but I'm not sure how to use such a mesh to generate an ensemble of continuous functions `yApprox[a, b, c, d]` varying continuously over the parameters `a, b, c, d`.
