I have been using Visual Studio for quite some time now, in fact from the VS 2005 version. Right now, I am not only comfortable but addict to using it(VS 2010) for all my development needs. Recently I have been learning Python and Django. In that getting the tutorial tasks up and running with IDLE seems very lame and outdated(I am following the Django Book). Therefore, I downloaded and configured Eclipse & PyDev. Eclipse seems good and fine but needs a bit of learning curve for itself. So, I am looking for a way to configure Visual Studio 2010 for Python and Django development if possible. Please tell me if that's possible and How ?
