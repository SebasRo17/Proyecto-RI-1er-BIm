I think it is just my thinking that is off here. Suppose I have two entities: question and choice. A question can be a parent or child, or both (in relation to other questions). It seems that this model is too simple and is an unresolved many-to-many, but I think my thinking is the problem here so this is more of a conceptual question. What is the best way to design/model this? Please explain why it is or isn't a many-to-many relationship, and whether or not it needs to be resolved and why. See below: ![idea](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7kUG9.png) A question can be a parent or a child, or both (potentially multiple times). Programming logic would prevent the child from being its own parent and vice versa. It seems I'm missing a linking solution of some sort here, or I'm just not wrapping my brain around this.
