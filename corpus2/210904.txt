I am trying my hand in python, Django, JQuery.. etc to make a clone of imdb site. Currently I'm in web-development from past 10 months on same technologies. In my spare time I want to develop a side-project which may look good on resume. I came up with an _idea_ , to make a clone of imdb.com. But after 2 weeks of development I stopped. reasons: _its not different_   1. Why create another imdb?   2. I'm not improving it?   3. Face it, it will be sub standard of original one. The need for the project is to showcase my skills in above technologies but at same time I want it to be useful.
