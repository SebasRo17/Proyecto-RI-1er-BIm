I want to make private functions.for that purpose,I wrote the following code.               BeginPackage["Test1`"]     Begin["`Private`"]     function1[x_]:=x     End[]     EndPackage[]      I saved the above package and closed my entire `Mathematica` and again reopen `Mathematica` and evaluated that `Package`. in `Notebook` I am calling the above function.just like in the following way.                Test1`function1[5]      Test1`Private`function1[5]      it returns output like.                function1[5]      5      that means,functions are working fine but the problem was If you evaluate `Package` second time and evaluate `Notebook` code it returns like in the following way.               5     5      why it's working like that.clearly I mention full contexts How can I resolve Fell Free,If you want edit my question. Thank you
