I am new to Django. I have found the official topic guides https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/ an excellent place to learn from. But now I am in a place where I need quick reference to see what methods an object has, what arguments it takes, what it returns etc, kind of like the Python docs or Java docs. More of a reference than a tutorial. The official docs are tutorial style and do not necessarily have reference to all the methods. Am I missing something here? Do the Django official docs suffice for everyone?
