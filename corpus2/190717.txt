I hope this question gives some interesting answers because it's one that's bugged me for a while. **Is there any real value in unit testing a controller in ASP.NET MVC?** What I mean by that is, most of the time, (and I'm no genius), my controller methods are, even at their most complex something like this:               public ActionResult Create(MyModel model)     {         // start error list         var errors = new List<string>();              // check model state based on data annotations         if(ModelState.IsValid)         {             // call a service method             if(this._myService.CreateNew(model, Request.UserHostAddress, ref errors))             {                 // all is well, data is saved,                  // so tell the user they are brilliant                 return View("_Success");             }         }              // add errors to model state         errors.ForEach(e => ModelState.AddModelError("", e));              // return view         return View(model);     }      Most of the heavy-lifting is done by either the MVC pipeline or my service library. So maybe questions to ask might be:   * what would be the value of unit testing this method?   * would it not break on `Request.UserHostAddress` and `ModelState` with a NullReferenceException? Should I try to mock these?   * if I refractor this method into a re-useable "helper" (which I probably should, considering how many times I do it!), would testing that even be worthwhile when all I'm really testing is mostly the "pipeline" which, presumably, has been tested to within an inch of it's life by Microsoft? I think my point **really** is, doing the following seems utterly pointless and wrong               [TestMethod]     public void Test_Home_Index()     {         var controller = new HomeController();         var expected = "Index";         var actual = ((ViewResult)controller.Index()).ViewName;         Assert.AreEqual(expected, actual);     }      Obviously I'm being obtuse with this exaggeratedly pointless example, but does anybody have any wisdom to add here? Looking forward to it... Thanks.
