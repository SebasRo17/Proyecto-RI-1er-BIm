I'm currently trying to get my head round MVVM for WPF - I don't mean get my head round the concept, but around the actual nuts and bolts of doing anything that is further off the beaten track than dumb CRUD. What I've noticed is that lots of the frameworks, and most/all blog posts are from 'ages' ago. Is this because it is now old hat and the bloggers have moved onto the Next Big Thing, or just because they've said everything there is to say? In other words, is there something I'm missing here?
