Say your company has some closely-guarded internal software that happens to have an MIT License. Maybe it was based on MIT Licensed software but has been heavily modified over the years. Your company does not want to share it with the outside world. However, one day an employee decides to post the software up on GitHub against the wishes of the company. Is this legal? Does it violate the license?
