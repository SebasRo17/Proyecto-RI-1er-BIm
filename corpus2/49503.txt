I've always wondered why some companies want you to register when you install their programs. Personally, I just find it annoying and decline, but what do companies have to gain by having their users get registred? They claim that you get "the latest updates" and stuff, but often you get that anyway without having to register. So what's the deal with this registering? I just don't see that point.
