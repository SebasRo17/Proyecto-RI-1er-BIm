I work in a team of 2 developers, my partner is the founder of the company, in the beginning he did everything on his own. He hired me about 3 years ago to help him get things done quicker and satisfy our customer needs. Often I get small project to do all by my own, as long as it works great (and it usually does...) he doesn't care much on what I did or how I did it. But if the customer calls him up asking why something doesn't work as expected and I'm not around to forward the call to me, he could get very angry on why he doesn't have an idea on how that program works. I don't keep anything as a secret, if he asks me on something how I did it I'm happy to explain as long as he's willing to listen (which isn't long), but I don't know why I need to say it in first place, in developing software everything is written down clearly. Most of the time I work on projects he wrote and I don't need to ask him anything (it happens maybe once a month that I ask him how something works, just because I don't have the time to look it up). I've read a lot on that great site about small teams that usually means 7-12 people. I couldn't find how 2 people work as a team; we don't have project managers, reviewers or testers. I feel that the fact he don't have time to review the code on his own is not my problem, so the question here is am I doing something wrong? Do I need to walk over to him and give him a lecture on what I did even he doesn't ask me?
