From a simulation (solid state physcis) i obtained a `list1={{300,0,0},...}` with x values=300,400,...,1500 and y-values=0,0.08,...,20 and z values. I plotted them using `ListPlot3D`. I want to investigate the change in z value for fixed y, i.e. does z value change a lot for a given y in the range of all x values. Therefore I want to make a coloring like this:   1. If z' value of {x',y',z'} is equal to z value at {x=300,y',z} then it should be Gray   2. If z' value of {x',y',z'} is lower than z value at {x=300,y',z}: going from Yellow to Red   3. If z' value of {x',y',z'} is higher than z value at {x=300,y',z}: going from Green to Blue How can I do that? I tried the following:   * Manipulation of list1 to get list2={0,0.3,...}, which has same amount of elements as points (x,y,z) in list1 and same ordering,    * The values in list2 are 0.5 when point at same position in list1 satiesfies 1)   * The values in list2 are < 0.5 when point at same position in list1 satiesfies 2)   * The values in list2 are > 0.5 when point at same position in list1 satiesfies 3) I tried to use a colorfunction:               colorf =  Blend[{{0, Blue}, {0.49, Green}, {0.5, Gray},{0.51, Yellow}, {1,Red}}, #] &;     ListPlot3D[list1,ColorFunction->colorf/@ list2]      I do get a coloring but not the correct one. I checked by exchanging all z values in list1 with values in list2 and made a density plot and colors are at different postions. Is there any solution to make the color like I want to have it?
