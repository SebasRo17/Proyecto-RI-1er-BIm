If I have an equation like               f[x](1 + a)==0      I'd like to be able to tell Mathematica that 1+a doesn't vanish in general, and get back               f[x]==0      I've come up with               Reduce[f[x](1 + a)==0 && (1 + a) != 0, f[t]][[1]]      But it's not clear to me this is the best solution. EDIT: The reason this isn't ideal to me is that it seems sometimes the part that I want isn't always the first part of the output, so it doesn't generalize well. Sometimes I need to take [[1]], other times [[3]], etc.
