Chrome 11 is now asking user permission to run both signed and unsigned Applets (yes, for signed applets the user is asked twice). Chromium team decided that this measure is needed even when the user is using an up-to-date JRE. Here's my bug report (which reflects solely my opinion: http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=84001). My question is, how do you guys see it? Is Java Sandbox dated and unsafe? Do browsers need to impose a second layer of protection by default? **Update:** I'm also curious about how many of you guys have a clean record experience with Java against how many every hit a piece of malicious software? As a Java Power User for more than 10 years, the only time my antivirus ever complained about something related to Java was a false positive (I was downloading some libraries from Maven Central repository).
