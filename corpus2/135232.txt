I am currently employed with a company for 2.5 years and I have been working with the .net stack for the entire duration mainly on the MVC framework. I _believe_ I have some cool ideas for a startup but I am not sure if I should continue in this stack or switch to some other stack like Ruby on Rails. The reason why I am consider this switch is due to the Infrastructure required to host a dot net application and scaling it successfully as compared to setting up a live running site on some other stack. I have a really good domain expertise in dot net at this moment but I believe it should be not so hard to move onto a new stack and adopt the best practices that I have picked up in the past two years. Let me know if I am missing something in the puzzle and if I am taking the right decision? Are there any complications of learning a new stack and building on it? Please guide me in the right direction.
