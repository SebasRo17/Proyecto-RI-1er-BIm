I am trying to solve the following differential equation $$ s''(x) = \frac{8}{9}s(x) -2s^2(x) + s^3(x), $$ with boundary conditions $s(-30) = 4/3 $ and $s(30)=0$, in Mathematica by using the following code:               sol = NDSolve[{s''[x] == 8/9 s[x] - 2 s[x]^2 + s[x]^3, s[-30] == 4/3,      s[30] == 0}, s, {x, -30, 30}]     Plot[s[x] /. sol, {x, -30, 30}].      However, Mathematica gives me an infinite sequence of errors. Is it just my ignorance concerning the numerical solvability of this kind of nasty differential equations, or is there a way to let Mathematica solve this equation neatly?
