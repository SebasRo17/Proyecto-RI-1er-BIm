What makes the web application perform and scale better is always a big topic. And finding the performance problems and tuning them is another... Here is some my thoughts of how to "finding" performance problems: For a "new" api/application or other   * Analzying the detail api and then preparing the Jmeter/Grinder testing scripts for it.   * Using different load to identify the threshold for the api   * Adding profiling codes find the slownes   * Restart from point one again.. For a "old" api/application or other   * Analyzing the user pattern from the access detail log    * Simulate the real user load to find the slowness   * Adding profiling codes find the slownes   * Restart from point one again..  So,how can you identify the performance problems?
