Microsoft seems to use such generic names for their core products that it seems like it must be or have been part of a deliberate strategy. It is so common that I think it may have originated as a way to overawe some business customer or junior college striver -- who vaguely knows that SQL servers exist -- that SQL servers are Microsoft-specific products. Same with mail exchange server. Namely: SQL Server (most general term possible, despite which they claim a trademark) Exchange Server (see rfc's from the 1980's onward describing mail exchanges and calling them precisely that) Windows (the generic term used with windowing applications since their invention) Office (if you are inclined to protest that it's really Microsoft Office, go to the product splash page and look for the word 'microsoft') Has anyone ever come across a discussion of this from someone involved in the early naming decisions or marketing, or have any knowledge if this is in fact a pattern intended to associate in the public's mind core general technologies with Microsoft products (while stretching the outermost limits of trademarkability)?
