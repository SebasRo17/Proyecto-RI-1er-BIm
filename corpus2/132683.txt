I have a web application with lots of Javascipt and CSS code. I want to minify the CSS and JS code using something like UglifyJS. However, I don't want to program with the minified code and I want my team to checkout only the non-minified code. What's the most common way of doing this? I guess you would push both the minified and non-minified code and have the code reference only minified files. Do most people create a file call BUILD that runs all JS/CSS files through the minifier? Programmers would then have to run the BUILD script before pushing right?
