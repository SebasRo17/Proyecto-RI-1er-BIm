this is my first question on this particular stackexchange node, not sure if it's the most appropriate place for this question (if not, guidance to the appropriate node would be appreciated). **the abstract:** I'm interested in modifying existing video codecs and distributing my modded codecs in such a way as to make them easily added to a users codec library... for example to be added to their mpeg streamclip, ffmpeg etc. **some details:** I've had some experience modifying codecs by hacking ffmpeg source files and compiling my hacked code (so that for ex: my version of ffmpeg has a very different h.263 than yours). I'm interested now in taking these modified codecs and somehow making them easily distributable, so others could "add them" to their "libraries." Also, I realize there are some tricky rights/patent issues here, this is in part my motivation. I'm interested in the patent quagmires, and welcome any thoughts on this as well. **ctx link:** if it helps (to gauge where I'm coming from) here's a link to a previous codec-hacking project of mine http://nickbriz.com/glitchcodectutorial/
