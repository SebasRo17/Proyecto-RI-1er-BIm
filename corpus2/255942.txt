I know cool greedy algorithm like brokuva, kruskal and prim's exists for finding minimum spanning tree but I am curious to know a dynamic programming algorithm for finding minimum spanning tree.I am not able to come up with such an algorithm. If someone already have it please let me know the explanation for your algorithm along with the code.Or can anyone argue the other way round why no such dynamic programming algorithm cannot exist.
