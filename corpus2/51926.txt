Following on from a previous thread that had a link to TekPub, I have just had a quick look and I think it looks pretty impressive. Are any of you guys subscribers and if so would you recommend it? I am mainly interested in general software design and, as a language, C# and it's features. Is there much content posted on a regular basis along these lines to warrant the outlay? Thanks.
