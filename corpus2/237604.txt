We have a large dataset that's current residing in many, many spreadsheets.   I've been tasked with getting part of that data into our MySQL DB.   When all is said and done, I will probably be inserting somewhere around 3 million rows. I intend to collect the inserts into batches of about a quarter-million or so (parsing through it with PHP).   Initially, my plan was to just run/send those batch INSERTs straight from my script.   More recently, though, I thought about actually writing out the INSERTs to _.sql_ files for later importing. I tried to google around on this a little ... didn't find much.   Are there any real pro's/con's one way or the other?   If not, I'm inclined to stick with my original plan.   Otherwise, I'm completely open to suggestions.
