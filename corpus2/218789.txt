I'll express my doubt with an example. Suppose I have the following requirement: > _The customer needs a page in his website that displays all the products he > has with a quantity field on the side of each product. The visitor of the > website must be able to fill in the quantities desired, select one location > and ask for the budgeting. After asking for the budgeting, the visitor must > be taken to a page with the summary of the products asked, together with the > prices and fields to fill in contact informations to proceed the negotiation > if desired_ To organize this I've decided on building two use cases: "Require budgeting" and "Ask for products". The first one is: > Title: Require budgeting > > Actor: Website visitor > > Scenario: > >   * The visitor selects to see the products > >   * While the visitor want to add products to the budgeting > >     * The visitor fills the desired quantity of a product in the > corresponding field >   * The visitor selects his location to estimate shipping price > >   * The visitor sends the requirement > > After that, the visitor will be redirected to the page with the information about what he asks and the fields to require the products. This is another use case, but there is a close connection with the first one, because it is in the sequnce. I didn't know exactly how to deal with this. So I thought of using precondition: > Title: Ask for products > > Actor: Website visitor > > Precondition: the visitor has asked for a budgeting > > Scenario: > >   * The visitor reviews the products and prices > >   * If he wants to ask for the products > >     * The visitor fills his contact information and sends to the sales > department >   * If not, he exits the page > > But I'm unsure this is the right way to do so, I think that "extension" was the right way to express that, but I think I didn't get this yet. How should we proceed when use cases are closely related like that?
