It is well known that tech companies frequently try to recruit employees from competitors. However, is it common for open-source projects to seek potential volunteers from companies in similar industries? For example, suppose there is an open-source video editing project that really wants to take off. If they were to actively look for volunteers, it would seem that connecting with people from companies like Adobe or Sony would be a good choice. I've been at my current job for almost two years, and I frequently get e-mails from recruiters for similar companies. However, neither I nor anyone else I know have received invitations to participate in an open-source project. This tells me such a practice is uncommon. I know there are legal and ethical issues when it comes to "poaching" employees, but the difference is that the engineer would merely be writing open-source code in their personal time as opposed to leaving their job. So my questions are:   1. Is it common for open-source project coordinators to recruit developers from companies that make similar software?   2. If so, are there any ethical issues in doing so?
