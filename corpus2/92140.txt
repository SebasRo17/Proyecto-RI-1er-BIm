I manage a small in-house development team for a large organization. We develop for both internal and external clients. I find it impossible to educate the non-technical senior management about the importance of team work, testing, etc etc. However, the most difficult thing is trying to make non-technical people understand what is realistic to expect from us in terms of running concurrent projects and timescales etc. It is definitely still a case of people think we just press a few buttons and applications build themselves. Does anyone know of a simple business case template for non-technical managers to justify the investment in my team's time?
