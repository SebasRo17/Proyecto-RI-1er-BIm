I'm currently a web developer building web apps in PHP and Javascript. I really enjoy the programming aspect more so than the front end design side of things. I would to like to start to focus my attention on this with the aim to becoming a software engineer in next couple of years. So my first thought was to go and learn C++ but is this the best thing to start? In the future I would like to work on developing things such as operating systems and native applications. When I look at at engineering jobs at say, Google, Facebook, Apple, they all appear to ask for **C/C++ AND OR JAVA**. Currently, I know none of these, but I am familiar with generic programming concepts such as loops, functions, oop etc. Also, out of C/C++ and JAVA which is the more probably chance of it getting me ahead in my career? My problem would be that while learning say 'C++' what would I use it for? I currently have no use for it but really would like a career as a serious engineer rather than just web based stuff. I have a mac and PC running linux and would like to start with some example projects and tutorials to just get a good understanding of the language
