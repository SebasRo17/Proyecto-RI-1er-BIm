I am looking for beginner books into PHP 5 (Maybe with a bit into MySQL?) and HTML 5. I started self-teaching myself PHP although it has become a problem as the tutorials online are either outdated or just crap. I also managed to start learning with very little HTML knowledge so I am looking to brush up on my HTML knowledge and get more into PHP. I also am unsure weather I should be looking into XHTML or HTML5, or both so an answer to that would be splendid. I just want to become more self-sufficient and less reliant on other for my programming needs. I've searched Google for books but I'm just not sure which one is the "best" for me and makes for good practice and habits which brings me here.
