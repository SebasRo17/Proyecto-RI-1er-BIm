I have used Factory pattern where I have multiple classes which does similar sort of work, but I don't want client to worry about class instantiating and return types. So Instantiate the necessary class dynamically depending on input and pass the values. These classes have similar methods but does slightly different work and these classes inherit the same common interface. Is this the correct way or can I improve it further?
