I want to briefly discuss managed or interpreted languages. It's said that they're worth developing in, because the CPU time is worth less than the programmer time required to develop in a faster language. I'm curious if the same thing could be said for the compiler. If I had some mythical compiler that took four times as long to compile as, say, C#, but took half the time to program with, would that be an advantage or a disadvantage? Is programmer time worth more than compiler time?
