I am writing up a description/guide/wiki of an "open source software framework for the easy integration and utilization of datasets, algorithms, tools, and computing resources". I feel like software integration framework sounds concise and to the point, but I want to emphasize that it can also independently integrate and process standalone data (i.e. data meaning something like columns of numbers in a text file, even if that particular example isn't technically correct). Also might as well take the chance to learn some new software development nomenclature. So I ask - is there some term that encompasses both data and software in software architecture?
