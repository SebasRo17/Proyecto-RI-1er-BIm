It seems to me that rapid-development web platforms are going to radically change the world of web applications. It has been five years since Rails 1.0 was released for Ruby, and since that time we have seen Grails for Groovy, Django for Python, and Roo for Java. But to my knowledge (which is probably limited, being a Java/Groovy progammer) there is no similar framework for C#. Does such a thing exist? If not, why not? **Edit:** It's quite possible I'm not using the right words when I say "rapid- development," but I'm talking about frameworks that can conceivably allow you to build a working blog engine in 30 minutes. You couldn't reasonably do this with, say, Java, Spring, and Hibernate, given the various configuration needed to allow your controllers to be found, and both configuration and code necessary for your entities to persist and be retrieved. So I'm talking about frameworks that handle all of the CRUD with a convention- over-configuration mentality. If someone has the right words for what I'm talking about, let me know.
