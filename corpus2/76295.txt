I have little experience in website programming. However, I have an idea for a website that I would like to make real. It would have many of the same features that a site such as TripAdvisor uses, but obviously on a smaller scale, and its main feature being a user rating system. Whilst it would be ideal for me to learn how to do it myself, I feel it would be unrealistic given the complexity and time consuming nature of it. Therefore, my question is what will I need to know and understand before I approach a web developing team?, i.e., what are the questions that they will ask me when I sit down to talk with them about my idea? On a slightly separate note, what are the legal restrictions on creating a website that has already been done? There are a small number (2 or 3) of websites that I would be essentially doing the same as, but in my opinion, I would be providing the users with far more useful features in a more user friendly manner.
