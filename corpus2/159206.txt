I have had a hard time learning logic programming thus far, and my request for outside resources on this site was met with some opprobrium, so perhaps this question better addresses both my needs and the requirements of this community: Is there a step-by-step approach to writing a problem in Prolog or related logic languages? For example, I initially found recursive functions difficult to create myself, though I could more or less understand those that I read, until the I learned the following approach (presented roughly and for example purposes only!):   1. Describe the base case, i.e. the smallest form of the problem.   2. Figure out how to combine the results of recursive cases, i.e. add numbers, cons elements, etc. Seeing that there were a few common patterns here helped immensely!   3. Figure out how to break the results of a larger recursive case up, i.e. cdr down list, subtract, etc. Again, seeing the limited number of common patters was key! So, a clear description of a related process for tackling a logic problem might be very useful.
