At work, we've been doing lunchtime book clubs for a while. So far we've done:   * Clean Code   * Working Effectively with Legacy Code   * The Pragmatic Programmer We read a chapter per week, and one person is assigned to present over the content and help facilitate discussion. Of the three, we've probably had the most success with The Pragmatic Programmer. It seems like the more technically complicated the content was, the more people tended to drop out as the book went along. I'd like to do a technically-heavy book like SICP or Java Concurrency in Practice, but I don't know of good ways to make this work with the format we're currently doing. What advice do you have?
