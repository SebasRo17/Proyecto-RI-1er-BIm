I am trying to scrape websites for valuable text for example the title of an article, the author's name, and other distinguished text. I cannot always guarantee that this sort of text will have informative tags, and but this needs to be done as quickly as possible. As a possible short cut I think that I could just try to pull the text with unique styling. The title is normally bigger than the body text, and the by-line is normally smaller. Is there a way to quickly pull all of the font stylings of a page and then rank them by size and how often it is used?
