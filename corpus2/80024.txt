I've read some posts here and other places about how a lot of people don't put much value in certifications but I am beginning to think it may be necessary for me at this point to be able to move to a bigger company, etc. I currently work as a Java programmer with a startup and worked with a small company before that. Now that I'm applying with larger companies the hr people / recruiters have been asking a lot about certifications and some have directly suggested that someone in my position should probably get a few (they were trying to be helpful) since I haven't completed a BS degree yet (I bounced around a bit in college and ended up not finishing but have enough units to finish eventually, just its not something I can do nearly as easily as getting certifications). Anyways, just curious about what people think for someone in my situation where I do have an interested in working for large companies and do not currently have a BS degree (but do have experience already in the field). Any advice on which certifications beyond the SCJP would be appreciated as well
