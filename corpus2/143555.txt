I keep reading this sentence: > Linux is a Unix-like system, but it is not Unix. I don't know what's the real difference between the two. I know Linux got a lot of ideas from Unix and the licenses of the two are different. Apart from that, as I am not an expert in either one of them, I want to know whether there are basic differences between them in design or other significant aspects.
