I want to work with lists within the CDF player. A very simple example, which works inside a notebook is               DynamicModule[{x = {1, 2, 7}},       Panel[Column@{InputField[Dynamic@x, Expression], Dynamic@func@x}],       Initialization :> (func[x_] := 2*ToExpression[x])]      Exported as a stand alone CDF application this does not work. Changing input `x` results in nothing! If `x` is a Number then it works also in the CDF player.
