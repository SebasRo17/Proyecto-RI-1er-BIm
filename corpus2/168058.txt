What are graphs, in computer science, and what are they used for? In laymen's terms preferably. I have read the definition on Wikipedia: > In computer science, a graph is an abstract data type that is meant to > implement the graph and hypergraph concepts from mathematics. > > A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of > ordered pairs, called edges or arcs, of certain entities called nodes or > vertices. As in mathematics, an edge (x,y) is said to point or go from x to > y. The nodes may be part of the graph structure, or may be external entities > represented by integer indices or references. but I'm looking for a less formal, easier to understand definition.
