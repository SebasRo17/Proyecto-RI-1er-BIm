As a test I want a simple script to take a command line argument and print it to a file: `Export["c://cygwin/home/jorgen/yu.dat",$ScriptCommandLine[[2]],"Data"] // MatrixForm;` However when I run this with `./MathKernel -script Swargtest.m 45` the resulting file yu.dat looks like this: `{}[[2]]` I've tried what I could think of: making another variable with `out=$ScriptCommandLine[[2]]` and exporting that, removing the `$`, running the script with `'45'` and `"45"` on the command line, etc. I'm using cygwin on a windows 7 machine.
