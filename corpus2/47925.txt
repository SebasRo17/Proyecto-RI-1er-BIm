This seems like the sort of thing where _Mathematica_ can give a very simple solution. I have a list of points `{x,y}`:               {{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, 5}}      From this list, I want to generate a new list of pairs `{x,ymean}`, where `ymean` is the average of all `y`'s in the original list which were paired to the same value of `x`:               {{1, 3}, {2, 7/2}, {3, 5}}      What's the simplest, most elegant way to accomplish this in Mathematica?
