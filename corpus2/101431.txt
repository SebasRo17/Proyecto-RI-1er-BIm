Hello and I'm apologizing in advance if this question doesn't fit programmers section of stackexchange. I'll try to clarify what the problem is by telling a story where the problem originates from. I'm working in a small company (8 people) where we have developers, sys admins and staff that handles day to day calls. The problem is the logins. There are various logins, for example web server root login. Then there's MySQL login, login for apps that we develop and to make the thing even more complex - logins differ from local development and testing versions to the ones that are actually deployed which makes the whole thing even more messier. What's happening is that no one knows all of the logins, and they're either written down somewhere deep on cryptically named files or certain people know them by heart. If someone who knows the login for the thing we need to work with is away (say holiday), the process of retrieving the login becomes a huge mess. Now, we are aware how terrible that is and we're looking into improving our login / project management. The other problem is that not everyone should know all the logins. My question is: how do you (or how would you) handle storing logins such as web server root information, web app admin login etc. in such a way that it's available to everyone within the company, but with restricted access (say, a secretary cannot obtain root details, no offence to secretaries)? P.S. I just spent 3 hours obtaining the login details to change a simple spelling mistake on a project which took exactly 1 second after I had the info. Seeing I can't afford losing any more nerves or time over such seemingly trivial things, I'm begging experienced and smart guys for help. Thanks in advance :)
