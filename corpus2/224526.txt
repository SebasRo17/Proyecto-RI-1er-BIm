Is possible to create and download a video file only on the client side? Suppose that we have an animated canvas like in this **JSFIDDLE**. Please see this snippet:               ...     var stop = false;     setTimeout(function () {         stop = true;     }, 1860);     ...     if (!stop) { requestAnimationFrame( draw, 10 ); }      So, my animation duration is `1860ms`. We can generate text files for download, I know that we can generate images from canvas, but is possible to render and download a video file? Would adding sound possible?
