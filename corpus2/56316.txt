I have this function:               f[k_, θ_, ϕ_] := Cos[k*Cos[θ]*x + k*Sin[θ]*y - ϕ]      I want to change the parameters $\theta, \phi,$ and $k$ to see the effects on the function. I use the command below to achieve that:               Manipulate[       ContourPlot[f[k, θ, ϕ], {x, 0, 50}, {y, 0, 50}, PlotLegends -> Automatic],     {k, 0, 10}, {θ, 0, 2*Pi}, {ϕ,0, 2*Pi}]      The problem is that when I change one of the parameters, say $\theta$, continuously the plot is evaluated slowly so that during the running you cannot see the actual graph. How can I change those parameters and see the real evaluated result immediately?
