Every so often (seems about once a year) I get a chance to play with JS.   While not proficient, I'm comfortable enough to get the job done if I have some good references. At this point, I feel like I'm just _not_ coming up with the right search terms to find anything useful. **GOAL:**   I'm looking for examples, tips, advice and/or links to any documentation/articles/instructions that my help. **BACK STORY:**   We have a vendor on whose site we search part numbers.   The results page has basic spec's and stat's, and there is a download link for a pricing sheet.   We have developed a tool to parse through the sheet and automatically enter the pricing into our system. The current workflow is to download the file and save it locally, and then upload the file to our form. **TASK:**   What I intend to do is make a bookmarklet to cut out a few steps.   I'd like to have the JS initiate the DL (?straight into a temp location?), and then POST the file right off to the current form-processing `action` url.   Done. **SUMMARY:**   Of course, snippets and examples are always _**awesome**_!!   Beyond that, any-and-every bit of sharing will be appreciated
