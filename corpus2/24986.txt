I am having trouble solving a set of equations in mathematica. I do not get any errors, but i don't get any answers as well. I have some restrictions on my parameters and variables in the equations which i try to implement too. I have tried to implement them using $Assumptions and Assuming[], but it seems like Mathematica ignore it. However, all my parameters and variables are real and non-negative. g is a known positive constant which i define earlier in my notebook. Here is what i type in Mathematica 8 (this is copy-pasted from my program):               g:=6.45161;     Solve[{u == 1/3 μb - 2/3*e, d == 1/3 μb + 1/3*e,      2*(u^2 - (g x/2)^2)^(3/2) - (d^2 - (g x/2)^2)^(3/          2) - (d^2 - (g y/Sqrt[2])^2)^(3/2) - (e^2)^(3/2) == 0,      x >= 0, y >= 0,μb > e, μb >= 0, u >= 0, d >= 0, e >= 0}, {u, d, e},      Reals]      μb is a parameter and x and y are variables in some other functions. So what i want is for u,d and e to be functions of x and y, and dependent of μb. Is there an easy way to solve this in Mathematica 8? This is my first post here, so please let me know I make things unclear or something. I have tried to find the solution elsewhere, but have not succeeded.
