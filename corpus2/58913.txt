Consider this simple example:               mytrans[expr_] :=       expr /. Ω1^2 + Δ^2 :> Ω^2          f =        FullSimplify[Sqrt[-Δ^2 - Ω1^2],         TransformationFunctions -> {Automatic, mytrans}, Assumptions -> #] &;          f /@ {{Δ > 0, Ω1 > 0, Ω > 0},           {Δ > 0, Ω1 < 0, Ω > 0},           {Δ < 0, Ω1 > 0, Ω > 0},           {Δ < 0, Ω1 < 0, Ω > 0},          {Δ ∈ Reals, Ω1 ∈ Reals, Ω > 0}}               (* {I Ω, I Ω, I Ω, I Ω, Sqrt[-Δ^2 - Ω1^2]} *)      Isn't the last assumption equivalent to the first four? Why doesn't it work? Or why does it work in the first four cases?
