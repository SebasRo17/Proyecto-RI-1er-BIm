i am working on a project that has two interface (web and desktop), they are not performing the same tasks but they use the same BLL and DAL, the web part using 100% of the BLL and DAL, while the desktop only needs to know about 20% of the BLL and DAL. do you think it is a good idea to let the desktop use the same BLL and DAL as the web, which consequently will lead to ditributing thos BLL and DAL with the desktop application? or you think i'd better create new BLL and DAL projects just to serve the desktop app? but in this case i will fall in the trap of maintaining two copies of the same code!
