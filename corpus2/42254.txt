I'm trying to decide between:   * using the clumsy facebook invite dialogs which are very cumbersome to use (not very configurable) but trigger notifications.   * Using the API to let users invite 2 or 3 friends according to some criteria (say same location). By invite, I mean write on the user friend's wall. My understanding is that this won't trigger a facebook notification, and the target friend may not even see it at all, it all hangs on facebook (unknowable) rules about what shows or not on a user's feed.  Ideally I would like to send emails but facebook api understandably doesn't provide email addresses. Incidentally, quora offers invites for facebook friends which result in emails being sent. Looks like quora does have perhaps privileged access to facebook apis (my guess)
