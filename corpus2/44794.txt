I'm implementing a package for in-house signal processing. I wrote here a quite trivial function implementing a Hanning windowing of the signal.               HanningFilter[signal_List] := Module[{length},        length = Length[signal];        Table[signal[[k]] 2 Sin[Ï€ k/length]^2, {k, 1, length}]     ];      I know there is a `HannWindow[x]` built-in function that can be use. However the question I have can be applied to other filters as well: > What is the most performant implementation of such a function? Probably the use of a `Table[]` is not optimal.
