In an earlier question, I asked for career advice for new software engineers who did well before and during college. But what about people who weren't fortunate enough to go to MIT or Yale, for whatever reason? What if you went to what Joel Spolsky calls a JavaSchool? What can/should JavaSchool alumni do to develop their skills and make up for the things they missed in college? (Or, was Joel wrong about those schools being disadvantageous?)
