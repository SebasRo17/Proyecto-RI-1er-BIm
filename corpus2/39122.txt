I've been evaluating a number of code review tools (mostly free ones), but they all seem to be aimed at reviewing patches before they are committed. This wouldn't really fit within our workflow with Subversion, so I've been looking for alternatives that better support reviewing committed revisions instead of just diffs. Any recommendations? I would prefer free or inexpensive tools.
