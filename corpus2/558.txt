I am a moderately capable web developer. I can put stuff where I want it to go and put some JQuery stuff in there if I need to. However, if I am making my own website (which I am starting to do) I have no idea how to design it. If someone was to sit next to me a point to the screen and say "put this picture there, text there" I can do that quite easily. But designing my own site with my choice of colours and text will look like a toddler has invented it. Does anyone know any websites/books I can look at or has anyone got any tips on the basics of non-toddler web design?
