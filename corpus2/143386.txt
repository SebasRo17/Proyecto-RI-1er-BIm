I have lots of code like this in my constructors:-               function __construct($params) {              $this->property = isset($params['property']) ? $params['property'] : default_val;          }      Is it better to do this rather than specify the default value in the property definition? i.e. `public $property = default_val`? Sometimes there is logic for the default value, and some default values are taken from other properties, which was why I was doing this in the constructor. Should I be using setters so all the logic for default values is separated?
