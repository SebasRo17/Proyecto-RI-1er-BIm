Consider the following:               list1={a,b,c,d};     list2={c,d,e,f};     list3={g,d,c,h};      Now I would like to get the symmetric difference. Hence, the result must be `{a,b,e,f,g,h}` (whether the result is sorted or not is irrelevant) BTW: Using `Complement[list1,list2,list3]` returns `{a,b}`, since `Complement` only "gives the elements in `e_all` which are not in any of the `e_i`."
