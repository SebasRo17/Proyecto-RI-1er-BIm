So I've been wanting to try Node and Express. Not to mention Jade and Stylus. Webstorm has in my opinion an amazing user experience and I want to use it and these technologies. Here is where I get hung up though. ASP has some nice built in features that don't seem to exist in this other world. I will pick on authentication. Authentication can be a pretty complex in depth thing. Frankly it is nice to have something built in, tested, and robust for something so critical to some applications. Or if Authentication is too petty. How about compiled code? Why would I WANT to use JavaScript on the server side if I know c#. Isn't type safety a nice to have? What am I missing? these technologies are popular for a reason but I just don't see the draw? I would like to though.
