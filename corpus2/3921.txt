More than one hole, I mean… I’m trying to export from Mathematica into the X3D format, with the longer term goal of generating 3D figures for PDF inclusion. But I'm stuck at the first step:               p = ParametricPlot3D[{(2 + Cos[v]) Sin[u], (2 + Cos[v]) Cos[u],          Sin[v]}, {u, 0, 2 Pi}, {v, 0, 2 Pi}, PlotStyle -> Red];     Export["test.x3d", p];      The donut thus generated has holes in it (as visualized here with FreeWRL): ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ccppQ.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/y5RE6.png) and the same is true for every 3D surface I've tried to export. MeshLab complains that the file contains “4 degenerated faces”, but I doubt it's the same issue, as there are a lot more than 4 holes! I am not a 3D format expert, so I don't really know where to go. Exporting to VRML gives the same issue, so I suspect something generic is going on, but I don't really know how to investigate. I tried importing back the files into Mathematica, but 3D graphics formats are apparently write-only. So, how do you advise me to tackle the issue? Do you have any experience in this kind of export?
