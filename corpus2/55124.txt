I have the data for graph nodes as:               graphComponents = {{"blood", "pressur"}, {"harvard", "oxford"}, {"help",  "lower"},     {"oxford", "benefit"}, {"harvard", "benefit"}, {"lower",  "level"}, {"faceoff", "benefit"}     , {"oxford", "faceoff"}, {"harvard", "faceoff"}, {"over", "benefit"}, {"faceoff", "over"},     {"oxford", "over"}, {"harvard", "over"}, {"benefit", "drug"},      {"oxford",  "drug"}, {"harvard", "drug"}, {"faceoff", "drug"}, {"fast",  "test"},     {"over", "drug"}, {"test", "test2"}};      Then I want to make a `Manipulate` to show the communities of the graph:               Manipulate[       components = graphComponents[[1 ;; L]];       rawGraph = Graph[#[[1]] <-> #[[2]] & /@ graphComponents[[1 ;; L]]];       communities = FindGraphCommunities[rawGraph];       H = HighlightGraph[rawGraph, Subgraph[rawGraph, communities[[i]]]],       {{L, 15, "Number of Tuples: "}, 5, 20, 5},        {{i, 2, "Cluster number: "}, 1, 3, 1},        LocalizeVariables -> False]      The question is as the value of `L` changes the number of communities change as well. So the control list for variable `i` should be updated when `L` changes. How should this be done?
