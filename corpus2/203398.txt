I'm a Python beginner. I started programming with Python 1.5 months back. I downloaded the Python docs and read some parts of the tutorial. I have been programming on codechef.com and solving problems of projecteuler. I am thinking of reading Introduction to algorithms and following this course on MIT opencourse ware as I haven't improved much in programming and I am wasting a lot of time thinking just what should I do when faced with any programming problem. But I think that I still don't know the correct way to learn the language itself. Should I start with the library reference or continue with the Python tutorial? Is learning algorithms useful for languages such as C and not so much for Python as it has "batteries included"? Are there some other resources for familiarization with the language and in general for learning to solve programming problems? Or do I need to just devote some more time?
