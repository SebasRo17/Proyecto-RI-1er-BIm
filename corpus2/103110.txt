For most of my development years I have been a _Java backend developer_ , mostly for web applications. Usually for regular jobs I have described my duties in previous ones during the interview, expanding what's on my resumé. Now for a possible freelance job I was asked for a portfolio, and then we'd have the interview. Never done it before, I'm in doubt of how to do it, as putting in written form requires quite a lot more of thought:   * Should I use **UML diagrams** to describe what parts of the project I've worked on? Besides having to learn UML, I have two issues here: having to remember the exact work from several years ago, and wondering if I can get into trouble for displaying internal parts of systems not owned by me. Those UML diagrams should be, low level (sequence diagrams) to high level (application architecture, or class diagrams). The frameworks I used on those jobs is already on my resumé.   * Should I link to the resulting web sites? Like, _go to that site, create a user and then do the following actions_ , and you'll see what parts I've worked on.   * How do I show the parts of my job that don't involve coding? Like leading other people, managing a project, testing, running scripts, checking the database that everything is ok, etc.   * Also, sometimes I had to do frontend development, using Javascript. I've read other questions regarding portfolios here, from which I got that I have to avoid putting my open-sourced pet projects on my resumé, unless they are popular and widely used (which they are not).
