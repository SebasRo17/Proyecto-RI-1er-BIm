> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Why does Button[ â€¦ , ChoiceDialog[] ] freeze the front end? **Warning: the following code may freeze your session,** as it does mine. I have to wait for the dialog asking whether to abort dynamic updating if that happens. Run this with a fresh kernel:               Button["Pressing this button may freeze your session!",             InputString["Type something", "(or just press Enter)"]           ]      and press the button. Then try to interact with the dialog. I see a spinning wait cursor, then I have to "Abort" dynamic execution twice to get back control of Mathematica (the kernel quits). I found no items under "Possible Issues" for either `InputString` or `Button` that could explain this.   1. Is this a bug?   2. How else could I obtain input from a user who clicks a button?
