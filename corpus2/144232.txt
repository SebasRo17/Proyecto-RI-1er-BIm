I have written a program that can rapidly (within 5 sec on a 2GB RAM desktop, 2.33 Ghz CPU) differentiate between structured text (e.g English text) and random alphanumeric strings. It can also provide a probability score for the prediction. Are there any practical applications/uses of such a program? Note that the program is based on entropy models and does not have any dictionary comparisons in its workflow.
