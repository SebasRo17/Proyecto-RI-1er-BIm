All, I have a WPF `DataGrid`. This `DataGrid` shows files ready for compilation and should also show the progress of my compiler as it compiles the files. The format of the `DataGrid` is               Image|File Path|State     -----|---------|-----        *    |C:\AA\BB |Compiled     &    |F:PP\QQ  |Failed     >    |G:HH\LL  |Processing     ....      The problem is the image column (the *, &, and > are for representation only). I have a `ResourceDictionary` that contains hundreds of vector images as `Canvas` objects:               <ResourceDictionary xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"                           xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation">     <Canvas x:Key="appbar_acorn" Width="48" Height="48" Clip="F1 M 0,0L 48,0L 48,48L 0,48L 0,0">         <Path Width="22.3248" Height="25.8518" Canvas.Left="13.6757" Canvas.Top="11.4012" Stretch="Fill" Fill="{DynamicResource BlackBrush}" Data="F1 M 16.6309,18.6563C 17.1309,8.15625 29.8809,14.1563 29.8809,14.1563C 30.8809,11.1563 34.1308,11.4063 34.1308,11.4063C 33.5,12 34.6309,13.1563 34.6309,13.1563C 32.1309,13.1562 31.1309,14.9062 31.1309,14.9062C 41.1309,23.9062 32.6309,27.9063 32.6309,27.9062C 24.6309,24.9063 21.1309,22.1562 16.6309,18.6563 Z M 16.6309,19.9063C 21.6309,24.1563 25.1309,26.1562 31.6309,28.6562C 31.6309,28.6562 26.3809,39.1562 18.3809,36.1563C 18.3809,36.1563 18,38 16.3809,36.9063C 15,36 16.3809,34.9063 16.3809,34.9063C 16.3809,34.9063 10.1309,30.9062 16.6309,19.9063 Z "/>     </Canvas>     </ResourceDictionary>      Now, I want to be able to include these in my image column and change them at run-time. I was going to attempt to do this by setting up a property in my View Model that was of type `Image` and binding this to my View via:               <DataGrid.Columns>         <DataGridTemplateColumn Header=""                                  Width="SizeToCells"                                  IsReadOnly="True">             <DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate>                 <DataTemplate>                     <Image Source="{Binding Canvas}"/>                 </DataTemplate>             </DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate>         </DataGridTemplateColumn>     </DataGrid.Columns>      Where in the View Model I have the appropriate property. Now, I was told this is not 'pure' MVVM. I don't fully accept this, but I want to know if there is a better way of doing this. Say, binding to an enum and using a converter to get the image? Any advice would be appreciated.
