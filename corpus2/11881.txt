I'm trying to write a function that picks out the row of a Matrix whose `kth` element is closest to some given number that will be given to me. So for example,               list = Table[{i, FromCharacterCode[70 + i]}, {i, 1, 10}]     {{1, "G"}, {2, "H"}, {3, "I"}, {4, "J"}, {5, "K"}, {6, "L"}, {7,"M"}, {8, "N"}, {9, "O"}, {10, "P"}}      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SZhuE.jpg)               b = RandomReal[{0, 6}]     4.42427      So I want to pick the row whose 1st element is closest to 4.42427. The function should spit out               {4,"J"}      **Edit** Btw, thanks to Mr. Wizard's help, my crappy code works!!               disT[l_List, bb_?NumericQ, cc_Integer] := Table[Abs[bb - l[[j, cc]]], {j, 1,Dimensions[l][[1]]}]          srcH[ll_List, bb_?NumericQ, cc_Integer] := Drop[First[Sort[Transpose[    Prepend[Transpose[ll], disT[ll, bb, cc]]], #1[[1]] < #2[[1]] &]],1]               disT[list,b,1]     {3.42427, 2.42427, 1.42427, 0.42427, 0.57573, 1.57573, 2.57573,3.57573, 4.57573,5.57573}          srcH[list, b, 1]     {4, "J"}      Now I will Implement Mr. Wizard's code or Daniel's code for my actual problem. Thanks!! **Edit2** To expand on what I wrote under Mr. Wizard's answer. The actual task that I am trying to accomplish involves many lists $list_k \; k \; \in \\{1,100\\}$ and many comparison lists $b_k = (b_{k1},...,b_{kj}), \; \; k \; \in \\{1,100\\}$ . So For example:                list[57]=  {{1, "G"}, {2, "H"}, {3, "I"}, {4, "J"}, {5, "K"}, {6, "L"}, {7,"M"}, {8, "N"}, {9, "O"}, {10, "P"}}           b[57]={0.1,7.3,9.8}           list[79]=  {{2.8, "G"}, {3.4, "H"}, {4.5, "I"}, {5.1, "J"}, {6.05, "K"}, {7.1, "L"}, {8.3,"M"}, {8.5, "N"}, {9, "O"}, {10, "P"}}           b[79]={5,7.2,8.1}      and my final output, as index goes from 1 to 100, will find rows where the first element is close to the elements of b[k] respectively:                output[57]={{1,G},{7,M},{10,P}}      output[79]={{5.1,J},{7.1,L},{8.3,M}}      I was planning on using the function I got from the help here at mma.se inside a table or something but since Mr. Wizard has mentioned speeding up computation, I figured it would be best if I described the exact problem I am working on.
