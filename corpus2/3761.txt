Is there any way to create a stream so that all output to the stream (from `Write` or something similar) goes to a specific notebook, or to a specific cell? I think `CellPrint` almost does what I want, but I would need to manipulate the selection in order to have the newly generated cell end up where I want it, and more annoyingly, I can no longer make use of the functionality by using a stream as an argument. **EDIT** to add: As an example of what I'm trying to do, say I have a function like this:               foo[] := Print["I am Spartacus!"];      What I want is some function, `whatever`, which will allow me to do this:               Block[{$Output = whatever[]},      foo[]];      and have "I am Spartacus!" appear in another notebook, instead of in a cell underneath the cell I just evaluated. I don't want to have to change the definition of `foo`, because it's really a long function with a lot of `Print` statements used for logging purposes.
