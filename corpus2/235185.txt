I like both but I notice languages that use camelCasing for members sometimes need more adjustments when you want to edit your code. For example (in Python):               node.customData()      vs               node.setCustomData()      custom changes casing. It could be avoided if it was:               node.getCustomData()      In C# they will use PascalCasing for example. I know some even use no casing so:               node.getcustomdata()      It seems to be that scripting languages generally prefer camelCasing more than PascalCasing to be more relaxed? Is there a reason for choosing one over the other from a programming language design POV?
