I purchased a used book by Julia Lerman (2010) on EF4.0, and now I am wondering if the EF has changed dramatically since, I'm looking to learn this technology and i do not know if starting with a previous version matters or not ( deprecated functions, new practices, different approaches...). If I start with learning EF 4.0 will I be learning a dead or dying technology or will most of what I learn translate directly to EF 5. Are there things I should be aware of that are extremely different in the application of the 2 versions?
