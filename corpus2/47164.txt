I have               m = {{0, -1, -2, -3, -4}, {1, 0, -1, -2, -3}, {2, 1, 0, -1, -2}, {3,          2, 1, 0, -1}, {4, 3, 2, 1, 0}};      And a grid `Grid[m,Frame->All]` I would like to label the grid such that every column has a number above it and every row has a number to its side. This is what I've currently managed to do.               Labeled[Grid[m,Frame->All],{Y:{1,5},X:{1,5}},{Left,Top}]       How can I label the grid appropriately?
