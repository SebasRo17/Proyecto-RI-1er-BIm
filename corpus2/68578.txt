In a standard ICT Department who is responsible for managing software licenses? I would start by saying that the ICT Manager is accountable for it. But who gets the responsibility, using ITIL as a standard model for an ICT department would the Service Delivery Manager or Development Manager? The Service Delivery Manager needs to keep things running, but when moving forward with new versions of software does the Development Manager get controlling vote in what to purchase? As it's not just about delivering the service it's about improving it.
