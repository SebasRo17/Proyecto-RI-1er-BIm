I always supported the idea of having coding rules for developers in a company or a specific project. Especially if the company is size greater than 10. The bigger the company the bigger the need. I know a lot of people will disagree, but I have seen projects that don't have them and the code looks like total disaster. The real problem that comes from this is how to make those hard headed ones that don't like to use brackets in if statements, or use the same connections string everywhere in the code, or whatever, to use the coding rules without making them oppose the idea?
