I am handling large numerical data in _Mathematica_. In smaller problems everything worked fine using `Export` and `Import` with the parameter `csv` and nothing more. Now I am facing a much larger data volume and plain `Export` and `Import` is way too slow for CSV format. What I want to do: First, exporting a numerical list of approximately $1400 \cdot 260$. Then I perform some calculations outside of mathematica and finally I import a csv file back using `Import`. In this question I read how to improve the speed of `Export` with CSV. I tried               Export["data.csv",        ExportString[Transpose[temp], "CSV", "FieldSeparators" -> ", "],        "Table"];      for a toy-example of dimension $9 \cdot 6$. This could be               temp = RandomReal[{0, 1000}, {9, 6}];      The problem is that I got additional blank lines in my CSV file. How can I avoid those blank lines? I did not have them using plain `Export`. Second part of the question: can I use a similar approach to speed up `Import` for CSV files? I work in English locale in Windows 7 and _Mathematica_ 8. My data should be comma-separated. The result of the above looks like this:               155.9418457227914,427.72566448956945,462.4370455183139,434.230107096781,377.73423736605037,457.7044624877774,229.5721937681028,453.6973831247924,827.5146478718962          656.9573702857699,975.1048399942904,716.715190156526,67.07781324817643,168.78248854317894,863.1953962590844,997.7580107302701,427.94798294100747,565.2955778916687          192.3648037459477,435.0418975785194,126.17228368369842,772.0737083559297,453.73573640921836,957.9178360741387,920.4158275934401,234.75353158374764,162.82606110943834          841.7132070637356,799.1268178998612,931.2448706410551,950.7753472229233,114.01596316796622,145.0771999411104,287.47149951303663,786.9008107323455,99.09420650484662          116.9916885502289,715.7594598282562,970.6252946068753,654.1742185278038,262.3778046629968,200.13980161337577,347.24862854841354,314.5612015073982,241.11046402342163          203.65015448763597,952.1236458849723,578.2673369638862,527.2990305555661,655.1228742370724,318.81372163827496,311.2738362265584,315.97629887850667,514.7676854642548      EDIT: A small example of the data that I want to import (2nd step) can be found here.
