I have an application with multiple threads that may be run on different hardware. To assist with tuning on different hardware I would like to create a "profiler" that can automatically run a fixed amount of data through using different numbers of threads. I've thought of several ways of implementing this:   1. It's a test, so put it in with the unit tests   2. It's also a part of the app, so make it part of the top level class running the app   3. It's a helper, so create entirely new class `Profiler` I'm leaning toward option 2, because I think it is simplest to implement and seems to fit in well. Anyone have any other ideas or comments?
