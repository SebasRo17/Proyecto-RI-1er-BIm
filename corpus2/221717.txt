This question is asked many times, and I always prefer code-first as I like to keep the logic in code. But now I have a challenge to load screen under 5 seconds and very little time to do things. I have large set of records, and I'm possibly going to retrieve them asynchronously. There are a few doubts in my mind.   * Does using db-first approach have any benefits in performance over code-first?    * Should I write the logic in stored procedures or in code (Linq)?   * Which has less latency: Linq or stored procedures?
