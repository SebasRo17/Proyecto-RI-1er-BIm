I'm attempting to add `$MachineEpsilon` to numbers I am pulling from the domains of 3 interpolating functions. I pulled 3 numbers, and for one of these numbers adding `$MachineEpsilon` produces a number slightly larger than the first (as expected). For some reason for the second two numbers, adding `$MachineEpsilon` does nothing - the number stays the same. I noticed that there are more significant digits in the first number than the last two, which I suppose could have something to do with this, but how can I fix this so that adding `$MachineEpsilon` will create a higher number for the last two numbers? Below is the output that I got by adding `$MachineEpsilon` to my numbers (lim,lim1,lim2):                eps=$MachineEpsilon     InputForm[lim]          (*     1.7775896893621104 *)          InputForm[lim + eps]     (* 1.7775896893621106 *)          InputForm[lim1]     (* 4.925661999190314 *)          InputForm[lim1 + eps]     (* 4.925661999190314 *)          InputForm[lim2]     (* 8.10371456559119 *)          InputForm[lim2 + eps]     (* 8.10371456559119 *)      Additionally, this is how I'm pulling the numbers from the interpolating functions (leaving out some unneccessary code for simplicity):               dom = InterpolatingFunctionDomain[First[r /. g1]];     dom1 = InterpolatingFunctionDomain[First[r /. g2]];     dom2 = InterpolatingFunctionDomain[First[r /. g3]];     dom3 = InterpolatingFunctionDomain[First[r /. g4]];     {lim, b} = dom1[[1]];     {lim1, b1} = dom2[[1]];     {lim2, b2} = dom3[[1]];      Thanks for any help! I'm using the pulled numbers and their next closest in plot and have continued to get the pllp error message saying the two numbers are the same.
