I have a webstore which sells components (it is a academic project) which looks like this. I have developed the same web application using following database methodologies:   1. MS Sql Server with Stored procedures and sql data reader   2. LINQ to Sql   3. DB4o using LINQ (Client/Server) What features can I compare apart from the technical and theoretical details between relational database and object oriented database ? It is my graduate/master's thesis final project. I want the features that i want to compare to be more practical and interesting so that I can draw some concrete and meaningful conclusions rather than abstract comparisons which don't create much interest and hard for inference. Please help me.
