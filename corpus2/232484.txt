Some apps, I've noticed that developers are able to update their software without submitting them to the App Store. For example, Game of War will occasionally tell you that an update is available and to restart your device. You can then watch the progress bar carefully and see that updates are being pushed to the app. I'm assuming they are using XML to change certain attributes and their location on the server. That's a guess but I don't know. They are able to make significant feature changes to the game, like adding hyperlinks to map locations, push sales promotions, add certain events etc. These methods don't require compilation, as that would obviously require resubmitting the app. What technologies allow this? Are they all server side changes with XML objects being updated on the client? What is apple's policy in the developer terms?
