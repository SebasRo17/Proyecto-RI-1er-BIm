I am enamored by reliable distributed systems and want to spend my career improving them rather than merely using them to write the same CRUD applications over and over. What experience will convince an employer to let me work on their systems project? (Pick any example, say, CouchDB.)   * Presumably writing my own system is the best example, but the scope of that is relatively large and pragmatically speaking it doesn't make a ton of sense to re-invent the wheel.   * Learning the codebase of an existing system and working up to submitting patches seems like a long road to only marginal impact on a project, with little assurance of job payoff.   * Most employers (as far as I can tell) want you busy working on their high-level app and not spending time improving the infrastructure. Are these impressions accurate? How do other people get started working on these systems? **EDIT** : I am indeed willing to start at the bottom and labor for a long time. Are there specific projects/tasks in the distributed systems space that are suitable for a beginner? E.g. it seems like distributed message queues are a good starter project and are not 100% saturated across all platforms yet. Any thoughts greatly appreciated. Thank you!
