I have started using Pivotal tracker for a project I'm working on. Conceptually, this seems really cool and I'm interested in using the agile model. However, I have one problem with everything talked about in the video. At 4:19 in the linked video they talk about story acceptance and how it should be done by the project owner. This concept sounds great on paper but I'm not sure I can actually get the project owner to sit down and try out even half of the new features I create, let alone all of them. My question is: how do you approach a product owner about the work that this flavor of the Agile Model asks of them? What do you do if they refuse to participate in acceptance testing?
