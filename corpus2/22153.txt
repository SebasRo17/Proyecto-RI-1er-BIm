So I have been developing with PHP for a year and a half now. Somewhere along those times, I decided to pick up skills in Python and Ruby, and learn ASP with C# just recently (as my first compiled language). Adding to that I'm a sucker for good CSS and Javascript coding. What I'm worried about is that this is a huge undertaking. Please don't tell me "you should focus on one language" right now because it's just that my damned brain is telling me to study the aforementioned languages and get up and running ASAP. I'm 21, and work at a small web dev company. They're not that strict so I can sneak some time learning Python and improving my PHP. At home I work with Ruby and C#. I have done the following to effectively manage my learning process:   1. Focus on web-only projects   2. Reuse my codes from PHP and convert rewrite them according to the language syntax (to Ruby, to Python)   3. Create an online blog to store some of my codes in case I need to get back to them later I know it's quite insane to juggle 4 server languages and 2 frontend languages at once but hey, I am having fun doing this. I'm not saying I want to master them immediately, because I know it takes years to master a single language. Have you done this before? How did you manage your learning process? Did you give up halfway and just focused on one?
