I have a system of non linear equations and from `NDSolve` I get the solution. I plot the phase space with `ParametricPlot[{y1[t],y2[t]}/.solution,{t,0,10}]`. I want to plot the vector field and I want your help. To be more specific, I want to see whether the fixed points are stable or unstable. I know how to do it by watching them from nonlinear dynamics, but the vector field is a much more faster way to figure out about the stability of the fixed points.
