I'm continuing[1,2] the study of an infinite square well in the context of quantum mechanics. Ultimate goal is to calculate the product $\Delta x\Delta k$, for various eigenstates, that is for various values of number $n$. I have finished with $\Delta x$, but I'm stuck with $\Delta k$.               ClearAll["Global`*"];     (* The length of the well *)     L = 1;          (* The eigenfunctions, n=1,2,3,... *)     u[n_, x_] := If[x <= 0 || x >= L, 0, Sqrt[2/L] Sin[n π x / L]]          (* The Fourier transform of eigenfunctions u[n,x] from the position        domain onto the momentum domain *)     φ[n_, k_] :=         Simplify[             FourierTransform[u[n, x], x, k, FourierParameters -> {0, -1}],             n ∈ Integers]          (* The probability density function η(n,k) *)     η[n_, k_] :=          FullSimplify[φ[n, k] \[Conjugate] φ[n, k],         {n ∈ Integers, k ∈ Reals}]          (* Calculate (Δk)^2 = <k^2> - <k>^2 = <k^2> *)     Integrate[         k^2 η[n, k], {k, -∞, +∞},         (* Edited: Was: {n ∈ Integers, n > 0}, but this edit didn't            fix the problem. *)          Assumptions -> n ∈ Integers && n > 0]      The problem is that _Mathematica_ can't calculate the last integral for any arbitrary $n$, although it can, correctly, calculate its value for hardcoded $n$s. Like $n=1,2,...$. **My question is** : Do you have any idea on how I could calculate it, perhaps by rewriting it a bit, or by using some other trick? In case it helps, the result should be $n^2\pi^2$. **Note** : Actually it can be calculated with Cauchy's residue theorem, but I'd like to avoid taking that route, if possible. Though, if it can't be done otherwise, I will post a solution with residual calculation so that this question has an answer. **Mathematica.SE related (to the physical problem) questions** : Is there a more mathematica-y way to label these plots? Why does FourierTransform converge while same integral manually written does not?
