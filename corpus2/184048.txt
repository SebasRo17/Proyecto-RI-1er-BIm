Does the choice of using a DVCS over a CVCS actually make for shorter release cycles? If so, what makes software release cycles shorter and what are the arguments for this?   1. Related to pull request? Does easier submission of patches play a role here?   2. Related to people factor? Are project teams that use CVCS act more conservative with release schedules?   3. Any other factors?
