I would like the equivalent of:               For[x = 0, x less than Infinity, x++]             For[y = 0, y less than Infinity, y++]                 m = Table[(x, x-2 y, x-2 y, 0, 0, 0), (x-2 y, x, x-2 y, 0, 0, 0),                      (x-2 y, x-2 y, x, 0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0, 2 y, 0, 0),(0, 0, 0, 0, 2 y, 0),                      (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2 y)]      I then would like to include an "if-else" statement where I print only the largest possible matrix. (i.e. If `m` is less than `m`, continue running through loop until it finds the largest `m`, then print it). I have another matrix, `l`, where I need to minimize the distance between `l` and `m`, hence requiring the largest possible matrix for `m`. Could you help me with this?
