I recently started using namespaces in PHP. When I first saw them, I thought that their syntax was ugly and I'd never use them. However, I created an autoloader (spl_autoload_register) that makes it so that I never have to write an include/require statement again. I like namespaces, but is there any objective benefit over include/require statements, or are they the exact same method to accomplish the same goal?
