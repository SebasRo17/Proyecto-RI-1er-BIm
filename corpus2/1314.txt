I am an undergraduate student, starting to use Mathematica to model simple physical chemistry problems, as a prelude to a summer internship in a computational/theoretical chemistry group. The solution to a problem I was given (and walked through) now needs to be incorporated in the group's program, which contains >17 Kloc. Before seeing this big program, my experience with Mathematica gave me the impression that it was a very sophisticated graphical calculator. Mathematica is fast, extremely versatile, but its code cannot be compiled and made executable (for what I know). I know one can use the CDF player, but that means the program is not really standalone. Considering my example, I am wondering if there is a point at which one would be better off using another programming language than Mathematica to do the computation. Are there disadvantages or obstacles present when Mathematica programs grow bigger than a certain size?
