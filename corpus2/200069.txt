We want to be able to offer users of our software the facility of having a miscellaneous folder for each of their clients. All these client folders would be stored together in another folder called 'miscellaneous data' for example It would be accessible via an icon in the client record window in our software and would be a place to just drop files that aren't catered for by us. A really simple solution is just to do a Shell call to explorer.exe with the folder address. All the files would have the correct icons and look familiar and the user would be able to open them with their default programs The problem with this is that this then allows the user to use file explorer to navigate up to the 'miscellaneous data' folder and possibly do something unintentional like delete a bunch of client folders. I'd be very grateful for suggestions for a simple but more secure design
