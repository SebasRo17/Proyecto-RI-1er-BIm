I was reading some code, in particular, recipe 4.13 on unification pattern- matching in Sal Mangano's Mathematica Cookbook, and there were many instances of Modules with no variables in them, such as               Lookup[x_] := Module[{}, x /. $bindings]      i didn't understand the point. Why not just write               Lookup[x_] := x /. $bindings      ? Sal uses such modules frequently, so I'm supposing there is some deep reason I'm missing, hence the question here.
