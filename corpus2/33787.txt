I have sets of 10 differential equations, but for this purpose I'll demonstrate what I need on one example that can be solved by hand. My equation is this: $$4GJ\Omega(\theta)\Omega'(\theta)\xi^\theta(\tau,r,\theta,\varphi)+4GJ\Omega^2(\theta)\frac{\partial \xi^\theta}{\partial\theta}=\mathcal{O}(r^{-1})$$ I need to assume that the solution of $\xi^\theta$ is in the form $$\xi^\theta=\sum\limits_n\xi_n^\theta(\tau,\theta,\varphi)r^n$$ and it truncates for large n, where n is negative. If I put that in my equation, and say that all powers greater or equal of 0 will be zero, I get $$\Omega'\xi^\theta_n+\Omega \xi_{n,\theta}^\theta=0,\quad for\ n\geq0$$ where $\xi_{n,\theta}^\theta=\frac{\partial \xi_n^\theta}{\partial\theta}$ for shorthand notation simplification. Now, this basically means that my general solution for $\xi^\theta$ is $$\xi^\theta=\xi^\theta_{-1}r^{-1}+\mathcal{O}(r^{-2})$$ which is what I need to get. Now, my question is: is it possible to do this for all other equations in Mathematica. I got my equations, and I made substitution:               ξθ=Sum[ξ[τ, θ, φ][m]*r^m, m]      and got the result               4 G J Ω[θ]((Sum[D[ξ[τ, θ, φ][m],θ]*r^m, m])Ω[θ]+(Sum[ξ[τ, θ, φ][m]*r^m, m])Ω'[θ])      As I should. Is it possible now, to somehow get the most general result, like I got by solving by hand? I'm asking because I have 10 equations like this, and some have other terms ($\xi^r,\xi^\tau,\xi^\varphi$) that I need to find the general solution to. Do I actually expand it to some order and somehow truncate higher terms? EDIT: The power series solution is in the negative expansion.
