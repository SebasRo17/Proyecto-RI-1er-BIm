I am pretty weak on the notion of pure functions, etc. I found a clean solution to my problem so in a sense I've already answered my own question but I don't feel I'm on terra firma. I wanted to take a random sample from a list of lists with a different sample size for each list in the list of lists. I did the following which is clean and readable by the cognoscenti. I'll probably have trouble understanding this in a year. Comments and/or suggestions of better ways will be appreciated.               listoflists = {{1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7}, {8, 9}, {10, 11, 12, 13}};          samplesizes = {2, 3, 1, 3};          out=Apply[RandomSample, Transpose[{listoflists, samplesizes}], {1}]
