I'm looking at how I can change the representation of a payload at runtime for varied potential advantages, but I'm not sure how to do it. Specifically collections. Array of Pairs               [{ <resource_uri> : { <entity> }, ...}]      Array of Objects               [<entity>,...]      Array of Resources               [<resource_uri>]      Map of entities               { <resource_uri> : { <entity> }, ... }      My problem is, I'm not sure if I should put these different representations of the sets at different URI's, give them slightly varied mime types, e.g. `application/foomap+json` or perhaps use an optional query parameter `?format=map`, or resource `/entities/map`. The UI is going to hide this, this is for programmatic web service access only (which the "UI's JS will have to call).
