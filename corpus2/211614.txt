Recently I came across a moderately large python codebase with lots of `MyClassAbstractFactory`, `MyClassManager`, `MyClassProxy`, `MyClassAdapter` etc. classes. While on the one hand those names pointed me to research and learn the corresponding patterns, they were not very descriptive of what the class **does**. Also, they seem to fall within the forbidden list of words in programming: `variable`, `process_available_information`, `data`, `amount`, `compute`: overly broad names, that don't tell us anything about the function **when used by themselves**. _So should there be`CommunicationManager` or rather `PortListener`? Or maybe I do not understand the problem at all...?_
