The source code I'm working on at the moment performs numeric calculations between a bunch of different properties belonging to different data models. All the calculations are coded in a big method with a lot of If statements than make it very complex, difficult to change and it contains some bugs. I have not found a design pattern that fits into this problem that I think is very common in any financial application. Any help with this? The source code is c# with .NET fw 4.
