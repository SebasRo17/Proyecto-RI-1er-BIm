this is my first time here. I'm a physics grad student and I've recently found a research group to work with. We study statistical mechanics using computer models, so there is a significant programming aspect to it. My first job has been to take the old data analysis code (written in java) and clean it up in c++. The guy before me who wrote the original program used the traditional physics method of using an enormous amount of spaghetti code and shoving it all in a constructor. This irked me quite a bit, so I divided it up into separate classes and now it has a reasonable class structure. In the past, whenever we had defined a class we would put its definitions and its methods in a header function, then to use it we would just include it. I know this breaks the rules of how to use .h and .cpp files, but is there any reason other than code etiquette to compile and link a class object rather than include it? Sorry for the long question.
