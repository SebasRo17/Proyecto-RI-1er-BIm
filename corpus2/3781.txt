I am new to Mathematica. I am trying to recursively solve an equation and saving the values into a `Table`. Since I need the real solutions only I use `Reduce`. The following is my code:               f = 5.68672 T + 6.46776 T^3          t = Table[i, {i, 0.2, 3, 0.2}]          sols = Table[Reduce[f == t[[i]], T, Reals], {i, Length[t]}]     {T == 0.0351204, T == 0.06995, T == 0.104221, T == 0.137708,       T == 0.170237, T == 0.201687, T == 0.231988, T == 0.26111,       T == 0.289058, T == 0.315857, T == 0.34155, T == 0.366188,       T == 0.389828, T == 0.412529, T == 0.434347}      The solution is OK as I compared it to other software as well. The only thing that matters me is how to remove the T== , i.e. I just need the solution and then to copy this into another table, say sols2 that contains               sols2 = {0.0351204, 0.06995, 0.104221, T == 0.137708,.., 0.434347}      I tried the following: `sols2 = T/.sols` but get the following error: > >     sols2 = ReplaceAll::reps: ... is neither a list of replacement rules nor >        a valid dispatch table, and so cannot be used for replacing. >> >   Does anyone know how to remove the T==?
