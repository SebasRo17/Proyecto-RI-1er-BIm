xd = ExponentialDistribution[1.0];     yd = ExponentialDistribution[5.0];     td = TransformedDistribution[x/(x + y), {x \[Distributed] xd, y \[Distributed] yd}];     Mean[td]     CDF[td, z]      All the above works as expected. But when I do               Quantile[td, 0.95]      I get the input echoed as the answer, i.e. MMA can not do this. Same answer in 9 & 10. Any suggestions? Known bug or am I doing something wrong?
