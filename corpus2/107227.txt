When I first started programming, I relied heavily on flowcharts (and printer spacing charts). While I was in COBOL class, I couldn't start writing any code until my flowchart was signed off by the instructor. Back then, I had to make flowchart for everything. Today, twenty-five years later, I find myself only flowcharting two types of things. Very specific algorithms where the logic is tricky or very general concepts to ensure that I get all the big steps defined and in the proper order. Are there other use cases for flowcharts that I've simply overlooked?
