I am trying to integrate the following expression over the time interval $0\leq t \leq \text{period}$.               (Cl - Cn)/Cl*(b Sin[2 Pi/peroid*t] f[t] - 2 (wl/peroid) Pi^2 b^2/wl^2)      where               f[t_] := ((Cl - Cn)^2/Cl 2 Pi^2 b^2/wl - Cn wl) b (wl/peroid)                  Sin[2 Pi (wl/peroid)*t/wl]/((Cl - Cn)^2/Cl*b^2*                 wl*(Sin[2*Pi*(wl/peroid)*t/wl]^2) + (Cn - Cl) wl b^2/2*                 Cos[4 Pi (wl/peroid) t/wl] - Cl b^2 wl/2 - Cn wl^3/12)      $Cl, Cn, b, period, wl$ are all parameters and $t$ is the only variable. I tried to perform the integration symbolically and _Mathematica_ gave me the following result: > >     -(((Cl - Cn) (2 b^2 (Cl - Cn) \[Pi]^2 + Cn wl^2))/((2 Cl^2 - 3 Cl Cn + > Cn^2) wl)) >   To further verify that this symbolical expression is correct, I performed the above integration again but numerically with both _Mathematica_ and _Matlab_ with the following parameter values:               Cn = 0.001903418147340     Cl = 8.265172296997836/10000     b = 10/1000000     wl = 1000/1000000     peroid = 0.5      and I also evaluated the symbolic expression with the above set of values. The numerical integration performed by _Mathematica_ and _Matlab_ agrees with each other. However, both numerical integration performed by _Mathematica_ and _Matlab_ are 4 orders of magnitude different from the result obtained by evaluating the symbolic expression with the same set of parameter values. There's something going on, but I don't know what. Any suggestions ? So far, I have checked that the function that I want to evaluate is smooth. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.
