I'm currently developing a web application, that provides some ' ** _service_** ' to the user. The user will have to select a ' ** _plan_** ' according to which she/he will be allowed to perform application specific actions but up to a limit defined by the plan.   A Plan will also limit access to certain features, which will not be available at all for some plans.      As an **example** : say there are 3 **plans** , 2 **actions** throughout the application   * users in plan-1 can perform action-1 3 times, and they can't perform action-2 at all   * users in plan-2 can perform action-1 10 times, action-2 5 times   * users in plan-3 can perform action-1 20 times, action-2 10 times So I am looking for the best way to get this done, and my main concerns besides implementing it, are the following(in no particular order)   * **maintainability/changeability** : the number of plans, and type of features/actions **will** change in the final product   * **industry standard/best practice** : for future readiness   * **efficiency** : of course, I want fast code!! I have never done anything like this before, so I have **no clue** about how do I go about implementing these functionalities. **Any tips/guides/patterns/resources/examples?**   I've read a little about ACL, RBAC, are they the patterns that I need to follow?   Really, any sort of feedback will help.
