When I'm creating large lists with `Table` I see the memory footprint increasing.               MemoryInUse[]/1024.     (* Out-> 16992.4 *)          data = Table[x, {x, 0, 10000}, {y, 10000}];         MemoryInUse[]/1024.     (* Out-> 408372. *)      I would expect that when I generate the same command `data = Table[...]` just as above the memory would not increase but in fact it just allocates a new block of memory.               data = Table[x, {x, 0, 10000}, {y, 10000}];        MemoryInUse[]/1024.     (* Out -> 799041. *)      Why is that? Even when I do:               Clear[data];     MemoryInUse[]/1024.     (* Out-> 799044. *)      Is this expected behaviour or am I missing something? I can't seem to find a function that clears the memory. I'm using Mathematica 8.0.4.0 on Windows 7
