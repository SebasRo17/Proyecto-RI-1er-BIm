According to http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/11/06/oracle_dueling_jvms/ there is a possibility that Oracle really will ~~kill Java~~ split Java into _Free_ and _Premium_ JVMs. **My Questions**   1. Do you think this will happen?   2. Will this kill Java at the end? If you answer both questions with _Yes_ , what are you doing about it? Which language would you choose, and which platform will you use? **.NET/Mono**? Plain compiled languages like **Golang**? **Ruby**? And if you answer _No_ , why do you think Oracle will not harm Java and the community?
