Let me preface this with saying I am **_not_** a Business Intelligence (BI) developer. I'm a .NET developer, and I have only a vague notion of what BI is, and encompasses. I've been an evangelist for a secure development lifecycle in our company, and recently convinced the rest of the development team that we should be doing peer reviews including...   * Requirements Reviews   * Code Reviews   * Architecture/design reviews   * Documentation Reviews The .NET team does code reviews and we look for various things - general overview:   * Maintainability (clear design, adequately documented, etc.)   * Code clarity (standard .NET coding/naming guidelines)   * Security (scanning for failures to sanitize input, prevent SQL injection, etc)   * Functionality (does it do what it's supposed to)   * Usability   * Performance At any rate, our Business Intelligence developers don't really do the same type of coding/development that we do for websites, windows apps, etc. Our templates/checklists don't really apply to them. Since I've been the one trying to evangelize and get everyone do start doing peer reviews, they asked me for advice on what types of things they should be looking for. I could probably guide them and help them to develop their own checklists by asking questions about what can go wrong, what is important to them, etc., but I thought I'd ask and see if anyone is aware of established guidelines for doing "code reviews" for BI developers. I'll also take, from BI people "What would you look for in evaluating another BI developer's work?".
