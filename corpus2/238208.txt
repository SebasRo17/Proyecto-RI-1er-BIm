I work on a Java project with a suggested structure (separate src folders for java files and resource files). After moving the message / text related properties files to that folder, the externalize strings mechanism in Eclipse does not work as before. Usually when hovering over the key string in a getString("") call, the tooltip showed the content of the properties file with the default locale. That has been extremely helpful for me personally. It seems as if that feature only works if the properties file is in the same source folder as the Java code that manages the BUNDLE_NAME stuff. Can I make a strong case for moving the properties file back to the src- folder, or should they be kept separate from the java source files? Anything else that I can try to get the feature to work again with the new structure?
