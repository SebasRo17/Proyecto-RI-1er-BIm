I am writing a piece of software and I would like to release it open source. Should I try just getting it stable on my computer (with normal use; no "things a monkey wouldn't even do") before releasing it, or should I take a different approach? * * * **What I am leaning towards doing right now is:**   1. Write it myself during the **`pre-alpha`** stage to get it partially usable. Play around with the functions (like a normal person would).   2. Release it publicly and add some bells and whistles during the **`alpha`** stage   3. Say it's in **`beta`** once all features are complete, and then, along with some others (hopefully) do the "monkey testing."   4. Generate the publicity for my [fairly basic and boring, but still good enough for free and **`stable`** ] project. Then keep improving it. This seems to be a usual system (to me, the one who has never really done this whole thing ever before). * * * **Is there something I could do to automatically test for basic errors before I go alpha? Or is this one of the best things I can do? How should I go about testing?**
