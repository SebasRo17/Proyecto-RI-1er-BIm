Here's my situation: I'm starting a small computer repair business on the side. I'll be making house calls in my neighborhood but in the future I'd like to provide remote support. I was thinking of a VNC-based solution but I don't know if it would be practical to use an existing one or not. I was tossing around the idea of writing a custom VNC-based remote support solution. It would have all my own wording and logos so it would seem much more professional I think. First, how difficult would something like that be? I have a little coding experience and I usually just learn new things out of necessity, like in this case. Also, since I'd be basing my software off of open source and using it for profit, would that be allowed? Would I have to release the source? Thanks.
