As I noticed in the documentation `VertexConnectivity` is defined as the following > The vertex connectivity of a graph $g$ is the smallest number of vertices > whose deletion from $g$ disconnects $g$. Now for a `CycleGraph` I expect one needs to delete at least **two vertices** to make the resulting graph disconnected. Please correct me if I am driven by a wrong intuition here.               opt = {VertexLabels -> "Name", ImagePadding -> 10};     graph1 = CycleGraph[8, opt];     graph2 = UndirectedGraph[Graph[{1 -> 3, 1 -> 7, 1 -> 10, 2 -> 5, 2 -> 6, 3 -> 6,     3 -> 10,4 -> 7, 4 -> 8, 4 -> 9, 5 -> 9, 6 -> 10, 7 -> 8, 8 -> 9}],opt];     Row[{graph1, graph2}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2oFzG.png) ## **Strange!** Now Mathematica is returning this _not so intuitive_ values for the `graph1` and `graph2`.               VertexConnectivity /@ {graph1, graph2}      > {1,1} How can one make any of these above graphs disconnected by deleting just **one vertex**? Can someone shade some light on this issue? `EdgeConnectivity` though gives understandable output for both the graphs.
