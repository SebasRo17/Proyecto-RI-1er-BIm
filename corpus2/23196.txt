The WebServices package in _Mathematica_ 9 no longer seems to support stateful web sessions. This requires the client (i.e., the WebServices package) to pass back the HTTP Cookies that it receives from the web service. With _Mathematica_ 8 this worked without problems. In _Mathematica_ 9 this is no longer the case. Each request looks like a newly established session on the web service server side. Is there a way to re-enable support for stateful web services in _Mathematica_ 9?
