I was working as a Java Developer before and I have now finished my contract with my previous employer. But now, as I am looking for a new job, a lot of opportunities out there seem to not include Java as much as other languages. I really like Java and I have been using it since college. But it seems like I have to learn a new language so I can have a new job. When is the right time to consider changing the language I use?
