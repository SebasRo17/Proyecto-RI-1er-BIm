This is a really newbie question, but it has me confused. Why does this code **work without** `// MatrixForm` and **doesn't work with** `// MatrixForm`?               cov = {{0.02, -0.01}, {-0.01, 0.04}} // MatrixForm     W = {w1, w2}; FindMinimum[ W.cov.W, W]      The error is:               The function value ... is not a real number      Is `MatrixForm` supposed to be typesetting feature or it has other impact? * * * A similar problem appears here:               a = {{1, 0, 1, 0}, {2, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 2, 1, 0}, {0, 1, 1, 1}};     inv = Inverse[a];     b = MatrixForm@{{0}, {0}, {0}, {1}};     soln = inv.b      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Aw8jS.png)
