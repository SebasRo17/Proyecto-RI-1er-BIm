I am building a web service (PHP+JSON) to sync with my iphone app. The main goals are:   1. Backup   2. Provide a web view for printing / sorting, manipulating.   3. allow a group sync up and down. I am aware of the logic problems with all of these items, Ie. if one person deletes something, do you persist this change to other users, collisions, etc. I am looking for just any book or scholarly work, or even words of wisdom to address common issues.   * when to detect changes of data with hashes, vs modified dates, or combination.   * how do address consolidation of sequential ID's originating on different client nodes (can be sidestepped in my context, but it would be interesting.)   * dealing with collisions (is there a universally safe way to do so?).    * general best practices.   * how to structure the actual data transaction (ask for whole list then detect changes...)
