I've been reading about selective mutual exclusion (SME). The idea I got is that if a process competes for its resources against a subset of all the other process instead of competing with all the other processes then I'm facing a SME problem. 1) Can you confirm my definition is right? Now, the dining philosophers problem is a classic example of this (SME by proximity) 2) In the distributed solution (in which each philosopher competes for both forks against two other philosophers), if instead of 5 philosophers, there were 3 of them, would it still be a SME problem? (I think not, because each philosopher will be competing with all of the others) 3) And in the centralized "conductor" solution, having 5 philosophers, would it still be a SME problem? (I think it would, because although all processes are competing to get to the waiter, each philosopher is only competing with two of the other to get both specified forks) Finally, in the readers and writers problem (SME by process type) 4) If only 1 reader and 1 writer were allowed, would it still be a SME problem? (I think not, because actually every process will be competing with all the others)
