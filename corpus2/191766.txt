In our workplace we use simple ajax library for getting page data and submitting changes to server ,on certain occasions we do need to change the forms fields values ,now we know that fields can be of any type (dropdown , textbox and radiobuttons etc) and one of the most annoying and tedious task I find was remembering various fields id so could do the manipulation (the task can exceed for few days,so I had to keep the ids in notepad) ,then I made this design pattern for easy working with the fields.                function FormFieldsManager() {                 var FormMgr = {                     txtGradeName: function (txt) {                         if (txt) {                             $('#txtGradeName').val(txt);                         }                         else {                             return $('#txtGradeName').val();                         }                     },                     txtGradeDesc: function (txt) {                         if (txt) {                             $('#txtGradeDesc').text(txt);                         }                         else {                             return $('#txtGradeDesc').text();                         }                     },                     ddStatus: function (txt) {                         if (txt) {                             if (isNaN(txt)) {                                 $("#ddStatus").val(txt);                             }                             else {                                 $("#ddStatus")[0].selectedIndex = txt;                             }                         }                         else {                             return $('#ddStatus :selected').val();//selected value: A                         }                     }                 };             return FormMgr;             };      In order to use that function,I just call the method and I could navigate the form fields and I get full JavaScript intellisense.               var form = FormFieldsManager();     form.txtGradeName('Software Developer');//to set the field value     form.txtGradeName();//to get the field value      **So my questions are,**   1. What specific design pattern is this?   2. What suggestion for improvement you guys can give? **PS:** I like to call it jsPageObject :)
