I have taken my major as computer science and Engineering and I am really confused at this moment. My first course was about learning C and C++ and I learned the basics of those. Now I am really confused what to do next. Some says I should practice algorithms and do contests in ACM-ICPC for now. Others tell me to start software development. But As I started digging its really a vast topic and there are many aspects of these, like web design, web- development, iOS-development, android... etc many things. And I am really confused about what should I do just now. Any advice for me to start with?
