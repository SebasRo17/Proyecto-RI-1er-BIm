I'm working on a business application (C#, WPF, EF, MVVM). I need to load a bunch of items from database, create view models for them and put them in a window. Is there a way to create the view model in another thread or do something similar to speed up UI?   1. The approximate average time needed to fetch all items from database = 1s    2. The approximate average time needed to instantiate all view models = 3s I'm doing the first part through Loaded event of each item. but the second part is the bottleneck. any insight would be appreciated.
