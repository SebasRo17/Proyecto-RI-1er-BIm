In the perils of java schools Joel discusses his experience at Penn and the difficulty of "segmentation faults". He says > [segfaults are difficult until you] "take a deep breath and really try to > force your mind to work at two different levels of abstraction > simultaneously." Given a list of common causes for segfaults, I don't understand how we have to work at 2 levels of abstraction. For some reason, Joel considers these concepts core to a programmers ability to abstract. I don't want to assume too much. So, what is so difficult about pointers/recursion? Examples would be nice.
