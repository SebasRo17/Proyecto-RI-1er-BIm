Having used Google Chrome now for a couple of years, I've really gotten to like rolling/automatic updates. I know that most modern software has "automatic updates", but many large pieces of software only have "minor version automatic updates", leaving you to pay to for each major version. Obviously, these companies get you hooked with version 1 and then get you to buy each subsequent version since you're often locked in and/or you're used to the product. Is there a viable business model for "automatic major version updates"? For instance: "Is there a business model in which Microsoft could just sell Office"? There would be no version number. As new features come out, they're automatically added. How could/would they continue to make just as much money?
