I want to solve the Linear Equation, $Ax=b$ in Mathematica using Kylov subspace solver method preferably BICGSTAB(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biconjugate_gradient_stabilized_method). Suppose $A^{BE}_{\Delta,\Omega}$ is the following Laplacian+ Angular Momentum operator.![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/RMoW8.png) Instead of using the finite difference matrices for evaluating $A^{BE}_{\Delta,\Omega}$, I am using the derivatives in Fourier space for higher accuracy. ![Derivatives](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wG316.png) where ![Description of operators](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cPwC3.png) How can one solve this Linear equation $A^{BE}_{\Delta,\Omega}\psi=\phi$ equation where $A=A^{BE}_{\Delta,\Omega}$, $x=\psi$, and $b=\phi$ in $Ax=b$? How can one extract $A^{BE}_{\Delta,\Omega}$ to plug it in `LinearSolve[A,b]`when it clearly depends upon $\psi$? I have used: `LinearSolve[A,b]` but as A ($A^{BE}_{\Delta,\Omega}$) depends on x ($\psi$), I do not get the correct result. One can solve this in MATLAB using the following function: `x = bicgstab(A,b)` Here it attempts to solve the system of linear equations A*x=b for x. A can be a function handle, afun, such that afun(x) returns A*x. Is there an analog of this function handle operation in Mathematica, in `LinearSolve`, where it can deal with the matrix A that depends on its x, in Ax=b? Any help is appreciated.
