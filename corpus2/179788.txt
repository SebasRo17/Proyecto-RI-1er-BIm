What is the "stack" exactly? I've read articles, tried comprehending it through my understanding, experience, and educated guessing of programming and computers, but I'm a bit perplexed here. The "stack" is a region in RAM? Or is it some other space I'm uncertain of here? The processor pushes bits through registers on to the stack in RAM, or do I have it wrong here? Also, the processor moves the bits from the RAM to the register to "process" it, such as maybe a compare, arithmetic, etc. But what actually can help understand, in some visual or verbal description or both, of how to implement the idea of a "stack" here? Is the stack actually the same in terminology with a "machine stack" meaning it's in RAM? * * * I know what a software stack is. I know about LIFO, FIFO, etc. I just want to gain a better understanding of the assembly level stack, what it is, where it is, how exactly it works, etc...
