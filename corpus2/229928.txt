I am currently learning functional programming using Underscore.js. What I want to do is add two co-ordinates together. Let P1 = (0, 0) and P2 = (1, 1). Therefore, P1 + P2 = (1, 1) I have a solution, but it seems so convoluted that I'm sure I'm doing something wrong:               // Base 2D Cartesian Point     var Point = function(x, y) {       this.x = x;       this.y = y;     }          Point.prototype.add = function(delta) {       return _.object(_.keys(this),         _.map(           _.zip(             _.values(this),              _.values(delta)),              function(point) {               return _.reduce(point,                  function(memo, num) { return memo + num; }, 0);             }         )       );     }      Is this the proper implementation of the add function for points using Underscore.js or is there a better solution?
