I've been playing a bit with Smalltalk, and I found it interesting. I know that there are some classical examples of Smalltalk: the Smalltalk images themselves and the Seaside web framework, and that there are lots of in-house custom applications built using this language. I'd like to know:   * if there are computer applications actively used and developed apart from the ones I mentioned;   * if there are software houses that use Smalltalk for doing their job;   * when would you use Smalltalk instead of another language for developing from scratch a new application;
