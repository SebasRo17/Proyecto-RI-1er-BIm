Are there any good Data Grid libraries that allow the user to view and edit data from a database? My boss asked me to research possible Data Grid resources to supplement our web application and I thought I'd ask here. I know we could make one in-house, but we'd like to have a professional looking one without expending too much time and work. We are looking for a web based Data Grid, preferably written in Java that is free or open-source. JDeveloper looks promising, however, it has quite a bit of overhead and quite a steep learning curve. The web application that this would supplement is not large enough to warrant the time it would take to simply learn JDeveloper. The grid viewer should be able to:   * allow users to view tables   * allow users to edit rows inline   * allow sorting by columns   * pages rows   * associate tables If there are any suggestions of possible Data Grids that allow have this criteria, it would be much appreciated.
