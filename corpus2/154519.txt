I am trying to come up with a list / ranking system on determining which server language to choose for a particular website. Assume that familiarity with a certain language is not important and the implementation can be done in any language. Here are some things that might be important but I am not sure how to rank them :   * Maintainability.   * Libraries. For example, Memcached and NoSql support right out the box would be really nice addition to a particular framework.   * 3rd party SDK's. For example, if I need Paypal on my site they openly provide SDK's for all senarios in Java, PHP and .Net. If I choose Django I would have to rely on 3rd party libraries that are don't support everything and are not officially maintained. Would that be dealbreaker for Django?   * Performance This one is tricky to put on a generic list because it can be a deal breaker but for many websites performance will not be an issue that the language/framework is responsible for.   * Cost (hosting, open source). edit - Any reason for the votes to close? I didn't see any duplicates mentioned and the question should not drum up a flame war.
