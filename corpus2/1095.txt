I used ad-hoc MUML (made-up modeling language) to design and explain system fairly frequently. It looks similar to UML and tends to be pretty well understood. However, I've had a professor or two that harped on the use of strict, formal UML, as close to the spec as possible. I always suspected that strict UML wasn't really as common as they claimed. So, how 'bout it- how often do you actually draw out complete diagrams that use all the proper line endings, multiplicity, member type symbols, etc?
