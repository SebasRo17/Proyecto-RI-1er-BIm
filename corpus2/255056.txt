I'm developing a (`PHP MySQL`) Web App which will sell dynamically generated real time cell phone numbers for cellular companies. A company will ask for, say, a thousand numbers and this app will check for available numbers and provide them. The number will be an 8 digit figure. The first `two digits` of the number will mostly be fixed as specific `codes` for a particular company, rest of the digits will be dynamically generated. My question is whether               a) I should store all the sold numbers in database, if yes then:        i)  Separate number in separate row or        ii) All the numbers in a single row          b) Should store range of numbers i.e 32500001-32510000      Keeping performance and ease of handling the algorithm in mind, kindly suggest me your solution.
