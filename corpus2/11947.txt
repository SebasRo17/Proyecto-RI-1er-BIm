I want to solve 13 variables by 13 equations. And here is my program:               Solve[{RD == (1.1*NR)^0.6, 0.6*1.1^0.6*NR^-0.4 == wr/em, wr == em^0.2,       Q == (0.6 NQ^(-1/3) + 0.02 R^(-1/3) + 0.38 K^(-1/3))^-3,        0.6 (Q/NR)^(4/3) == w, 0.02 (Q/R)^(4/3) == em,        0.38 (Q/K)^(4/3) == 0.04, NR + NQ + NU == 1 - L,        w (NR + NU) == wr*NR, C1/C2 == 4*em,        L == (1/1.04*0.2^0.2*0.8^0.8*em^-0.2*w)^-0.2,        Q == C1 + 0.25 Q*em^0.5,        0.25*Q*em^0.5 - em*C2 - em (R - RD) == 0}, {RD, NR, wr, em, Q, NQ,        R, K, w, NU, L, C1, C2}]      After executing this I get the following message > >     :General::ivar: 1.11396/(w/<<2>>^<<4>>)^0.2 is not a valid variable. >> >   Here is how it looks in my notebook. Could anybody kindly answer what's going on?
