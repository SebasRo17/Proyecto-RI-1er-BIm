As a novice programmer and I always wonder about c# capabilities. I know it is still early to judge that but all i want to know is can c# do complex stuffs or something outside windows OS.   1. I think C# is a proprietary language (I don't know if I said that right) meaning you can't do it outside Visual Studio or Windows.   2. Also you can't create your own controller (called object right?) like you are forced to use these available in toolbox and their properties and methods.   3. Can C# be used with OpenGL API or DirectX API    4. Finally it always bothers me when I think I start doing things in Visual Studio, I know it sounds arrogant to say but sometimes I feel that I don't like to be forced to use something even if its helpful, like I feel (do I have the right to feel?) that I want to do all things by myself? Don't laugh I just feel that this will give me a better understanding.   5. Is Visual C# like using MaxScript inside 3ds max in that C# is exclusive to do Windows and Forms and Components that are Windows related and maxscript is only for 3d editing and manipulation for various things in the software. If it is too difficult for a beginner I hope you don't answer the fourth question as I don't have enough motivation and I want to keep the little I have. Note:   1. Sorry for my English, I am self taught and never used the language with native speakers so expect so errors.   2. I have a lot of questions regarding many things, what is the daily ratio you think for asking (number of questions) that would not bother the admins of the site and the members here. Thank you for your time.
