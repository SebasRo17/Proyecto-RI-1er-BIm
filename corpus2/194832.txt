I' creating a client server application in which I need to update a particular database. I'm using python with MySQL. There are two options: I use a client.py and server.py, the client.py can send data packed into JSON to the server, the server.py will handle the database and send query data back in the form of JSON. The second option is that there is no server.py file, instead the client accesses databases and queries directly with the MySQL server. Is there any benefits to using one method to another? **EDIT:** There can be atmost about 100 clients and they will be sending data throught the day with a delay of about about 20 seconds.
