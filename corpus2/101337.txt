The books and documentation on the MVC just heap on using the Stateful and Stateless terms. To be honest, i am just unable to grab the idea of it, what the books are talking about. They don't give an example to understand any of the either state, rather than just telling that HTTP is stateless and with ASP.NET MVC microsoft is going along with it. Am I missing some fundamental knowledge, as i can't understand what is stateful and why is stateful and same goes for stateless. A simple and short example that talks about a control like button or textbox can be simplify the understanding i suppose.
