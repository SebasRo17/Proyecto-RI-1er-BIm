I work on two internal, mission critical applications. Let's keep it simple and call them "Foo" and "Bar". Nobody outside of the company has ever heard of them - like I said, they're internal apps. Until now my jobtitle has just been "Software Developer". I've recently discovered that my jobtitle is being changed to "Foo and Bar Developer". I'm a little worried that, should I leave the company, I'll have trouble finding a new job because of my weird job title. My question is this: How important is my job title compared to everything else on my CV (or resume, if you're American)? Am I likely to be rejected by box- ticking HR people who don't realise that "Foo and Bar Developer" is the same as "Software Developer"? Thanks in advance.
