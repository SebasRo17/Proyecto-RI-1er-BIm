This seemingly tame solid gives _Mathematica_ (v9) a bit of a workout if you want to generate a good picture:               rinner[y_] = Sqrt[y];     router[y_] = 1;     RegionPlot3D[rinner[y]^2 <= x^2 + z^2 <= router[y]^2,        {x, -1, 1}, {z, -1, 1}, {y, 0, 1}, AxesLabel -> {x, y, z}, PlotPoints -> 100,        PlotStyle -> Opacity[.75], MeshFunctions -> {#3 &}, Mesh -> 5]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/srC2C.png) I kept increasing `PlotPoints` from 100 to 200 to 300 and things get pretty slow---without much of an improvement in the rendering of the choppy part of the region at the top. Bumping up `MaxRecursion` and `PerformanceGoal->"Quality"` didn't seem to help. I tried playing with variations like `PlotPoints->{100,100,300}` to get better results faster, and this leads to my two questions.   1. What else should I try? (I experimented with `RevolutionPlot3D`, but I want _solids_.)   2. Is it possible to tailor the placement of `PlotPoints` to a subset of either  (a) an axis (say, 10x more points in the $z$ direction, but pack them into $0.9\le z\le 1$?, or (b) a specific portion of the overall space (say, $x,y,z$ with $0.9^2\le x^2+y^2\le 1^2$ and $0.9\le z\le 1$, etc.)? Thanks for any insight.
