I want to call `Range[]` with its arguments depending on a condition. Say we have               checklength = {5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6}        I then want to call `Range[]` 13 times (the length of `checklength`) and do `Range[5]` when `checklength[[#]] == 5` and `Range[2, 6]` when `checklength[[#]] == 6`. `If[]` would seem an appropriate way to do it,               Range[If[checklength[[#]] == 5, 5, XXX]]& /@ Range[13]        but I don't know what to put for "XXX", since I need "2,6" there without any brackets. I've tried               Range[If[checklength[[#]]==5, 5, Flatten[{2,6}]]]& /@ Range[13]        but that doesn't help (in fact if you think about it, it shouldn't!). The problem is, I need an unbracketed pair of numbers to be treated as a single argument and I don't know how to do that. I can think of one quite messy solution,               Range[If[checklength[[#]] == 5, 1, 2], If[checklength[[#]] == 5, 5, 6]& /@ Range[13]        but I'd be disappointed if there's not a better way to do it. Even though this does the trick, the general question remains of how to treat unbracketed comma separated numbers as a single item.
