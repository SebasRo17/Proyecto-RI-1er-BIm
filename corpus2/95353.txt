I want to choose JavaScript as my main development field, alongside HTML and CSS to become a developer commonly known as **front-end developer**. But I don't know how to become a JavaScript professional. I've read many books and learned the pieces including data types, syntax, tools usage (like IDEs, Debuggers, etc.), jQuery, etc. But when I look at some sophisticated JavaScript codes including famous libraries, I'm like "I never could write that code". What's wrong here? What step should I had taken that I didn't? I feel I'm missing something here to become a professional JavaScript developer. I also watched training movies, including Douglas Crockford's movies at Yahoo Theater.
