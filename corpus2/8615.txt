# The Problem. I have a C++ class that does some computations, and returns a C++ vector object (the length of which can possibly vary with each run). I want to store each of these vectors as a list in _Mathematica_ , so, for instance, if three iterations returns the vectors `(0, 1)`, `(0.02, 0.9)` and `(0.04, 0.73)`, I want this output to be written into a _Mathematica_ list of the form `{{0,1},{0.02, 0.9},{0.04, 0.73}}`. # My limitations. This is the first time I am trying to mess with MathLink. Having spent all of today trying to get this to work, I'm feeling pretty lost. The documentation that has shipped with my _Mathematica_ distribution, is helpful only in that I know what to do to write most of the template file. But I can't quite understand how to finish it, and what to do next. # Operating System and other information I am on a Mac running Snow Leopard 10.6.8. _Mathematica_ is installed in the usual place: `/Applications/Mathematica.app` # Code First, what I believe are the relevant portions of the C++ code that I already have               #include<iostream>     #include<vector>     #include<deque>     #include<cmath>     // and a bunch of other files          class mp{               // stuff that defines the class     public:          // some functions     vector <long double> viewCurrent(); // returns the (t, x) vector for the current state of the                                         // system; note that x can be a vector itself          };      What I would like is to store the output of `mp::viewCurrent()` into _Mathematica_ lists. How do I do this?
