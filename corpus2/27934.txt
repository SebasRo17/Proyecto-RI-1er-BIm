R language has this function 'nextn' (link) which computes the next highly composite number greater than a given one, which is used to find the optimal padding size for the subsequent FFT operation. So I am looking for similar _Mathematica_ function               NextHighlyCompositeNumber[ n_Integer?Positive, primes:{__Integer?PrimeQ} ]      which will output the smallest number $m \geqslant n$ such that $m = p_1^{e_1} \cdots p_k^{e_k}$ for some non-negative exponents $e_k$. This seems to be a combinatorial search kind of problem, which could be solved using integer linear programming (if available).
