I am a project manager at my company. I work with a few teams of developers using a standard, well-known version control system known as CVS. I'd like to see continuous integration and automated builds implemented to help prevent problems with the build breaking and with bad deployments sneaking onto the production servers. I am sure I can set this up myself, but I don't want to do this myself for two reasons:   1. I don't have time for it. I have my own responsibilities, which involve marketing, communication to other stakeholders with team members not part of development, communicating with customers, and project planning.   2. Most importantly, I'm the project manager. My purpose is to provide leadership, not to micro-manage the development team. What are some things that I can do to find someone on the development team who would be passionate about setting this up? Is a developer the right person for this task, considering it requires knowledge of Java, Spring, and Google App Engine? What are some tips for helping to promote change where change is feared?
