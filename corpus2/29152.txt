I'm sure I'll be embarrassed by the answer, but I don't understand why I get the following result:               list = {{9, "b"}, {4, "a"}, {7, "k4"}, {6, "k3"}, {5, "w"}}        This works:               Sort[list]       (* {{4, "a"}, {5, "w"}, {6, "k3"}, {7, "k4"}, {9, "b"}}*)      This works:               Sort[list, #1[[1]] > #2[[1]] &]        (*{{9, "b"}, {7, "k4"}, {6, "k3"}, {5, "w"}, {4, "a"}}  *)      But this fails:               Sort[list, #1[[2]] < #2[[2]] &]        (*{{9, "b"}, {4, "a"}, {7, "k4"}, {6, "k3"}, {5, "w"}}*)      **Question:** Why would it work using `SortBy[]` and not `Sort[]`?
