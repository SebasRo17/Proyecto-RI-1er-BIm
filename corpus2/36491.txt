When talking with colleagues about software design and development principles, I've noticed one of the most common sources for analogies is the construction industry. We **build** software and we consider the design and structure to be the **architecture**. One of the best ways to learn (or teach) are through analyzing analogies - **what other analogies can be drawn from construction?** (whether already in common use in software or not). Please provide a description, or your personal experience, regarding how the programming concept is similar to the construction concept.
