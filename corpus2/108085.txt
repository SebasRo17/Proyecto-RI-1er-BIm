I have almost 9 years of IT experience of which 7 years was worked in an IT company. For past 2 years I have been stuck in a non-IT based company using outdated technology and methodologies. We don't follow any good practices nor do we upgrade to the latest technologies due to budgetary constraints. For a time, there was some amount of work to keep me active, but lately, there's just maintenance work for a product running on an old technology stack. So I'm looking to get out of this job and into one that's more my speed: using the latest technology, writing new things, and actually in the IT field. But I keep coming up short on interviews due to the last few years of being in a job that's behind the technology times. What can I do to prepare myself and prove to more cutting-edge companies that I'm up to the job?
