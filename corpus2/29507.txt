As you all know ASF quit the JCP and the things between them and Oracle are not going so smooth. Not only that, Oracle is cooking some enterprise level JVMs. With all of these happening, I think it proves that Java is moving to a more closed-source environment. I'm curious if this will affect all those apache projects built around Java, e.g. Tomcat, Ant, Maven, Derby, Jackrabbit, just to name a few. Will these projects be in danger of disappearing due to the conflicts revolving around Java? Why?
