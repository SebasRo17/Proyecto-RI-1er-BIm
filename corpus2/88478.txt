I have seen some developers use hosted scripts to link their libraries. `cdn.jquerytools.org` is one example. I have also seen people complain that a hosted script link has been hijacked. How safe is using hosted scripts in reality? Are the scripts automatically updated? For example, if jQuery 5 goes to 6 do I automatically get version 6 or do I need to update my link? I also see that Google has a large set of these scripts setup for hosting. What are the pros and cons?
