Well, I have a notebook with the built-in stylesheet Preprint, which I'd like to convert it to pdf. Everything works well except for the code cells(I use the shortcut key alt+8 to create cells of code style) with gray background. the code cell in the notebook looks like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/h1H5T.png) But, after saving my entire notebook to pdf, the gray background lost! This is a screen-shot of the same code cell above from my pdf viewer. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IeDyV.png) So, is there anyway to make the "code cell" in the exported pdf looks exactly the same as it is in the notebook? I mean, It should have gray background. Or am I missing something? Thank you.
