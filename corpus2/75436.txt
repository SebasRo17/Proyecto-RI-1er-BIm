Suppose I release some source code under the new BSD license. Is it allowed for someone else to take this code, make modifications to it and distribute it under the terms of the GPL? From Wikipedia: > _Many of the most common free software licenses, such as the original MIT/X > license, BSD licenses (in the current 2-clause form), and the LGPL, are > "GPL-compatible". That is, their code can be combined with a program under > the GPL without conflict (the new combination would have the GPL applied to > the whole). However, some free/open source software licenses are not GPL- > compatible._ I'm assuming this implies that one can relicense new-BSD licensed code to GPL?
