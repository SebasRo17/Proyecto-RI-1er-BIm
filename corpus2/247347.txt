Fact that now a days everyone is moving to cloud due to ease in scalability, configuration and maintenance. But my question is should we develop all web application scalable event if it is not required? If an application is low budget with no such special requirements then why we should add efforts to make it support sclability? There are many factors to consider while making application scalable. If client has no specific requirement, small application contains 3-4 modules, client budget is low and is using on premises servers. To make application scalable, we have to make sure of session, IO files, caching etc...
