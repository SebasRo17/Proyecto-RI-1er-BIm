I have a program for calculating a type of list.               ff[num_Integer] :=        Union[         Select[Subsets[Tuples[Range[2 num], {2}], {num}],            Sort @ Flatten @ # == Sort @ Range[2 num] &],          SameTest -> (Sort[Sort /@ #1] == Sort[Sort /@ #2] &)];      Now, the problem is that `ff[num_]` doesn't work on my computer when `num >= 5`. I would really like to get `ff[8]`, even `ff[10]`. How can I change this program to use a better method for producing these types of list?
