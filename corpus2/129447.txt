I’m looking to document my business’ overall system architecture. I want to capture what system/s everything starts in, what systems it flows into and why, and where everything ends up. As part of this I also want to identify the processes that allow the data to flow from one system to another including why and how. Being unfamiliar with documenting on this level, I really don’t know where to start. I want it to be easy to read but detailed as well. To give a little bit more information, I’m not really concerned with what happens to the data inside each system, just the inputs and outputs. How can I document this?
