I've been having quite a bit of trouble loading a package I wrote. I've followed the suggestions on related questions on this site, as well as on _Mathematica_ 's own pages, and still nothing has worked. This is my package code:               BeginPackage["errorpropagation`"]     (* General error propagation formula *)          fError::usage =        "Calculate the error in a function f[{x1,x2,...}] with uncertainties {dx1,dx2,...}."          Begin["`Private`"]          fError[f_, xi__, dx__] :=        Sum[(D[f[xi], xi[[i]]]*dx[[i]])^2, {i, 1, Length[xi]}]^(1/2);          fErrorTest[x_] := Module[{a = 3}, x^3 - a];          End[]          EndPackage[]      And then I try to load it as such:               << pathToFile/errorpropagation.m     g[{x_, y_}] := x^2 + x y;     fError[g, {x, y}, {dx, dy}]     fErrorTest[3]      I've tried different variants of whether the `<<` command takes a string or not, and relative and full path names, but had no success. The package has worked for me if I open it and evaluate the cells in the package, but the whole point of writing a package was to avoid manual evaluation every time.
