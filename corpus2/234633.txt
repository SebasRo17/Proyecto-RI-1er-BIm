We have an internal website that is written in javascript and jquery and is only used in with ie8. Everything is fine but after a certain time, screen flickering starts to occur when the mouse transitions between certain elements (which can be annoying for the users). I can't really put any code up because there is quite a lot but I just wondered if anyone might know what initiate this strange problem or have ever had similar issues!?!? The script makes 4 ajax calls on page load which dynamically loads content and is also within an iFrame. I have looked into a few possible sources, i.e, Memory issues/leaks, jquery/modal, timers, iFrames, but I just don't understand why it is not consistent?
