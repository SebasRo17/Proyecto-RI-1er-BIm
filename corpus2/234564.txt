We follow pair programming in our company and always face the issue of balanced and effective pair rotation within the developers on stories. We follow a simple metrics in which every developer's name is mapped with every other developer and we mark the respective intersection whenever two developers are pairing. This is not working out well, we cannot track how much time a pair has spent pairing and people forget to update the metrics many times. Tracking the pair rotation is helpful because we want the project knowledge to be shared across the team, and not just one pair. So usually what happens is, whoever is pairing keeps pairing till the entire story is completed (given they have better context), and no body else knows about what is being done & if the story or a regression/production bug comes back, the same pair has to pick it up (leaving whatever they are currently doing), which is what creates a bottleneck. Are there any known metrics that can be used for tracking the pair rotations.
