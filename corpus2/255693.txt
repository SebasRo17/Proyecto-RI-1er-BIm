I am amazed by the way Github integrates with different systems like Travis. They are separate companies, but yet Travis builds blend seamlessly everywhere in the Github interface. Yes, i am asking _mainly_ about integration on the user interface level, there is enough electronic ink around about service integration. Usually web interfaces get blended via embeds, like for Disqus. On Github however, seems like the interface parts related to Travis are rendered on the server side. Do they enforce a markup structure, or specific style sheets, or do they require to describe the interfaces with a domain specific language?
