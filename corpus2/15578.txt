I'm trying to put an inset on top of a graph, the inset is also a graph. I'm using `Inset` within `Epilog` and the following command line:               Epilog -> {Inset[coherenceLengthGraph, {12, 0.35}, {Automatic, Top}, 11]}      I've tried many things yet I cannot put the inset above the base graph. * * * I'm using Show to render two lists of different data on the same graph, after that -and within Show- I use Epilog. I looked at GraphicsColumn but I couldn't see how it allows things that one can do using Inset. Here's my code                pwaveGraph = Show[graphlistofKPPhaseBoundaries, graphKPBands,        Frame -> {True},        FrameLabel -> {"2Î¼m/\!\(\*SuperscriptBox[\(\[HBar]\), \     \(2\)]\)", "" }, PlotRange -> {{-2, 18.05}, {-1.05, 1.05}},        FrameTicks -> {Automatic, {-1, 0, 1}},         Epilog -> {Inset[           coherenceLengthGraph, {12, 0.35}, {Automatic, Top}, 11]}];
