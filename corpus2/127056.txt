Since I don't have much practical experience and I'm not studiing computer science directly (rather multimedia focused programming) I really would like to know how good (and maybe how old) People are before they are taking their Jobs. Coming from Germany, it is not unusual to know little to nothing really useful (practically) when done with study. You just prove you're generally capable of leaning things and learn the real stuff after University. Or does that differ in Computer Science? Or to put it in another Question: Is the average computer-science first time employee capable to program serious things?
