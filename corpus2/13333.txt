If I type               ?CycleIndex      I get > Information::notfound: Symbol CycleIndex not found. >> If I then type               Needs["Combinatorica`"]      I get > General::compat: Combinatorica Graph and Permutations functionality has been > superseded by preloaded functionaliy. The package now being loaded may > conflict with this. Please see the Compatibility Guide for details. Is there any good way to get the functionality I need without causing a conflict? The warning is somewhat strong and suggests nonspecific breakdowns further down the line...
