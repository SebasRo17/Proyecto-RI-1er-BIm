I am currently teaching some students about the "point at infinity", and how it allows us to treat circles and lines as "the same", etc. I would like to kind of _show_ this happening with a series of three images:   1. The usual, $x$-$y$ plane plot of some function (say $y=x^3$)   2. That plot, on the surface of an **incomplete** sphere: that is, a sphere with a disk removed (the gluing isn't finished yet).   3. The plot on a complete sphere (bonus points if the ends of the cubic join together!) Now, I have been playing with `Texture` for the last 90min or so, and while I think I can eventually get it to do what I want for step 3., I don't see how to get it to work for step 2. The problem is, when I do an incomplete sphere (I have been using a RegionFunction), the Texture is distorted by this. In fact, the distortion is quite nasty (I am always completely confused by TextureCoordinates). Is there a way to do this in a nice way? I am open to any suggestions! **EDIT** : here is a picture of what I mean by "incomplete sphere": ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2LD9A.jpg) **2nd EDIT** : here is a picture of what I had in mind (for step 3 anyway): ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Jr6PU.jpg) Code:               SphericalPlot3D[1, {theta, 0, Pi}, {phi, 0, 2 Pi},  PlotStyle -> Texture[p],              TextureCoordinateFunction -> ({#5, 1 - #4} &), Lighting -> "Neutral",             Mesh -> None, Axes -> False, Boxed -> False]      **3rd EDIT** : Sorry for the confusion, and multiple edits! When I say "that plot" on the surface of a sphere, I mean the graph, the axes, the tick marks, everything.
