Like anything in life, what you don't know doesn't help you and as a new developer, I know that the more I learn about the different .NET classes out there and their uses, the more I have in my toolbox. However, sort of like an ocean where you just not sure where to start, I thought I would asked the community, does anyone know:   * any recommendations on breaking down a .NET library per class (or smaller), where to start?   * A site that might do just that per article/blog Or any other recommendations on making it a regular (i.e. daily/weekly) practice to learn a new class in .NET? Which Library to start with...etc? **NOTE** : I read allot or regularly, but I thought an effort geared directly at learning about a new class and its uses on a regularly bases would help. Thanks,
