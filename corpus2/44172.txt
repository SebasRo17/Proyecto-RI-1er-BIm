As a new Mathematica user I have been grappling with many aspects of its powerful capabilities but am now beginning the find the front end very disappointing in a number of respects.   * Lack of multiple level undo (yes, I've just signed the petition and posted in the Wolfram community site on this)   * Global effect of "Replace All" in the "Find and Replace" dialog   * Weak IDE-like debugging capabilities (I will investigate DebugTrace later; I know Workbench could help but I resent the current â‚¬120 cost for what I believe should probably be core capabilities) (Rhetorical?) How do sophisticated and heavy users manage? The specific immediate question however is: does anybody have a viable approach/solution/workaround to undo/redo for (limited scope) _input cell edits_? I'm still amazed by what Mma can do, but what it can't do is becoming increasingly baffling.
