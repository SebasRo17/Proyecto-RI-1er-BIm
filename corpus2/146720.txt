I do not know too many things about databases, so a lot of questions concerning architecture came up lately. Two of these things are:   1. If I have a table with a lot of entries(millions probably), how can I make the `select` queries faster? I thought about sorting the table alphabetically and then splitting it in two, but that doesn't seem to make things easier for me. Do you have any suggestions?   2. I have a table _user_ and one _message_. In _message_ I should have `sender_id` and `receiver_id`. From what I know, I can't make them both _foreign keys_ for _user_ , so I have to pick one of them. Doesn't this, however, lead to data inconsistency(which, as far as I know, is bad)? What is the right approach here? I do not think that it matters, but I use MySQL 5.5.
