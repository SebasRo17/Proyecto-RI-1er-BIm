I am working with a library that needs input in a Fixed Point notation. I’d like to figure out a way to convert the floating point results into fixed point representation. The fixed point length is 16 bit. Numbers can be represented with a variable number of bits and I can specify the format of the bits. For instance, I can represent a number as Signed[3.13], upto 3 bits are used to represent the integer portion, and 13 bits are used for the fraction (resolution of 2^-13). Q1. What is the best method to convert Mathematica floating point output into a 16 bit number. Ideally, I’d like a function like:               f[x_, signbits_, integerbits_, fractionbits_]      Q2. Given a set of numbers, what is the best method to determine the ideal number of integer bits and fractional bits used for the representation in order to minimize truncation errors               data = {0.0000618365, 0.0000701533, -0.0000747471, 0.0000595436, 0.0000705533, \     0.0000728675, 0.0000711056, 0.0000684559, 0.0000753624, -0.0000557638}
