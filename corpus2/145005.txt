I have a paid application on the android marketplace, however, I want to release a free ad-supported version. The easiest way I thought to do this was to set up a branch on my subversion repository that has the additional code to add the ads. However, when I went to submit this to the android marketplace, they require unique package names. This solution no longer works for me because I'd have to change the package of every class file, which would make merging the trunk and branch very painful. What is the best way I can keep these two projects together, sharing patches, but with a different package?
