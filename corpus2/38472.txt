I use _Mathematica_ a little bit. I try to understand it, but it is hard I have a list of 5 numbers selected randomly from 0 and -1. I have to replace a 0 with a 1 when the 0 is followed by -1. My wrong solution is:               list = RandomInteger[{-1, 0}, 5]      (* {0, 0, 0, -1, 0} *)          list /. x_ /; x == 0 -> 1     (* {1, 1, 1, -1, 1} *)      I need get: `{0, 0, 1, -1, 0}`. How do I manipulate a list to change the previous element if the next element is -1?
