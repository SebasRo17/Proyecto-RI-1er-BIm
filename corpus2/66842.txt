I've been meaning to read the SICP book for a while, and am finally about to get around to it (now that I can read it on Kindle :) I'd like to learn a functional language, and I use C# at work so thought it might be a good idea to go through the book with F# in my mind rather than Scheme. (That is, do the exercises in F#.) I wonder though, will there be much mental disjoint between Scheme and F#? Maybe it's better to go through with Scheme on the first pass?
