There are some names, where if you find yourself reaching for those names, you know you've already messed something up. For example: **XxxManager**   This is bad because a class should describe what the class does. If the most specific word you can come up with for what the class does is "manage," then the class is too big. What other naming anti-patterns exist? **EDIT** : To clarify, I'm not asking "what names are bad" -- that question is entirely subjective and there's no way to answer it. I'm asking, "what names indicate overall design problems with the system." That is, if you find yourself wanting to call a component Xyz, that probably indicates the component is ill concieved. Also note here that there are exceptions to every rule -- I'm just looking for warning flags for when I really need to stop and rethink a design.
