For example I have this matrix:               mk = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}}      and I'd like it to multiple with this:               ot = Table[5, {4}]      > >     {5,5,5,5} >   to get this one:               {{{ 5, 5, 5, 5}, {10,10,10,10}, {15,15,15}},       {{20,20,20,20}, {25,25 ...}...}...}      but `KroneckerProduct` gives me `3` rows instead of a `3 x 3 x 4` matrix (similar but not identical). Of course I have really large lists...               KroneckerProduct[mk, ot]      > >     {{5, 5, 5, 5, 10, 10, 10, 10, 15, 15, 15, 15}, >      {20, 20, 20, 20, 25, 25, 25, 25, 30, 30, 30, 30}, >      {35, 35, 35, 35, 40, 40, 40, 40, 45, 45, 45, 45}} >
