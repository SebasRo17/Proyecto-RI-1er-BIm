> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  How do I create my own programming language and a compiler for it I want to create a new general purpose language that will compile to JavaScript and I'd like to be able to write it in that same JavaScript. I wouldn't go much into detail about why, but how can I do it? Currently I have professionally coded in JS, Java, Groovy, PL/SQL, PHP among the rest, so I'm covered on the language user side of the story, but I have no theoretical or practical knowledge from the create language side. I have browsed the web for the past week and noticed a soup of acronyms and/or names like RR, LALR, BNF, AST etc. so I figure I need two things:   * Good Book(s) about theory   * Working projects or experiments that I can use to jump start my learning (something free like that narcissus) EDIT: No, this question does not cover the EXACTLY SAME content and it is not on the same topic even worse, even though there are two good answers, they don't answer how I can practically USE JS TO BUILD THE TOOLS (JS TRANSPILER) I NEED FOR THE NEW LANGUAGE. Any ideas?
