I'm a Java developer and in need of a CMS. I've spent a lot of time reading about, and tinkering with Liferay but am concerned that it doesn't cover two of my **three major concerns**   * I need to have many sites with individual domains   * HTML/CSS designers need to be able to design the website templates, look and feel, and layouts in their own tools without having to worry about writing scripts   * Site and page building APIs must be understandable so that a custom builder interface can be created and harness the CMS as opposed to hacking it Liferay nails the first bullet point, but the second two appear to be unsolved. Does anyone have experience with a Java CMS that does all three? Or have any idea how to approach the problem if none exists? Has someone has used a Java CMS and has been able to add this functionality give some insight?
