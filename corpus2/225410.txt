I'm searching an algorithm to store my data (which are moving objects' coordinates) and allow me to query objects within a specific radius of a specific point. I came up with R* Tree which is said as good solution for geographical data, but as I studied further, R* Tree stored data in secondary memory and its data mostly don't change over time. But my data is updated per second, so if I implement R* Tree, the insert and delete part of the algorithm will be called many time. Is R* tree is suitable for my case or not? If it isn't, can anyone suggest me a better algorithm?
