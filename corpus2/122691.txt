I'm learning CSS "seriously" for the first time, but I've found that the way you deal with multiple CSS classes in CSS and HTML quite inconsistent. For example, I learned that if I want to declare multiple CSS classes with a common style applied to them, I write:               .style1, .style2, .style3 {        color: red;     }      Then, if I want to declare an HTML tag that has multiple classes applied to it, I write:               <div class="style1 style2 style3"></div>      And I'm asking why? From my personal point of view it would be more consistent if both could be declared by using a comma to separate each class, or if both could be declared using a space; after all IMHO we're still talking about multiple classes, in both CSS and HTML. I think that it would make more sense if I could write this to declare a `div` with multiple classes applied:               <div class="style1, style2, style3"></div>      Am I'm missing something important? Could you explain me if there's a valid reason behind these two different syntaxes?
