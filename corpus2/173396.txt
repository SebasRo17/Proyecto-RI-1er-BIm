In the JavaDoc for `X509Certificate` `getSubjectDN()` it states: > **Denigrated** , replaced by getSubjectX500Principal(). I am used to seeing Deprecated in the for methods that should not be used any longer, but not Denigrated. I found a bug report about this particular case where it was closed with comment: > This isn't a bug. "Deprecated" is meant to be used only in serious cases. When we are using a method that is _Deprecated_ , the general suggested action is to stop using the method. So what is the suggested action when a method is marked as _Denigrated_?
