Unfortunately, some data can only be obtained in picture form (Japanese publications anyone?). Since this cannot be worked with, it has to be converted to a dataset that can; I was wondering whether this could be done in Mathematica. Consider the following example image: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wdTu4.png) The task consists of two steps:   1. Extract a point set from the graph   2. Finding a function that takes out the distortion and applying it to the data set Is there some streamlined way of doing this in Mathematica? The result should be a point set that is as accurate as possible, think of something whose `Interpolation` could be easily and accurately ploted. Bonus points for no _Get Coordinates_ to trace the graph. Here's the code used to generate the image above:               img = ImagePerspectiveTransformation[         Rasterize[             Plot[x^((x - 2)^2 E^-x) + E^-x, {x, 0, 10}, PlotStyle -> Thick],             ImageSize -> 400         ],         {{1, 0.1`, 0}, {0.1`, 1, 0}, {0, 0.1`, 1}},         Padding -> White     ]
