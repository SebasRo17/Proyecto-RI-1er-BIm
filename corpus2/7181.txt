I have been using mysql for the same amount of time I have been using PHP. However I feel about 10x more confident in PHP; or any other programming language. But I just can't seem to really really grasp SQL. I mean, I can select, update, insert, delete, join, etc. but when it comes to more complex stuff I am lost. How to write a more complicated select statement, how to use indexes properly, which engine to use, etc. For some reason I really find the mysql docs hard to follow, but the php ones easy to follow. I am starting to think that maybe my brain is just wired in a way that makes programming make since but sql confusing. I don't know. Most people think Regex is so confusing but to me it makes more scientific sense than how to construct an sql statement. Please don't get me wrong, I am not hating on SQL, I really like it, I just want to understand it better. Whats the best/fastest way to really master MySQL? When I say "master" I don't mean the guru among gurus, I mean smart enough to figure out most of the questions I ask on SO myself without needing help.
