I'm trying to create a simple graph from a matrix and then highlight a particular subgraph. My code (simplified from a bigger task) is as follows. I keep getting the "Subgraph::graph: A graph object is expected at position 1" message whenever I try to use Subgraph (or HighlightGraph). What might I be doing wrong? Thanks in advance for the help.               << Combinatorica`      > General::compat: Combinatorica Graph and Permutations functionality has been > superseded by preloaded functionality.
