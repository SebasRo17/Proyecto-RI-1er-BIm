It seems alot of times on stackoverflow, that people (programmers especially) tend to over complicate a solution to a problem to where the solution is vastly much more complicated then the original problem? Im not an expert by any means, but alot of times I try to go with the simplest solution that works (and obviously this doesn't work EVERYWHERE) but i've had pretty good success with suggesting simple solutions on the job that people seem to overlook for MUCH more complicated solutions? Is this like a normal thing for programmers.....or am I just not thinking in the correct perpective.
