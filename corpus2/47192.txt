Let's say I have the following animation:               Animate[ParametricPlot[{Cos[a t], Sin[a t]}, {t, 0, 1}], {a, 0,        2Pi}, AnimationRate -> 0.1]      Is there a way to somehow zoom into the moving point of the animated plot at a preselected xy-coordinate or time; such as being able to zoom into the animated moving point after 3 seconds or when the moving point reaches {x,y}={-1,0}? Any help would be appreciated.
