During the meeting, each team member answers three questions:   1. What have you done since yesterday?   2. What are you planning to do today?   3. Any impediments/stumbling blocks? Any impediment/stumbling block identified in this meeting is documented by the Scrum Master and worked towards resolution outside of this meeting. No detailed discussions shall happen in this meeting. In the last question, it states that "Any impediment/stumbling block identified in this meeting is documented and worked towards resolution outside of this meeting". From my experience, just about every "impediment" results to slippage. So how would you, the average Scrum Master respond to such slippage? Do you assume that only a day slippage in a two or three week sprint is normal and hope for the best? Do you assume that a three day slippage is reason to assign help? What would 'your' tolerance level for slippage normally be? Do you have a formula you stick to (ie: if the slippage is 20% late you automatically assign someone to help)? I'd just like to get a better understanding of this third rule.
