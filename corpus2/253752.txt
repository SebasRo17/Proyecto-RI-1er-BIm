Consider I am going to write a simple file based logger `AppLogger` to be used in my apps, ideally it should be a singleton so I can call it via               public class AppLogger {         public static String file = "..";              public void logToFile() {             // Write to file         }              public static log(String s) {             AppLogger.getInstance().logToFile(s);         }     }      And to use it               AppLogger::log("This is a log statement");      The problem is, what is the best time I should provide the value of file since it is a just a singleton? Or how to refactor the above code (or skip using singleton) so I can customize the log file path? (Assume I don't need to write to multiple at the same time) p.s. I know I can use library e.g. log4j, but consider it is just a design question, how to refactor the code above?
