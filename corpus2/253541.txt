When working with the 3-layer model, where should the validation code be placed? for: not empty fields, unchecked options, null values, wrong-written dates, etc. To keep total isolation between a form (UI layer) and the business rules, this validation should belong to BLL? It's the only work for the UI: grab user data input, without **any** care of verifying, and just send it to next layer.   For example, It's an empty username field, really breaking a business rule, or the BLL doesn't even need to care about getting empty values, sure, UI takes care. Could be this shallow validation, considered as an actual BL rule, or is enough handle it on UI layer?
