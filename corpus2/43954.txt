How do I change the default precision in Mathematica? Somehow the setting has been changed to 1 digit, so if I type               Timing[...]      I get > {1., ...} which is not very enlightening. Similarly,               N[Pi]      is > 3. Compare Mathematica's documentation for Numerical Precision which says of the above command "In standard output form, Mathematica prints a number like this to six digits." So something isn't right with my setup. I read the guide to numerical precision but it didn't appear to address this issue. Note that I do _not_ want to change `WorkingPrecision` or `PrecisionGoal` on a particular function,but just change the default setting. (Of course I'll have to adjust these in some cases, but I just want to have a sensible starting point.)
