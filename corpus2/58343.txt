I'm trying to evaluate the partial derivatives of some function `F[x,y]` at some point, i.e.               Limit[Limit[D[F[x,y],{x,m},{y,n}],x->x0],y->y0]      However, for higher derivatives I find that it fails to evaluate the limit. On the other hand, if I use the `Series` function               Series[F[x,y],{x,x0,m},{y,y0,n}]      It produces all the coefficients with no problem. My question is what is the difference between the two methods? what is `Series` assuming that I'm missing when I do it manually with the derivatives?
