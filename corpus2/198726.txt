I am just moving into freelancing (my primary sector will be web design / web development). I've got a few projects for friends as well as one or two 'professional' projects in the pipeline. I would like to know what are some of the most important things you need to hear from your client before you start the process of developing their website: Some examples I can think of are:   1. Wishlist of website functionality (contact forms / specific pages etc)   2. Whether they have an existing Google Analytics account   3. Any other tracking stuff   4. Legacy code that needs to be integrated   5. Desired aesthetics of the website   6. SEO discussion So yes, I'd really like to know what you think are the most important things to discuss and ascertain from a client before you begin development.
