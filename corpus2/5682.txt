Does `DisplayFunction->Identity` do anything at all in Mathematica 8? In the third edition of _Programming in Mathematica_ , Roman Maeder gives the following explanation: > The option setting `DisplayFunction->Identity` causes the graphics functions > `Plot[]`, `Plot3D[]`, `ParametricPlot[]`, and so on to generate the graphics > in the normal way, but not to render the images. We use it if we want to > manipulate the graphics further. Afterwards, we can render the images with > `Show[graphics,DisplayFunction->$DisplayFunction]`. He is referring to the following piece of code:               z = x + I y;     cz = {Re[z], Im[z]};     vlines = Table[ N[cz], {x, -Pi/2, Pi/2, Pi/12} ];     vg = ParametricPlot[ Evaluate[vlines], {y, -1, 1}, DisplayFunction -> Identity ][[1]]      `SameQ` tells me that even without `DisplayFunction->Identity`, I will still get the same result for `vg`. Is Maeder's precaution no longer necessary in Mathematica 8?
