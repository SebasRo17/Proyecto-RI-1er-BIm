I have taken sequential partial derivatives of a two variable polynomial fraction, resulting in a very long series of polynomials of form:               C*x^i*y^j/(some product series of (1-x^k*y)^n)      What I wish to do is a series of basic truncations. First, I eliminate all polynomials that have `x^i*y^j` with `i` or `j > 4` in the numerator. I keep looking over the documentation and StackExchange and cannot find anything that works for me. I am open to suggestions. Edit: Thus far, I have merely sorted the long series, and picked out the valid fractions starting from the bottom. What is the solution that uses Mathematica functions?
