Let's take this first example of a 2D output:               sol = DSolve[             {y''[t] + y'[t] + y[t] == 3 Sin[t] - 4 Cos[t],               y[0] == a, y'[0] == 0},              y[t], t           ];     toplot = Table[ sol[[1, 1, 2]] /. a -> i, {i, 0, 3, 0.5}];     Plot[Tooltip[toplot], {t, 0, 2 \[Pi]}]       How can I visualize these solutions with a 3-D output like the ones obtainable by ListSurfacePlot3D , the independant variable (a) of my example being the 3d coordinate? Here I would like to see 7 parallel curves. Also another example this time for a system of two differential equations:               sol = DSolve[             {x'[t] == x[t]/8 - y[t]  ,              y'[t] == x[t]   + y[t]/8,               x[0] == 0,              y[0] == 1},              {x[t], y[t]}, t           ];     ParametricPlot[{x[t], y[t]} /. sol, {t, -2 \[Pi], 2 \[Pi]}]      How can I get a 3D output of these solutions, the 3d coordinate being the variable t (and I expect to get a helix)? Thanks
