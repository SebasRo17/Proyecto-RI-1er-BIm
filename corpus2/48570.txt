Just try this example:               Export["a.txt", "这乱码问题该怎么解决呢\n***\n怎么解决嘛"]     ReadList["a.txt", Record]      > >     {"è¿ä¹\[PlusMinus]ç é®é¢è¯¥æä¹è§£å\.b3å¢", "***", "æä¹è§£å\.b3å"} >   I know `Import` can handle it correctly:               StringSplit@Import["a.txt"]      > >     {"这乱码问题该怎么解决呢", "***", "怎么解决嘛"} >   But `ReadList` is generally much faster, right? Well, after scanning this post and the links inside it I noticed that _Mathematica_ may be just not good at this, but still want to make sure if it's not possible.
