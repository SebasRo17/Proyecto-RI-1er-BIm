I have following code               Animate[     Plot[myvariable x,{x,0,100}     ],     {myvariable,0.1,1},AnimationRunning->If[myvariable==1,False,True]     ]      How do I make the animation stop automatically when reaching a defined value? NOTE: I tried to make it stop by evaluating myvariable in a If expression, but I get the error " _An unrecognized option name ("AnimationRunning") was encountered while reading a AnimatorBox._ "
