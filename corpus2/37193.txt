Can someone show me how to find the limit of a complex function? Example:               z1 = 3 + 4*I          some_function[z] = z * z1      Set-up:               Limit[some_function[z],z->z1]      The result should be > >     (4*I + 3)*z >   but I get > >     Limit[some_function[z], z -> 3 + 4 I] >   What am I doing wrong? I tried to search in google and in the help files in the section about complex analysis. Thank you for your attention.
