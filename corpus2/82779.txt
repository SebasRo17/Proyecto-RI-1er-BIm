I'm just getting started in Android development and am working on a few small "practice" apps. As an example, one is a live wallpaper. The others are similar in terms of development effort. When these apps are done I would like to list them in the market. I may list them for free (or maybe not), and they're simple apps, but if things go smoothly I may try to build and sell larger and more ambitious projects in the future. My question is **is it wise to sell apps in the Android Market under my own name?** Looking around in the market, it seems almost everyone is selling under a company name, even if they're only a 1-2 man shop. I can definitely see the advantage of creating a company to sell my apps if they were big apps involving a team of people. But it seems like overkill to create a company, even if just in name and identity, just to list something like a live wallpaper. On the other hand, I don't want to expose myself to legal liability or other potential problems that I haven't foreseen. What's the best course of action here? For purposes of legal jurisdiction, I am in the United States. I understand that you are not my lawyer and answers are not legal advice. **Edit for clarification:** Just to be clear, what I want to ask is less about the advantages of forming a company, and more about potential dangers of _not_ forming one. In other words, are there likely to be situations where I'm beating myself up and saying "Oh, if only I had formed a company instead of listing this is as a personal project!".
