We are starting a new project with a new customer. We have a legacy application circa 1997 that we are planning on using to satisfy the customer's business requirements. I have been on the fence as to whether this is really the right course both for our company, and for the customer. I don't want to rewrite the app for no reason, but I feel that this older technology MFC, VC6 - has outlived its usefulness. If I am honest with myself - I don't want to spend any more of my career on the legacy app either. To that end, I have justified to myself that I should present to management a plan to develop a new, fresh solution based on current methodologies. 1) Am I wrong for doing thinking this is a good idea. 2) If not - how can I sell it to the business. There are definite advantages from the ongoing support perspective for the customer (more people with skill-sets in newer technologies - which in this case would probably be .NET with an XML or Lua based configuration) I'll be happy to answer any follow-on questions to clarify my intent.
