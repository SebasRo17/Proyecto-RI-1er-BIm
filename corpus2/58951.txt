The following plot (A)                ListLinePlot[{0,1,2,3},ColorFunction->"TemperatureMap"]      goes from blue to read. The following plot (B)               ListLinePlot[{4,5,6,7},ColorFunction->"TemperatureMap"]      goes also from blue to read. I want the colors to be correlated to the number to be plotted, not the position in the list (as above). Therefore I would like (A) to go from white to yellow (approx.) and (B) from yellow to red (approx.). How can I make the color to be correlated with the value of the number to be plotted and not the position in the list?
