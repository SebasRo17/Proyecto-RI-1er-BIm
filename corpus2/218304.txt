I have been asked to create a web service that communicates with Auth.NET CIM and Shipsurance API. My web service will be used by multiple applications (one a desktop and another a web application). I am confused whether I should build a WCF or an asmx web service. Auth.NET CIM and Shipsurance API have asmx web services which I would be calling in my newly created web service. So is WCF the right approach or can I stay with asmx?
