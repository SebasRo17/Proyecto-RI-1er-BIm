I'm talking the kind of search that auto-suggests your query as you type, the way Google does, the way Wikipedia does, the way Stack Exchange suggests other questions as you type the title, etc. And Wikipedia used to have an _awful_ search implementation, for those of us who remember. It had no auto-suggest, was shut down by the slightest typo or misspelling, and rarely gave pertinent results. As an amateur web programmer, I'm trying to figure out how I would implement an effective and high-performing search-and-auto-suggest as Wikipedia now has, and as SE has, and as so many other websites have. How can you obtain that kind of incredibly fast performance and flexibility? Does everyone just wing it, or are there principles, guidelines, helpful libraries, or other such resources to help you get it done right in the style of the "Internet of the Future"?
