For finding location of spikes in a time series I used to transform the data into wavelet space using               DiscreteWaveletPacketTransform [ data, filter, 0]       and then shrink the basis using the universal threshold in Mathematica version 7 and now every single command, corresponding to wavelets, is changed in version 8. Is there anybody who can tell me how can I do in version 8 again? I guess I need to use `WaveletBestBasis` command, but how?
