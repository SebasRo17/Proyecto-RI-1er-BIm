From SVN 1.5, it supports reintegrate feature. I wonder when I should reintegrate. Should it be done before release or after release? If I do it **Before release**   * Pro: It is not forgettable to merge with trunk.   * Con: Merged version can be different from QAed version. **After release**   * Pro: Releasing version is same with QAed version.   * Con: Some feature from trunk can be missed. So, when do you reintegrate?
