Some people have the view of programming that it is just repetitive typing on a keyboard. None of this is true. First of all, there is so much more you have to do than actually typing down the code, such as design architecture and so on. Secondly, it could be a greatly varying, non-repetitive task, with new challenges coming all the time. How should you explain that programming is _not_ a repetitive task to **non- programmers**?
