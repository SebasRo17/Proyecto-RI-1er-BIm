Say I have an expression (call it expr) involving a function, f[x]. I'd like to be able to evaluate that for a particular choice of f[x] without setting that choice for the whole session. I thought to do this using a replacement,               expr /. f[x_]->x^2      (where expr is some expression involving f[x] and I want to set f to x^2), but this doesn't work on derivatives, e.g., if expr contains f'[x] then it will stay as f'[x] rather than become 2x. What's the best solution to this problem?
