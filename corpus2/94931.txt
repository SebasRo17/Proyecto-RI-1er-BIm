I wonder if PKUFFT is Chinese algorithm/library and is it really better than FFTW, MKL ? Thank you Edit: I will elaborate. My personal programmers interest is in fast parallel algorithms like FFTW3, which was my favorite until I stumbled upon chinese claim of superior run with PKUFFT. It is on google, if you search for FFTW3, Intel MKL, GPU and things. I dont know anything about this library, but I would be very interested to learn. I can guess PKU stands for Peking Univ. There is nothing on web except presentation and mentioning of some commonly available hardware (GPU, infiniband, etc.). everything, including compilers was available for years. The improvement of 2000% is significant. The news are 1 year old. But no details about algorithm itself. It will be interesting to know if there is genuine discovery in algebra, or just technical effect with unfair advantage of knowing specific platform better than competing teams.
