I'm not sure if this is an acceptable question, but compiler-os-design-where- to-start was, so I figured that I'd take a shot at it. I have taken no formal Computer Science classes. I have programmed in Python and attempted C# without success. My technical vocabulary is expansive, yet scattered over a very wide range of computer science topics. I have a very long way to go before I can get to a level where I could reasonably read a book about compiler design/theory. **I am asking what steps I need to take before attempting compiler design.** I have some examples here already:   * Computer architecture   * Binary   * How booting/kernels/OSes work   * Imperative vs. Comparative language design   * "Grammars" At least these are some examples of what I've seen. Edit: I can't for the life of me see how this problem is unclear. I quite clearly bolded what I was asking. I was expecting it to be marked as biased, vague/broad, or too generalized, but certainly not unclear. Don't be afraid to say it's unconstructive (just make sure whatever it is classified under is accurate).
