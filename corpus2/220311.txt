My work place suffers from a bad case of the Pokemon Exception Handling anti- pattern with constructs like the following splattered across the code base:               try {         ...     } catch (Exception ex) {         // Log and pretend nothing happened.         Log.LogException(ex);             }      I've found lots of answers on Stack Exchange sites that explains why the above is bad. But I haven't found any _authoritative_ sources, like books, developer journal articles or msdn pages explaining why you shouldn't write code like the above. Are there any sources like that, if so, where? **Edit** : I'd say that "famous" bloggers also count as authoritative sources. My rule for what counts as authoritative or not is not exactly set in stone.
