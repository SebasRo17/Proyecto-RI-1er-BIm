Some time ago I have read two different books and each of them gives totally different answer for the question if it is a good pattern to define constant values in the interface (in java). So I am curious of your opinions with some reasonable arguments. Is it a good habit/ pattern to define constant values in interfaces in java? Is it generally good, generally bad or it depends?
