I've recently had the misfortune of hiring a developer who failed to deliver a **working** product by the arranged date. I have the software, but it produces errors on installation. The developer said the product works. I had wanted to give the developer the benefit of the doubt, but they have ignored all requests to show me a working demo. I set up a website specifically so that they could install the software, but they have done nothing (it should be a matter of uploading the zip and changing a few things in the configuration). They have also ignored all requests for information on their configuration. Actually it is really difficult to get any reply from them at all. It is almost 1.5 months after the deadline. **Possible ideas**   * Have a third party check the software.    * Put in a claim with Paypal (although I think it is too late and isn't covered anyway).   * Make it public (I'm assuming it isn't defamation because it is true). **QUESTION:** What should I do (or not do) about this? **EXTRA**   * I've noticed that even if the software was to work there are a number of features that I requested (prior to their acceptance of the job) that they have ignored.   * I've found comments on the web about the company saying that this situation is normal for them. They seem to use errors in their software as an excuse to extort more money from their clients. Actually this was a relief as it backed up my belief that I'd been scammed.   * They don't have a phone number on their website.    * The developer is based in the US. **EDIT:** The arrangement was that I paid 25% of the cost of the development. The developer would keep all rights for the product. The product was integrating an already existing open source component with a CMS. I produced icons and did the styling for part of the component (completed). The developer would have the component done with the features I requested by mid December. **EDIT2:** The developer said that they would be able to provide all the features I requested. **EDIT3:** There is no documentation with the software.
