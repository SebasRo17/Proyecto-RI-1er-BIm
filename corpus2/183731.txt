I have the following sample question for a compilers exam and wanted to check my solution.               Convert the following grammar into an LL(1) grammar which recognises the same      language:          E -> E + T       E -> T       T -> id      T -> id()      T -> id(L)      L -> E;L      L -> E      For my answer I have               E  -> T E'       E' -> + T | ε       T  -> id      T  -> id()      T  -> id(L)      L  -> E L'      L' -> ;E | ε      Can anybody verify the answer? **Edit** Ok so would it be similar to...               E  -> T E'       E' -> + E | ε       T  -> id      T  -> id()      T  -> id(L)      L  -> E L'      L' -> ;E | ε
