I have less than 6 months to learn mathematics for my Master course in CS. (With no prior formal education in any computer/mathematics related area.) So I need to prepare my self to be tested on math as it relates to computer science. As I found in Wikipedia, mathematics has many branches. Which ones are the most important for a programmer?   * Arithmetic   * Algebra (elementary, linear, multilinear, abstract)   * Geometry (discrete, algebraic, differential)   * Calculus/Analysis   * Set theory   * Logic   * Category theory   * Number theory   * Combinatorics   * Graph theory   * Topology   * Lie theory   * Differential equations/Dynamical systems   * Mathematical physics   * Numerical analysis   * Computation   * Information theory   * Probability   * Statistics   * Optimization   * Control theory   * Game theory
