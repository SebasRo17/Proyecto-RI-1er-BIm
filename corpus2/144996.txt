Let me start this out by saying I've been a asp.net web forms developer for a while now and that I understand mvc is a new way of doing things. As I'm learning mvc and going through tutorials and training videos, I have questions that these tutorials don't address. This is my attempt to address them here... I started a new project with the new internet application template in Visual Studio. I'm looking around the project trying to wrap my head around the mvc paradigm and I notice there is a Home and an About page. In the views, there is a file for each of these two pages. That makes sense. But why do they share the same controller? I think it would make sense if I had several screens that edit/view/delete the same data table, but the home and the about page don't necessarily have anything to do with each other. Does this mean if I create other pages that don't need a full blown controller (like a sitemap or something), I should just stick their views in the "Home" views folder? It just doesn't seem right. I know this basic stuff isn't that big of a deal, but this is the type of stuff that bugs the hell out of me. Thanks in advance for the clarification!
