I have drawn a triangle using `Line` graphics primitive and `Graphics3D` function:                Graphics3D[Line[{{1, 0, 0}, {0, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 1}, {1, 0, 0}}],       Axes -> False, Boxed -> True, AspectRatio -> 1]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1TS7y.png) But in the shape I get, the vertices of triangle do not coincide with the vertices of the box, how can I solve this problem?
