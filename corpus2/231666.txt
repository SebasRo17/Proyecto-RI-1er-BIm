My professor made a comment today - "...They've been having trouble with filesystem performance, and since they're more graphics guys, they asked us systems guys to help out...". What exactly is "computer systems"? What does it mean to be a "systems guy"? And, what is a "systems guy" passionate about? For contrast, what is not computer systems? What would possibly bore a "systems guy"?
