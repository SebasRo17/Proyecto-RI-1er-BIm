I'm in a software engineering class and I want to practice some skills on the most basic case possible : tic tac toe. I know this is overkill but I want to do it in "proper" OOP. I designed a class diagram for it but there is one point where I don't clearly see what would be the best design decision. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/US5Er.jpg) ("Joueur" means "Player", "PlancheDeJeu" means "Game board") Given this diagram, according to the `Expert`, `Low coupling` and `Strong cohesion` design patterns (sorry if those are not the correct english terms, I am translating) the score should be kept by the user class (Joueur). However, since there is no direct relation between Joueur and Système I don't exactly know how the game could display the score in a clean way. In this diagram, Système would have to ask the PlancheDeJeu object about the score and it would itself have to get it from Joueur. This seems wrong. I am trying to think of how to design an intermediary object that would link Joueur and Système but I can't come up with a good idea. What would be the best way to go here ? Thanks !
