I've been developing web apps for a while now and it is standard practice in our team to use agile development techniques and principles to implement the software. Recently, I've also become involved in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I heard people primarily use Matlab for developing ML and NLP algorithms. Does agile development have a place there or is that skill completely redundant? In other words, when you develop ML and NLP algorithms as a job, do you use agile development in the process?
