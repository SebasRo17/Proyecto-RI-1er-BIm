In my IB Computer Science class I am routinely asked by... pretty much everyone how to do X or implement Y. I'm the only person with any significant programming experience in the class and I do not necessaries mind teaching people about programming but so many of the questions could be simply solved by doing a little investigating. What are some ways I could try to teach my fellow students how to be self- reliant programmers? All I can really think of is being a Google ninja & learning how to use an API.
