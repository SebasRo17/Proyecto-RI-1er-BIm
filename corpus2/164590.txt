I have just started working in Information Security World. I want to learn the Python language for creating my own automated tool for Fuzzing, SQL-Injection etc. My question is I don't know much about C language (only basic knowledge) but I want to learn directly Python Language so is it good? I have seen there is lots of difference between Python and C (obviously) and for Information Security field Python = GOD so I want to know learning Python need any experience on C language? If not so can I start learning Python directly?
