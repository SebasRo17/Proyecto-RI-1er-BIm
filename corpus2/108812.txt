I know that CRM stands for Customer Relationship Management, CMS stands for Content Management System and ERP stands for Enterprise Resource Planner. I would like to know what each of things does best and which scenarios they are used in. So basic understanding of the three with differences among them and the environments in which they are used. **Edit:** I read up on the Wiki a bit more and now I understand according to the ERP wiki that a CRM is a part of the ERP. My question to be more specific is:   * Why have a CRM separately if it's already a part of the ERP? Abstraction?    * To log and store the information of a call-center that calls a hundred odd people to get info, which is more better to achieve the following tasks, a CRM or an ERP? :     * Store all the information about all the people that we have been called      * Store information about which person called and how many hours a person has worked?     * Find out which employee has been more productive? My friend strongly believes a CRM will get the job done. So thought I'd ask you guys which would be better and why does it make it better.
