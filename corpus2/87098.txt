One of things I do in my Resume is try to quantify the impact my work has had in the particular company I was with at the time. The reason is it shows the value my work had added to the business. Is this what you guys do as well or am I the only one? In my previous job this was easy as I worked on short/medium internal applications and it was fairly easy to measure end result. For example, external consulting company quoted $50,000 for an application Business Services department wanted I completed it in 3 days so I say I saved the company $48,000. I have been in my current job for 3 years but all of it has been on 1 single well established product. About 30% work is maintenance and 70% work is on new modules. I have worked on various modules like API (WCF), Security (2 factor authentication), etc. How should I quantify work on modules?
