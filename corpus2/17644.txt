I want to make a demonstration of how the complex roots of a polynomial change when I alter the coefficients. Here is my attempt:               QuintRoots[t_] := Map[{Re[#], Im[#]} &, x /. NSolve[x^5 - x - t == 0, x]]          DrawRoots[t_] := ListPlot[QuintRoots[t], PlotRange -> {{-1.5, 1.5}, {-1.5, 1.5}},                                     PlotStyle -> PointSize[Large], AspectRatio -> Automatic]          Manipulate[DrawRoots[t[[1]] + I*t[[2]]], {t, {-1, 1}, {-1, 1}}]      `QuintRoots[]` and `DrawRoots[]` work exactly as I would expect. The final command produces a nice-looking 2D slider and ListPlot below it but, when I try to move the slider, it doesn't move. A one dimensional slider, such as                Manipulate[DrawRoots[E^{I*t}], {t, 0, 2 Pi}]      works fine. So does the documentation center's example of a 2D slider,                Manipulate[ParametricPlot[{Sin[t + d[[1]]], Sin[t + d[[2]]]}, {t, 0, 2 Pi}],                {d, {0, 0}, {Pi, Pi}}]      PS Bonus question: If I can get this to work, I would also like to mark the points $\pm 3/ \sqrt{32}$ and $\pm 3 i /\sqrt{32}$ in the slider field, which are the points where we get multiple roots. Can this be done?
