Can software with AGPLv3 license be used with GPLv3 project? Can the resulting project be GPLv3, or must it have the special requirements of AGPLv3? I am not very smart from clause 13 of GLPv3 that mentions AGPLv3. > Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to > link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the > GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey > the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the > part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU > Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a > network will apply to the combination as such. Must the resulting, combined work be AGPLv3 or not?
