I have a Java application that I am implementing following the MVC pattern. I want to have a window (view) that contains a form which allows the user to add several text fields. There will also be a button that will allow the user to add more text-fields to the form. I have several questions about this. Will the code for adding new text-fields be considered part of the controller or the view?   1. If controller, then this controller will not do anything to the model, it will just modify my view, so is this a violation of MVC?   2. If view, then will it be a violation of MVC as the changes in view were not directed from the model?
