In most Java code, I see people declare Java objects like this:               Map<String, String> hashMap = new HashMap<>();     List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();      instead of:               HashMap<String, String> hashMap = new HashMap<>();     ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();      Why is there a preference to define the Java object using the interface rather than the implementation that is actually going to be used?
