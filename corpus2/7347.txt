I'm talking about the way we write simple routines in order to improve performance without making your code harder to read... for instance, this is the typical for we learned:               for(int i = 0; i < collection.length(); i++ ){        // stuff here     }      But, I usually do this when a `foreach` is not applicable:               for(int i = 0, j = collection.length(); i < j; i++ ){        // stuff here     }      I think this is a better approach since it will call the `length` method once only... my girlfriend says it's cryptic though. Is there any other simple trick you use on your own developments?
