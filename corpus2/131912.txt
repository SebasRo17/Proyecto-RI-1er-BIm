On a fairly regular basis, I run into problems that have already been solved by open source projects. Let’s say, purely for the sake of example, that I’m adding functionality to a piece of open source software which lets it line wrap some information in your terminal. It needs to know the width of the user’s terminal to do so. libuv (Node.JS’s platform layer) has already solved the problem (under *nix and Windows!) (so have a number of other projects, FWIW). It turns out that libuv is licensed under something which looks suspiciously like the MIT license: > >     Copyright Joyent, Inc. and other Node contributors. All rights >     reserved.

Is there a right (legal and respectful) way to use the window-sizing logic from libuv in another project? Here are the options that I can think of:   1. Nothing is required, since this doesn’t constitute a “substantial portion of the Software” (but including attribution in the source code would be nice).   2. A full copy of the license should be included in the source code.   3. A full copy of the license should be included in the source code and distributed with binaries. ### Bonuses:   1. What if the destination project is closed-source?   2. What if the borrowed code gets modified heavily (now or in the future)?   3. What’s the best way for authors of open source code to encourage reuse of bits of it by other programmers, with reasonable restrictions (e.g. require attribution in the source code, but don’t require the license to be distributed with binaries which include it)?
