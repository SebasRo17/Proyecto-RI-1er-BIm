I want to numerically solve the heat equation. To do so I wrote a program in C++ - It is a BVP $(\alpha T +\kappa \frac{\partial T}{\partial r}=f(t))$, where $f(t)$ is an arbitrary function, whose address I pass to the constructor of the struct `BoundaryCondition`               struct BoundaryCondition     {       enum class Side {LEFT,RIGHT};       double alpha;        double kappa;       double (*f) (double);       Side side;       BoundaryCondition(Side,double,double,double (*)(double));     };      Now I rewrite my code to use _Mathematica_ Interface. My plan is to write the functions for the left and right boundary conditions in _Mathematica_ , pass these functions(by name or by address???) and the initial data(array of real numbers) to my C++ code. Then I will just call these functions in an iterative algorithm. And finally - flush the results back to _Mathematica_ for post-processing (graphics, another calculation, etc.) Do you have any idea how to pass an arbitrary (unknown in advance) function (not just the usual data) to my, written in C++, library as an argument for further usage in the C++ code ?
