I have a differential equation that looks like this:                DSolve[(D[R[r, t], t])^2/(2*c) - (G*M1[r, z])/(        c^2*R[r, t]) - (Î»*(R[r, t])^2)/3 - E1[r] == 0, ... "boundary conditions etc go here"]      I need to get `R[r, t]` using my values of `E1[r]` and `M1[r]`. However, my `M1[r]` is defined as:               M1[r_] :=  NIntegrate[(1 + f*Exp[-(r/y)^2])*(r)^2, r]      Herein lies the problem. I realise that `DSolve` uses `Integrate` internally, but the function I want it to solve has an `NIntegrate` in it and this causes problems. I'm not sure how else to evaluate an error function. Any ideas?
