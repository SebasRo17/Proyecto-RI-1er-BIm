I want to series expansion the expression $\frac{1}{2} \left(e_1+e_2-\sqrt{e_1^2-2e_1e_2+e_2^2+4V_{12}^2} \right)$ up to second order in $V_{12}$ using the assumption $e_1>e_2$. So I tried               Series[1/2 (e1 + e2 - Sqrt[e1^2 - 2 e1 e2 + e2^2 + 4 V12^2]), {V12, 0, 2},      Assumptions -> e1 > e2] // FullSimplify      But there is still $\sqrt{(e_1-e_2)^2} $ terms in the results. What should I do to make the assumption $e_1>e_2$ work?
