Say you're a programmer and you have your personal home page (blog, about me, contacts, cv and so forth). Several top-devel domain names could apply to this situation. **.com** : This is an open TLD; any person or entity is permitted to register. Though originally intended for for-profit business entities, for a number of reasons it became the "main" TLD for domain names and is currently used by all types of entities including nonprofits, schools and private individuals. Domain name registrations may be challenged if the holder cannot prove an outside relation justifying reservation of the name, to prevent "squatting". **.pro** : Currently, .pro is reserved for licensed or certified lawyers, accountants, physicians and engineers in France, Canada, NL, UK and the U.S. A professional seeking to register a .pro domain must provide their registrar with the appropriate credentials. **.info** : This is an open TLD; any person or entity is permitted to register. **.name** : This is an open TLD; any person or entity is permitted to register; however, registrations may be challenged later if they are not by individuals (or the owners of fictional characters) in accordance with the domain's charter. Then, you obviously have the geographically local domains ( **.it, .co.uk** , etc.). Other domains are also often misused (for example **.me** , being Montenegro), just because they sound appropriate for a personal home page and they are usually cheaper than others. What would be the most appropriate choice for this situation?
