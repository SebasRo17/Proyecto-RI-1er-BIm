I don't want to be offensive; people in India matter just as much as people in the US and also need work. However, I'm one of the people in the US. Are there fewer programming jobs in the US because of competition from India? Are the programming jobs in the US less lucrative because of competition from India? Is programming a good career choice in the US (in terms of being able to actually make a fair amount of money)?
