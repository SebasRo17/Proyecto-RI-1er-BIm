In good old _Mathematica_ versions _(5.2, 6.0)_ , matrix multiplication was automatically done in parallel. For example, on an 8-core machine, define two square real matrices:               m1 = Table[Random[Real], {256}, {256}];     m2 = Table[Random[Real], {256}, {256}];      The total CPU time used in all cores to compute a dot product is:               Tsingle = Timing[m1.m2][[1]]      > 0.010999 Second The real time needed for the calculation is:               Tparallel = AbsoluteTiming[m1.m2][[1]]      > 0.001546 Second For large matrices, the ratio is almost equal to the number of cores (8):               Tsingle / Tparallel      > 7.114489004 Repeating the same calculation in newer _Mathematica_ versions _(8.0, 9.0)_ gives `Tsingle` equal to `Tparallel`, which seems to indicate that new _Mathematica_ versions dropped automatic parallelization of the _Dot_ command. Is this true?   I would be thankful if anyone can advise how to regain this functionality, i.e. compute `Dot` products in parallel (automatically or manually).
