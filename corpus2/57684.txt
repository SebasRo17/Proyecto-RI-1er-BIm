I want to plot a function of 2 variables x and y, for discrete values of y, like:               myFunc[x_, y_] := Sin[x y]     yvalues={0.1,0.5,1.0,2.0}     Plot[Evaluate@Map[myFunc[x, #] &, yvalues], {x, 0, 5}]      What I want is that the maximum x range (in this case 5) is a function of yvalues, for example, for each value i of yvalues, stop the corresponding plot curve at `Cos[yvalues[[i]]]`. I need this because in my real case, the function to plot is a 2D interpolation which behaves badly outside some specific intervals depending on y. Thanks.
