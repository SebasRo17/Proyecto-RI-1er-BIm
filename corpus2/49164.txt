I would like to call the following function from Mathematica               ps3000aOpenUnit     PICO_STATUS ps3000aOpenUnit     (        short * handle,        char * serial     )      I define the DLLFunciton in Mathematica:               ps3000OpenUnit =  DefineDLLFunction["ps3000aOpenUnit", "PS3000a.dll", "short", {"short[]", "char[]"}]      I get following error when executing               ps3000OpenUnit[handle, serial]     NET::methodargs: Improper arguments supplied for method named ps3000aOpenUnit.      What is wrong with my code? Thanx for helping me in advance.
