1. Use _Euler's Method_ or the _Modified Euler's_ to solve the differential equation ${dy/dt=y^2+t^2-1, y(-2)=-2}$ on $[- 2, 2]$. Take `h = 0.2` (`n = 20` iterations).   2. See if _Mathematica_ will give an analytic solution to this problem.  If it does compare the analytic solution found in Problems 1 and 2. If _Mathematica_ will not give an analytic solution, compare your solutions to the numerical solution on $[-2, 2]$ given by _Mathematica_. For the first problem, I am confused of the interval is not $[0,2]$ but $[-2,2]$ I have no idea with these two problems, can anyone help me?
