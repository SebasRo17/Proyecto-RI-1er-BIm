In JIRA, when creating a new issue, i am presented with a number of choices, some of which look like they don't belong. For example: "New Feature". This should be a part of a story right? How can one chose when to use "New Feature" and when to use a "Story"? "New Feature" looks like a type to me or a "Story" to me. Or, take for instance "Improvement". We can start a whole project with it's own "Epic" for the sole purpose to improve a bunch of things. Should such work be filed under an "Epic" or under something else? Please clarify
