I am having two set of data. This is d000 and d001. The set d001 is a subset of d000. I am fitting the d000 data by using the BSpline of the d001 data according to the following commands:               Table[Graphics[{Green, PointSize[Large], Point[d000], Red,         Point[d001], Black, BSplineCurve[d001]}, AspectRatio -> 1,        Axes -> True]]     SP = BSplineFunction[d001, SplineKnots -> "Unclamped"]     dsp[t_] = 2*0.33*10^(-9)*10^(12)*D[SP[t], t]      My problem is that the SP is defined with respect to the parameter t of the curve (that does the fitting), not with respect to a variable x, that defines the domain of the data d000. Does anyone know how I can convert the SP to a function of x?
