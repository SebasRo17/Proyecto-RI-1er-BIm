I am trying to export the data from a B Spline Function to a table in excel. I have tried exporting as many different file types (.xls, .txt, .dat), but all of them show up in excel as all of the data in one cell. Currently, all I have successfully done is this, showing a plot of "data1", a set of ordered pairs that I imported, and the B-spline fit for this data set.               f = BSplineFunction[data1]     Show[ListLinePlot[data1, PlotStyle -> Red],       ParametricPlot[f[t], {t, 0, 1}]]      I would like to export the data from the B-spline function in a way that can be viewed as a table in Excel. Thank you.
