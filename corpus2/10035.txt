Background: If you haven't read much of what I've written here, then:   * I'm a sole developer   * I've developed professionally for ~3 years, personally for 13   * I love my work   * Top-to-bottom, I find the whole process of developing software interesting, fun and exciting (with the slight exception of marketing)    * I hate the environment I'm in now and had to leave Now: I've applied for a position as a Software Development Engineer in Test which potentially pays significantly more than I'm making now (~70%), is located somewhere I'd really like to be and looks like a company I'd really like to work for (interesting product, good tools, smart people - I was referred by an existing employee). So obviously, I'm really hoping that I get the position. I don't want to get pigeonholed as a test developer, however, because they can sometimes have a bad reputation as not being good 'production' developers (not sure why... and this could be wrong, but that's the vibe I've gotten). I'd prefer my career path to end up at a senior dev/lead dev position in 5-10 years. If I'm offered** the position, is there a possibility of hurting this desired path? ** I'm getting ahead of myself. I know. I haven't even had the interview yet. I'm anxious. Still, I interview well and I think that I have the knowledge/experience for the position.
