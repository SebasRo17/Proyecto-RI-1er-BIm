I have written code, with the help of stackoverflow of course, and I want to make it user friendly so that other people in my lab can use it. I'm playing with DialogCreate and similar functions. I want to do something like this so far:                  CreateDialog[TabView[{        "General" ->         Column[{           Row[{TextCell["Project Name:"], InputField[Dynamic[Project]]}],           Row[{TextCell["Number of Wells:"], InputField[Dynamic[num]],              Button["Set", DialogReturn[num]]}]}],        "Row Selection" ->         Column[{Do[           Row[TextCell["Well " <> ToString[i] <> ":"],            FileNameSetter[Dynamic[Evaluate[Symbol["w" <> ToString[i]]]],           "Open"]], {i, 1, num}]}]}, ControlPlacement -> Left]      ]      I want to dynamically create more rows based on the input of "Number of Wells" within the same dialogbox but in a different tab. Is anything like this possible or some sort of alternative?
