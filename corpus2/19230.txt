Imagine I have some graph `G`, and I perform a graph embedding using a command like:               G = Graph[GraphEdges, GraphLayout -> {"SpringElectricalEmbedding"}]      I then want to apply a `"GridEmbedding"` to the post-Spring/Electrical embedded graph. How can I do this? Specifically, I have a graph I know to be a rectangular lattice, but the vertices are at random positions initially. Attempting a direct `"GridEmbedding"` yields junk; however the `"SpringElectricalEmbedding"` almost works, but begins to fail around the edges of the graph. Does anyone have advice for dealing with this? Alternatively, can `"GridEmbedding"` be made to respect edge lengths / weights akin to what is possible for `"SpringElectricalEmbedding"`?
