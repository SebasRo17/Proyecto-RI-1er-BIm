I know this is a simple question and there is a single command to do this but I have been looking for the command for 30+ minutes and cannot find it. I have a list that I want to put tabs between columns and new lines between rows. As a simple example, I have a list                 list = {{1, 2, 3}, {a, b, c}}      and I want to convert it to the string                 "1\t2\t3\na\tb\tc"
