There are developers out there that not only write code and solve problems, but aspire to one day be an entrepreneur and run their own company. They may participate in open source projects, go to various networking events/meetups, or even write code to help shape/start their own business outside of work. And, for example, an fully-candid interview with a prospective hire might go something like this: > Company: _Where do you see yourself in 5 years?_ > > You: _I see myself running my own software company in City Z, doing xx > projects, solving yy kind of problems._ This might be a red flag to a company, who may consider this kind of developer a high risk for leaving, and that they would take with them the experience of developing a particular software or specific industry knowledge. Should developers hide these kind of aspirations/traits from their current employers, or where they are interviewing? Is it unprofessional to mention these kind of things? Does it help or hurt their chance of getting hired?
