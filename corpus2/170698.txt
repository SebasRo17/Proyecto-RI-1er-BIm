I was looking into lipsync on a Dropbox clone. I was looking at the diagram on how it works here. It shows that a cronjob is used to keep files in sync between client and server. Does that mean that every sec/min/hour, a cronjob runs and checks to see if there is a difference between client and server? Is that how Dropbox does it? If it does use a cronjob, what happens when you are in the middle of syncing and another cronjob runs? Does rsync (or additional libs) know how to handle this?
