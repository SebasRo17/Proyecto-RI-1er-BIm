I have one year experience on ASP.net webforms and now I decided to move to another company where ASP MVC is the architecture. I decided because I always felt its not the real way to develop apps on web.(single form architecture and viewstate). But I know that I can accomplish everything on MVC on webforms with a controlled architecture? Will it give a value in job market if I moved to ASP MVC?
