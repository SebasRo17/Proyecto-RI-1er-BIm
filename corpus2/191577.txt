This is probably not the right place for this question, but I figure it is a board visited by thousands of programmers, and I am a programmer, and it is related, so I would try anyway. This is not a technical question, but rather a physical one - targeting mostly programmers, who have, as we all know, an extremely keyboard intensive lifestyle. The constant back and forth of the mouse, the rapid typing, the near expert level fluency over the keys. I can't be the only one who has come down with long term chronic pain from all of this. So I pose the query to other coders, how do you slow down? How do you bring those enormous typing speeds down to levels that let you function in day to day workload? I am currently attempting unfamiliar keyboard layouts, arthritic gloves, restrictive pads, and even word delay tools and I am having a lot of trouble "training" myself to type more slowly and not burn my arms up. I apologize if this isn't appropriate content, I just figure a place with all programmers would hold some insight.
