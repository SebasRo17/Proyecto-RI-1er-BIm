On the Wikipedia page on dependency injection, the disadvantages section tells us this: > Dependency injection increases coupling by requiring the user of a subsystem > to provide for the needs of that subsystem. with a link to an article against dependency injection. Dependency injection makes a class use the interface instead of the concrete implementation. That should result in decreased coupling, no? What am I missing? How is dependency injection increasing coupling between classes?
