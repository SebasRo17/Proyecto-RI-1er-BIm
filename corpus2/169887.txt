I'm taking a class where I work with a partner to implement the link layer of the OSI model. I've worked programmed with a partner once before and it went bad. Is the goal to divide the work up and decides who does what or should one person code and the other person reviews and switch roles after a while? Any tips are much appreciated. Literally I know nothing about working with a partner to program so even if it's basic please tell me.
