For my final year project, I'm working on a script that will run your python program and provide a time line of events(so far working on assignments) and create a story of what happened(the changes in the variables). Based on what Exception is thrown, you can choose to use the library made available by me to help figure out what happened and how it happened. (Hopefully I explained this much better than I did on stack overflow) My question to you, besides the variables, when an error occurs/exception you cant handle occurs, what would you look through in order to try and fix the problem? Many thanks.
