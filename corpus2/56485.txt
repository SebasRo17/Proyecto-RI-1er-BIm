This is a follow up to this question. I am using Mma 10 on a MacBook-Pro with OS-X Mavericks. After reading the documentation under CCompilerDriver/tutorial/SpecificCompilers I did the following:               Needs["CCompilerDriver`"];     CCompilers[]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZNCx5.png) The documentations says they are the compilers that _are found on my machine_ and that the CCompilerDriver package is automatically called when using CompilationTarget->"C" inside Compile. However, I can't get Compile working with CompilationTarget->"C". I also tried the Basic example in the documentation for CreateLibrary, and $Failed was returned. That means a suitable compiler could not be found. The documentation at CCompilerDriver/tutorial/SpecificCompilers also says, " Many Unix-type operating systems such as Linux or Mac OS X come with GCC already installed. If it is not present, then it can be added with a relatively simple configuration step." Can you help me with that _simple configuration step_?
