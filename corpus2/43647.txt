I am using the _CurveGraphics6_ NB to try and do some 3D related phase portraits and graphics. The following works and produces an animation.               pic = NDSolve[( {        {x'[t] == 2 y[t] (z[t] + 1)},        {y'[t] == -x[t] (z[t] + 1)},        {z'[t] == -(z[t])^3},        {x[0] == z[0] == 0},        {y[0] == 1}} ),         {x, y, z}, {t, -9, 9}, Animate -> True, PlotPoints -> 600,       ImageSize -> 300, HeadLength3D -> 1/30, DefaultDuration -> 40] // Last      I then attempt:                 Export["temp.gif", pic]      It exports the gif, but not the animation. What am I doing wrong? I also welcome if anyone has ideas on how to better show this in 3D. I do not see how to use the nice 3D Phase Portrait on the system above and maybe someone will be kind enough to provide guidance (as that is what I was really after).
