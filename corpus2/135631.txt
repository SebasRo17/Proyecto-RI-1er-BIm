My current application is running into issues with its ORM, and we're relying on some pretty hairy SQL to express queries that the ORM can't. Are there best practices in terms of how to manage the SQL queries? For example, where do these usually live in relation to other parts of the code? Are they in separate `.sql` files, or do you edit them directly in your other source files? If the latter, does your IDE (or editor) allow syntax highlighting? Are there schemes for Vim or Eclipse which will perform SQL syntax highlighting given a set of tags (like `#begin sql` and `#end sql`, or something similar?)
