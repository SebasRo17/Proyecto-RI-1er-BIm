As the title says, I want to control the speed when I use `Manipulate`. I have the following piece of code               Clear["Global`*"];     Manipulate[     V = -(M/Sqrt[b^2 + x^2 + λ*y^2 + (a + Sqrt[h^2 + z^2])^2]);     Vxx = D[V, {x, 2}];     Vyy = D[V, {y, 2}];     Vzz = D[V, {z, 2}];     ρ = 2.325/(4*π*100)*(Vxx + Vyy + Vzz);     ρxy = ρ /. {z -> 0};     ρxz = ρ /. {y -> 0};     ρyz = ρ /. {x -> 0};          M = 9500; a = 3; h = 0.15; λ = 1.1;          Syz = ContourPlot[ρyz, {y, -30, 30}, {z, -30, 30}, Contours -> 20,      ContourStyle -> Black, PlotPoints -> 50,      RegionFunction -> Function[{y, z}, ρyz < 0],      PerformanceGoal :> "Speed"],     {b, 0, 10, 0.1}]      My problem is that when I evaluate this in order to see what happens when the value of b changes the contours are plotted too fast without any order. Let me be more specific, the slider corresponding to b changes very fast and at any time it shows contours for completely random values of b. What I want, is to start the "animation" and be able to see in smooth and slow motion all the situations from b=0 up up b=10 using step 0.1 Many thanks in advance. **EDIT**               plots = Table[     V = -(M/Sqrt[b^2 + x^2 + λ*y^2 + (a + Sqrt[h^2 + z^2])^2]);     Vxx = D[V, {x, 2}]; Vyy = D[V, {y, 2}]; Vzz = D[V, {z, 2}];     ρ = (2.325/(4*Pi*100))*(Vxx + Vyy + Vzz);     ρxy = ρ /. {z -> 0};     ρxz = ρ /. {y -> 0};     ρyz = ρ /. {x -> 0};     M = 9500; a = 3; h = 0.15; λ = 1.1;     ContourPlot[ρyz, {y, -50, 50}, {z, -50, 50}, Contours -> 20,      ContourStyle -> Black, PlotPoints -> 50,      RegionFunction -> Function[{y, z}, ρyz < 0],      PerformanceGoal :> "Speed", FrameLabel -> {"y", "z"},      RotateLabel -> False,      FrameStyle ->       Directive[FontSize -> 17, FontFamily -> "Helvetica"],      PlotLabel -> Row[{"b = ", b}],      LabelStyle ->       Directive[FontSize -> 17, FontFamily -> "Helvetica"],      ImageSize -> 550], {b, 0, 10, 0.1}];
