I'm making a facebook app and I'm trying to follow MVC properly. But I was wondering if I had a class that was a bunch of fql queries (getting data from facebook) should I have keep these in a controller or a model? According to Codeigniter's user guide "Models are PHP classes that are designed to work with information in your database". Since fql interacts with facebook's databases and not my own, would having a class full of what is basically just SQL Select statements count as valid model?
