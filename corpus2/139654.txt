I'm working through designing a RESTful API. We know we want to return JSON and XML for any given resource. I had been thinking we would do something like this:               GET /api/something?param1=value1     Accept:  application/xml (or application/json)      However, someone tossed out using extensions for this, like so:               GET /api/something.xml?parm1=value1 (or /api/something.json?param1=value1)      What are the tradeoffs with these approaches? Is it best to rely on the accept header when an extension isn't specified, but honor extensions when specified? Is there a drawback to that approach?
