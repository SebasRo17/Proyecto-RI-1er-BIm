I have an unidimensional array (let's call it **list** )ranging from 0 to 86400, each one representing a second of a day (a day has 86400 secs). For example,               list = {73496.3, 85974.6, 86085., 86136., 16.6256, 19.6975, 25.8896, 26.1856, 26.3937}      ## ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/05if4.png) My goal is to change the ticks of plotted list with ListPlot, so that instead of the numbers, it gives you the hour. Also, there must be 24 ticks, each one representing one hour. For example, the number 49616 would become 13:46:56
