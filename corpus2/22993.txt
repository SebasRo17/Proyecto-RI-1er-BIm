I wrote 2 simple recursive functions for calculating the power of a table.               pol3[Tb_List, n_Integer?Positive] := If[n == 1, Tb, Tb.pol3[Tb, n - 1]]      and               pol4[A, 1] := A      pol4[A, n_Integer?Positive] := A.pol4[A, n - 1]      Tb, A are 3x3 arrays. Functions works for n<255 but if I try to call them for n=256 or greater then I take wrong results and the message:               $RecursionLimit::reclim: Recursion depth of 256 exceeded      I'm not very familiar with the Mathematica so I would appreciate any ideas on what I'm doing wrong.
