Next semester (starts in just under 5 weeks), I'm taking System Programming and OOD concurrently. Apparently SP centers on working in C on Linux, and I only have Java and Python experience, so I am a little nervous about this. For those of you who've taken these at an university, what should I look out for? I've already taken Computer Organization which included an overview of Assembly. With the exception of implementing loops in assembly, I ranged from B+ to A- in the assembly projects. Building circuitry was another story, however.
