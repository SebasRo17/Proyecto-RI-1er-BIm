I've been reading about database testing in PHPUnit. I'm not exactly sure what it's purpose is. Should I use this to test schema? E.g. if I have a UNIQUE email column then ensure that I'm not allow duplicate email addresses? (I shouldn't put this in my class tests then?) Is there anything else? I've been reading through documentation, blog posts etc trying to get my head round it .. it's also 2am, perhaps I need to sleep on it too :) Would appreciate if someone could explain in simple terms what this type of testing sets out to do.
