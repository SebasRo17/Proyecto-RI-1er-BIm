In C# code it allows the #region/#endregion keywords to made areas of code collapsible in the editor. Whenever I am doing this though I find it is to hide large chunks of code that could probably be refactored into other classes or methods. For example I have seen methods that contain 500 lines of code with 3 or 4 regions just to make it manageable. So is judicious use of regions a sign of trouble? It seems to be to me.
