I want to use the ICSOpenVpn project source code in my commercial application. If we see the ICSOpenVpn project, it states that its license is New BSD but the libopenvpn.so library it uses is under GNU GPLv2 license. As per FAQ for version 2 of GNU GPL "If a library is released under the GPL (not the LGPL), does that mean that any program which uses it has to be under the GPL?" The answer says: "Yes, because the program as it is actually run includes the library." Also, how could ICSOpenVpn change the license to New BSD?
