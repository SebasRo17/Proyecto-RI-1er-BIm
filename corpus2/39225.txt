My woes with Mathematica animations exported in SWF-format continue. The goal is to Export an animation in SWF-format, and also make it scalable, so that when I embed it into a slide set (produced by LaTeX) in PDF-format, the animation will resize when I zoom in/out. I have asked a related question on TeX.SE, where a solution via converting the animation into an MP4-file was suggested. That solution works, but lossy compression (or something) makes the end result look passable but not nearly as good as the same animation in a Mathematica notebook. Following the further discussion in TeX.SE I looked at the header of the generated SWF-file with a text editor (NotePad). Indeed, there reads `scaleMode - noScale`. So time to study Mathematica's help files. Promising sounding options are listed in `ref/format/SWF`. Most notably _Scalable_ and _ControlAppearance_ (kind of pointless to have those unclickable control buttons in the end product). So let's try...               roll[u_] := Show[       {ParametricPlot[{Cos[t] + u, Sin[t] + 1}, {t, 0, 2 Pi},          AspectRatio -> Automatic, AxesOrigin -> {0, 0},          Ticks -> {{0, 2 Pi, 4 Pi, 6 Pi}, {}}],        ParametricPlot[{u, 1} - t {Sin[u], Cos[u]}, {t, 0, 1}],        ParametricPlot[{t - Sin[t], 1 - Cos[t]}, {t, -0.6, u}],        Graphics[{PointSize[0.02], Point[{u - Sin[u], 1 - Cos[u]}]}]},        PlotRange -> {{-1.2, 20}, {-0.2, 4.2}}, Axes -> True]          sykloidi = Animate[roll[u], {u, 0, 20}]          Export["Analyysi I/2013/kalvot12-13/sykloidi.swf", sykloidi,       AnimationDuration -> 6, FrameRate -> 8, Scalable -> True,       ControlAppearance -> None]      Nope. No change. The .swf still does not scale. In the header of the SWF-file it still reads `scaleMode - noScale`, and the control buttons didn't disappear either. > Did I use wrong syntax for `Export` in the above snippet? What's the right > way of doing this?
