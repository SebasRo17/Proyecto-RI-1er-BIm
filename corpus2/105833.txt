Just a heads up: this will be a repost from stackoverflow. As a person who's going to graduate very soon from the university (and who didn't always pay enough attention to what the teacher said) I decided to brush up my "university" CS knowledge (i.e. it's been 3 years since I took my Operating Systems course). I'd like to revise everything (or at least the important stuff) I learned in the past 5 years or so. The problem is that I don't really need to go through all the presentations/lectures I was given during my courses, since I already know most of that stuff and they tend to be rather lengthy and very detailed. Therefore I'm looking for a book/set of books/presentations that would, very briefly revise all the common CS problems. You know starting with the basics (the definition of an algorithm) and then moving to other topics like algorithms and data structures, programming, databases, networks, operating systems, numerical analysis, probability. Are there any such materials out there? I tried googling but I always end up finding rather detailed stuff. Obviously it won't be a 10 pages long booklet, but I'm not really looking for a set of 10 books each 1200pages long neither.
