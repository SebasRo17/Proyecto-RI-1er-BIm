From reading various comments on this site, surfing the net, and talking to other programmers/non-programmers I find that a recurring theme is that programmers think differently from non-programmers. Do you really think this is the case? Aren't programmers just people who have a skill that can be difficult to explain in detail to non-programmers? Isn't this the same problem that any skilled person has when explaining it to someone unskilled in that same area? Edit 2: Hackers and Painters - This is a link from Michael's answer. Definitely worth reading if you've got a spare 15 mins Edit: Here's a link to clarify my question Programmers think differently than non-programmers The author of this blog holds the stance that programmers don't think differently from others. Does anyone disagree with this? If yes, why?
