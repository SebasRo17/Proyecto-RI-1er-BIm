I'm about to release an app and I have no idea what would be the ideal pricing point. I'm not sure how pricing high and selling few copies will compare in revenue to pricing low and selling lots of copies in my case. Can somebody point me to books/articles/blog posts/etc that elaborate on the subject, preferably taking into account stuff like competition, number of features, being the first one to the market, research if this kind of app is even needed, etc?
