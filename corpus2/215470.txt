I am in the final stages of development for my Revit plugin. This plugin is programmed in C#, and distributed via a DLL. One of the DLLs is an encrypted SQLite database (with proprietary data) that is in the form of a DLL. Currently, in development stages, the decryption key for the SQLite database is hardcoded in my main DLL (the program's DLL). For distribution, since DLLs are easily decompilable, I am in need of a new method to decrypt the DLL. My solution is to send our decryption keys from our servers securely to the host's computer. I was looking in POST, thinking it was more secure than GET, but upon research, it appears it's similarly insecure, only more "obscure" than GET. I also looked into HTTPS, but Hostgator requires extra money for HTTPS use. I am in need of some advice - are there any custom solutions I can do to implement this?
