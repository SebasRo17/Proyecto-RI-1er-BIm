Before I had my first proper contact with Javascript I read an excellent book "Javascript: The Good Parts" by Douglas Crockford. I was hoping for something similar in case of PHP. My first thought was this book: "PHP: The Good Parts" from O'Reilly However after I read the reviews it seems it totally misses the point. I am looking for a resource that would:   * concentrate on known shortcommings of PHP,   * give concrete examples,   * be as exhaustive as possible I already see that things can go wrong. **Research:** I looked through SO, and Programmers for materials. I obviously found this question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/90924/what-is-the-best-php-programming-book It's general, mine is specific. Moreover I'm reading the top recommendation "PHP Objects, Patterns, and Practice" right now. I find it insufficient -- it doesn't address the bad practices as much as I would like it to. **Motivation:** I don't _dislike_ PHP. I'm not even competent enough just yet to really state that. In 3 months however, I will start a job that will likely involve a lot of development in that language. I do not really know what quality the code will be. I also don't want to be the guy to introduce all the bad practices and then learn everything the hard way. I try to find out about as many traps that I possibly can. In case of Javascript Crockford's lectures really served as a guiding light. I would never feel confident in Javascript without them.
