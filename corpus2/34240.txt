I would like some assistance to solve the following: $\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n-1} e^{-k(n\Delta t -i\Delta t)}\Delta z_i$ where $z$ is a Wiener process, $\Delta z_i = z((i+1)\Delta t)-z(i\Delta t)$. The code I have so far is as follows. I am very new to _Mathematica_ (and programming in general) so please let me know of any errors.               k = 0.5; t = 2; n = 100; M = 1000     Sum[       Exp[-k (n (t/n) - i (t/n))][WienerProcess[][(i + 1) (t/n)]] -          Exp[-k (n (t/n) - i (t/n))][WienerProcess[][i (t/n)]],        {i, 0, n - 1}]      Note that $k$, $t$, $n$ and $M$ are user defined inputs. Also, I would like some guidance on how to perform $M=1000$ simulations.
