Sometimes Java outperforms C++ in benchmarks. Of course, sometimes C++ outperforms. See the following links:   * http://keithlea.com/javabench/   * http://blog.dhananjaynene.com/2008/07/performance-comparison-c-java-python-ruby-jython-jruby-groovy/   * http://blog.cfelde.com/2010/06/c-vs-java-performance/ But how is this even possible? It boggles my mind that interpreted bytecode could ever be faster than a compiled language. Can someone please explain? Thanks!
