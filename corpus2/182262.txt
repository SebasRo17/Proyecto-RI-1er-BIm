I'm fairly new to OOP (and programming in general), but what I find myself doing is that in the event that I don't need to pass a value from one method to another, I'll have my method calls centralized in some class within a Form.cs file. For example:               public void CentralMethod()     {         MethodA();         MethodC();         MethodD();     }      MethodA() will then do some stuff and call MethodB() directly, to which it passes a value. However after MethodB() is done, control reverts back to CentralMethod() and then MethodC() is called, etc. I can see how this is a nightmare on a large project, but is this at all a habit that one should get into on a relatively small project? I didn't necessarily do this by design, but I found myself doing it when it didn't make logical sense to include some method calls within other methods.
