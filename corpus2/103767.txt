Here is my situation:   * I am switching to a new company in a new city as an engineer [code, test, performance etc].   * I was not particularly successful in my previous role [at least not as per my immediate manager] and finally decided to quit on good terms.    * The new job is exciting [I haven't started it yet]. I am the first engineer for this new team and there is no existing code for what I would be working on, except an old prototype.    * I have to work closely with sister teams to bootstrap my product.    * I am due for a performance review within 5 months. I will have to take a few weeks vacation toward the end of it. I am a little anxious about this since I think 5 months isn't much time for me to bootstrap and show some early successes.   * I am working in a new space I am not familiar with though the stack is mostly Java, Apache, etc. which I am more comfortable than other stacks out there.  I am currently reading _First 90 Days_ though it is a bit more focused on leadership rather than engineers. I am an engineer and not manager though would like to move to leadership roles future in my career. Thanks for your input and I will add more details if someone requests.
