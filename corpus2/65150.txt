Reading the answers to Python vs. Perl in ten years time here on SE, most people seem to say go with Python. I agree (sorry Perl fans ;-) ). I already know Python, and I think it is a very good language, sure, as any programming language it _does_ come with its defects, but when I tried Perl I just didn't like it nearly as much as I liked Python. I "know" C, Python, Java and Scheme and have toyed with several other languages. Now, is there any good reason for me to learn Perl? **What is Perl "better" at than Python?** I do (hobby) application development and am learning some systems development as well (mostly programming for the Linux kernel). I'm pretty sure Perl is not fundamentally enough different from what I know this far to broaden my mind too greatly either (I would probably do better by focusing on Haskell, Scala, Forth or something like that for that purpose).
