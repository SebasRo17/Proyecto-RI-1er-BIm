I have the following string:                string=  {{"D(2.00225050736308e-15*A01 - 0.0201549279513608) = \         0.0820842279730734 + 0.08923448712*delay(A35",            " 17) + 0.08669543966*delay(A88",            " 20) + 1.98960079968027e-16*A57 - 0.3146216003*erf(delay(A01",            " 2)) - 0.3157150548*erf(sin(0.00541313376373593*cos(0.\         129564165001876 + 2.22963213427193e-15*A57 - \         gauss(0.00170510841714258 + 1.87338787507e-15*A51)) + delay(A27",            " 24) + gauss(gauss(0.00170510841714258 + 1.87338787507e-15*A51)) - \         2.17740845675611e-15*A81*cos(0.129564165001876 + \         2.22963213427193e-15*A57 - gauss(0.00170510841714258 + \         1.87338787507e-15*A51))))"}}      I want to isolate all characters within the brackets of the **delay** part e.g. delay(A27, 24). In other words I want the characters A24 and 24. My best bet was to go with               StringCases[string,"delay("~~__~~")"]      in order to get all String between the brackets, but this does not work. Still a little bit confused about using string patterns :/.
