I'm a math professor that is losing his job, and I'm trying to gain programming skills, since academic jobs are scarce these days. Are there particular types of programming jobs that I should try to work towards, in order to leverage my math Ph.D? What particular skills should I try to obtain for those jobs? **Update, 6 months later:** For those that are curious, I went the certification route, and it worked for me. I learned Java, then studied for the SCJP test, then obtained a job that is technically an internship, but is full time and pays comparably to being a math professor at a private school with tough finances. I recommend certifications for anyone without a CS degree or IT experience, it is the fastest and cheapest way to get _something_ objective on your resume.
