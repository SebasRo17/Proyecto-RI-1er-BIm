I have created some mockup screens for my app in HTML/CSS. I have 4 screens in total.   They contain no client-side coding i.e. Javascript or jQuery. The screens themselves are quite bland at the moment, and I realise they require some further work. Some of my plans for the app going forward are:-   * Introducing client-side templating : eg Mustache/Dust.js   * Add some effects and transitions using jQuery   * Improve the visual look of the screens (through css and images) I'm indecisive on the best way forward. My main aim is that I want changes to be easy to manage, and that's why I did mockup screens first as per the recommendation in the _Getting Real_ book by 37Signals. I'm currently in the process of gathering feedback for the mockup screens. From a programming point of view, which of the 3 steps above, would be a good logical step forward considering my requirement of making changes easy to manage? I should point out that i am very new to programming and development, and this is the first time i am learning programming. Some terms may not make sense to me and you may have to elaborate.
