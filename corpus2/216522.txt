I have 3 levels of permission to see the product:   * `Brand` -> Allow/Deny   * `Category` -> Allow/Deny   * `Product` -> Allow/Deny For example, product A has:   * Category: Allow   * Product: Deny => product A cannot be seen because product A isn't allowed in `Product` level.               if(allowForCategory == true) {         if(allowForProduct == false) return false;         if(allowForProduct == true) return true;     } else {         ...     }      This is not a good choice because it will become more complex if we add brand level.               if() {         if() {             if() {}         }     }      So is there any general algorithm to deal with the permission problem just like `777` solution in Linux?
