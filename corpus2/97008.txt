I have a fairly ambitious software development project that I have no time to give. This project is for my personal life and if completed will save me much time and money. I am a software developer by trade but don't have much time to work on this project. So, I am considering outsourcing or contracting out some of the work so I can get it done faster. It's one of those projects where the longer I take to finish it, the more it costs me. I have not outsourced anything and would like to try, what is a good way to get started? What are some risks that I might face?
