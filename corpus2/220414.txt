I have a reservation table (a user fills out a form to request a reservation). It has two parts that need to be confirmed. isReservationAccepted (decline,accept,waiting) and hasReservationBeenSent (sent, declined, waiting) Not sure how to structure my table, thinking about making a lookup table for each column, or maybe just creating them as int, and having 1 = accepted/sent, 2 = declined, 3 = waiting. not sure if there is a better way (probably)
