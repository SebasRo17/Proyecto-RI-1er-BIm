Suppose that I have the following               table = List[{"ID", "Variable 1", "Variable 2"}, {"Alpha", 1,         0}, {"Beta", 1, 1}, {"Alpha", 0, 0}, {"Gamma", 1, 0}, {"Gamma", 2,         2}]      Regard to this Post, we can use `select` (user-defined function) to select what we want based on either rows or columns. For example, we can use               select[table, where["ID" == "Alpha"]]      the return will be `{{"Alpha", 1, 0}, {"Alpha", 0, 0}}`. If I want to select multiple categories, for example, I want "Alpha" and "Gamma", I can use               select[table, where["ID" == "Alpha"||"ID" == "Gamma"]]      My point here is that you can do this if you have small table. What if you have very large table and you need to select multiple categories. You may have to write               select[table, where["ID" == "Alpha"||"ID" == "Gamma"||"ID"=="Beta"||....so on]]      What I did was to use               Flatten[select[table, where["ID"==#]]&/@{"Alpha", "Gamma"},1]      but it is slow if you have very large table. Could anyone give me suggestions?
