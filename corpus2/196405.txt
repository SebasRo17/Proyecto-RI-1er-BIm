I've read about the "hypervisor" in hardware virtualization. VMs are not my area, so I can't quite see where the term came from. THe wikipedia article talks about how "the hardware's supervisor state was virtualized as well, allowing multiple operating systems to run concurrently in separate virtual machine contexts" This implies that a _supervisor_ process was virtualized.. which then probably originated a 'hyper'-visor. Is this true?
