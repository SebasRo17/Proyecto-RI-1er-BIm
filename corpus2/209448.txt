I forked a project on Github, made a small change and sent a pull request to the original maintainer, who has pulled it in. Now the last commit there is `Merged pull request #11 from my_username/master`. This is the first time I'm doing this, so I'm not sure what the etiquette now is: I did a `git pull upstream master` and then `git push origin master`, and now the last commit on my own repository reads `Merged pull request #11 from my_username/master` which feels pretty weird to me. Is this the way people usually do it, is there anything I need to do to "clean up the history" or something? Note: since this was a tiny documentation change, I hadn't created any branches, I just made the change in my `master` branch and sent the pull req. So there's no cleanup to be done in that part.
