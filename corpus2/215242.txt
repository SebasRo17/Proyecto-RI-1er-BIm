If i make a set of processes like this:   1. select data from set of DB tables.   2. loop on the selected result.   3. Make some checks on each iteration.   4. Insert the result in another table. * * * Implementing the previous steps in a stored procedure or in a transaction through my code (asp.net)? Concerning the performance, security and reliability issues.
