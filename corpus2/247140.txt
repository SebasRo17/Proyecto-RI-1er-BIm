So normally I would only use JS to modify the dom after the user interacts with something or some event goes off. This seems right for some reason. But I'm developing a widget based app where widgets need the capability to draw (print) themselves and it feels redundant to send the widget's html via the initial http request when I can just print them with the js method when the page loads. Should I be trying to avoid printing html elements with JS on the page load as a rule or is it just an optimization thing?
