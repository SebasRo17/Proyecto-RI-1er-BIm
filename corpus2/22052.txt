I am trying to draw a Sierpinski_carpet. I have code that works, but I think there is a more elegant way to do than my way. Maybe I couls use `Tuples` or `Permutations` or some similar function to simplify my code. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/x3FRh.png)               f[{{x1_, y1_}, {x2_, y2_}}] := Map[Mean, {         {{{x1, x1, x1}, {y1, y1, y1}}, {{x1, x1, x2}, {y1, y1, y2}}},         {{{x1, x1, x1}, {y1, y1, y2}}, {{x1, x1, x2}, {y1, y2, y2}}},         {{{x1, x1, x1}, {y1, y2, y2}}, {{x1, x1, x2}, {y2, y2, y2}}},         {{{x1, x1, x2}, {y1, y1, y1}}, {{x1, x2, x2}, {y1, y1, y2}}},         {{{x1, x1, x2}, {y1, y2, y2}}, {{x1, x2, x2}, {y2, y2, y2}}},         {{{x1, x2, x2}, {y1, y1, y1}}, {{x2, x2, x2}, {y1, y1, y2}}},         {{{x1, x2, x2}, {y1, y1, y2}}, {{x2, x2, x2}, {y1, y2, y2}}},         {{{x1, x2, x2}, {y1, y2, y2}}, {{x2, x2, x2}, {y2, y2, y2}}}         }, {3}];     d = Nest[Join @@ f /@ # &, {{{0., 0.}, {1, 1}}}, 3];     Graphics[Rectangle @@@ d]     Clear["`*"]
