What is the best way to ensure that programmers ask for help when they get stuck on a problem, rather than spending too much time trying to figure something out when they've hit a wall? I'm especially interested in how to optimize this with a distributed team. Some ideas that come to mind:   * pair programming   * co-locating the team   * timeboxes (after expiration, must ask for help) Things (goals) to think about:   * avoid developing dependence on others   * maximize learning & knowledge transfer   * cost of developer A's time to help vs. developer B's time to figure it out him/herself There is also the concern that even if a developer comes up with a solution, it may be of lower quality than if they had asked for help. I believe code reviews are a good way to address this. This question: When do you not give help to less experienced programmers? is good background reading for this one.
