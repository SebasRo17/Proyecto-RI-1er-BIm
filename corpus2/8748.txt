Quote from Wikipedia of the article "High-level programming language": > A high-level programming language is a programming language with strong > abstraction from the details of the computer. In comparison to low-level > programming languages, it may use natural language elements, be easier to > use, or be more portable across platforms. Such languages hide the details > of CPU operations such as memory access models and management of scope. I.e., as the level of programming language increases, the further away the programmer goes from the hardware on which the program runs. Now I do not know the statistics of language usages across levels, but I would suspect that the higher level languages more and more are replacing the lower level languages. If so, can this lead to a deficit of programmers with computer architecture knowledge? Would this be a problem for the industry?
