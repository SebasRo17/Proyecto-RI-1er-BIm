Can anyone point me to reference materials on what companies may expect to pay for outsourced apps? I had hoped to find something in a trade publication or the like, but have only turned up two or three quotable articles with any sense of credibility. We are talking to a client about their first app (and ours) and, as neither party knows what sort of number to expect at the beginning of the negotiation, I'd like some ammunition to be able to say, "On the open market, you can expect an app like this to start around..." Any link or even search term suggestions would be appreciated. Thank you, Mary Kroll Post script: I have ready Joel Spolsky's "Camels and Rubber Duckies" and Neil Davidson's "Don't Just Roll the Dice." My focus is more on what is common in the industry, rather than rate x hours, etc.
