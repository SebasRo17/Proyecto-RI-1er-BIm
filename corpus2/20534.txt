Given the following List:                 lis =  { {-2.8336, -1.1088, -0.1232, 1.23493}, {-2.8336, -1.1088, 0.1232,            1.08433}, {-2.8336, -0.8624, -0.616,            1.04417}, {-2.8336, -0.8624, -0.3696,            1.10441}, {-2.8336, -0.8624, -0.1232, 1.17469}, {-2.8336, -0.8624,            0.1232, 1.09437}, {-2.8336, -0.8624, 0.3696,            1.43574}, {-2.8336, -0.8624, 0.616,            1.07429}, {-2.8336, -0.616, -0.8624,            1.26506}, {-2.8336, -0.616, -0.616, 1.43574} }      One can convert it to a table as follows: `lis//TableForm` But that just works for displaying it in _Mathematica_. How can one easily save that list to a text file so that it appears as a table?
