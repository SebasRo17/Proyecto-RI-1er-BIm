I would like to read in really large text files (about 2GB) into _Mathematica_. The structure of the file is such that the first row and the first column are text i.e strings. Rest is all numbers. Is it possible to take advantage of this and make the `Import` faster? Currently I do `Import["file.txt","Table"]`. It takes a long time. I would like the output list to be same as that returned by the previously mentioned `Import` command. Thanks for your help.
