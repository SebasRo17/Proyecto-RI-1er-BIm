From the documentation: > Overlay[{Subscript[expr, 1],Subscript[expr, 2],...},{i,j,...},s] allows > selections to be made and controls to be clicked in Subscript[expr, s]. and an example of selecting **one** layer:               Overlay[{Slider2D[], Graphics[{Opacity[.2], Disk[]}]}, All, 1]      Does anyone know what the syntax is for cases in which you want controls to be clicked in more than one layer, or all layers? I have tried:               Overlay[{Slider2D[], Graphics[{Opacity[.2], Disk[]}]}, All, All]      and               Overlay[{Slider2D[], Graphics[{Opacity[.2], Disk[]}]}, All, {1,2}]      without success.
