This might seem like a rant, but I am curious. CSS replaced tables for layout a long time ago. But we still have to use tables for layout when creating rich emails. Why is this? Are there any other options? Are there really technical constraints that prevent CSS from working in an email. What are they? I can see how linked or embedded style sheets might be a problem, but not even inline styles work. Is this ever going to change?
