In Scott Chacon's workflow (explained eg in this SO answer), with essentially two silos (`development`, and `master`), if, say I have a small bug to fix (e.g. can be fixed with a few characters) is the optimal way of doing that: a) branch off of `development` a branch called e.g. `fix_123`. Push this branch to origin as I work on it. When it's done, code-reviewed, whatever, merge into `development` and push `development` to origin. b) Same as above, but without pushing `fix_123` to origin.
