I really like a microframework in Python called Flask. I have used it for the past 2 months, and I find it excellent. Now, I would like to use it in deployment, but, there are a few things I'm afraid of. Firstly, even though its a microframework, it depends on Werkzeug (a WSGI framework type of thing), which, in case I run into a problem, makes it more difficult to debug stuff. Second, its not extremely popular, which means that support would be difficult to get. So, what I was thinking is I could roll my own microframework in Python that doesn't have all the features of Flask, but, only the ones I need, and I would know it through and through and could fix any problems that I might encounter, I estimate this will take 1000-2000 lines, and about 2-3 weeks for me, and probably a lot less with a team of 2. What do you guys suggest?
