For some work I am doing, I take my notes in a notebook with a custom stylesheet. For my own convenience, I have separated the styles into their own stylesheet notebook, and reference within the notebook's stylesheet like is done with `Default.nb`: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vYJZl.png) Unfortunately, this makes sharing this notebook difficult with out also ensuring that the recipient has the stylesheet already installed. Barring that, what are the alternatives? The simplest would be if the `NotebookDirectory[]` was automatically included in the search for the stylesheets, then the stylesheet can be simply placed in that directory. This works great in the case of a shared network drive, but still requires a two step process for the case of email. Ideally, I would like to automatically embed _all_ of the style definitions up to a certain depth in the referenced stylesheets. How can this be most easily accomplished?
