Please tell me if:   * Node.js will make our site faster!   * Node.js will consume fewer server resources, we can save money!   * Node.js will make us more productive!   * Node.js means we can share client and server side JavaScript code. To clarify, we're rewriting a frontend server, which will talk to our existing Ruby on Rails application as an API. Meanwhile, we'll refactor our Ruby on Rails application into services. More details on the existing architecture:   * Memcached for HTML partials caching   * Redis for session, and some structured data caching   * MySQL single master, multiple slaves      * There's one large table that accepts a lot of writes (imagine a poll)     * Otherwise mostly reads.   * MongoDB for some metadata   * Ruby on Rails 3.0   * nginx and Unicorn
