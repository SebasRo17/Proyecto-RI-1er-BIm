I'm going through some training on objective-c. The trainer suggests setting single character parameter names. The .NET developer in me is crying. Is this truly the convention? Why? For example,               @interface Square : NSObject     {       int size;     }          -(void)setSize: (int)s;      I've seen developers using underscores `int _size` to declar variables (I think people call the variable declared in `@interface` ivar for some unknown reason). Personally, I prefer to use descriptive names. E.G.               @interface Square : NSObject     {       int Size;     }          -(void)setSize: (int)size;      C, like C# is case sensitive. So why don't we use the same convention as .NET?
