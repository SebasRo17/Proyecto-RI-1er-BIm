I have a function that works perfectly for detecting whether or not r1 overlaps with r2:               boolean overlaps( Rectangle r1, Rectangle r2 ) {         return r1.x < r2.x + r2.width && r1.x + r1.width > r2.x &&             r1.y < r2.y + r2.height && r1.y + r1.height > r2.y;     }      But now I would like to add a minimum threshold so that it would return true if r1 overlaps r2 by at least a given length. Here's what I have so far but haven't had any luck:               boolean overlaps( Rectangle r1, Rectangle r2, float threshold ) {         return r1.x < r2.x + r2.width && r1.x + r1.width > r2.x + threshold &&             r1.y < r2.y + r2.height && r1.y + r1.height > r2.y + threshold;     }
