Recently we got a requirement for converting a classic asp project to asp.net. This one is really a very old project created around 2002/2003. It consists of around 50 asp pages. I found very little documentation for this project, FSD and design documents for only a few modules. Just giving a quick look into this project my head start to hurt. It is really a mess. I checked the records and found none of the developers who worked on this project work for the company anymore. My real pain is that this is an urgent requirement and I have to provide an estimated deadline to my supervisor. I found a similar question classic-asp-to-asp-net, but I need some more insight on how to convert this classic asp project to asp.net in the quickest possible way.
