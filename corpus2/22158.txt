Roundup issue tracker is pretty minimalistic by default, and it does not bring any specific workflow with itself. It was once called ‘so configurable that it’s probably better described as a lightweight tracker-oriented framework.’ Have you ever used Roundup extensively or seen some interesting use cases? If so, please share an example. (If you don’t consider your workflow special enough, at least tell how do you understand & utilize `superseder` field in the default ‘classic’ template, which alone could be interpreted differently—see _old.nabble.com/Superseder- td13792131.html_ )
