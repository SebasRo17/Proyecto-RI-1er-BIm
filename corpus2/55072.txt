Missing[...] "is a symbolic object, with no default evaluation rules defined." Missing data can be tagged and enables use of filters like DeleteMissing. So it's worthwhile to normalize various types of missing values, like "" or "NA" to `Missing[...]`. EDIT: Suppose a set of functions `{foo,bar}` are interatively applied a data column that contains `Missing[]` elements. Unless the `{foo,bar}` are implemented to handle Missing, increasingly long unevaluated expressions `bar[foo[Missing[]]` are generated, which often throw `Dataset` Failures. Is there a global way to make `Missing[]` invariant, ie `f[m_Missing]` \--> `m`, for any `f` without actually overloading `f` on _Missing?
