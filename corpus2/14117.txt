I would like to save an image as a double precision TIFF image. I have looked and tried many things but no luck. I have been able to import a double precision TIFF from IDL and found that the data was double precision. So the problem is on the export side.               data = RandomVariate[NormalDistribution[], {4, 4}]     pic = Image[data, "Real"]     ImageData[pic]     Export["Real_tiff.tiff", pic]     Import["Real_tiff.tiff", "Data"]      If you run this code you will find that the data is non-integer until it is read back in.
