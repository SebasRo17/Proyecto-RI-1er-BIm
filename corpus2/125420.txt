Typically, when you hit Enter in a smart editor, it copies the indentation of the last line by inserting the same amount of spaces, so if you don't delete them, the code looks like this:               sub sum {         my @numbers = @_;                  my $sum = 0;         foreach (@_) {              $sum += $_;         }                  return $sum;     }      (Yes, the example is silly; that sub could be written in two or three lines. :)) To be honest, these lines make my cursor feel dizzy, so I tend to clear them out. (I admit, that this behavior generates commit noise + inconsistency.) Plus, the whitespace are unnecessary bytes. Well, probably none of these does matter, at least in most obvious ways. So I wonder if there is any better (i.e. less subjective and less over-pedantic) reason why the lines should be blanked (by `s/^\s+$//`). **Note:** And please try not to point me to the style guide. Imagine I'm the one writing the style guide: should I inherit rule "delete the extra spaces" or just bravely fight my intuition and leave those peaceful `\t`'s and ``'s alone?. Or I just want to improve my "own" guide, which I can use where "official" guide is silent or missing.
