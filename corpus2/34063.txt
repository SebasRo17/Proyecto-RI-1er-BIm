After discovering that MapIndexed cannot be used with `compile` (see MapIndexed and Compile) I am now trying do implement similar functionality using a combination of `MapThread` and `Map`. Unfortunately I am running into problems even when only using `MapThread`. Here is a test-scenario: Create Lists first:               A = {{1, 2}, {2, 3}};     B = {{{1, 2, 3}, {2, 3, 4}}, {{2, 3, 4}, {3, 4, 5}}};      The I simply run `MapThread` with function `List[]` to obtain a suitable combination of those lists and put the whole thing inside a `Compile`-statement:               test = Compile[{{B, _Real, 3}, {A, _Real, 2}}, MapThread[List[#1, #2, #3] &, {B, A, A}, 2]];      But when running `test[B,A]` I get the following compile error: > CompiledFunction::cfex: Could not complete external evaluation at > instruction 15; proceeding with uncompiled evaluation. When using `CompilePrint[test]` instruction 15 shows a call to `MainEvaluate`. Unfortunately I currently have no clue how to fix that problem. Any hint is appreciated.
