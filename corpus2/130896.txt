I am planning an application that includes a membership card functionality, where the user can place an order, either in the application or by phoning the vendor. Once the order is placed, especially in the case of a phone in order, what would be the best approach to having the vendor side communicate relevant details to a specific device. I have looked Android's C2DM, that doesn't seem to be the best method. I don't want to send messages/data to all devices with the application installed, only the specific device that placed the order.
