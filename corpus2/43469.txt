I have loads of operations I wish to perform on the solution, but every single operation depends on getting the solution in the first place. Here's the code I intend to run in order to perform everything I want on it:               eps4 = 0;     phi6m4 = NDSolveValue[{        D[u[t, x], x, x] -         D[u[t, x], t]*1/Sqrt[t^2 + x^2] == -6 u[t, x]^5 +              (8 + 4 eps4) u[t, x]^3 - (2 + 4 eps4)u[t, x],        u[0.001, x] == Tanh[x],        Derivative[1, 0][u][0.001, x] == 0,        u[t, 0] == 0, u[t, 7] == 1}          , u, {t, 0.001, 6}, {x, 0, 7}];      > NDSolveValue::ivone: Boundary values may only be specified for one > independent variable.
