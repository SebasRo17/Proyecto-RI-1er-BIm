To clarify, what I'm asking about is               public class A{         private/*or public*/ B b;     }      vs.               public class A{         private/*or public*/ class B{             ....         }     }      I can definitely think of some reasons to use one or the other, but what I would really like to see are convincing examples that show that the pros and cons are not just academic.
