Is it generally, to a reasonable developer, considered morally acceptable, to take a branch of an open-source repository, and start making changes to it and calling your own? You would be taking this to another open-source. Assume that you will link to the original. Note that this is a question of what is considered acceptable, _not_ what is legal. If this is okay, where is the line of how much you change that allows you to call it your own?
