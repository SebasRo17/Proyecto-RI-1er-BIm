I am pretty new to Java and its JTables and this is where I am struggling at the moment. I need to create a GUI which shows me results of a sql query like `SELECT * FROM tblPeople WHERE name='Doe'`. My idea was to create a a JFrame which displays a JTable with all found records. Besides this, I need to also implement some code to handle when a user is double clicking a record or selecting it by using his arrow keys (additional feature: pressing `12`(e.g.) should select the 12th record). What is the best way to structure my program (what classes do I need and especially where do I store my logic)? I came up with structuring it the following way:   * **Main.java** ("view")   * **SQLConnection.java**   * **PeopleTableModel.java** (only stores and returns data given by the passed ResultSet, "model" inherits from DefaultTableModel)   * **PeopleTable.java** (stores basically all my logic including KeyListener and MouseListener, "controller", inherits from JTable) Are there better ways to achieve my goals? If so, what are they?
