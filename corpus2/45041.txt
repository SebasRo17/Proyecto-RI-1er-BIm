I want to define a "prefix" (D_i) covariant derivative operator CD[] for symbolic tensors in form of a function, i.e. for               $Assumptions={Element[g,Arrays[{3,3},Reals,Symmetric[{1,2}]]]}      also               Element[CD[g],Arrays[{3,3,3},Reals,Symmetric[2,3]]]      should be made an assumption, an additional slot is created on the left. So far the only way I found to make this possible is defining a function               $Assumptions = {Element[v,Vectors[3, Reals]]}          CDdef[a_] := (AppendTo[$Assumptions,          Element[CD[a],Arrays[{3}~Join~TensorDimensions[a]],Reals,            TensorSymmetry[TensorProduct[v, a]]]];           $Assumptions =  DeleteDuplicates[$Assumptions]; CD[a])      and effectively writing all the assumption by hand into $Assumptions. But this could generate a huge list in bigger calculations. All my attempts of the kind               $Assumptions={Element[CD[a_?SomeSymmetryQ],Arrays["one more slot"]]}      to use pattern that are at least valid for all tensors with the same symmetries have failed. Is there any effective way to proceed? Many thanks, Hendrik
