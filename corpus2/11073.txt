I have three simple graphs in one Plot. Now I am trying to make a button for each graph so you can hide or show it in the plot. Until now I was just able to make a checkbox with the Manipulate function, but I don't now how to tell the checkbox that it should hide my graph when unchecked an display it when checked. Here is what I was able to make so far, I know it looks simple but I also have many other mathematica documents which at the end just need this button. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QMqcr.png)
