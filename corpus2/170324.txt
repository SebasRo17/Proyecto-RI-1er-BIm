I was just talking to my partner about how hard it is to personally judge how good your product is after a while because you use it so often. You literally spend hours on your computer doing nothing but work on this "consumer facing" application, and you start to feel a little fatigue of using it over and over and over, at least a hundred times a day. You get scared this fatigue may mean the product you are building may have the same effect on the users and might mean you are doing something wrong. Is there a name for this in product development? For the fact that as a designer+ programmer+everything else, your product might not suck as much as you think simply because you spend way too much time with it, or a variation of this?
