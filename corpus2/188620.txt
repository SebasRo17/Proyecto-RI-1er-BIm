I have a web application which I want to make RESTful. Here is the structure of the app:   1. Top level has a bunch of search screens, they are basically tabs which search different parts of database with different parameters.   2. After the search is done we display search results in a new tab, inside this tab is a table with a list of results.   3. From the list of results we can drill down to individual details for each row (they also open in a new tab)   4. Inside the details there are further additional details (and some sub-searches relevant to the the item). These additional details are also open in a new tab. So, now I want to make this app RESTful - the goal is for people to share their searches and screens easily, have simpler URLs, get rid of some information stored in session.   * Is this feasible for the design we have to make it RESTful?   * The main difficulty I see is that we have multiple tabs with different searches and details, how do I reflect it in the URL?    * Also, the search could be quite complex - users can enter 50 different filters and could enter multiple ids - up to a thousand at the same time. What would be a preferred solution in this case? If this is not quite works, then is there a way to have several tabs that correspond to different URLs in one URL?
