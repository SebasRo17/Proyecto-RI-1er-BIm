I have a control where the user can select a value for the x and y axis from 2 dropdowns, and then there is a 4 by 4 grid (an image) which will show what their selections correspond to (updating dynamically). So, if the grid is:               a b c d     e f g h     i j k l     m n o p      If the user picks 2 for row (column is `null` for now), `e f g h` should highlight (using an outline). If they then pick 3 for column, only `g` should highlight. And so on for every combination. I know I can figure this out by making 25 separate images (one for each square + 4 rows + 4 cols + both null) and then load in the right image using ajax, but my question is if there is a better way or some sort of dynamic solution where I can draw over the image, or overlay another image in an intelligent fashion?
