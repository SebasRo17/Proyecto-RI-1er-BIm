I have an image I would like to make into a `.dxf` and to do this I need a `Graphics3D` object. Is there anyway I can do this? Can mathematica somehow vectorize a 2D image? I tried saving the image as a PDF then `Export[path.dxf,Import[path.pdf]]` after saving `EdgeDetect[Image]` as a PDF but AutoCad said it was a bad DXF and did not accept it. Any solutions? Edit: Clarification: I have a 2d image that i want to put into the .dxf format which I believe is 3d. In order to do that Mathematica wants a Export[path.dxf,3DGraphics object]. It's a 2d image though. This is for importation into AutoCAD. It says malformed shape when i do Export[path.dxf,Image] since I assume Image is 2DGraphics object
