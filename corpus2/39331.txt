I would like to make a replacement "c1 C1 -> F1, c2 C2-> F2...." such that the expression like this "c1 C1 c2 C2 c3 C3 c4 C4" becomes "F1 F2 F3 F4". I used the standard replacement method: `c1 C1 c2 C2 c3 C3 c4 C4 /. {c1 C1 ->F1, c2 C2 -> F2, c3 C3-> F3, c4 C4-> F4}`. But mathematica only gives "F1 c2 C2 c3 C3 c4 C4", it only replace the first product. What is the reason this replacement does not work? How could I make such a replacement at once? Thanks a lot.
