Where I come from software is considered something you can get for free (same goes for movies, etc.) The willingness not to pay for software is quite strong. It is putting me off, that people would rather go through hoops and risk legal issues than to pay a small amount of money for a piece of software. This attitude is somehow embedded in the society. I'm just trying to understand the situation. What do you think is causing this? Why won't some people pay for software even if it's cheap and they use it every day?
