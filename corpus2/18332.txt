I'm working on a sales projection, trying to create some flexibility in handle the forecast using locators. The toy code is something like this:               DynamicModule[{pts={{1,1},{2,1}}}         ,LocatorPane[             Dynamic[pts]            ,Dynamic@Plot[Piecewise[{{InterpolatingPolynomial[{{0,1},Sequence@@pts,{3,5}},x],x<3},{5,x>3}}],{x,0,5},PlotRange->{{0,5},{0,6}}]         ]     ]      ![plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IdyQl.png) Where I can change the locators position in order to change the curve. **The question is, assuming my plot functions as`f[x]`**   1. How to define `f'[3]=0` to don't get the slop break in `{3,5}`?   2. How to define `f'[0]>0` to don't get a initial down slope? So I could control the polinomial order to get these conditions met, still using locators. Maybe using `NDSolve` together with `LinearModelFit`? Or is there a simpler way? **Update** The first condition was solved by @kguler and @belisarius. Tks to both. Some clue for the second?
