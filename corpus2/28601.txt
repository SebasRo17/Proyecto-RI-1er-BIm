I am a complete starter in web development, as I know only basics of HTML and CSS, although I have a history of desktop development. What is the usual roadmap to get started in web apps, based on AJAX? We decided to use Dojo toolkit as our javascript library. Is the following a feasible map? 1-Learn basic javascript(already on it) 2-Learn what DOM is 3-Start with Dojo documentation and examples 4-Get into AJAX with Dojo Addendum: My goal is not to become a professional web developer who builds public web pages, it is not my specialty. I am trying to build an interface to an embedded product my company develops. We chose dojo mostly because it provides widgets for easy interface development. I am just trying to find out the easiest way to get this done. I got several satisfactory answers and have difficulty choosing the best.
