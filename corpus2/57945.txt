Consider...               f[x_]:=Body containing h[some args]...     g[x_]:=Body containing h[some args]...      However I want to define something like...               The h to use inside f has this definition h[args___]:=f specific definition.     The h to use inside g has this definition h[args___]:=g specific definition.      I know I can do this using Block wrapped around the call to f and g but I was curious if some cunning extension of UpValues would work; more like a dependency injector pattern. My experience of using UpValues is very limited and reading the documentation for UpValues it would appear to be appropriate only when the precise pattern of h within f or g is known. Added 26/08/2014 10:11 (London) The specific problem I was trying to apply this to concerned two very similar functions that produce some graphics. Those graphics required different scaling functions to produce their results. What I wanted to do was attach in some way the specific scaling to the relevant function but separate from the plotting functions themselves. Block comes closest to what I was trying to achieve. I may go with this. Many thanks to all who answered.
