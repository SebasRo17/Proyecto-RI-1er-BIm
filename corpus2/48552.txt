I want to export a string for a bash script. The terminal is naturally very picky when it comes down to the "\n\r" vs "\n", Windows vs. Linux, new line issue. How can I teach _Mathematica_ to use "\n" rather than "\n\r" as the line separator when exporting text (in Windows)? I found a couple of posts regards the same issue, but they were concerned with importing files. For example, here. None of the suggested solutions worked for my case. I played with `CharacterEncoding` and `"LineSeparators"` but nothing worked. EDIT: Great thanks to Mark Adler for giving me the right clue. His suggested solution `WriteString[f, "\n"]` did not work because "\n" is interpreted by _Mathematica_ as string not as end-of-line. However, his suggested `DOSTextFormat -> False` option also works as option for `Export[]`. I got the desired result using `Export[filename,script,"Text",DOSTextFormat -> False]`.
