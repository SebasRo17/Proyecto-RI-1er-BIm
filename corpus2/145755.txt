We've probably all been in the situation where you'd like to alert your team members to some change ("I changed X, so now it's running every hour instead of every day"). But the change is non-urgent, and email can be disruptive - or get tuned out. Anyone have any techniques where the team can have a running log of changes that everyone should be aware of, that they can peruse at their leisure - or at least, when they suspect something is up?
