In Matlab, I can type:               >> whos     >> x=4          x =               4          >> y=7          y =               7          >> whos       Name      Size            Bytes  Class     Attributes            x         1x1                 8  double                     y         1x1                 8  double         And I get a list of all variables in my workspace. Is there something similar in Mathematica so I know what variables to Clear?
