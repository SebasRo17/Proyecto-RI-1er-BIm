I have a list `{1, 2, 3, 4}` and wish to form                {{{1,2},{3,4}},       {{1,3},{2,4}},       {{1,4},{2,3}}}      I ended up doing it manually like this:               a={1,2,3,4}     {{{a[[1]],a[[2]]}, {a[[3]],a[[4]]}},     {{a[[1]],a[[3]]}, {a[[2]],a[[4]]}},     {{a[[1]],a[[4]]}, {a[[2]],a[[3]]}}}      Is there a way to do this more simply? Of course this is a simplified question from the actual problem which is more complicated. An answer to this can be generalized to my actual problem. Thanks.
