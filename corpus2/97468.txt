I would like to improve the TOR network, where the exit nodes are a vulnerability to concealing traffic. From my understanding, traffic to .onion sites are not decrypted by exit nodes, so therefore - in theory - a .onion site web proxy could be used to further anonymize traffic. Yes/no? perhaps you have insight into the coding and routing behind these concepts to elaborate on why this is a good/not good idea.
