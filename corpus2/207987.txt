Bugs happen and sometimes data has to be fixed in production. What is the safest way to go about this from a big company standpoint? Are there tools that can help? Here are some considerations driving this requirement...   1. We need to log who ran the query and what they ran   2. Ideally we need to give the person access to only run queries against the tables of interest and only for a short time   3. Whatever is running the queries needs to have some smarts about it to not allow long running and locking SQL to run without explicit permission   4. This process needs to be DB agnostic or at least understand DB2, Oracle, and SQL Server. We are trying to reduce the risk of ad-hoc prod fix-up queries from doing the "wrong thing" and at the same time add some security/audtis to the process. Thoughts or Ideas?
