I have multiple applications some that use data from the same sources. Is it best practice (or what are the pros/cons) to:   * leave the data in databases shared by multiple applications     1. saves space as only one database is needed     2. complicates indexing as different applications have different querying needs   * import data daily into per-app databases     1. uses more space as duplicated data exists in per-app databases     2. easier indexing as each app can focus on its individual needs I may have left out other advantages/disadvantages, please list if any, also how is this done at your workplace?
