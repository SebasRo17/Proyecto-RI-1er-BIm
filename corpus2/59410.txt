I have have list of lists and I would like to be able to append an element to the start of each list. I am sure there must be an elegant solution. EG: `a` and `{{b,c},{d,e,f}}` -> `{{a,b,c},{a,d,e,f}}` If I want to apply a function to a list of lists I normally use `@@@` however I don't know how to modify this so that it gets feed into the second argument or `AppendTo`. Can someone please explain how I could achieve this?
