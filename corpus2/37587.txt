Some Java developers have asked if I could give them a 2-day primer on Grails development. I'm assuming they're familiar with:   * Java language and libraries   * Java web development, e.g. Servlets, JSPs   * Spring   * Hibernate   * Client-side development, CSS, HTML, JavaScript I'm further assuming they have no experience with Groovy or Grails. AFAIK, the app that they'll be building is a new project, so there's no need to cover topics like using GORM with a legacy database. I'm trying to decide how I should structure the course, e.g. what topics to cover and how much time to spend on each. I reckon about 1/2 - 3/4 days on Groovy and the rest of the time on Grails would be adequate. I'll probably use the Groovy console to demonstrate the Groovy language concepts and a simple Grails app for explaining the conventions and structure of a Grails project. If anyone has a list of Groovy/Grails topics that I should cover, or even an outline of a similar course that they've given/taken, I'd be very grateful. Naturally, I will credit for any resources that I use during the course.
