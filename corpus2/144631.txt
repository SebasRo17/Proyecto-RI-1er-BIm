I'd like to know, why would I want to have a special prefixes for a function arguments, like "p_name", "p_age", "p_sex"? On the one hand it helps to distinguish parameter from local variable or field further in the function body, but would it help? On the other hand, I didn't saw such naming recommendations anywhere including official Java language conventions. Please advise any reasons for using such naming policy
