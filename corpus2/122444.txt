I little bit new to the CodeIgniter framework and this is my first project with this framework. During a chat on StackOverflow somebody said that we need to make controllers tiny as possible. Currently I have a default controller named `home` with 1332 lines of codes (and increasing) and a model named `Profunction` with 1356 lines of codes (and increasing). The controller class have about 46 functions on it and also with model class. I thought that Codeigniter can handle large Controllers or Models well, is there any problem/performance issue/security issues regarding this?
