I have some whitespace-separated matrix data that I read with `Import[..., "Table"]`. The data contained mixed strings and numbers (the strings are for row and column names). I noticed this weird behaviour:               ImportString["123c", "Table"]          (* ==> {{123}} *)      Mathematica ate the letter `c`!! Why? It doesn't eat any other letters:               ImportString["123a", "Table"]     (* {{"123a"}} *)          ImportString["123e", "Table"]     (* {{"123e"}} *)      What is the explanation and what is a good workaround? * * * **Update:** It seems that this happens even if the labels is quoted in the file:               ImportString["\"24c\"", "CSV"]          (* ==> {{24}} *)
