This is not a "classic" programming question, but it's related to our job. I develop and sell data driven web app for some customer, some small (10 employess or less), some bigger (1000-2000 employers). My questions are:   1. Can i sell my app with different prices, based on customer's "dimension" ? Is it common in "software market"..isn't ?   2. How can **"control" and maybe "limit to work" my asp.net web** app when customer exceed their limit license ? Are there some ready-made server side component to do that ? Thanks EDIT: Last question: how to _justify_ the higher price for big company against small price for smaller company ?
