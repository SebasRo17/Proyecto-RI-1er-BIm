Let's say I'd like to plot `Sign[x + 0.5]`:               Plot[Sign[x + 0.5], {x, -1, 1}]      _Mathematica_ will give this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BfCAp.jpg) This plot does not show very clearly the value of `Sign[x + 0.5]` at `x = -0.5`: is it 1? is it -1? No, it's 0, but there is no indication of which it is on the plot. This is what I'd like to achieve: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/raH5t.jpg) (I used Paint to add the markers.) How can I make it _Mathematica_ do it?
