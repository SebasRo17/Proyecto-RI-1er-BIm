I want to start looking for jobs in great companies and I have four years of enterprise corporations development, three years with C#.NET and alomst one year with Ruby On Rails, JS, etc... But when I look up interview questions from Google, Amazon, Fog Creek, DropBox, etc... they are really targeted at students that are coming fresh out of college and still remember what was Dynamic Programming and Dijkstra algorithms ... but I don't! :( It has been a while for me ... If a I need a sort algorithm I would either Google it or there already is a library and method that does it for me. So what should I do? Do they realize that this guy is not coming from college and will ask more general questions about software architecture or nop! I should go back find my old Data structures book from the storage and read them? In that case wht books and language do you recommend to hone my skills?
