If I add a legend using               Legended[..., SwatchLegend[..., ...]]      then I can explicitly set the legend marker size using the `LegendMarkerSize` option. But I also need to explicitly set the style/colour of the legend elements a second time within the legend expression. It is usually much more convenient to use the `PlotLegens` or the `ChartLegends` option. It spares me the trouble of having to manually match up the legens with the plot or chart. If I use this, can I still control the marker size? Example:               cm = 72/2.54;     BarChart[{{1, 2, 3}, {1, 3, 2}}, ChartLegends -> {"a", "b", "c"}, ImageSize -> 4 cm]      How can I control the legend marker size in the above graphic? Is there anything simpler than an explicit legend specification as below?               colours = {Red, Blue, Black};     Legended[      BarChart[{{1, 2, 3}, {1, 3, 2}}, ImageSize -> 4 cm, ChartStyle -> colours],      SwatchLegend[colours, {"a", "b", "c"}, LegendMarkerSize -> 7]     ]
