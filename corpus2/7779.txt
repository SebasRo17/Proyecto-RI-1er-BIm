As a self-taught programmer myself competing in an industry dominated by CS majors, I often find myself intimidated. I have a BA in liberal arts but have found that many "trained" programmers tend to look down and assume I have huge holes in my understanding of fundamentals. I tend to not tell anyone, unless I have to, that I learned this way to avoid the stigma. Would it be better to embrace how I learned or would it be more prudent to continue to deliver while being less than open about my background? Edit: I guess I did not mention this, but I actually have taken many CS classes, but I never had the time to get the actual paper with the random requirements attached. I have all the core stuff like data structures and algorithms, etc. I've found that I learned more on my own, however, I was primarily concerned with how this approach was viewed by employers and whatnot. Thanks for all of the great advice though!
