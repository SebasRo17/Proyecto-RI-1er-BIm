The following code generates an iterative mapping of some trigonometric functions. I have a couple questions about it. The first question is how to optimize this iterative process using mathematica's language and the second is about the result. Do you think the flower looking structures that appear in these plots are a result of some numerical instability or a true part of the mathematics? Additionally, I was trying to get the different listplots to show up in different colors. thx               k = 100000;     m = 5;     For[l = 0, l <= m, l++,       dt = .0001 + .0005 l; t = 0; x = RandomReal[{0, 2 \[Pi]}];        y = RandomReal[{0, 2 \[Pi]}];       xs = Table[0 , {n, 1, k}]; ys = Table[0 , {n, 1, k}];       For[n = 1, n <= k,          n++, {xp = x, yp = y, x = Cos[4 yp] Cos[t], y = Sin[xp] Sin[t],           xs[[n]] = x, ys[[n]] = y, t = t + dt}]        data =          Partition[Flatten[Table[{xs[[n]], ys[[n]]}, {n, 1, k}]], 2] // N;       Subscript[p, l] =         ListPlot[data, AxesOrigin -> {0, 0},          PlotStyle -> {Hue[l], PointSize[.001]}, AspectRatio -> 1]];     Art = Table[Subscript[p, n], {n, 0, m}];     Show[Art]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/EelaT.jpg) If you consider the frequency of the cosine term as a parameter $x_{n+1} = \cos(ay_n)\cos(t_n)$ a bifurcation occurs at approx. $a=2.939$.
