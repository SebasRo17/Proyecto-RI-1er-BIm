After half a year working for the company, I got two students to be leader for. So, I got some technical management responsibility. As I think, I should be not just a leader, but a teacher and the one who is example. What are common steps to educate junior developers? How to be not just a boss, who gives the task, but a 'senior fellow'? Is it appropriate to give some advices which are not properly related to coding(for example, human interaction and so on). I want to be a good leader for them, but don't have any experience in that and don't know what to begin from. Thanks.
