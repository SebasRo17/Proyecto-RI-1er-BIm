On the `AstronomicalData` page in the online reference, it says for               AstronomicalData["Sun", "NextRiseTime"]      that it finds the next rise time for the Sun **from your current location** and time. Where does _Mathematica_ keep that? I don't remember giving that during installation and I can't find it in the Preferences either. **edit**   Particularly the returned value               {2012, 9, 5, 7, 3, 52.704}      to 1 ms resolution suggests that the location is known to some precision. At the latitude where I live, 1 ms is 25 cm.
