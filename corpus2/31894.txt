I noticed that one can subtract a since real number value from all elements in an array by writing something like               {5, 4, 3, 2, 1} - 5      which outputs `{0, -1, -2, -3, -4}`. However, this doesn't seem to extend to coordinates, where we get an "objects of unequal length" error for a command like               {{5, 4}, {5, 2}, {5, 1}, {5, -5}} - {2, 2}      Is there a way to easily do make something like above work so that `{2,2}` is subtracted from each list item automatically?
