In my current job, there are no coding guidelines. Everyone pretty much codes the way he wants. Which is fine, since the company is small. However, one new guy recently proposed to always use Hungarian Notation. Until now, some of us used some sort of Hungarian Notation, some of us didn't. You know, it's an engineering company, so coding styles do not really matter as long as the algorithms are sound. Personally, I feel that these little type abbreviations are kind of redundant. A well thought-out name usually delivers the same message. (Furthermore, most of our code has to run on some weirdo DSPs, where a concept like `bool` or `float` doesn't exist anyway). So, how do you feel about Hungarian Notation? Do you use it? Why?
