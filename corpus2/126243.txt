I have 4+ years of experience in software engineering. I am well competent in system design, analysis and development. I have worked heavily in Java and C++ and I am confident about my technical skills. Now I am thinking of finding a job in the financial sector. What kind of resources should I be looking for? What are the keywords I should look for? E.g. "algorithmic trading" Are there any books targeting software engineers?
