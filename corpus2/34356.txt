So I just read some fabulous articles by Joel on specs here. (Was written in 2000!!) I read all 4 parts, but **Im looking for** some methodical approaches to writing my specs. Im the only lonely dev, working on this fairly complicated app (or family of apps) for a very well known finance company. I've never made something this serious, I started out writing something like a bad spec, an overview of some sorts, and it has wasted a LOT of my time. Ive also made 3 mockup-kinda-thingies for my client so I have a good understanding of what they want. Also released a preview (a throw away working app with the most basic workflow), and Ive only written and tested some of the very core/base systems. I think the mistake Ive been making so far is not writing a detailed spec, so Im getting to it now. So the whole thing comprises of   * An MVC website (for admins & data viewing)   * 2 Silverlight modules (For 2 specific tasks)   * 1 Desktop Application Im totally short on time, resources and need to get this done quick, also, need to make sure these guys read it up equally quick and painlessly.   * So **how** do I go about it, **Im looking** for any tips, any real world stuff, how do you guys usually do it?   * Do you make a mock screenie of every dialog/form/page? Im thinking of making a dummy asp.net web forms project, then filling in **html** files in folders and making it look like my mvc url structure. Then having a section in the spec for the website and write up a page for every URL Ive got with a screenie. For my win forms app, Ive made somewhat of a demo Win Form project, **would I** then put in a dialog or stucture everything as I would in the real app and then screen shot it? * * * For some background into this question. I've always been a crazy jump-to-code kinda guy, which has worked ok, but for the app I'm working on, its not only complex, its for a very very reputed and large company and I have to get it right! (And it has been going well so far, today I gave a demo of the preview version which a lot of people liked!! =D ) If I do get the initial design right I will also have a great business with this company, there are already many thinking about new "awesome" features which they're ready to pay for.
