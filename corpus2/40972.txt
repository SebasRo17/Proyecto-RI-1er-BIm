I use the following code to draw a parametric plot, with `Epilog` to add a point, and text using `Graphics`.               graf7 = ParametricPlot[  { delta18[t], delta2D[t]}, {t, 0, 800},        Epilog -> {Red, PointSize[Large],           Point[{ delta18[0] , delta2D[0]} ],           Line[{{20, 160}, {-50, -400}}] } ,        AspectRatio -> 1, PlotLabel -> "d18O vs dD (g/kgda)",        PlotStyle -> Thick, PlotRange -> All, ImageSize -> Medium        ];          Show[graf7,       Graphics[Text["Dot is at surface", {-10.6, -89.4}]],       Graphics[Text["Black line is MWL ", {-10.6, -89.6}]]  ]      For now, it works fine. I experimented with the equations that find the original arguments, `delta18[t]` and `delta2D[t]`, so their value ranges change drastically, and the inserted text is no longer in the plot region. How can I make the text appear at a _relative_ position within the plot, so it is never outside the plot region?
