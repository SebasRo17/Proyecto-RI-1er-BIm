I am not yet accustomed with the way Git works (And wonder if someone besides Linus is ;)). If you use Heroku to host you application, you need to have your code checked in a Git repo. If you work on an open-source project, you are more likely going to share this repo on Github or other Git hosts. Some things should not be checked in the public repo; database passwords, API keys, certificates, etc... But these things still need to be part of the Git repo since you use it to push your code to Heroku. How to work with this use case? Note: I know that Heroku or PHPFog can use server variables to circumvent this problem. My question is more about how to "hide" parts of the code.
