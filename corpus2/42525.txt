I am trying to generalize a `Manipulate` construct into a `DynamicModule` one to try and include smoother controls, but I seem to be running afoul of `Dynamic`'s compartmentalization of my intermediate variables inside what used to be a `Module`. More specifically, I used to have a construct of the form               Manipulate[      Module[{y},       y = f[x];       {x, g[y]}       ]      , {x, 0, 1}]      including (a large number of) intermediate expressions like `y=f[x]`, and which produced output like ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/A0kMx.png) I now want to move control of the variable `x` into the `Module` \- essentially, into a `LocatorPane` command - but I don't know what the correct translation of the code above should be. My naive attempt is to so something like               DynamicModule[{x, y},      y = f[x];      {Slider[Dynamic[x]], Dynamic[x], Dynamic[g[y]]}      ]      and this produces no errors but the output inside `g` fails to update: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nKczx.png) What is the correct generalization of the `Manipulate[Module[ ... ] ]` combination? I have tried inserting `Dynamic` commands in all possible combinations but I cannot seem to get them right. I know the answer is probably fairly basic, but I'm also a bit lost in the maze of tutorials for these commands. Obviously, simply doing `{Slider[Dynamic[x]], Dynamic[x], Dynamic[f[g[y]]]}` is not an option in my case. The intermediate calculations `f[x]` are quite a few and very verbose, and the 'displayable' function `g[y]` is actually several rather long and slow plotting commands. I need to do the central bit of the computation only once, and I do not want to repeat myself in giving it to the plotting commands. What am I missing here? It feels very basic but I can't seem to get it right.
