One more question for today: I'm trying to show two random integers with a plus (+) sign between them, in an unevaluated form. I know how Hold and HoldForm work, but they hold everything, including the RandomInteger:               Hold[RandomInteger[100] + RandomInteger[100]]      I've tried then Evaluate before RandomInteger, but that doesn't seem to do the trick. Any help with this? Very much appreciated, as always!
