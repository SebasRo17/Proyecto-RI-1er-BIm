I would like to perform a permutation test on a particularly large data set, i.e. around 4 million entries. Basically, I need to get some number of random permutations of this data set. Usual way to do this, is a Fisher-Yates shuffle, but it's pretty much limited by period of a PRNG. That is, to a sequence no longer than around 2080. Is there a solution to randomly permuting much larger sequences? EDIT: Here is an interesting related discussion on random shuffle algorithms and how much are they limited by RNG.
