A friend and me are working on a webapp. We're using git so each of us has a local copy of the app. But the problem is the database. We want to be able to see the latest changes the other person made. From what I understand, we have two options:   * Host the database on a server   * Add the .sql file to every commit we make. For the first option, we might expose our system to some risks (which I'm scared of). For the second option, we're adding unnecessary work to our daily tasks (importing the .sql file and then creating the .sql file). I'm new to this stuff - so any suggestions are welcome!
