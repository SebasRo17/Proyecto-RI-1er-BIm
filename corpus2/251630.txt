I'm trying to learn about Agile methodologies through the Head First Software Development book and after reading about it, I've tried to apply the concept of User Stories to a recent mini-project (set of new features added to an existing application). Besides the fact that I have a hard time not thinking in terms of "tasks", I've also had trouble with the fact the client has asked things in a way that, to me, include implementation. For example, instead of asking "we want Limited Users to have an Address now, just like Regular Users" and leaving the rest to us, they would say "we want Limited Users to appear in the same list as Regular Users and we want them to have an Address too, and it should be editable in the same Address Editing screen as Regular Users". It seems to me that User Stories are meant to express a business need, but not its technical implementation, nor its UI implementation. That said, does it make sense that a client would impose its vision of the UI and have that be their business need? How would I turn the client's request into one or more User Stories? Should I say "woah there! Tell me your ultimate goals and we'll see how we can get the UI to accomodate them later"? Should I make multiple stories, one for the main business need (Limited Users have an Address) and additional ones for the UI requests? Should I just make the business need a single story and have other concerns as details / acceptance tests? Admittedly I'm quite wet behind the ears when it comes to Agile and User Stories and I have trouble defining how much goes into them and where the rest would go too.
