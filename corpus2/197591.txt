This question could be titled "Place password hash and salt in query string?" as well to be less subjective, but the point remains the same: I want to create kind of a launcher application for my web application, which should allow the user to specify his credentials to auto login into my web application. Now since plaintext is almost always awful, I thought about passing the password hash and salt as a querystring to my application to perform an auto login. Something like: http://myapp.com/login/?autologin=true&passwordhash=foo&salt=bar But I wonder if there is any better or more secure way instead of doing this?
