I believe that the answer to this may be obvious to some of you, but I just can't think of anything that works. NIntegrate, NDSolve, etc, all throw a temper tantrum when they have to divide by zero, and it's not really an issue that an InterpolatingFunction can deal with either. Is there any way to approach this? **EDIT** Example: If I just type               Plot[NIntegrate[Tan[u],{u,0,x}],{x,0,2Pi}]      I am going to get an error immediately, at least in the form of a graph that goes insane. I can kind of try to get around that by doing this:               ntan[x_] := FunctionInterpolation[Tan[x],{x,0,2Pi}]     Plot[NIntegrate[Tan[u], {u, 0, x}], {x, 0, 2 Pi}      This immediately throws some errors, and you get a plot that is certainly not right. The very large values ruin the calculation completely! This is definitely not right. I know with Tan[x] you can just easily integrate it and plot it and all is well, but I'm curious how to get a more general way of plotting integrals of functions with singularities that cannot be easily integrated.
