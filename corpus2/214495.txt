I've been working on a utility app for a while, and when we're in the final phases the boss is asking for adding user behavior and location tracking and was explicit about publishing them to 3rd party developers to make use of them. He seems to have set his mind about it, is there anything I can/should do about it? Clarify: if you are an app developer who's asked to add data gathering of the app users and publishing it, is there anything you should say against it ?
