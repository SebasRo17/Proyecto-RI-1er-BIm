How do I track which rows were swapped in the Gaussian elimination using RowReduce? I am doing metabolic control analysis on a mathematical of the energy metabolism I have in Mathematica. I need to do several matrix operations including a Gaussian elimination. For my control analysis I need to know which rows were swapped and where they are after the elimination. Is there a way to let Mathematica also give me the final position of the original rows after the elimination? Thank you very much, Anne-Claire
