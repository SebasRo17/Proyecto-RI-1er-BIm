I want to find a function $w=f(x,y,z)$ that fits experimentally determined values of w. For example, assume               x = {1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2}          y = {1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3}          z = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}      and experiments have given               w = {.531, .341, .163, .641, .713, -0.40e-1}      I want to fit this data according to this relationship:               w = x^a + (b x^2)/y + c y z      How can I find the constants a, b and c and estimate the error the model produces?
