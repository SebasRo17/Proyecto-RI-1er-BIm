Recently, I found multiple GitHub repositories that would allow me to perform the same task. (In my case, assess the readability of text strings.) It made me wonder, what are the best practices for programmers to choose between different open-source libraries, and in particular, libraries hosted on GitHub? GitHub statistics of users who watch, star, or fork a repository are one option, but are there others?
