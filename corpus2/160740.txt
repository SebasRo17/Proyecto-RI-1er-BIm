I'm a chess enthusiast and a programmer. I recently decided to start making a chess engine using my chess and programming knowledge. So here's my question: What language (I'm familiar with Java, C++ and Python) and methodology should I adapt while writing a chess engine? A little guidance would be much appreciated. **Edit:** So I decided to make it in JavaScript. I download this Chess UI from github and now I'm all set! My first step would be to write legal moves for it. So can anybody point me in the right direction? (I'm new to jQuery but have alot of programming experience). P.S: I'm not trying to make a very efficient engine (I know its way too difficult), I just want to get familiar with the process and learn some new techniques along the way.
