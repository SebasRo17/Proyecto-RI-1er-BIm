I am planning to buy a GPS enabled android phone and develop an Augmented Reality application (which will point the locations in front of camera). All i found about GPS is that it just tells the location of the device, how do i get the direction where camera is pointing, and height of device? how to make compass (2D, 3D) with GPS enabled phone? Is responsibility of phone to tell the direction? **(please correct, if i asked this question at wrong place)**
