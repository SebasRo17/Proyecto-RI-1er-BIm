How difficult would it be for someone with a college degree in social science to land their first job as a junior developer? This is assuming they have experience with open source projects, have a reasonable amount of small projects of their own written in various languages, and a passion for developing software. Would a degree that is not in computer science, electrical engineering, math etc. harm their chances? Thank you.
