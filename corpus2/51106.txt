I have the following               p[c1_, c2_, w_] := Exp[(-2*ω/(σ^2))*(c2^2 + ω^2*c1^2)]*                        Exp[(-1/(2*Σ))*(w - α*c2 - β*c1)^2]          SolveAlways[-D[c2*p[c1, c2, w], c1] +                   D[((2*ω)*c2 + ((ω)^2)*c1)*p[c1, c2, w], c2] +                  (1/2)*(σ^2)*D[p[c1, c2, w], {c2, 2}] -                  D[(c2*(1 - 2*Sqrt[3]) - c1*(Sqrt[3]*ω))*p[c1, c2, w], w] +                  (3/2)*((σ/ω)^2)*D[p[c1, c2, w], {w, 2}] == 0, {c1, c2, w, σ, ω}]      I am trying to solve for any `α, β, Σ` (in terms of `c1, c2, w, σ, ω`) that satisfies the previous equation. However, nothing results.
