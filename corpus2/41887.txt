I'm a total newbie in mathematica, so need some help. I understand that my question is about basics, but i couldn't find the answer in docs, google and here. Here is what i'm trying to do.               For[i = 1, i < 10, i++,      Quiet[s =          NMinimize[{Abs[x1] + Abs[x2] + Abs[x3] + Abs[x4] + Abs[x5],            Abs[0.055*(x1 + 11) + 0.065*(x2 - 13) + 0.068*(x3 - 47) +                0.071*(x4 - 50) + 0.07*(x5 - 43) + 0.852] <= 0.30 * i &&             Abs[-8.567*(x1 + 11) - 9.057*(x2 - 13) - 9.154*(x3 - 47) -                8.937*(x4 - 50) - 8.608*(x5 - 43) - 1359.469] <= 6 &&             Abs[55.818*(x1 + 11) + 62.22*(x2 - 13) + 64.286*(x3 - 47) +                64.945*(x4 - 50) + 63.306*(x5 - 43) + 4747.69] <=              1650}, {x1, x2, x3, x4, x5},           Method -> "DifferentialEvolution"]]            AppendTo[sols_nested_list, s]???      ]      Here AppendTo is wrond, but i need something like {{f,x1,x2,x3,x4,x5},{f,x1,x2,x3,x4,x5}...} How can i do this? Thanks in andvance.
