I have empirical data that describes a 2-dimensional Probability Density Function and I want to visualize that data in a meaningful way using Mathematica. My first instinct is to use a 2D Heat map style plot, where high probabilities would be shown in red, and low in blue or white. However I am a novice when it comes to Mathematica's visualization power so I would like some community input. Is there a better way to visualize this data?
