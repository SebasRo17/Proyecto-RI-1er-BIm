Is there a built in function (or a function in one of the standard packages) that allows you to compute the probability of exactly one event occurring out of some known set of probabilities for N independent events? Ideally what I'd want is something with a signature like:               Pr[independentProbabilities__] := ...       To give an example, suppose I have a process that produces a letter from the set {A, B, C, D, X} with probabilities: $$P(A) = 0.1\text{, } P(B) = 0.22\text{, } P(C) = 0.17\text{, } P(D) = 0.28$$ what is the probability that _exactly one_ of the possibilities (A, B, C, or D) occurs?
