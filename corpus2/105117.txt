This is sort of a follow-up to my previous question Should We Quit Trying to Do Agile if QA Takes 12 Weeks? For the second time in as many sprints, we've set a sprint review that is scheduled to feature just a single issue that essentially amounts to an obscure bug fix or at most an esoteric enhancement to some small portion of our product. The only real stakeholders for this issue are the single developer and the customer who opened the issue. It seems to me that given these parameters, we are probably better off just not doing a sprint review. Is there a general consensus on what types of stories should be discussed during a sprint review and what should be left out, or should everything be fair game? We haven't been doing retrospectives at all unfortunately, so unless that changes, that reason is kind of out as a reason to go ahead with the review.
