When I start learning a new language, I have a couple of simple implementations that I like to complete to familiarise myself with the language. Currently, I write:   1. **Fibonacci and/or factorial** to get the hang of writing and calling methods, and basic recursion   2. **Djikstras shortest path** (with a node type) to get to grips with making classes (or whatever the language equivalent is) with methods and properties, and also using them in slightly more complex code. I was wondering: **does anybody else have any techniques or tools they like to use when getting off the ground in a new language?** I'm always looking for new things to add to my "start-up routine".
