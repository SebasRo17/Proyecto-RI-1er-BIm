I'm looking for an algorithm that would be able to determine the optimal combination of two variables, but I'm not sure where to start looking. For example, if I have 10,000 rows in a database and each row contains price, and square feet is there any algorithm out there that will be able to determine what combination of price and sq ft is optimal. I know this is vague, but I assume is along the lines of Fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets, but I'm not sure and I'd like to start digging in the right field to see if I can come up with something that solves my problem.
