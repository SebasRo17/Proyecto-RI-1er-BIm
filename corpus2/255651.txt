I have a button that will be disabled until you send out a tweet that I have crafted. Only users with twitter accounts will have access to this, and I will require users to sign-in to be able to access this button. What kind of tools are available for me to check whether   1. The user has actually tweeted it   2. The user has not deleted the tweet afterwards Now, there is no way to actually stop the user from deleting the tweet, but I would like to disable the button if the user has actually chosen to delete it afterwards.
