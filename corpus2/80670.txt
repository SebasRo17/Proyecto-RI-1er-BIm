I am currently using VB.net 2010 and WPF 4 to create an application, but the further I learn it, the more I realize that the two programming languages may not meet my needs, especially where I have to migrate a version to a web-based Silverlight platform. With this in mind, I'm thinking of dumping the Microsoft programming languages all together before I get further into this project, and build this entire thing over again in a cross-platform language. This brings me to my question: I need the graphic capabilities of WPF, which I know is in the Flash platform, but I also need a language I can migrate my VERY complex VB.net core code into; thus, I'm thinking using Python. Are these two languages capable of working side by side? Alternatively, can I convert all my Vb.net code into ActionScript, instead of using two languages?   Is there another alternative to consider? Open source is the best, though I know ActionScript isn't, by any means open source. This is a strictly commercial project. Thank you!
