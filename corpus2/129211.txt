I'm in a position where my developers are asking to learn design patterns. So far we have done a book club reading Heads First Design Patterns. During this we worked through examples and talked about how to apply this to areas of our own products. The problem is that these exercises didn't stick and they continue to ask to learn them. This post has some great example of books we could use, but I'm also looking for techniques on how to teach the information. So what have you done to teach other developers design patterns?
