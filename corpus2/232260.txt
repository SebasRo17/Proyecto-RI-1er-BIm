I am working on project on which I need to open-source part of my code in order to simplify extension by the enduser. What I want, is to make an npm module, that will expose part of my code, so my users can build extensions for the product (in JavaScript), but I want a guarantee that this code will not be used for commercial or other development work, beside extensions for my product. I found **Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial NoDerivs** license to be a fit. **My problem:** Can **I** , as the author of this code, use it in a commercial closed-source application? **Disclaimer:** I know this is kind of a legal question, but please, state what you think, no one is holding you accountable/liable for it. Thanks.
