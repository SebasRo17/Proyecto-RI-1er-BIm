I have got class with 30 variables (it is application form), so I wonder what is the best practice to organize class creation. Should I use huge constructor:               MyClass mc = new MyClass(a, b, c, d)      Or setters:               MyClass mc = new MyClass();     mc.setA(a);     mc.setB(b);     mc.setC(c);     mc.setD(d);      What is the best practice in OOP for such situation? I saw similar question, but now I don't need immutability.
