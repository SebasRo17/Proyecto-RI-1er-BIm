I have a giant list `l1` and some smaller lists `l21`, `l21`, ..., `l2n`. The `l1` is the superset and has $\tilde{}10^7$ elements. `l2?` is subset of `l1` (if my other code does correct job). All lists only contain numbers (again, if my code does correct job). I need to take complement of `l1` and each of the `l2?`. The number of subsets (i.e. `n`) is several hundreds. What's the most memory/time efficient way of doing this? I run this on 4GB machine and usually have 1.* GB of free memory when the program reaches that stage. I'd probably save numbers in file and use some command-line tool like `grep` to do this. But the original lists are all prepared in a Mathematica program. If there is a good solution in Mathematica then i'd like to avoid going out.
