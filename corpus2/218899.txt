I work on a company that have a payment system that runs under a executable kiosk instance of internet explorer 7. when the application is running the process name is not similar with iexplore.exe or something like that. The name of the windows process is the same as the executable.exe. We cannot run the system under a local webserver because the executable expect some pages in pure .html to process the data and give the users change. The executable pass information to the .html forms and vice-versa. So we cannot user another browser. I think selenium will not work with this browser. Any idea how i can automate tests on the interface? **EDIT** Selenium fail trying to start my executable: _Exception: Failed to start new browser session: org.openqa.selenium.server.RemoteCommandException: Error while launching browser_ I think the executable its not the browser itself. Its just a executable that make some security tasks and after that call a internet explorer instance somehow. But the internet explorer process donÂ´t appear on the windows process.
