What policy do developers have when it comes to supporting earlier versions of Android? I still support , but this means that I am unable to use features such as the action bar. Over 40% of my users are still running versions below 3.0, so I feel somewhat constrained about this. The problem is that 3.x was not very successful, so 2.3.x will be with us for some time. But all new devices will now be shipping with 4.x. I am wondering whether 4.x users are more likely to pay for an app, while most 2.3.x users are just looking. **Update:** With a little effort, I have found that I am able to implement action bars and Holo themes, and still support Android 2.1. All this without recourse to an external library. The only feature that I am still stuck with is tab bars. These do work with action bars, but not in the approved style. For that I would need fragments, which requires Android 3.0. I only have two tab bars though, so it is not a big deal.
