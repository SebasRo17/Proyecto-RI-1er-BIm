I have an external java application which use JDBC as to reach an MySQL database. This will be used by many people and is going to store all the people's data on the same server / MySQL. As I bet people will be able to crack the .jar and see the source, I expect them to be able to cheat the program by editing it and making it get information from other users even when they are not allowed to reach said information. Is there any standard way to protect a server so people should only be able to reach the information their account is connected to even if said people are able to change the source? Cheers, Skarion
