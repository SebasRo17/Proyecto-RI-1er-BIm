We have a project that was written over a period of 2 years, but has a poorly designed architecture and not unit tests. The software works well, but we're at the point where we want to refactor some core modules. The budget is also limited so we can not hire a sufficient number of developers to write unit tests. Would generating unit test code automatically to cover (as an example) integration scenarios via some too be a viable strategy? An assumpion is that considering the system works fine right now, and the its output can be converted into XML data for unit testing? This approach gives us a possibility of quickly starting to refactor existing code and receieve immediate feedback if some core functionality is broken because of those changes.
