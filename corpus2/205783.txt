Function `A()` calls `B()` calls `C()`, which encounters an error. Which function writes to the log and which function reports to the user? My first inclination is that all functions should write to the log, and that the inner-most UI-facing function should be responsible for outputting the error to the user. However, the _fix_ needs to be done in `C()`, so perhaps instead of having an super-long log file which will take a while to parse, I should simply have the function which encountered the error log the error and the parameters used to call it. Likewise, I'm not too convinced that the inner-most UI-facing function should output the error (consider CLI apps, as opposed to web or GUI apps). That was more of a gut-feeling decision, so any insight into actually _engineering_ a solution would be appreciated.
