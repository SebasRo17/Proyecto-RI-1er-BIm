I'm trying to make a iso surface plot from some data using ContourPlot3d. My data is a 3 dimension data with form like `{{x,y,f[x,y]},...}`. I first make this data into 4d by rotating it along the x axis, so that `{x,y,f[x,y]}` becomes `{x,y,z,f[x,y,z]}`. Then interpolate them and plot the interpolated function. But sometimes I get a broken surface. Here is the detail:               Get["https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/24667921/data.dat"];     f = Interpolation[data];     f3d[x_, y_, z_] := f[x, Sqrt[y^2 + z^2]];          ContourPlot3D[      Abs[f3d[x, y, z]]^2, {x, -15, 15}, {y, -15, 15}, {z, -15, 15},       Mesh -> None, PlotPoints -> 20, Contours -> {1*^-6},       ViewPoint -> {1.3, -1.3, 2.9}, ViewVertical -> {0.2, -1, 0.2},       Axes -> False, Boxed -> False, ImageSize -> 300]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/AwyGu.png) We can see two dark spot on the surface. If I remove the `PlotPoints->20`, the holes are gone. And this seems not caused by the same reason from this post, because I still see the broken surface as I exported to pov file and rendered in povray. For my problem I can't just remove the `PlotPoints->20` option, because I have to generate the same kind of plots from a serial of data. And I have to set a PlotPoints to a number to make sure the contour can be found. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0yG0r.png)
