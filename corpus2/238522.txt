My team does 2-week sprints, and the trend we've identified (which we want to move away from) is that our daily standup scrums are relatively straightforward early in the sprint, but then transform into a more frantic scramble toward the end. The first week developers are heads down in coding, analysts are developing test plans and answering developer questions, and testers are refining existing tests and identifying areas to test (but not necessarily testing just yet since there isn't as much out there actually ready to test). Blockers and scope creep tend to emerge into the second week, and then as we see how close we're getting to the end, we force ourselves to make tough choices and be more communicative. How can we "spread the wealth" and increase the overall "tempo" (I guess?) of our scrums from the beginning of the sprint to the end?
