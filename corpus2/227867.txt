For an academic exercise, we have been tasked with creating a small website. We have already gathered the requirements and fleshed out the business domain to see the classes we are supposed to support. It is to be on Microsoft stack, so I decided to use _ASP MVC_ with _code first Entity Framework_. I am now looking for the best way to split up a 6 man team in order to best tackle the project. **TLDR:** What are some effective ways of splitting up an ASP MVC project so that multiple developers can work on it concurrently? I have researched where projects have been split across the tiers, i.e. _database, business, views_ , and such, but I don't exactly know how to instruct them to go about designing a view for which there is no controller. Is splitting it up between the different business models used a decent strategy? I have read that this has led to an application that didn't mesh well, due to the different aesthetics.
