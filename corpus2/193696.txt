I was reading this article: A Critique of Common Lisp and finding it hard to make out the precise definition of "stock-hardware machine" and its difference with "micro-coded" machines. I tried to search for a precise definition of the former to no avail. What I currently construe stock-hardware machine to be is that, it refers to the computer chip-set commonly available in the market (without much customization). So given that I would like to ask, what is meant by a stock-hardware machine (in the context of the paper) and how does it differ from a micro-coded machine?
