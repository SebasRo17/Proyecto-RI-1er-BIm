I would like to add a `Locator` to a figure displayed by `Manipulate` when I click inside the figure, at the location where I click, and to have this trigger an update of the figure. I would also like to have clicking on an existing `Locator` remove it, and dragging a locator reposition it (again, redrawing the figure in response in each case). For (a silly) example, I would like clicking anywhere in the region displayed by               With[{locs = {}},       Manipulate[Graphics[Text[locs, {0, 0}], PlotRange -> 2],       {{q, {1, 1}}, Locator,         Appearance -> Graphics[{Green, Disk[{0, 0}, .1]}, ImageSize -> 10]},       {{p, locs}, Locator,         Appearance -> Graphics[{Red, Disk[{0, 0}, .1]}, ImageSize -> 10]}]]      to add the corresponding `Point` to `locs`, and for clicking on any `p` `Locator` to remove it from `locs`, with the text, updating accordingly in response to additions, deletions or repositionings of a `Locator`. To make things hard, I have another locator `q` that needs to coexist with the one to which I would like to add/remove; and `p` and `q` have different appearances.
