We have three applications developed in **Flex** and all these use BlazeDS. These applications have their own authentication implementations **(Database)**. Also they will be deployed in **tomcat**. Deploying all these applications in the same tomcat instance is acceptable for us. We want to bring the authentication credentials of all these applications into a single place and also provide **SSO feature between these applications**. We also want the authentication module to be **configurable**. Something like the system administrator can decide if the authentication should be done against **a database or LDAP**. Say, if the user successfully logs into app1, and when he access app2 in the same browser he should be automatically logged in. Same goes for logout as well. We have been exploring **OpenAM, jGuard and JOSSO**. I'm not sure if these require lot of customization to work with **Flex**. I would like to know how people are implementing SSO for Flex applications. **Is there a common and simple SSO solution available for Flex based applications ?**
