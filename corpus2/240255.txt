Suppose I had a grammar like:               object          { members }      members          pair     pair         string : value      value          number         string     string          " chars "      chars          char         char chars      number         digit         digit number      I could parse the following example: `{ "one" : 1234 }` As far as I understand, I should have the tokens `object`, `members`, `pair`, `value`, `string` and `chars`. Tokenizing the example should produce               object         ->members             ->pair                 ->"one"                 ->"1234"      Parsing the tokens should produce               object         ->pair             ->"one"             ->1234      It seems to me like the tokenizer is either useless or I don't fully understand what a it should do. What is the responsibility of a tokenizer? What is the benefit of a tokenizer over parsing the original string?
