I need to set up a rather complicated `Grid[]` and I've run into a curious problem. I've reduced it to a simple example. See the following 2 sets of code and their output:                   plot = Plot[Sin[x], {x, 0, 6 Pi}, ImageSize -> 175];         Grid[          {           {1, 2, 3, 4, 5},           {2, "x", "x", "A long title... ", 70000},           {3, "xx", "xx", "", ""},           {4, "xxx", SpanFromLeft, plot, SpanFromLeft},           {5, "xxxx", SpanFromLeft, SpanFromAbove, SpanFromBoth},           {6, "xxxxx", SpanFromLeft, SpanFromAbove, SpanFromBoth},           {7, "xxxxxx",  SpanFromLeft, SpanFromAbove, SpanFromBoth},           {8, "xxxxxxx", SpanFromLeft, SpanFromAbove, SpanFromBoth},           {9, "xxxxxxxx", SpanFromLeft, SpanFromAbove, SpanFromBoth},           {10, "xxxxxxxxx", SpanFromLeft, SpanFromAbove, SpanFromBoth}          } ,          Alignment -> {Left, Top}          ]              "-----------------------------"              Grid[          {           {1, 2, 3, 4, 5},           {2, "x", "x", "A long title... ", 70000},           {3, "xx", "xx", "", ""},           {4, "xxx", "", plot, SpanFromLeft},           {5, "xxxx", SpanFromLeft, SpanFromAbove, SpanFromBoth},           {6, "xxxxx", SpanFromLeft, SpanFromAbove, SpanFromBoth},           {7, "xxxxxx",  SpanFromLeft, SpanFromAbove, SpanFromBoth},           {8, "xxxxxxx", SpanFromLeft, SpanFromAbove, SpanFromBoth},           {9, "xxxxxxxx", SpanFromLeft, SpanFromAbove, SpanFromBoth},           {10, "xxxxxxxxx", SpanFromLeft, SpanFromAbove, SpanFromBoth}          } ,          Alignment -> {Left, Top}          ]      Output: ![Grids](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PgnZu.png) Both grids have 10 rows x 5 columns. They have identical code excepting for the position at row 4 column 3:   * 1st grid has SpanFromLeft at that position.    * 2nd grid has "" at the same position. Immediately to the left of row 4 column 3 I have the plot. Can anyone explain why I get such different alignment in the two grids?
