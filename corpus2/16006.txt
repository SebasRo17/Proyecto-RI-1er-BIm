How can I use the new symbolic matrix/tensor capabilities to verify matrix identities, such as ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rbU71.gif) (1) or ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YwVpc.gif) (2) Even better, how can I ask Mathematica to derive expressions for X, Y, Z, and U like the ones shown on the RHS of (2) (many equivalent forms exist) (and as a bonus, display them similarly).
