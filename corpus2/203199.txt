Due to financial problems, I couldn't go for CSE in my country and had to settle for a BCIS honors degree. Now, after quite some time, when I want to go for a higher position in software development then I get asked about algorithms and basics that I have missed back in uni. This is affecting my chances of getting selected and I cannot afford that any longer. My question would be that what you would suggest smn like me to do in order to cover the 'basics' without any university or educational institute e.g. books,learn C++,etc? Any suggestion (including -ve) is welcomed and appreciated.
