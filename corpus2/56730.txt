I create Mathematica application. For example testPrj. Now I want load this application for test. Here is a problem: how can I setup environment for loading my application with simple `<<testPrj`? First what I try is to add to a `$Path` path of my application. But it should be done every time after loading Mathematica (any notebook). PS: My application has a custom way and it is better not to change
