I'm working for a company that has been developing a series of products for years with little to no unit testing in place. They want to move to TDD and unit test new code going forward. However, I'm concerned about the lack of testability of the old code and where to draw the line between old and new. Has anyone had experience with layering unit testing onto brownfield software like this? If so, could you recommend some effective approaches?
