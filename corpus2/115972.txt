I have an upcoming speaking engagement at a local University and will be address students in a 102 computer science course. Being more of an introductory course, there will be comp sci majors, along with some business/comp sci hybrid majors, as well as Math and Physics majors. It is one of those 'see someone from the real world with your degree' type things. The professor's requested topic is what career opportunities does a student have when they have some programming courses under their belt. Now, my degree was a B.S. in Comp Sci and my entire experience (5 years out of school) has been in what you would generically label the 'business world' (first job was for a consulting firm, my current job is for a company in distribution). I was hoping to get outside opinions so that I'm not just pulling from my own experience for these college students. What opportunities exist for students that have some degree and ability to program/develop software outside of the business world? (ie. research and grant type work, military/government, etc.) How can the skills learned in programming courses help you beyond developing software? (Being able to better communicate with an I.T. staff is something I thought of) Any other benefits you can think of would be appreciated! Thanks!
