Yesterday, I was doing any Tables of 15 graphs similar to the next example, to save .eps and use in latex. In the generation of the graphs Mathematica spends many time. Is possible to reduce this time, and work for the cpu? I found that Mathematica save .eps with a big (not necessary) size. between 4 and 5 MB. When it´s obvious that for this image 400 or 500 KB is enough. So... how to obtain eps from MAthematica with a reasonable size (10-20% of the size that I have commented) In this example               ContourPlot[peaks[x, y], {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 3},       ColorFunction -> "DarkRainbow", ContourLines -> False,       Contours -> 25, LabelStyle -> {Bold, 20},       Epilog -> {Black, PointSize -> .036, Point[ {{1, 2}, {1.5, 2.5}}],         Cyan, PointSize -> .036, Point[ {{-1, 2}, {-1.5, 2.5}}]},       ImageSize -> 300]      Yesterday I resolve the problem, saving jpg/png and converting to .eps to can use in latex, because I put 12 or 15 images per page, and don´t need a high quality, but I would like any solutions to this issue.
