This is a question regarding engineers with 20+ years experience, but it is a question for everybody, as it has to do with career development. I'm in a surprisingly long job hunt, and the problem seems to be that employers will not accept me as a coder. Yes, I have done lots of things, had my own company, sold it too early, etc. But the world always needs productive workers, and my skills are current and sharp. The market I am in has fewer openings for senior people, and I don't mind taking a step or two back if I can find a place to contribute. What are your thoughts about career management that prepares the 40, 50 year-old for a sudden career disruption?
