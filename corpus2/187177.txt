In environments where software is built internally by one team and then that software is used by other internal teams, how does one decide what the required quality should be for the produced artefacts? For example:   1. documentation completeness and accuracy   2. extensibility/re-usability of artefact (without hacking at source code)   3. defects   4. etc I guess one aspect to consider is the length of time into a project before quality is considered. It should be more cost effective to ensure quality is built into a product from the start rather than leaving it until later in the project life-cycle.
