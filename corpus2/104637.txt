Whilst installing Ruby on OsX I noticed I could do so by using a package manager called Homebrew. This seemed like an easy option, so I took it. Everything worked smoothly. Life was good. Being a curious fellow, I looked into what other benefits having homebrew installed would give me, and in my study found that Homebrew is written in ruby. Woah, wait a minute! How is it then, that I can install Ruby using something that is written in Ruby, not already having Ruby on my system, and once installed said ruby based system I STILL have to install ruby separetely? **Warning:** _Do not read this question aloud. You risk getting a Kaiser Chiefs single stuck in your head for the remainder of the day._
