Objective-C features nice object orientation, simplicity, elegance, and (as a superset of C), low level ability. It could seem like the simple, modern alternative to C++ that many people look for and try to find in Go. But it is just used at Cocoa and post-NextSTEP environments, and even in this case is seen more as a burden for historical reasons than as an optimal choice. Why it's not more widely used then? What are its problems?
