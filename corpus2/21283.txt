This is my first question. I'm fairly new to _Mathematica_ and completely new to SE, so I apologize if this question is trivial. I'm working on a problem that requires a function to be redefined several times and applied to data. My "function generator" (not sure if this is the proper application of this term) looks like this:               makeLine[{m_, b_}] := line = Function[{x, y}, y - m x - b]      The idea being that the program can call line several times and then redefine it and call it again. I was hopeful that I could do something like this:               Module[{line}, makeLine[{1, 0}]]      to avoid defining line as a global function, but it doesn't work.               ?line      > Global`line   >  line = Function[{x\$, y\$}, y\$ - 1 x\$ - 0] So, is it possible to do this? If not, can someone suggest an alternate construct that does essentially the same thing?
