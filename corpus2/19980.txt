My question is based on the discussion that I started: Plot, extract data to a file The method proposed works well for the `Plot` command, but what about `LogLinearPlot`? This was the original motivation when I started the thread. I wanted to extract the data for `LogLinearPlot`, because I wanted a tighter grid for r $\approx$ 0. Otherwise, I could have just used `Table` and wouldn't have started the thread. This doesn't work with `Table`, which produces a uniform grid. Anyways, this is my code:               LogLinearPlot[{f[r]*r, 0}, {r, 0.0001, 1000}, PlotRange -> {-0.5, 0.2}, MaxRecursion -> 15]     data = Cases[%, Line[data_] :> data, -4, 1][[1]];     Export["~/Desktop/1.dat", SetAccuracy[%, 10], Alignment -> Center]      _The catch is that it produces a relative positions of the points on the **r** axis for the 1st column ( **r** coordinates of the points they would have if the **r** -axis wasn't set to be logarithmic on the plot)._ For example,               -9.210340043    -0.044128619     -9.210320733    -0.04412862      ......      whereas I was expecting something like this:                0.000110000    -0.044128619      0.000170000    -0.04412862      ........         The origin of the "fictitious" and real axes coincide. How do I get the actual values of **r**?
