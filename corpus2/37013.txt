As a manager, I can't always end up generating work that'd be cutting edge. Some of the projects do run on maintenance mode, and generate a healthy free cash flow for the company. As a developer what would it take for you to stick around in this project? I have been thinking of re-branding the work, but I could do with a lot of help here. EDIT: Thank you all for the suggestions. So far here's what we've got:   1. Rotation of work as per developer interest   2. Flexible working environment   3. Allot time to work on pet projects   4. Socials and fun    5. Branding of the project    6. Use this as a stepping stone for other projects
