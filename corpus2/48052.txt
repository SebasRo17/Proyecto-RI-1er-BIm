I want to name a bunch of tables after the OEIS entries which describe them. Is there any way to use these names for both the table name and the link at the same time? The second line uses the entry number as a variable: could I use the hyperlink in its place? This would allow clicking the link to reference the documentation from any place the file is referenced.               lcm[n_] := Module[{a = 1}, For[b = n, b > 1, b--, a = LCM[a, b]]; a]     A002944 = Table[lcm[n]/n, {n, 1, 15}]     Hyperlink["A002944", "http://oeis.org/A002944"]     Hyperlink[A002944[[1 ;; 6]], "http://oeis.org/A002944"]        **Edit** The last line displays the first few characters of the sequence, so I can click it to see more.
