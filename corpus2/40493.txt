I am trying to use Mathematica to solve a relatively simple ODE involving parameter(s). I would like to use a set of conditions to solve for the particular solution of the ODE. I understand how to make Mathematica find values for the constants that arise during the process of solving the ODE, but what about solving for constants/coefficients already present in the original ODE? Here is a simple example involving Newton's Law of Cooling... ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rivKO.jpg) Here is the code I tried:                  DSolve[          {           T'[t] == -k*(T[t] - Ta),           T[0] == 70,           T[1/2] == 110,           T[1] == 145           },          {T[t], t, k},          {t}          ]      I feel like I need a two step process... first solve the ODE with the parameters, and then solve for the parameters afterwards. I'm just not sure where to start. Thank you in advance!
