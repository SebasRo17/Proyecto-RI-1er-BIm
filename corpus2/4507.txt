Considering the fact that you don't have to get involved in setting up/buying a server or even buying a domain, do you think that fact alone is enough to choose one over the other? I don't necessarily want to work on Google App Engine, I just find it convenient when it comes to hosting/environment/etc. and wondering if that's a good enough reason to learn python. In any case, I'm not looking for a debate between python and ruby but more on Google App Engine and whether its value is enough to dictate the language you should learn.
