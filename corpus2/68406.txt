Is there any benefit in getting a CS degree in ones mid 40's _career wise_? Would the increased likelihood of getting past the HR filter be worth it? It's something I might actually enjoy doing, and I wouldn't mind solidifying my fundamentals, but I would be reducing my earning capacity during the years it would take to complete the degree, and by the time I'm done, I'll have maybe 15 years left in my career. (I currently have no college degree)
