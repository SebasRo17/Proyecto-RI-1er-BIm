There is an analysis and design phase of the software development life cycle. Should software developers be skilled enough for carrying out the work performed during this phase, such as drawing workflow diagrams, data flow diagrams, ERDs, UML, and other models? I have seen some cases where developers can code very well given a clear understanding of what is required. However, when they are asked to design a system, they stagger at times.
