I have encountered this problem of getting a list of accurate coordinates from a plot. Upon searching online, the best method of doing so is to right-click on the plot and select "Get Coordinates". After which, I will have to use my mouse to probe and move along the plot as accurately and steadily as I can, but it was rather inaccurate. Hence, I will like to ask if there are any other methods to get the list of accurate coordinates from a plot? Thank you!
