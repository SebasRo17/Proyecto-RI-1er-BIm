Let us say that someone writes a piece of software and licenses it under the GPL. Then they go on to sell it. Will this be effective? Won't someone just buy it and redistribute at a lower price? Do any of you know GPL licensed software that is being sold? Also if you know of any instances where someone bought such software and redistributed at a lower price/free please share it here.
