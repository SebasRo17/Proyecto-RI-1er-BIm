So, I've been working on Ruby with the goal of self-employment (I'm an impoverished philosopher (not even in university!) and can't get a normal low- paying job). But there is a quandary in my road of learning and discovery: I keep getting sidetracked by CS (mostly theoretical). I'm starting to think that I should consciously stop myself from straying into the theoretical until I am, I dunno, not starving? :) So I would like opinions on whether or not my view is rational (I guess a better term would be pragmatic), and of course discussion in general relating to the interrelationship between language mastery and general CS mastery is welcome.
