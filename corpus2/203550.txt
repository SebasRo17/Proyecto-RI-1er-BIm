This question is in reference to the IEEE's CSDA and CSDP certifications. I've already taken the CSDA course, which covered all of the knowledge areas in the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK). I'm thinking about doing the CSDP certification as well, but I can't find anywhere that tells me how it differs from the CSDA. I know that it's aimed more at professionals rather than recent graduates, and I'd imagine that it covers the same areas as the CSDA, but in greater detail. Unfortunately I can't find much evidence to back that up. This is making it difficult to justify to my boss that he should spend several hundred pounds of the group's training budget on it. So the question is: **What does the CSDP offer that the CSDA doesn't?**
