Hello to all Mathematica Users! I have this question: Consider a box which contains 69 balls. 17 red, 1 white, 29 blue and 22 green balls. There will be picked 7 balls randomly, without putting the balls back to the experiment. My question is: How do I create a probability distribution of all the possible combinations and to visualize it? And then I would like to find the combination with the higher probability and the mean. I know that I have to use "Multivariate Hypergeometric distribution", and I know how to compute the probability of a particular combination, but not how to find the more probable combination and the mean of the whole distribution.
