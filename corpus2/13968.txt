I have the following dynamic module. It works. The problem is that whenever I try to make the variable _list_ or the variable _s_ dynamic the code doesn't work. My goal is to allow students to enter a list of points using familiar mathematical notation. That is, user inputs "(4, 5), (9, 0)" and this gets converted to {{4, 5}, {9,0}} Suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I can not for the life of me figure this out.               DynamicModule[{list = "((5, 6), (9, 0))", s},        Panel[         Column[           {            Labeled[InputField[Dynamic[list], String, FieldSize -> {50, 5}],StringForm["Data Points"], Left],            s = ToExpression[StringReplace[list, {"(" -> "{", ")" -> "}"}] ],            ListPlot[s]           }          ]        ]      ]
