I am trying to do something which I assume should be very simple: I want to generate a list with symbolic coefficients that looks like this:               A = {a0, a1, a2, a3, ... , a20};      And I mean to do this a lot up to an arbitrary number, so I wouldn't want to type them all. So of course when I set one of them, say `a1 = 5`, then it should be updated in the list, so now:               A = {a0, 5, a2, a3, ... , a20};      I might just be missing an obvious _Mathematica_ command here that does this... Is there a way to do such a thing?
