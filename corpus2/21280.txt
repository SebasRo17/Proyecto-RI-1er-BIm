I am about to start a new job at a startup company on Monday. Today they asked me what I want for a PC for work, Windows, Linux or Mac (presumably a laptop). I am proficient with Windows and Linux but I have never used a Mac, so without hesitation I said I wanted a Mac. Without looking like a idiot on the first day of the new job and without access to a MacBook over the Thanksgiving weekend, what resources would you recommend for me to learn as much as possible before I lay my hands on my Mac? Looks like they use Google Apps so the office suite part is all set, for development, I will use C++/STL/Boost and GCC. A few months ago, I asked about a slightly different question on the Stack Exchange Unix forum: Software developer switching from Linux to OS X, what are the gotchas? Update 1: I'm expecting to work longer than normal hours, so I wouldn't think using some time on the job to acquire a new skill is such a bad thing to the company. Update 2: I'm writing on my new MacBook Pro now, I love my new Mac. thanks for all the answers for helping with this transition. Update 3: to naysayers out there, I'm glad that I picked a MacBook without hesitation. I love my new job and new Mac. :)
