I'm wondering how can I create functionality of custom fields. Below I described what I want and solution which I consider. Case study: Let’s assume that we have 2 roles: Admin and User. Admin has possibility to "add custom fields to forms". User can open that form in add/edit/read-only mode. In addition User can see a grid with columns from that custom fields. Now I want to do following things as an admin: I add new textbox and this control should be available on add/edit/read-only view and value should be available in the grid(sorting functionality is required). Below I place problems which I see to this feature:   1. Where store form configuration – xml or custom tables for storing form view    2. Where store results – xml or custom tables for storing results    3. How to make grid with paging and sorting – If I’m going to use SQL Server then I will probably build some Views.    4. How to build UI – I will use MVC and I think this is the easiest step. Have you ever made something like this? Can you share with me some solution? Thanks in advance.
