I have been looking at several of the timeseries functions in mathematica, however running a process like ARDL, ARMA, GARCH or ARCH you would be able to get a ANOVA table, with its coefficients and p value, you also in most packages would get R and R^2. I am wondering if there is an easy way to get ANOVA table when running an ARDL model or a ARCH model. I know it is possible with linear model fit, but I am not able to get it when using any other models.
