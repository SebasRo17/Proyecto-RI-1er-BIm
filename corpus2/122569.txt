I have just completed my Master's degree in Computer Science and have gotten my first job interview as a developer. I do not have much experience in large scale development projects, but I am hoping my university education counts for something. I am wondering, what materials should I bring that would impress my interviewers? What do most interviewers expect, especially from a new graduate? **Edit: The job interview went OK, except I forgot my pants. Thanks for all the great advice!
