I want to solve (numerically) the geodesics of the upper half plane and plot. The results are quite known (i) straight lines parallel to $y$-axis and (ii) semicircles centered on the $x$-axis. Now the problem is how to solve the coupled ODEs. I tried with `NDSolve` but the results are not coming. Can you please write a code and help me. Here are the coupled ODEs: $$\begin{align*} \ddot{x} &= \frac{2\dot{x}\dot{y}}{y}\\\ \ddot{y} &= \frac{-\dot{x}^2+\dot{y}^2}{y} \end{align*}$$ Thanking you in advance.
