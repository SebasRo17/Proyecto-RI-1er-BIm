There is a R package called TIMP. By this package someone can fit data to a model. There is a GUI for TIMP called Glotaran. When I fit my data by this package it does not take so much time to get the answer which is consisted of lifetimes and amplitudes of the fluorescence spectra of a sample. However, when I try to do the same thing by Mathematica, doing a global analysis-> fitting different data sets to different models which have some parameters in common such as lifetime here, it takes so longer and Mathematica eats a huge chunk of RAM, at the bottom line Mathematica is not as fast as TIMP. I want to know that why this happens? Is it due to being written in Mathematica language? or Is it that TIMP package use a different algorithm? My objection is that I would expect Mathematica to do a much better job because 1- It is supposed to do heavy mathematical operations 2- It is expensive so I expect much higher quality Personally, I considered Mathematica a tool to do various heavy computations. What is the point of putting so much energy and time to mastering Mathematica if I have to learn other more specialized software to achieve my goal?
