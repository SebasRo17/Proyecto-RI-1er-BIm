Say I have a graph `Gtest`, which has multiple disconnected components. I found that I can isolate individual components while retaining vertex coordinate specifications if I use `VertexDelete` in the manner of:               VertexDelete[Gtest, ConnectedComponents[Gtest][[2]]]      Here assuming that `Gtest` has only two connected components. However, this seems like a ridiculous way of proceeding. Is there a one-liner that will let me make a list of graphs `Glist = {g1, g2, g3, ...}` where each $g_i$ corresponds to a particular connected graph in `G`? How can I do this while respecting my original vertex coordinate assignments for `G`?
