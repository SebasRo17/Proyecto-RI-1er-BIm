I work in a small team of developers that supports several pieces of software that a large multi-site company uses. We use Spiceworks to raise issues and support requests throughout the IT department not just developers. We constantly get tickets raised with the following or similar: "Function X is broken, please fix it, it is urgent" Now this statement is practically useless to me, and it wastes my time and theirs whilst I try to work out the problem often only to discover it is something they had not realised or that should be assigned to someone else. Now my question is in what ways could I try to get people to write more information in bugs? I have thought of several ideas such as a template but I am pretty sure they would be ignored. The only thing I can think of that would almost certainly work is to refuse to action any tickets not written correctly, but I have my doubts as to whether I would be allowed to do this. Incidentally the people raising the bugs tend to have trouble using basic computer functions so I cant ask them to do anything very technical without a great deal of effort. Thanks all
