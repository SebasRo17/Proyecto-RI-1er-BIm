For the last 3 sprints or so, I've observed our Product Owner suddenly shoving new stories -- stories not previously in the Product Backlog -- at the top of the Product Backlog. Because of this, the existing items in the backlog never get worked on. New stories continuously take over the helm and make into our Sprint Backlog. My question is - how much can the Product Owner really shake up the Product Backlog? Is it really fair game to ignore what's already in the backlog and keep on shoving new stories at the top? I've tried to argue that this is hogwash, but I often hear counter-arguments such as "adapting to frequently changing business needs," "we're moving so fast - we're super agile" and I don't know what to say to those arguments, although I feel it is not how Scrum was meant to be. EDIT: I understand that the product owner owns the product backlog. What I am observing at my team though, is that the PO constantly puts new items at the top of the backlog, ignoring the existing backlog items completely. For instance, say we're building a car and PO creates 10 stories to make it happen. We decide to take on 3 stories in our sprint backlog - thus 7 stories still remain in the product backlog. Everything is good so far. At the next sprint planning, however, the PO now claims that we need to build a baseball bat and creates 5 stories around that - which are then placed at the top of our backlog (i.e. highest priority); nevermind those car stories we already had in the backlog.
