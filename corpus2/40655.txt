Let the following equation have two equal roots:               f[x_] := x^3 - p x^2 + q x - r       And I want to find out what the three roots are. Not knowing how to put this condition within a Solve or Reduce, I have to rely on transcribing some algebra into MMA. So if the above equation has two equal roots, then               fr[x_] := 3 x^2 - 2 p x + q      has one of them, out of a theorem on the depression of equations. If I put this into Solve this leads to:               Solve[x^3 - p x^2 + q  x - r == 0   && 3 x^2 - 2 p  x + q == 0, x]      No error message but MMA is unable to give here one the the duplicate solution. So I put more algebra into the code:               PolynomialRemainder[f[x], fr[x], x]    (* the remainder must he equal to zero *)     rootduplicate = x /. Solve[% == 0, x]  (* gives the value of the two equal roots *)      The third root is within the third factor of f[x]:               PolynomialQuotient[f[x], (x - rootduplicate[[1]])^2, x] // FullSimplify     Solve[% == 0, x]     root3 = x /. {%}      Let's check it up with an example:               Solve[(x^3 - p x^2 + q  x - r /. {p -> 4, q -> 5, r -> 2}) ==  0   && (3 x^2 - 2 p  x + q /. {p -> 4, q -> 5}) == 0, x]    (* now MMA finds a double root *)     Solve[(x^3 - p x^2 + q  x - r /. {p -> 4, q -> 5, r -> 2}) ==  0   , x]      rootduplicate /. {p -> 4, q -> 5, r -> 2}     root3 /. {p -> 4, q -> 5, r -> 2}     root3 == {(p - 2 rootduplicate)} // FullSimplify (* another verification out of algebra   - is there a way with MMA to find out this relation without hardcoding it? *)      My questions:   * Why MMA (V8) is unable to find a solution in my first Solve ?    * Is there a better way relying less on algebra to get these solutions?
