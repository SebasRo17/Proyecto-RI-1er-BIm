I was recently going over MPEG articles and videos to understand how it works. I understand what I, P and B frames do but I do not understand how the prediction is calculated.   Assume that I want to record a video of a ball falling from the sky to the ground and then bouncing a couple of times before finally coming to a halt.   Also, I am not clear with the concept of the 16x16 macroblock. Please tell me:   * how prediction is calulated  * what is macroblock and how it helps in MPEG encoding     My references:   * MPEG Prediction * Video on MPEG conversion
