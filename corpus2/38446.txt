# Taking the square root of the square of a number **Variable set to a real value** I'm wondering why these examples               a = -4.3;          Sqrt@a²     Sqrt@(a^2)     Sqrt[a^2]     Sqrt[a²]      each return > 4.3 the `FullForm` of which is               %//FullForm      > 4.3` yet               Sqrt@a^2      returns the complex number, > -4.3 + 0. I the FullForm of which is               %//FullForm      > Complex[-4.299999999999999`,0.`] Why is the last case output as a complex number (with a slightly different real component)? * * * **With an unbound variable**               ClearAll[b]          Sqrt@b²     Sqrt@(b^2)     Sqrt[b^2]     Sqrt[b²]      each of the above returns ![b](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TMsZG.png) the `FullForm` of which is > Power[Power[b,2],Rational[1,2]] yet               Sqrt@b^2      returns > b the `FullForm` of which is               %//FullForm      > b Why is the last case treated differently? * * *
