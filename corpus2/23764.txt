I'm new to Mathematica. I'm very impressed about it's abilities. It's very easy to achieve complex tasks. But I fail the simple ones. **How can I get coordinates in image processing?** I'd like to detect one of the following things   * absolute vertical center of the rectangle surrounding all white parts   * gravity center of all white parts e.g.: for this picture ![http://i.stack.imgur.com/0GFCv.png](http://i.stack.imgur.com/opzqB.png) I want to find the green point (center of outbound box). ![http://i.stack.imgur.com/AcMp5.png](http://i.stack.imgur.com/HftUl.png)
