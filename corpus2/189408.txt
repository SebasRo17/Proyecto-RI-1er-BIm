It was quite hard to put what I meant into a title, but it's easy to put into code. **C++** Is this               int offset_x = 10;     int offset_y = 40;     ...     element.move(offset_x, offset_y);      To be preferred over this?               Vector<int> offset(10, 40);     ...     element.move(offset.x, offset.y);      (Note that Vector is not like `std::vector`, it's a 2D vector. This class has lots of methods I don't need here, like `normalize()` and `scale()`. Should I have a more basic `Point` class for this?) **JavaScript** Is this               var offsetX = 10;     var offsetY = 40;     ...     element.move(offsetX, offsetY);      To be preferred over this?               var offset = {x: 10, y: 40};     ...     element.move(offset.x, offset.y);
