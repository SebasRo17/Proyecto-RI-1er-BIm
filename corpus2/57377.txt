I was expecting a real angle using VectorAngle when passing real valued vectors, however I obtained a complex angle.               VectorAngle[{-2.7432000000000016`, 0.`, 0.`},{2.743199999999973`, 0.`, 0.`}]      returns               3.14159 - 2.10734*10^-8 I      I was expecting 3.14159 (pi) as this is essentially a half circle. My guess is the precision of the numbers results in the imaginary portion. 3 possible solutions are:   * using Round[result,10^-7], which works for this case, but future cases might have an imaginary part larger than 10^-8    * using Re[result], a better solution. Interestingly, using Round on the vectors to some sufficiently small value results in an exact solution. For example I rounded to the nearest 10^-100 and got the exact value of pi Going forward I'll probably just take the real part of the result, but is this the expected behavior in Mathematica for this function?
