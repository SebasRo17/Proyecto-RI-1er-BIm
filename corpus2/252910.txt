I would like to make the return type of my method an interface rather than a class for similar reasons stated in c# List or IList, however I am having trouble figuring out how to initialize the interface to return it. I cannot use `new IA()` and `(IA) new A()` does not work as I cannot cast the result to `B`.               interface IA{}        class A: IA{}     class B: IA{}          class UseIA     {       public IA DesiredMethod()       {         return ???;// new IA()       }       public A UndesiredMethod()       {         return new A();       }     }
