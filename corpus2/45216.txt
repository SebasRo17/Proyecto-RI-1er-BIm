I want to calculate the Katz Centrality of large graphs. The _Mathematica_ command to do that is KatzCentrality[g, $\alpha$] and it is also fast. However I realized that there is a mismatch between the result I get by using this command and that one I obtain by explicitly solving the system that gives me the Katz centralities $x={x_1,x_2,..,x_N}$ for each node. The Katz centrality is indeed defined as the solution of the system $x=(I-\alpha A)^{-1}\cdot \beta$, where I is the identity matrix, A the adjecency matrix, $\alpha$ is a paramter and $\beta$ is a vector, usally the unit vector, i.e. $\beta={1,1,...,1}$. Here is my code ($\alpha=0.01$, N=200):               rA = Partition[RandomChoice[{0, 0, 0, 0, 1}, 200*200], {200}];          kx1 = Inverse[IdentityMatrix[Length[rA]] - 0.01*rA].ConstantArray[1,      Length[rA]] // Sort;          kx2 = KatzCentrality[AdjacencyGraph[rA], 0.01] // Sort     In[53]:= Total[kx1 - kx2] == 0     Out[53]= False      What is the most precise method? Note that if I use this adjecency matrix (of data I'm analyzing) https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/62056077/TestMatrix.m the differences are bigger. Thanks
