I started a discussion on StackOverflow earlier this week about one of my work project and how to lead it correctly. But it seems that this stack is a more appropriate place to ask those sort of questions, so here is my last question about my project: **How do you value your work? / How do you rate it in a financial way?** I'm working on a quite cool project with two other friends and people that we know ask us for an earlier access and how many it would cost per month for us to access it. Unfortunately, I was not able to answer this simple question due to the fact that I'm not agree with my friends on this specific topic. For me a bill of 80$/month/contract seems to be reasonable and appropriate for our targeted market (Institutions and Corporations) but my partner would rather count a charge of 500$/month/contract. Our project is an asset manager in SAAS mode, and I don't really think that our potential clients would be ready to pay more than 90$/month/contract even if they have a lot of money due to their situation. So, I would really like to have some opinions and advices on this kind of question. PS: If my post is not on the appropriate stack, feel free to tell me. PS2: I'm quite sorry if I'm not totally crystal clear, I'm not a native english, if you do not understand something, as above, feel free to notice me and I'll rephrase.
