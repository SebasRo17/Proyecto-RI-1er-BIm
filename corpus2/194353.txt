I am wondering about how much time Google Summer of Code typically takes. I do have an internship lined up for this summer, but GSoC seems like quite an awesome experience. I also really want to get into Open Source development. It states in the FAQ that it's not a good idea to attempt both, but it doesn't give any specifics. I'm wondering if it's feasible to do both. Or would I be better off by trying to work on open source in my spare time? Thanks for all your help!
