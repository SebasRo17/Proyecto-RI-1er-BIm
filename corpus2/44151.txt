I am trying to find the eigenvector of a $20000 \times 20000$ sparse matrix associated with the smallest eigenvalue. I realized that the smallest eigenvalue might be negative; for example, if the eigenvalues of the matrix are $ \\{-3,1,2,5 \\}$, I want to find the eigenvector associated with $-3$, not $1$ or $5$. Therefore the commands `Eigensystem[matrix,-1]` or `Eigensystem[matrix,1]` cannot be guaranteed to return the desired result. Furthermore, I don't have a lower bound estimate for the possible smallest eigenvalue. Is there a way to find the eigenvectors efficiently?
