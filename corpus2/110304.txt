I've recently worked on a Java class that generates permutations per list of objects. In any case, I would like to have this library offered to the public, so I have several questions:   * Most libraries I see have this complicated package naming, specifically including `com`/`org`. Is there a convention for these or is a `permutations` package enough?   * Is there a specific format to publish these? Should I include separate WARs for source code / javadoc?   * I have the files on a GitHub repository. I guess I can serve the files there, but how do I get people to find my repo?
