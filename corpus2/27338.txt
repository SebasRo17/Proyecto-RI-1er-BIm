Doctrine and Propel both make use of single and concrete table inheritance to map object relationships. The former sees all possible fields in the class tree mapped to a single table - whereas the latter maps each class to a specific table, duplicating common fields in the inheritance hierarchy. While this facilitates the ORM apparatus, it suggests bad database design to me. Are these bad design patterns to enforce on a database?
