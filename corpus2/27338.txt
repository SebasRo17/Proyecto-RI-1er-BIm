I would like to evaluate the integral $\int_{-\infty}^\infty \mathrm{d}x \, \exp\left(- a x^2 - x^4\right)$ for any real value of $a$. _Mathematica_ 8.0.4 gives the following result:               Integrate[Exp[- a x^2  - x^4], {x, -∞, ∞}, Assumptions -> {a ∈ Reals}]      > >     ConditionalExpression[1/2 Sqrt[a] E^(a^2/8) BesselK[1/4, a^2/8], a >= 0] >   Can I keep _Mathematica_ from restricting its answer to non-negative values of $a$, especially since it can do the integral also for negative values:               Integrate[Exp[- a x^2  - x^4], {x, -∞, ∞}, Assumptions -> {a < 0}]      > >     (Sqrt[-a] E^(a^2/8) π (BesselI[-(1/4), a^2/8] + BesselI[1/4, a^2/8]))/(2 > Sqrt[2]) >   I can construct the solution for all real $a$ from these two restricted solutions using `Piecewise`, but I'd rather not do that.
