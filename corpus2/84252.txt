I mostly understand the theory of TDD, but I can't figure out how to get started. I sit down to write a unit test for a personal project and realize . . . I have no idea what I am testing. What objects, what functionality, etc. E.g., let's say I want to write an app to help our family manage chore assignments. Here are some questions in my mind: How do I go from this idea to my first test? How much should be decided before I start, and how much do I figure out after I start writing tests? When do I make decisions like whether to store data in a text file or a database? Should I have user acceptance tests before I get started? Should I have the UI designed? Should I have a spec? (I do realize at least some of these example questions are probably in a "gray area"). In addition to the title question about getting to the first unit test, could you also give an example of what the first unit test for a project like the sample project might look like?
