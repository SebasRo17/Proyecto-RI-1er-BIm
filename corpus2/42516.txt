Here's a simple example. Suppose we want to find the off-diagonal matrix of m:               m={{1,2},{3,4}}      This can be solved fairly simply by extracting a list of the diagonal elements, re-creating the diagonal matrix from these, and removing them from the full matrix to get the off-diagonal elements:               m - DiagonalMatrix[Diagonal[m]]        to get               {{0,2},{3,0}}      Now, this was a fairly simple solution to the given problem, but what I'm wondering is if there is a way to write something akin to               (Identity - DiagonalMatrix@Diagonal)[m]        To get the same result. In this simple example, not much would be gained by doing this, but I just thought it could be interesting in more complicated problems and help make the code resemble more closely the underlying mathematics in some cases.
