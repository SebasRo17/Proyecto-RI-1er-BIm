How can I label particular vertices in GraphPlot? And have the arrows space out accordingly, for the width of the label? I have Mathematica 7, but I think this question applies to all versions. ![Mathematica Graph Plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YEq9j.png) Edit: I posted the above graph so you can see label overlap might kill whatever information the graph is displaying. For simplicity, lets do a mock graph: Generate the Data:               data = #[[1]] -> #[[2]] & /@ Partition[RandomInteger[10, 100], 2]      Plot the Graph:               GraphPlot[data, EdgeRenderingFunction -> ({Red, {Arrowheads[Small], Arrow[#1, .07]}} &)]      Gives something like: ![Random GraphPlot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/kIHgg.png) If I wanted to explicitly label "1" and "5", this is where I'm completely lost: I'm happy with the ugly yellow boxes for now:               GraphPlot[data,EdgeRenderingFunction->({Red,{Arrowheads[Small],Arrow[#1,.07]}}&), VertexLabeling->True]      ![yellow box, on all labeling](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ItSw3.png) But you can see it can be problematic if I labeled every point in the first graph. I wish the `VertexLabelingFunction` help pages was a bit more thorough, all it seem it do is some sort of rule based, rather than explicit labels. I'm thinking it'll be some `VertexLabelingFunction -> (If[#1 == "1" || #1 == "5", Text[#1]])&` But that always gives me an error.
