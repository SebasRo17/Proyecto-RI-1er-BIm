I am still trying to figure out Mathematica (started early August). I am trying to write a program that will accept an arbitrary function and an arbitrary sequence that can start at an arbitrary natural number in order to compose the function with the sequence so that my students can investigate the sequential criterion for the limit of a function. I cannot figure out how to get Mathematica to accept a function...below is what I have worked out so far. Any help would be greatly appreciated!               Manipulate[DynamicModule[{ a = 1 /n, b = 1},        Column[{Labeled[InputField[ Dynamic[  f[x_] :> ( x^2 - 4)/( x - 2 ) ]], "function", Left],                Labeled[InputField[Dynamic[a]],"sequence", Left],               Labeled[InputField[Dynamic[b]], "i=" , Left ],                Dynamic[If[ ( t - b ) < 11,                   TableForm[ Transpose[ {Range[b, t], Table[ N[ a, 4 ], {n, b, t} ],                     Table[ N[ f[ a ], 4], {n, b, t}]}], TableHeadings -> {           None, { "n", "\!\(\*SubscriptBox[\(a\), \(n\)]\)",            " f(\!\(\*SubscriptBox[\(a\), \(n\)]\))"}}],                  TableForm[Transpose[ {Range[t - 10, t],                     Table[ N[ a, 4 ], {n, t - 10, t} ],                     Table[N[ f[ a ], 4], {n, t - 10, t}]}], TableHeadings -> {           None, { "n", "\!\(\*SubscriptBox[\(a\), \(n\)]\)",            " f(\!\(\*SubscriptBox[\(a\), \(n\)]\))"}}]]]}]], {{t, 1, "k"}, 1, 1000, 1, Appearance -> "Labeled"}]
