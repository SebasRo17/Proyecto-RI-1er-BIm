Given a function, g, which is symmetric in its argument, g(a,b)=g(b,a), consider the product g(a,b)*g(c,d)*g(e,f). I would like to get all the permutations of this product with respect to the arguments, that is, terms such as g(a,c)*g(b,d)*g(e,f), which respect the symmetry so that g(c,a)*g(b,d)*g(e,f) would not be among the generated terms. Is there a way to get Mathematica to do this? Many thanks for any help.
