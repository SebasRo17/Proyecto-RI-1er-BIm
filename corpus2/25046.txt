Consider that I have the simple graph of               Graph[{"Uppsala" -> "Marsta", "Marsta" -> "Uppsala", "UpplandsVasby" -> "Sollentuna", "Sollentuna" -> "UpplandsVasby",        "UpplandsVasby" -> "Marsta", "Marsta" -> "UpplandsVasby",        "Stockholm" -> "Boo", "Boo" -> "Stockholm",        "Stockholm" -> "Lidingo", "Lidingo" -> "Stockholm",        "Stockholm" -> "Sollentuna", "Sollentuna" -> "Stockholm",        "Stockholm" -> "Taby", "Taby" -> "Stockholm"},       VertexLabels -> "Name"]      I want to add required data of the Graph such as `EdgeWeight, EdgeCapacity` or other required data with GUI. Preferably in Excel interactive data sheet . Could you please somebody help me on that?
