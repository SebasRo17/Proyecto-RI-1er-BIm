I could not figure out how to get a plot of the results of my coupled differential equations. I am sure that the equations are written correctly. I tried solving a basic Lotka Volterra set of equations but could't figure out how to graph the results of that either. Please Help! a = 2; b = 1; c = 1; d = 2;               DSolve[{x'[t] == a x[t] - b x[t] y[t],        y'[t] == -c y[t] + d x[t] y[t]}, {x[t], y[t]}, t]      I haven't read anything that made sense for graphing... I tried variations of this: `Plot[y[t] /. s, {t, 0, 10}]`
