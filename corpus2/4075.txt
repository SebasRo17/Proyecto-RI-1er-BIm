I'm trying to force a Mathematica function to make an assumption about its input variables. In my case, I'm trying to define a function to return the pdf of a Gaussian. But let's use a simple toy case:               n[x_]:= x^(1/2);      Thus, n[x] returns               Sqrt[x]      However, n[x^2] returns               Sqrt[x^2]      While this is correct and fine in principle, in my case some of the variables (like variance) will always be positive and will always be real, thus the simplification               n[x^2] = x      is appropriate. I've tried many things like:               n[x_/; x > 0 && Element[x,Reals]]:=x^(1/2);     n[x_]:=Assuming[x > 0 && Element[x,Reals],FullSimplify[x^(1/2)]];      etc. The best I can get it to do is               n[x^2] = Abs[x];       When I want               n[x^2] = x;      Anyone have any advice on how to do this?
