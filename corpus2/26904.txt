I'm considering buying a car. So I thought why not make a web-crawler in _Mathematica_ to pile-up car data? Brilliant idea. Then I found this Greek website, gocar.gr, which just so happens to have all the data I need in a convenient form, with URLs following a very consistent progression:               www.gocar.gr/cars/BRAND/MODEL/EDITION      e.g. `www.gocar.gr/cars/OPEL/MOKKA/1.7_CDTi_Edition_/`. The problem is when the model or edition contains Greek letters (but not the brand? Oh wait, there _are no_ Greek car brands), e.g. `www.gocar.gr/cars/BMW/ΣΕΙΡΑ_3/`, in which case `Import["URL", "Data"]` fails with a `FetchURL::conopen` error. It seems to me that this is some kind of encoding problem (it's consistent with Greek characters appearing in the URL and everything else works). I've seen the -kind of- relevant questions about copying non-Unicode text (this and this), but my problem is staying **within** _Mathematica_ , not copying something out of it (which, by the way, works fine). **So, to reproduce:**               Import["http://www.gocar.gr/cars/BMW","Data"]      works, but               Import["http://www.gocar.gr/cars/BMW/ΣΕΙΡΑ_3","Data"]      doesn't. And my question is: any ideas? **Additional info:**   1. This is a Windows 7 / 64-bit computer; formats and location are set to Greek/Greece, Greek keyboard is installed (duh), display language is set to English, _Mathematica_ version 8.   2. I also tried going directly through the JLink with a Java module I found in some other post (can't find it right now; may credit go where credit is due):              Needs["JLink`"]          httpGet[url_String] :=JavaBlock @     Module[{http, get},             http = JavaNew["org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpClient"];            get = JavaNew["org.apache.commons.httpclient.methods.GetMethod", url];            http @ executeMethod[get]; get @ getResponseBodyAsString[]]      followed by:              ImportString[httpGet[URL - HERE], {"HTML", "Data"}]      No luck. Thank you for reading my rant.
