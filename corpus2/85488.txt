Currently I wish to expand my professional skills with Bachelor degree. However, I am not able to study full time abroad, but looking for University where I could study in distance (online from home), coming just several times in a semester to the University to pass exams, complete papers and so on. I am **looking for Software Engineering or Computer Science programs**. **Fully in distance** (online) **in English in Europe** , because I am living in Central Europe. Any suggestions?
