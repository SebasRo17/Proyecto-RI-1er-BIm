I am trying to determine some good interview questions to assess the ability of people coming in for a Html/CSS job, however that topic is extremely broad, and I'm not sure what sort of questions I can ask to properly evaluate someone's HTML/CSS knowledge. What sort of questions can I ask to evaluate a candidate's Html/CSS abilities during an interview? Ideally I would like to ask few questions and then give them a real life scenario to combat.
