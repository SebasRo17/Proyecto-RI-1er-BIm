I'd like to assign `DownValues` to a symbol like this               x["firstvalue"] = 1;     x["secondvalue"] = 2;      And then have the `DownValue` keys `"firstvalue"` and `"secondvalue"` offered in an autocomplete list once I have entered `x[`. Another useful application for this kind of modification is to have the `"Properties"` of an object like a `FittedModel` added to the autocomplete list. It is not always easy to remember `"SinglePredictionConfidenceIntervalTableEntries"`, which is one of the 64 properties of `FittedModel`. Can this be done? What controls the entries in the autocomplete "engine"? ### Addendum This amazing answer shows a way of altering the behavior of autocomplete. I do not yet understand how it works.
