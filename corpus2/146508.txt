In a project, I've found a code like this:               class SomeClass     {         private SomeType _someField;              public SomeType SomeField         {             get { return _someField; }             set { _someField = value; }         }              protected virtual void SomeMethod(/*...., */SomeType someVar)         {         }              private void SomeAnotherMethod()         {             //.............             SomeMethod(_someField);             //.............         }          };      How do I convince my teammates that this is bad code? I believe this is an unnecessary complication. Why pass a member variable as a method parameter if you already have access to it? This is also a violation of encapsulation. Do you see any other issues with this code?
