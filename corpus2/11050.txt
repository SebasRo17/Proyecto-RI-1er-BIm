I haven't been programming for almost a decade. I used to be able to program in QBasic, Turbo Pascal, C, C++, Visual Basic and Assembly. I have no knowledge in any other programming language (other than HTML). I want a project (in _some_ programming language) to help me acquaint myself with the new environment (unix, python, perl, java, flash?) in a way that would give me the feeling that I've gained a mini-super-power. By that I mean something that give me the feeling of hacking (not actually learn about hacking, but just like learning C for the first time feels like hacking). Something that would put my programming skills to use in a way that the programming languages I do (did) know don't.
