Is there a software license that allows free access to source code, but does not allow redistributing any binaries, either direct from the source code or modified source code for a limited time? The idea being much like a open source software patent; the original developer has the exclusive right to sell and distribute the product, and prevent others from copying the product for a limited time, and the source code would be disclosed to the public. Obviously the downside is enforcing this license, but larger companies (e.g. Microsoft) could possibly gain the benefits of open source projects but still keep their proprietary position.
