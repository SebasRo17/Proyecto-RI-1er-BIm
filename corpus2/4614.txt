You know who they are. They are the rock stars of programming:   * They code 10X faster.   * Their code just works.   * They not only know their primary language inside and out, but they also know how it works under the hood.   * They know the answer to most any question before you ask it.   * A few of them invented the programming principles we all use.   * And they tend to be uncharacteristically humble, as well. What is it about these folks? Is there something about their thought process that is fundamentally different from the above-average programmer? Or are they simply very talented people that work hard? To put it another way: How can I be like them? I know what I think I need to learn to be that good, but it seems like it will take me the next ten years to learn it, and then my knowledge will be obsolete.
