In my RESTful API, I have Users, Applications, and Tokens. An application has an owner, which is a user. A token is linked to both an application, and a user. A user has both public and private representations:   * `GET /user` \- Retrieve current authenticated user   * `GET /users/:user` \- Retrieve given user An application has a public representation:   * `GET /applications/:id` \- Retrieve given application A token is associate with both a user, and an application. A token is **never** public:   * `GET /user/tokens/:id` \- Retrieve given user token Similary, applications of a user can be seen like so:   * `GET /user/applications` \- Retrieve collection of the current authenticated users' applications. * * * What should the resource path be in a situation such as this, for if I wanted to get all of the current users' tokens for a given application? Some things I have considered:   * `GET /user/tokens/application/:appId` \- I felt this may be poorly represented. How would it be read? Current users' tokens application? It's really: current users' tokens _for_ application.   * `GET /user/applications/:id/tokens` \- I felt this could imply that if you owned an application you would be able to see the tokens of all users using the application, which is of course not the intended functionality, or representation.   * `GET /applications/:id/tokens` \- I felt this to be problematic in a manner similar to the above.
