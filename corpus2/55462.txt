Just to report. `IgnoringInactive`should work with `Cases`. In agreement with the things written at the Documentation Center this:                Cases[{Cos[a], Inactive[Cos][b]}, IgnoringInactive[Cos[x_]]]      works correctly yielding               (*   {Cos[a], Inactive[Cos][b]}   *)      exactly as expected. However, this               Cases[{Cos[a], Inactive[Cos][b], Tan[c]}, IgnoringInactive[Cos[x_]]]      works (as I think) incorrectly returning               (*  {Cos[a], Inactive[Cos][b], Tan[c]}  *)      while I would expect again `{Cos[a], Inactive[Cos][b]}`.
