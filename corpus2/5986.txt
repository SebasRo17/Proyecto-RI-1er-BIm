I experience a weird bug in the function `LogLinearPlot`. If the input is an interpolation function, such as the one created like this,               int = NDSolve[{x'[t] == 1, x[0] == 0}, x, {t, 0, 100}]      then when plotting it I get an error message (but the plot works fine)               LogLinearPlot[x[t] /. int, {t, 0.1, 100}]          InterpolatingFunction::dmval: "Input value {-2.30244} lies outside the range of data in the interpolating function. Extrapolation will be used"      You will not be surprised to know that `log(0.1)=-2.302`. It seems that `LogLinearPlot` tries to plug in the wrong values in the function, but the plot does look good. **Update: This is working correctly in version 9.**
