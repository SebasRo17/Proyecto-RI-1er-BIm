I would like to be able to use Mathematica's string completion feature for subvalues of my own functions. I tend to go for functions that follow the pattern `f["description"][parameters][variables]` So say I have functions describing models:               modelOfSomething["Linear"][a_, b_][x_]:= a + b x;     modelOfSomething["Logarithmic"][a_, b_][x_]:= a + b Log[x];      Then as time goes on, I define more functions:               modelOfSomething["NonLinear"][a_, b_, c_, n_][x_] :=        modelOfSomething["Linear"][a, b][x] + c x^n;      so as I go along, I may end up with a few different models that I find useful to index with a string especially if they have the same number of parameters. So my question is > if/how can I get Mathematica to give me a drop-down of all the string > subvalues of my function much like it does with `CountryData`: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/a5cWX.png)
