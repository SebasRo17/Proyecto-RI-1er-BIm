I find that oldstyle (or text) figures are much easier to read in any context outside of simple assignment. Are there any low-ambiguity fonts, monospaced or proportional, that have text figures and other programming-friendly features, such as marked zeroes; aligned braces, operations, and other symbols; and bold and italic forms with identical width to regular? Note. Old-style figures are numerals which are drawn with variable ascent and descent. Typically, for example, a "0" will be slightly larger than a lowercase "o"; the "6" and "9" will have have circles that are sized and placed similar to a "0", with flags extending up and down from that.   In general, if one is trying to examine numbers as numbers (e.g. parse "8675309" as "eight six seven five three oh ni-y-ine"), the "lining" forms with unified ascent and descent are easier to read. On the other hand, multi- digit numbers written with old-style numerals have different shapes. If one is comparing columns of figures, a number like "1265" will look very different from "1285", since the former will have a flag on the "6" that sticks up far above any feature of the latter. Tabular figures are figures spaced with equal width; they may be lining or oldstyle. So all monospaced fonts have tabular figures, but most proportional fonts do not.
