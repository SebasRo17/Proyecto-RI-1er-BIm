I'm working on a medium sized (100k lines) code base, it's all relatively recent code (less than a year old) and has good unit test coverage. I keep coming across methods which are either no longer used anywhere or only referenced in unit tests which only test that specific method. Should I remove this code if I'm certain that it's no longer needed? **Reasons to remove it:**   * Less code, less bugs   * Less code is easier for others to digest   * It's still under source control **Reasons to keep it:**   * Can be used as reference   * It may be useful sometime   * It may have been written to 'round-out' the functionality for a class
