D[Tu1[x], {x, 2}] qu - Tu1[x] (fu0 + I w p) == Tou[x] f1              D[T1[x], {x, 2}] q - T1[x] (f0 - b g0 + I w p)==       To[x] (f1 - b g1) - g1      For T1 , `Range[0, L/2]` For Tu1, `Range[L/2, La/2]` Here, there are two differential equations with coupled boundary conditions;               T1'[0]==0     Tu1[La/2] == 0     Tu1[L/2] == T1[L/2]     a4 Tu1'[L/2] == T1'[L/2]      And also,               Tou[x_] := E^(a3 x) c2 + E^(-a3 x) c3     To[x_] := 2 c1 Cosh[x a1] + a2      I know all constants in the equations. I tried following code, but I coud not get answer, " error: not the same shape "               {T1, Tu1} = {T1, Tu1} /.        DSolve[{D[T1[x], {x, 2}] q - T1[x] (f0 - b g0 + I w p) -            To[x] (f1 - b g1) + g1 == 0,          D[Tu1[x], {x, 2}] qu - Tu1[x] (fu0 + I w p) - Tu[x] f1 == 0,          T1'[0] == 0, Tu1[L/2] == T1[L/2], a4 Tu1'[L/2] == T1'[L/2],          Tu1[La/2] == 0}, {T1, Tu1}, x]      How can I find solution of differential equations?
