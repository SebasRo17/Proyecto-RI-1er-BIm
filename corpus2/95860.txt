What is the current best practice for all the type conversions necessary in a Java web application? For example, `HttpServletRequest.getParameters(...)` returns `String[]`, but Hibernate does not allow `String[]` to be used in an IN clause for a numeric column. Therefore I need to convert `String[]` to `Long[]` via `Long.valueOf()`. What is the best way to handle this, short of rewriting in another language? Do people just create a class full of little static methods to do this?
