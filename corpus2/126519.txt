Suppose that you want to show a user list, on a web application having to handle custom date formats (depending on current selected interface language). Several locations for applying the date format seem possible. Which one would you use, and why?   * At model, for example doing a `DATE_FORMAT(user.birthdate, '%d/%m/%Y')` for date fields (supposing we have a MySQL DB).   * At controller level, for example (supposing we use PHP):              $users = UserModel::getUsers();     // loops through results before display to format dates.     // in the $users structure, we have to know which fields are dates or not     $users = MagicFunctionFormattingDates($users);          $view = new View('someTemplate');     $view->assign('users', $users);        * At view level, for example (supposing we use a template language such as Smarty):              {foreach key=keyitem item=row from=$users}       <tr>       {foreach key=keyfield item=field from=$row.fields}          {* Here $field should be an Object or associative array             holding its 'type' (is it a date or something else) *}          <td>{MagicFunctionForFormatting field=$field}</td>       {/foreach}       </tr>     {/endforeach}      A similar and related question goes for sumbitting dates (e.g. on a user registration form). Where should the date conversion take place:   * In the controller processing and validating the form, before calling the model?   * In the model?
