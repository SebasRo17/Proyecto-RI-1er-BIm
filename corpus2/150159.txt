I don't know if this question is strictly related to software development, but still I'll give it a try: Like a lot of programmers, I love to work on hobby projects. Sometimes, seemingly good ideas turn out to be not so good, so I drop the project. But sometimes, something useful comes out of the project. So, I could release it, present it to the world, right? Wrong. Somehow, I don't seem to be able to make this step. I fear that my code is not good enough, I can always think of things which are suboptimal, of features which could be added. So, I don't release anything, I lose interest, and at one point abandon the project. Is this normal? How do you overcome such a situation?
