Reading these two questions, I see that understanding CPU caching behaviour can be important when dealing with large amounts of data in memory. I would like to understand the way the caching works to add another tool to my optimisation toolbox. How can I learn about the way the CPU cache works so I can write code that uses it sensibly? Relatedly, is there a way to profile code to see if poor cache use is slowing things down?
