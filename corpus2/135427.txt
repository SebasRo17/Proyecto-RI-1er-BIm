### Background So I have a REST API that allows for client applications to access and manipulate users' data. I'm in the process of writing an Objective-C class for simple utilization of this REST API, but I'm stuck between two methods of implementation. ### Method 1               class MYClient         string username         string password         methods for using GET, PUT, POST, DELETE on questions         // questions are dictionaries with 'title' and 'body' strings      ### Method 2               class MYUser         string username         string password         array  tokens     class MYToken         string title         string body          // classes inherently sync themselves to the server in their initializers, setters, and getters      ### Questions   * Is there one that is more appropriate for use in (for example) iOS apps?   * Is there one that is more appropriate in general?   * What are the distinct benefits of Method 1 over Method 2 and vice versa?
