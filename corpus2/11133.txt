I was looking at the Documentation Center for `Round`, `Ceiling` and `Floor` when I noticed that the plots for `Round` showed some variation, even at the small size that the Documentation Center displays them, when blown up... well:               Plot[Round[x, 10], {x, -30, 30}, Filling -> Axis]      ![Rounding at 10](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fABno.png)               Plot[Round[x], {x, -3, 3}, Filling -> Axis]      ![Rounding at 1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PJdok.png) This intrigued me, I don't fully understand the rules governing generation of plots from functions. Clearly the method is adaptive, generating more data points where there is "activity," but is the (dis)continuity just based on the resolution that the plot is generated using? Any insight is welcome.
