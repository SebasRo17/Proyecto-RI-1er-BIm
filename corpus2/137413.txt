I'm reading the Wikipedia page on first normal form, and am confused about the last bullet point: > 5) All columns are regular [i.e. rows have no hidden components such as row > IDs, object IDs, or hidden timestamps]. Does this mean "all information about a row is contained in its values" (my words)? * * * I understand the rest of the points about 1NF; it's only this one that I'm confused about.
