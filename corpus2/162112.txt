I have found a need for a standardization for storage and recording of data relating to diabetes information (I don't think there's any, but I may have missed it). To that end I made this github project because I want to create one.. but I don't really know how to go about it, or even for sure what I want to create is called. Do I need to pick a language (xml, json) or a database type (mongo, sqlite, mysql), or how 'unspecific' is possible with something like this. Is a data format as I describe here a thing? Are there other names for what I want to try to do? It's a bit of a strange task to accomplish compared to what I'm used to.
