Let's say I have file named `test.m` containing               test[arg1_] := ( Print[arg1];)      What is the best technique for calling test like `test["value"]` while preventing test from being added to the `$ContextPath`? The following almost works except you must know function values ahead of time               Block[{$ContextPath,test}, Needs["test`"];test["test"]];      My question is: **How do I generalize the call above to work with any number of functions without the user needing to input definitions manually?**
