While starting work on a brand new ASP.net MVC application we've learned that we should have all of our available data pushed to make it easy to create a full view. While learning this we've started using a concept of a ViewModel, or a complex object full of properties from other basic data transfer objects. Now our problem has been in naming these ViewModels. We've run across the idea of using a name created from the DTO object names like MemberContactViewModel. while this is okay, I feel that names should be more unique or more related to what the complex object will be doing rather than what it's made up of. What are your thoughts. How should a complex ViewModel be named, based on the data it holds, or the view where it will interact with. Thanks for the input.
