I'll try to further explain what I mean. Imagine you are the boss of a company. You have to deal with the tradeoff between the quality of the code and the speed of producing it. Let's assume to measure the coding speed according to Agile Methodologies in Story Points Let's consider the two extremes:   1. Our developers spend a lot of time in formation without writing any line of code. They are getting certified. They know about every technology and pattern, they spend hour in thinking how to better implement something but the productivity goes to 0.   2. Our developers go straightforward to the solution of the problems. They produce a lot of code, they respect the deadlines. But it's really poor quality. A lot of code smells and other problems which will slow down the code in a few time. It' objective that both the two extremes are not optimal. So what's your suggestion and consideration for finding the optimal tradeoff?
