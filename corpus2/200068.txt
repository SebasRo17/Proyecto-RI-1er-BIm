I have two git branches with almost the same code, but some minor changes in order to support different platforms. I need to maintain these changes because I need them to run the software on different computers. So there is no master and development branch, both are equally important. Nevertheless, I need to "synchronize" the core code base of the branches. So I would like to somehow apply the commits from one branch in a sort of patch fashion to the other branch and vice versa, without merging them, in order to maintain the different setups. Is this possible with git? If yes, how can I accomplish this? Edit: can I merge only some files and leaves others out, but maintain the two branches?
