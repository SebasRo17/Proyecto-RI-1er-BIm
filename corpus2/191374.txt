In an interview with a software company they asked me some algorithm design questions. Being strong in mathematics I was able to solve it mathematically, but each time when I propose my algorithm they were doubtful about its working and I have to prove it with examples. I didnt get a call for further rounds, I believe my solutions were correct. After googling I have found answers to most questions but they were implemented in a different way. Why do interviewers look for optimal answers rather than solutions, which came out of our thoughts rather than memorization of an optimal answer and delivering it.
