I know that many of us maintain our own little personal library with tools and utilities that we use often. I've had mine since I was 16 years old so it has grown to quite a considerable size. Some of the stuff I've written has since been added to the framework. I wrote my own little implementation of expression trees for use with genetic algorithms long before LINQ, which I quite like and was proud of at the time - of course its pretty useless now. But recently I have been going through it and upgrading to .NET 4.0 and re-kindled an interest. So I'm curious as to what you use your library for. Maybe we could get some cool ideas going for useful little snippets and share them amongst ourselves. So my questions are:   * Do you have a miscellaneous utility library?   * Which part are you most proud of and why? Give an example of code if you like `:-)`
