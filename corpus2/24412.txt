Trying to plot the following two functions to show points of intersection.               2 x + y - 1 == 0,      x - y + 2 == 0     ContourPlot[{2 x + y - 1 == 0, x - y + 2 == 0}, {x, -5, 5}, {y, -5, 5}]      The above shows the plots, but I find it difficult to see the point of intersection. I suspect that there is a better method than this. Please suggest a good method to plot such equations.
