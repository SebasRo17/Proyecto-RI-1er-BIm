Our manager wants us to do applicaiton qos which is quite different from the well-known system qos. We have many services of three types, they have priorites, the manager wants to suspend low priority services requests when there are not enough bandwidth for high priority services. But if the high priority services requests decrease, the bandwidth for low priority services should increase and low priority service requests are allowed again. There should be an algorithm involving priority and bandwidth. I don't know how to design the algorithm, can anyone assist in getting this right? All these services are within a same process. We are setting the maximum bandwidth for the three types of services via ports of services via TC (TC is the linux qos tool whose name means traffic control).
