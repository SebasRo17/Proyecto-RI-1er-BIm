What methods / libraries / tools would people suggest for generating license keys (those lovely AAAAA-AAAAA-AAAAA-AAAAA-AAAAA things you put in when you register software)? Any gotchas to look out for when implementing them? (At the moment I'm interested in this as a general thing rather than language specific so just state what language you're using if your solution is language specific).
