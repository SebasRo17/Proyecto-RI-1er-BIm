I have multiple dataset that I want to plot in PieChart, as in               PieChart[{{2, 2}, {1, 2, 4}}, ChartLayout -> "Stacked"]      Now here is the catch: I want the color of the chart to be "similar" if the corresponding data belong to the same set. In my example, the regions corresponding to `{1,2,4}` would have different shades of Blue, while the ones relative to `{2,2}` would be plotted with different intensities of Red. Finally, since the original data set is more nested than this one, it would be nice to be able to specialize such color function further I have tried with ColorFunction -> Function[x, ...] but I don't manage to have info about the originating dataset. Example or more nested data set:               {{2, 2}, {1, 2, {3,1}}}     {{2, 2}, {1, 2, {{2,1},1}}}
