I have a short script to `NDSolve` a second-order nonlinear BVP, which as its output produces an `InterpolatingFunction` object. I would like to load in some data, and check how well this data fits the function by performing a Least-Mean-Squares sum. I don't know how to go about this with a function represented by one of these `InterpolatingFunction` objects. Minimal(ish) code to produce the function is included below.               {r0, f0} = {1.349, 1.421}; {r1, f1} = {3.913, 0.044};     eqn = 2 H == f''[r]/((1 + f'[r]^2)^(3/2)) + (1/r) (f'[r]/(1 + f'[r]^2)^(1/2));     H = -0.021414;     F = First[f /. NDSolve[{eqn, f'[r0] == -1.127435, f[r1] == f1}, f, {r, r0, r1}]]      Any help would be appreciated.
