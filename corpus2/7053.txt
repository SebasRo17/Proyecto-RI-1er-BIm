I have a notebook, which contains a dozen or so custom functions all leading to the production of a simple static report, something like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/TDMNM.png) I want to distribute this to a single user who will run (or execute) it a couple of times a day. I can get them a copy of Mathematica, but that seems overkill for this. They want something very simple. The notebook as it stands gets computable data via FinancialData[] for a single instrument and has hard code for all other required inputs. It requires only a single interaction with the user: pushing the "Run report" button (or some equivalent means of evaluating the code). The code for the actual report uses some proprietary functions, which I want to protect and hide from the user. Ideally, the end user should only see the latest report and the "Run report" button. So, can anyone suggest the best solution for distributing such a computable but otherwise non-interactive report? It doesn't have any need for a Manipulate[] as I see it, so at first thought CDF seems the wrong fit. Should I go with Player or Player Pro and simply hide the cells with functions? Does CDF make more sense? CDF, Player Pro, Notebook comparison I think you can see that I want simple, robust, and secure for this. Just a simple stand alone app. Thx. P.S., We don't seem to have a tag for "player".
