I have learned C++ to an intermediate point and now I'd like to create something beyond a console program. I would like to create a simple program that grabs info from specific text files and displays it in a GUI. Just simple statistics. Nothing complex like a spreadsheet or anything. I also know batch, and could use that for the none gui things, as I can put script together in much quicker speeds than writing C++. I don't have any issue having the batch scripts running in the background while the GUI opens, or is running. I have QT but learning it seems to be intimidating. What I'd like to do are simple things, like grabbign info from external files, but that seems to be difficult in Qt. I understand events signals and slots, but the Qt library is overwhelming and it seems like I need to learn everything I learned to create a C console app, all over again. And I don't want to do that. I also have Visual Studio 2012. Should I use that instead? What are my options here to create a simple GUI program with C++? I'm sick of just creating console apps. Thanks.
