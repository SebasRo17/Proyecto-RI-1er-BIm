I'm graphing a Markov process               mp = DiscreteMarkovProcess[{1, 0, 0}, ({          {0.6, 0.1, 0.3},          {0.2, 0.7, 0.1},          {0.3, 0.3, 0.4}         })];      and would like to have arrows whose thicknesses corresponds to the transition probabilities, with arrowheads of a different color in the exact center of each edge. But all my attempts end up a mess.               g = Graph[mp];     Scan[(PropertyValue[{g, #}, EdgeLabels] =           PropertyValue[{g, #}, "Probability"]) &, EdgeList[g]];     Scan[(PropertyValue[{g, #}, EdgeStyle] =          Directive[Arrowheads[{{.045, .575}}], GrayLevel[.7],            Thickness[PropertyValue[{g, #}, "Probability"]/20]]) &,        EdgeList[g]];     g      ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wdQaA.png) ![enter image description here][1] The thick edges leave gaps between their ends and the nodes of the graph, and I can't figure out how to change the color of the arrow heads so that they stand out against the color of the edges. How can I change the color of the arrowheads in my figure. How can I avoid the gaps that appear between nodes and the ends of the edges?
