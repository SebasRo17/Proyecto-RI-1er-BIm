Currently, I'm an Emacs user, (I'm used to the commands, and I work in a bunch of different languages day-to-day, one of which is Common Lisp, so it's the natural choice), but a recent-ish talk by Steve Yegge has gotten me thinking that an online editor/IDE (if done well) might provide a lot of benefits. Both in terms of tracking large code-bases, and in terms of supporting editing at the same highly-interactive level for many languages. The Bespin roadmap makes it sound like they're going in the same direction and there are also web-based implementations of both Emacs and vi (none of which I have any experience with). My question is twofold. First, are any of these editors ready for prime-time? Meaning, are they at least on-par with desktop based editors? If not, do they reliably bring any of they benefits that a server-based implementation could support (things like fully combined VCS/editor/server-side preview/storage, real IDE-level support for many disparate languages, support for team coding/remote pair programming, etc.)? I'm more interested in experience than speculation here. Second, where do you see the concept going? Are editors eventually evolving into services, are they staying on the desktop, or will we get to a hybrid system that supports local editing but provide certain, cluster-friendly pieces through a network connection? Feel free to speculate on this part.
