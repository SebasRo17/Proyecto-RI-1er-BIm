I'm not a native English speaker. In my native language I'm aware of some terms used to refer to the condition checked to stop a recursion, and to the condition checked for extreme, unlikely or super-simple cases. In English, I've encountered the terms "edge case", "corner case", "boundary case" and "base case", but I can't quite figure out the differences and which is used to refer to what; I'd love to get some summary of the differences between them. In particular, I would be very happy if someone could provide annotations for the lines in the following code sample:                   int transmogrify(int n) {     1.      assert(n <= 1000000);     2.      if (n < 0) return -1;     3.      if (n == 1000000) return PRE_CALC;     4.      if (n == 0) return n+1;            // For stopping the recursion     5.      if (n == 1251) return 3077;             return transmogrify(n-1);         }      I _think_ it's:   1. Sanity check   2. Input check   3. Boundary case? Edge case? Corner case?   4. Base case? Boundary case?   5. Corner case? Edge case?
