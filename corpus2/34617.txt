In _Mathematica_ there are two different forms for the arctangent (inverse tangent), namely               ArcTan[x,y]      which gives the arc tangent of $y/x$, taking into account which quadrant the point $(x,y)$ is in, and               ArcTan[z]      which gives the arc tangent $\tan^{-1}(z)$ of the complex number $z$. I am not sure about the exact conversion rule, but as far as I understand it is not simply               ArcTan[z] == ArcTan[x+I y] == ArcTan[x,y]      How do I restrict _Mathematica_ to use only one of the two forms for `ArcTan`, or convert between the two? **EDIT** Maybe I should elucidate on the problem at hand. I am trying to solve the equation $$ a \cos(x) + b \sin(x) = c $$ which can be done with the _Weierstrass substitution_ to yield $$ x_{\pm} = 2 \arctan\left[ \frac{b \pm \sqrt{a^2+b^2 - c^2}}{a+c}\right] $$ which is of the type `ArcTan[z]`. But if instead I use _Mathematica_               Solve[a Cos[x] + b Sin[x] == c, x]      Then I get an ugly expression of the type `ArcTan[x,y]`: $$ \arctan\left[\frac{a c-\sqrt{a^2 b^2+b^4-b^2 c^2}}{a^2+b^2},\frac{\frac{a \sqrt{-b^2 \left(-a^2-b^2+c^2\right)}}{a^2+b^2}-\frac{a^2 c}{a^2+b^2}+c}{b}\right] $$ How do I tell _Mathematica_ to convert this expression into an `ArcTan[z]` or vice versa? (I purposely neglected the periodicity of the solutions.) **EDIT 2** I just saw, that `Reduce` yields an `ArcTan[z]`. Where is the logic behind this?
