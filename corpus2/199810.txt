Suppose I own a copy of a physics book containing _original_ research. Suppose that this book is licensed under a non-free license. If I use the formulas and concepts explained in that book in my program, am I infringing the book's copyright? In my opinion the answer is no because I'm copying ideas, not text, and ideas can't be copyrighted. Though, I must say that in order to use the formulas, I'm forced to copy parts of the text, hence the question. **Update:** I have no problems crediting the author and citing the book; my aim is to have freedom to choice the license I want for my software, without being limited by the book's license.
