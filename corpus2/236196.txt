I'm developing an ASP.NET webforms application with pages which displays information based on the authorization level of the authenticated user (very typical). I will write a simple example of the issue I'm facing: Let's pose I want to have a page with 4 buttons: 1- "OnlyForAdmins" button. 2- "OnlyForManagersAndAdmins" button 3- "Guest" button 4- "Authenticated" button Depending on the permission level of the visitor, one or several buttons must be displayed. Right now in code behind buttons are handled in the following way:               public void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)     {         if (HttpContext.Current.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)             Athenticated.Visible = true;         if (HttpContext.Current.User.IsInRole("Admins"))             OnlyForAdmins.Visible = true;         if (HttpContext.Current.User.IsInRole("Manager") || HttpContext.Current.User.IsInRole("Admins"))             OnlyForManagersAndAdmin.Visible = true;     }      While this works, honestly I think that this approach is rather inflexible, having to add more "ifs" for every new role I introduce. I wonder if there exist approaches to handle this kind of problems. I'd be grateful if someone can enlighten me. Thank you.
