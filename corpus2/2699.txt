This is a "Share the Knowledge" question. I am interested in learning from your successes and/or failures. Information that might be helpful... **Background:**   * Context: Language, Application, Environment, etc.   * How was the bug identified ?   * Who or what identified the bug ?   * How complex was reproducing the bug ?  **The Hunting.**   * What was your plan ?   * What difficulties did you encounter ?   * How was the offending code finally found ? **The Killing.**   * How complex was the fix ?   * How did you determine the scope of the fix ?   * How much code was involved in the fix ? **Postmortem.**   * What was the root cause technically ? _buffer overrun, etc._   * What was the root cause from 30,000 ft ?   * How long did the process ultimately take ?   * Were there any features adversely effected by the fix ?   * What methods, tools, motivations did you find particularly helpful ? ...horribly useless ?   * If you could do it all again ?............ These examples are general, not applicable in every situation and possibly useless. Please season as needed.
