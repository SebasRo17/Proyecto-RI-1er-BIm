I've got a set of Eisenstein integers (triangle lattice points in the complex plane), and I've selected them to be above a line, so that they form a triangle: ![eisenstein triangle above line](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wR8il.png) I then took these 2D points and embedded them in 3D space, with the z-axis chosen randomly:               points3d = Map[{#[[1]], #[[2]], RandomReal[]} &, eisensteinIntegers]     Graphics3D[Point /@ points3d, Boxed -> False]      ![3d points](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BOLJi.png) I would like to have those points form a triangular mesh, similiar to the Delaunay mesh for the eisenstein integers: ![Delaunay mesh](http://i.stack.imgur.com/NhJUf.png) Except that the Delaunay mesh on the 3D points forms a solid, not a surface. How can I form a mesh surface from these points?
