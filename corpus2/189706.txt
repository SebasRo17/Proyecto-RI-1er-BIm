First of all **I am not after legal advice**. This is a bit TL;DR but I have a summary at the bottom, I'm explaining it all so people can offer insightful advise. ### Situation I need to explain my present situation to explain why I've decided to go the route that I have. I have recently been asked to find another job, due to the local economy struggling. I haven't been sacked but the cause is due to my present employer no longer being able to afford to employ me full time. I looked for jobs for a while but there is very little around, particularly for the level that I'm at, and I don't want _just another job_ that I'm not going to find challenging or enjoy. My current position sees me work as an architect and software manager. The vast majority of work is internal, but I do a little external consulting for my employer. ### My decision I've decided to go out on my own as a consultant / contractor. I already have quite a fair bit of work lined up. But while I establish my business I need to make money to support my family. The eventual outcome is to monetize some products, but product development takes time. ### The issue My current employer has offered me part-time employment with them. They are primarily a retail operation although since my employment have moved extensively into web work (mainly CMS-based sites) and to a lesser extent, programming, which is where I come in. This is undertaken both on a consulting basis as well as several internal projects. There is also a very large IT support business. The software development is largely ancillary although there is a large focus on (basic) web development. **Software development will largely stop when I leave, if not completely** ## Conflict of Interest If I take up the part time role I need to have a contract written about conflict of interest. I will see a lawyer for legal advise however I need to know what to allow myself. ### TL;DR Working as a consultant as well as for a company doing software part time, I can think of the following areas to define in the contract to allow myself to operate:   * When I work for them, I am employed by them and will not publicise or disclose my own business details   * I will not, outside of work, pursue their clients offering services   * They will not own any right to anything I produce whilst I am not employed by them   * If an existing client approaches me from their own research then it is fair game   * If they have a client leaving then I am entitled to work for them, and to either approach them or have them approach me Can you think of any other areas to approach my lawyers with that I have missed? I want to allow my business to grow and flourish and to protect myself. Case in point - one client of theirs has told me they want me to do their work, and it was unsolicited.
