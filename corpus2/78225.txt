The following SQL queries are the same:               SELECT column1, column2     FROM table1, table2     WHERE table1.id = table2.id;          SELECT column1, column2     FROM table1 JOIN table2      ON table1.id = table2.id;      And certainly result in the same query plans on every DBMS I've ever tried. But every so often, I read or hear an opinion that one is definitely better than the other. Naturally, these claims are never substantiated with an explanation. Where I work, the second version seems to be favored by the majority of other devs, and so I also tend toward that style to minimize surprise. But In my heart, I'm really thinking the first one (since that's how I originally learned it). Is one of these forms objectively better than the other? If not, what would be the reasons to use one over the other?
