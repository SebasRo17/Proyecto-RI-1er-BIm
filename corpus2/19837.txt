I have the following `ListPlot`:               ListPlot[{{1, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, .3}, {4, 6}}, Filling -> Axis,      FillingStyle -> {Thickness[0.008], Black},      LabelStyle -> Directive[20], Frame -> True]      ![plot1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qvCup.jpg) I have a problem with the lines below the points: They are too thin. How to change the Thickness propperly? `FillingStyle -> {Thickness[0.008], Black},` seems not to be correct.
