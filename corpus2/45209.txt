I have several functions (let `a[x]` and `b[x]`), defined as expressions with integrals and differentiations. I want to perform some manipulations with these expressions - for example, ask _Mathematica_ to simplify `a[x] + b[x]` without evaluations of integrals. `Hold` doesn't works (as I tried) as I used to expand functions `a[x]` and `b[x]` first. I think, that I could replace `Integrate` and `D` with some meaningless heads `integrate` and `d`, and then expand functions with another meaningless symbol `x`, but I can't achieve this, because _Mathematica_ tries first to perform integrations and fails. Example:               a[t_] := Integrate[t, {x, -∞, ∞}]     b[t_] := Integrate[t^2, {x, -∞, ∞}]     a[t]+b[t]  (* this doesn't works, as it "evaluates" integrals;                    I want to see simple sum *)      _ADDED:_ I want to see something like `myIntegrate[t, {x, -∞, ∞}]+myIntegrate[t^2, {x, -∞, ∞}]`. Really, _a_ and _b_ are more complicated, and they contain more than one integrals. I want Mathematica to perform expression simplification keeping integrals unevaluated. I could manually modify definition for _a_ and _b_ , but they are rather complicated, and don't want to keep two copies (one with Integrate, and one with some myIntegrate).
