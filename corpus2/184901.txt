I used to work for a professional consulting firm, and we worked under many different contract terms. When we could get a time & materials project, we ran it with SCRUM and tracked the backlog in our issue tracker system. Most of the time, however, we had to deliver under a fixed price contract. This required a specifications document as an appendix to the contract. So we always ended up batch importing work-items (or worse, manually entering) from the spec. Change orders took a lot of time to make sure everything was in sync, especially towards the end of the project. Is there a methodology or software tool out there **that keeps this whole process DRY**? I've done some searching and I'm apparently not using the right terms. Most of my professional network doesn't do fixed price work. I'd be open to:   1. Switching my bug tracker or buying plugins (currently using FogBugz).    2. Following a different development methodology    3. Writing software to manage the specifications and update the bug tracker and specification document (but this sounds like it will be a lot of work for dubious benefit) Lastly, is this really worth solving? It cost us quite a bit on some projects, but on other projects it didn't end up affecting us.
