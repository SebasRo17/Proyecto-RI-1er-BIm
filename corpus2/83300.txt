I am a computer science student working on some mobile games. However, I am completely torn and keep going back and forth deciding whether to learn Windows Phone or iPhone development. I love developing for Windows Phone because C# and XNA are both great tools. However, it is unproven on the market and has a market share many times less than that of the iPhone If you have experience in one or both, I would love to hear what you have to say. It would also be helpful to hear what you think about the prospects of learning C#/objective C in terms of job prospects because well, I am a student and that's important. A few things to keep in mind: I own and love the iPhone I understand memory management I want to develop the best programming practices possible (I have heard that because C# hides so much, you can develop bad habits) EDIT: Because some people asked. This is purely for my own benefit, not for a class. I have time to spend this summer to develop my skills and I want to get the most out of it. I have a few game ideas that I have been toying with, but I primarily want to develop good practices.
