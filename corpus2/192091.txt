I have data available in the form of Structs and Arrays. I need some design pattern advice, which I can use to model this situation into corresponding Coldfusion Components. Here is the data definition I have objects like   * Hotel   * Apartment   * Bus Each object has it's attributes and images. Images have also different types like thumbnails, gallery etc. Attributes may be simple or complex   Simple Attributes like: name, code, id etc   And complex attributes are themselves objects which have it's own Attributes and Images. The second part is Customers. Our customers receive these objects as XML export files. Each customer has it's own requirements. For example some want one kind of attributes and other want other attributes. Some want that one type of images should be exported and some want all image types should be exported.
