sometimes a programmer comes up with a brilliant idea to protect his/her webservice created with Windows Communication Foundation. I would like to hear from you guys, which techniques do you use to protect your WCF service and avoid unauthorized users to consume it? For example, you would:   * avoid Impersonate, use it only if necessary    * publish metadata information to prevent tampering   * avoid memory consuption enforcing a maximum size quota    * create a security context token to control number of sessions
