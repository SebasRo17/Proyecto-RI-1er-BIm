Here's a small listing where I've used `Esc``q``Esc` to typeset `θ` in the notebook:               Clear[ f, θ, Subscript[x, r] ]     Subscript[x, r] := 3     f[θ_] := Subscript[x, r] Cos[θ]          Plot[f[θ], {θ, 0, Pi}]      (in my notebook this looked like $x_r$, not `Subscript[x, r]` for example). This produces a message from `Clear` of the form:               Clear::ssym : x_r is not a symbol or a string      What is curious is that I appear to be able to assign to this variable $x_r$ without any trouble, yet it is apparently treated differently than my other symbols `f` and `θ`. How exactly does Mathematica define a symbol. Why can I use $x_r$ like a variable, yet it does not have this symbol characterization?
