I am trying to use the `EventHandler` and have managed to make the text change color upon clicking it, but cannot seem to make each piece of the pie chart change color as I click it. For the text I used this:               f[text_] := DynamicModule[{col = Red},        EventHandler[Style[text, FontColor ->  Dynamic[col]],                     {"MouseClicked" :> (col = col /. {Red-> Green, Green-> Blue,                                         Blue-> Red})}]]      When I apply this function `f` in the pie chart as follows:               PieChart[{{        Labeled[.5, Style[f["A"], Bold]],        Labeled[.5, Style[f["B"], Bold]]        }, {        Labeled[Style[.5, White], Style[f["C"], Bold]]        }       }]      it works. How can I make the pieces of the pie change color upon clicking them?
