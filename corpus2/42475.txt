I want to compute the integral of a polynomial in t, which I know an analitical solution exist. But Mathematica give me as result the input, not the result of the integral: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/lFTgK.jpg) I already know this since it is the input but I want to compute the value of this integral. Here is the code if you want to reproduce this (copy-pasted from mathematica, this is indeed ugly):               x[t_] := a0 + a1*t + a2*t^2 + a3*t^3 + a4*t^4 + a5*t^5;          a0 = x0;     a1 = v0;     a2 = acc0/2;     a3 = -((20 x0 - 20 xf + 12 v0 tf + 8 vf tf + 3 acc0 tf^2 - accf tf^2)/(2 tf^3));     a4 = -((-30 x0 + 30 xf - 16 v0 tf - 14 vf tf - 3 acc0 tf^2 + 2 accf tf^2)/(2 tf^4));     a5 = -((12 x0 - 12 xf + 6 v0 tf + 6 vf tf + acc0 tf^2 - accf tf^2)/(2 tf^5));          Jp = 1/2*Integrate[(x[t] - xf)^2, {t, 0, tf}];     Jv = 1/2*Integrate[(x'[t] - (vf + v0)/2)^2, {t, 0, tf}];     J3 = alpha*Jp + (1 - alpha)*Jv      Do you have an idea of what I am doing wrong? Thnk you in advance
