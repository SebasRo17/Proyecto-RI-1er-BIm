In C#, with an inherited class set -- when calling a method should we use keywords 'base.methodname and this.methodname'... irrespective of whether it is a overridden method or not? The code is likely to undergo changes in terms of logic and maybe some IF-ELSE like conditions may come in at a later date. So at that time, the developer has to be compelled to revisit each line of code and ensure that he/she makes the right choice of which method is being called --- base.methodname() or this.methodname() ELSE the .NET framework will call the DEFAULT (I think its base.methodname()) and the entire logic can go for a toss.
