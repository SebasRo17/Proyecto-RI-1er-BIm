I am still a beginner and do not fully understand pure functions and root objects. When I tried to calculate the inverse of a function, _Mathematica_ gave me:               f[B_] :=       -744.790486 +        559.361126 Root[-247818634 - 2500 B + 796044875 #1 - 1032864500 #1^2 +          675444825 #1^3 - 222213025 #1^4 + 29396850 #1^5 &, 1] -       0.468197 Root[-247818634 - 2500 B + 796044875 #1 - 1032864500 #1^2 +          675444825 #1^3 - 222213025 #1^4 + 29396850 #1^5 &, 1]^2      _Mathematica_ has no problems evaluating f[B] once B is defined. Simple equations can be easily converted into an Excel-friendly format, but this isn't exactly a simple equation. My question: Is it possible to format this in a way that Excel can generate the same result as _Mathematica_ , or is this simply beyond the scope of what is achievable with Excel?
