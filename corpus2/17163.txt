Ubuntu 12.04 x86_64 kernel 3.2.0-35-generic _Mathematica_ 9 linux version (x86_64) crashes with errors: > X Error of failed request: BadGC (invalid GC parameter)   >  Major opcode of failed request: 59 (X_SetClipRectangles)   >  Resource id in failed request: 0x0   >  Serial number of failed request: 2266   >  Current serial number in output stream: 2268 > > X Error of failed request: BadGC (invalid GC parameter)   >  Major opcode of failed request: 59 (X_SetClipRectangles)   >  Resource id in failed request: 0x0   >  Serial number of failed request: 2267   >  Current serial number in output stream: 2268 > > ... The above errors occur when I run command `mathematica` as a general user. It crashes before GUI is started. However, if I run it as root `sudo mathematica`, all work well. Can someone fix this problem?
