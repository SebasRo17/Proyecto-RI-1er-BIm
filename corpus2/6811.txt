Basically, this question can be considered to be an extenstion to my other question. What I wanted to do was this integral as homework (it is indefinite BTW so no approximations using Simpson's Rule or Boole's Rule) $$\int(x^{3m}+x^{2m}+x^{m})(2x^{2m}+3x^{m}+6)^{\frac1{m}}dx$$ So using Mathematica's `Integrate` function the answer was ![Answer](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BnYHD.png) Apparently, after rigorous substitutions and transformations the answer was found to be correct. What I wanted to know was how Mathematica integrates these functions that require a human tons of intuition to compute, within seconds, and often in the most simple way and also presents them in the most humanly computable form. (Even differentiation for that matter)
