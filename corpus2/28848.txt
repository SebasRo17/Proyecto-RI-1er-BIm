I have a problem using `MousePosition`. I want to restrict the value returned by `MousePosition` to a specific Graphics object. Consider the following example:               g1 = Graphics[{Green, Disk[]}];      g2 = Graphics[{Blue,Disk[]}];     {g1, g2, Dynamic[MousePosition["Graphics"]]}      I would like to have the mouse position updated only if the mouse is on the second (blue) disk and not on the first one (green). This seems to be an easy problem, but I can't figure out how it works in _Mathematica_. Thanks for help!
