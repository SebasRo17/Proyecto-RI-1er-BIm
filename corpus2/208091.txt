I have a hobby project and it looks like there is need to have some API library (which in turn is a wrapper over existing http API) at least for two languages - JavaScript and Python, adding support to Perl would be nice as well. The question is - what are the best practices for minifying the cost of supporting and developing of such multilanguage APIs? Is it better to choose one language and write just wrappers that for other ones? Or it's better do move slower but to implement thoroughly each method on each language.
