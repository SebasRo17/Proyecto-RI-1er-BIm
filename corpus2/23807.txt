Consider the following line of code:               DensityPlot[4 Sin[2 Pi x] Cos[1.5 Pi y] (1 - x^2) (1 - y) y,                        {x, -1, 1}, {y, 0, 1}, Mesh -> All, MeshStyle -> Thick]      with the following output: ![mesh](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rUZVo.png) How can I convert the shown mesh into a `Graph` object such that:   1. All the vertices are aligned at the intersection of the lines, withe correct `VertexCoordinates`.   2. The edges (line segments in the plot) connect the corresponding vertices. Note: If `g` is the result `Graph`, the the following code should give the same figure as the one above:               Show[DensityPlot[4 Sin[2 Pi x] Cos[1.5 Pi y] (1 - x^2) (1 - y) y, {x, -1, 1}, {y, 0, 1}], g]
