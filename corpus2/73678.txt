I need a bit of input from people who have used both of these programs. I am using Visual Studio Express 2010 right now for creating a project in VB.net and WPF 4. I just discovered a freeware IDE called IC#Develop, which apparently supports both of those formats. Has anyone used both, and if so, what are the advantages and disadvantages of each? Which would you recommend? Is IC#Develop a good alternative to the very expensive Visual Studio Ultimate?
