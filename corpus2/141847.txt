I am developing an open source ruby application under the MIT license. I am using this license because I don't want to place any restrictions on the users of the application. Also I can actually read and understand this license. I recently started using another ruby gem in my project (require "somegem"). This ruby gem is under the LGPL license. Do I have to change anything about my project because I am using this other ruby gem that is licensed with LGPL? My project does not contain the source code for the other gem and it is not shipped with my project. It is simply listed as a dependency so that ruby gems will install it and my project will call into it from my code. Additionally, it would be helpful to know if there are any licenses I need to "watch out for" because using them would affect the license of my project. There are some other post about this topic but phrased in different ways. Since I find this license stuff tricky I am hoping to get a answer directed at my situation. Thank you,   Corsen
