I’m interested in finding closed-form inverses for map projection equations in general (of course, this is not always possible). I’m hoping Mathematica can help me with some of the trickier ones. As a **practice run** , I thought I would try and use Mathematica to invert Lambert’s Azimuthal Equal-Area Projection. There are of course closed-form inverse equations on MathWorld, but I’m wondering how I would go about finding these using Mathematica. I’ve tried using `Solve` and `Reduce`, for example:               k = Sqrt[2/(1 + s1 Sin[y] + c1 Cos[y] Cos[x])]     Solve[{u, v} == {       k Cos[y] Sin[x],        k (c1 Sin[y] - s1 Cos[y] Cos[x])     }, {x, y}]      But no luck so far. Perhaps I need to specify more constraints? For example, I know that the longitude and latitude (`x` and `y` above) have:               -π ≤ x ≤ π     -π/2 ≤ y ≤ π/2      I wonder if eliminating variables might also help the solving routines.
