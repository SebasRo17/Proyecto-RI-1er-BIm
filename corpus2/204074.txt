I have been trying to get some architecture documentation passed at work. I've spoken to my CIO and he has said to me that if I prove to him that if we stay within MOF then we can implement it. I am not an architect, I am a software developer trying to become an architect. I downloaded the MOF documentation and did some searches for "architect" or "architecture" and really only found 3 very minor references. So I'm trying to find out more about the role of "Architecture" in MOF.
