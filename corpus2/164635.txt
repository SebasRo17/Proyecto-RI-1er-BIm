### I'm not talking about MySQL, I'm talking about Microsoft SQL Server I've been aware of PDO for quite some time now, standard mysql functions are dangerous and should be avoided. http://php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-connect.php But what about the MSSQL function in PHP? They are, for most purposes, identical sets of functions, but the PHP page describing mssql_* carries no warning of deprecation. http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.mssql-connect.php There are PDO drivers available for MSSQL, but they aren't quite as readily available or used as the MySQL drivers. Ideally, it looks to me like I should get them working and move from mssql_* to PDO like I have with MySQL, but is it as big of a priority? Is there some hidden safety to MSSQL that means it's exempt from all of the mysql_* hatred as of late? Or is its obscurity as a backend the only reason there hasn't been more PDO encouragement?
