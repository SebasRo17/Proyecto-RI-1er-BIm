I am currently learning my way through _Mathematica_ and have stumbled upon a strange problem. It is asking me to implement `PrimeQ` into `Graphics3D` (specifically for spheres). I typed it up and displayed a picture in the notebook uploaded at the link below. If someone could explain this to me, I would greatly appreciate it and will move on to the next chapter, _Pure Functions_. Disregard the input I entered. I was just trying a generic example to see how both compare in front of each other. http://ge.tt/4Xi1kvZ1/v/0?c P.S. I'm only 14 years old. I'm working through a _Mathematica_ book, so that I may use _Mathematica_ to enter into the Intel or Semmes Science Fairs next year.
