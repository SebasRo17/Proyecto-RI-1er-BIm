I would like to visualize a sampled sound, and place the sounds as notes starting from `C0` to `A8` or such. I have a table of frequencies (in $[Hz]$) of these notes, and I have a sample sound. My goal is to have along the $y$ axis the possible notes, and along the $x$ axis the time. My main question is, what are the values of the `SampleSoundList`, and can they easily be related to the frequencies from my table? The table is in _Excel_ , but I could write it out as a list of `{ { C0, 16.35}, .. }`. Any help or pointers in the right direction would be much appreciated. Additional Information: What are values?               toSpectrogram[x_] := Print[Spectrogram[x]] &&  Print[ x ]     Button["Sing", snd = SystemDialogInput["RecordSound"];       toSpectrogram[snd[[1]]], Appearance -> "DialogBox",       Method -> "Queued"]      What I mean by what are the values of a SampledSoundList in this sense:               SampledSoundList[{{0.,0.,-0.0078125,0.,0.,0.,0.,-0.0078125,0.,0.,0.,0.,0.,0.,0.,0.,0.,0.,0.,0.,0.,0.,-0.0078125,0.,0.,0.,0.,0.,0.,0.,0.,0.,0.0078125,0., ........ 0.,0.,0.0078125}},11025]      The final value ,11025] is the sample rate. But what are all of the other Reals? How could/would they relate to finding a pitch, or frame to look at to figure out if the sound is a note or what note they are? Can I iterate over this list of "values" and get an idea of the Musical Note at any point, or series of points? I imagine that the sound is sampled at a certain rate, i.e. the 11025 and so this means that a certain block of numbers in the list represent a point in time, but I don't know what the actual numbers mean? Are they some kind of representation of pitches? The numbers are from -1 to 1, so they represent some kind of whole but what that whole is is unknown to me. I am sorry if I am being dense. This is just an area of curiosity for me. Thanks **EDIT** From all the input and more doc reading, I have come up with this:               toSpectrogram[x_] := (Print[Spectrogram[x]]; plotSampledSoundList[x])     plotSampledSoundList[       x_] := (sa = Abs[SpectrogramArray[x[[1]][[1]], 16, 10]];        Print[ListLinePlot[sa[[{10, 35}]], DataRange -> {0, 8000},          PlotRange -> {{500, 5000}}, Ticks -> {Automatic, None}]])     Button["Sing", snd = SystemDialogInput["RecordSound"];       toSpectrogram[snd[[1]]], Appearance -> "DialogBox",       Method -> "Queued"]      This is getting very close to what I want, though I am still unclear on some of the arguments. In the case of SpectrogramArray, the 16 is supposed to be the bit depth of the sample? So if I record at 11khrtz 16bit then this should be good? The plot that comes out is what I was hoping for, but I could be wrong. The final part of my question is: How do I place the Note values up the y axis starting with C0-A8 or what not ( can be smaller range, or even better if it fits the sound to the range).
