I was just reading this slightly older post on choosing a good source control system when I started thinking about how different projects use source control. Where I work we've essentially moved completely to Git and things have been mostly good. I have wondered about high security projects such as military software projects. Using something like Git there would fundamentally be unsafe; even allowing repo clones under restricted circumstances could be problematic. Using SVN or TFS may not even provide enough security in itself. Are there any VCS systems that have any stronger security considerations? Or are there additional considerations that go into using VCS for high security projects?
