So I've been reading about namespace on w3schools and I understand they are to uniquely identify an element. But what is the point of having namespaces if you have to have prefixes along side them. Are you always required to have prefixes with namespaces? If not are you always required to have namespaces with prefixes? If so why? For example:               <root xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/" xmlns:f="http://www.w3schools.com/furniture">           <h:table>        <h:tr>        <h:td>Apples</h:td>        <h:td>Bananas</h:td>      </h:tr>                    <f:name>African Coffee Table</f:name>         <f:width>80</f:width>         <f:length>120</f:length>       </f:table>     </root>      Doesn't f and h uniquely identify the different element types? Thanks for your help. I'm really at a loss at understanding why namespaces exists.
