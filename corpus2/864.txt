it is possible to get a histogram style in `ListPlot` using `InterpolationOrder->0`               testdata = {{1, 3}, {3, 4}, {4, 3}, {5, 8}, {7, 6}, {9, 4}};     ListPlot[testdata, Joined -> True, InterpolationOrder -> 0,      Epilog -> {PointSize[Large], Point[testdata]}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/kfem4.jpg) Note that the data points are sitting at the corner of the histograms at the left end of the horizontal lines. My question is: How could I plot the same data set with the data points being centered on the horizontal line segments? For equidistant data points this is of course a simple shift. But how to do this for irregularly gridded data? Edit 1: To clarify: Of course this is possibly not very meaningfull in irregularly spaced cases, and centered is the wrong term, however, in the example case the data point connection I was looking for could look like the following: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8UtCJ.jpg)
