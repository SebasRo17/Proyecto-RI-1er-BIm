I've recently been tasked with increasing standards and efficiency within a development team. I've read similar posts about the makings of a good development team but these often discuss the human elements such as "passion for learning", "being a team player" etc. These are all of course important but I'm particularly interested in ideas surrounding practical methodologies. Some are just plain obvious, for example, my first implementations are:   * Implementation of Source Control - well, do I have to even explain why?   * A structured method of deploying builds that everybody adheres to - makes deployment easier for all involved   * Coding standards - ensures everybody is working in the same way and (hopefully) reduces technical debt   * Encouragement to make use of the developer community e.g. StackOverFlow and the like - keeps us in the loop with the big bad world and brings in ideas from outside our office walls What practical methodology does your team employ that you feel makes a tremendous difference to the productivity and overall "goodness" of a development team?
