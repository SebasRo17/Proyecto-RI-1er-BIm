I'm reading a sample chapter of _Visual Complex Functions_ by E. Wegert. Near the bottom of this page, there is a link "Download Sample pages 1 (pdf, 2.4 MB)" which allows you to read Chapter 2 of the text. On page 28, he has a color circle in Figure 2.8, which is based on `Hue` and the argument of the complex number. Mine winds up a little differently from his, as his is rotated 180 degrees from mine.               DensityPlot[Arg[x + I y], {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2},       RegionFunction -> Function[{x, y}, 1 < x^2 + y^2 < 1.5],       ColorFunction -> Hue, PlotLegends -> Automatic, ImageSize -> 300]      ![Wegert1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/zrGCs.png) On page 28, he pictures what he calls a "Colored Analytic Landscape" of the function $f(z)=(z-1)/(z^2+z+1)$. That is, he plots $\ln(|f|)$, and the color is based on $\arg f$. Here is my first attempt to do the same thing.               f[z_] := (z - 1)/(z^2 + z + 1)     Plot3D[Log[Abs[f[x + I y]]], {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2},       ColorFunction -> Function[{x, y, z}, Hue[Arg[f[x + I y]]]],       AxesLabel -> {x, y, z}, Mesh -> None, BoxRatios -> {1, 1, 1},       ImageSize -> 300]      ![Weger2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cNMWL.png) Unfortunately, my image does not match his. Of course, that's partly because my color wheel is not rotated, but here is a description of my real question. Notice what happens when I do a density plot of `Arg[f[x+I y]]` and place it side-by-side with a top view of my surface:               GraphicsRow[{{Plot3D[Log[Abs[f[x + I y]]], {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2},          ColorFunction -> Function[{x, y, z}, Hue[Arg[f[x + I y]]]],          AxesLabel -> {x, y, z}, Mesh -> None, BoxRatios -> {1, 1, 1},          ViewPoint -> {0, 0, Infinity}]}, {DensityPlot[         Arg[f[x + I y]], {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2}, ColorFunction -> Hue]}}]      ![Wegert3](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ofbdw.png)![Wegert4](http://i.stack.imgur.com/kgs3f.png) They don't have the same color scheme. What am I missing?
