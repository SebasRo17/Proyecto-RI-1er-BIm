I have a very annoying problem. The Conjugate glyph (*) does not show when I type.   That is, if I type `\[Conjugate]` or `⋮co⋮` then no character appears on the screen, although the conjugation operator is definitely there and working. I'm running Mathematica 8 under Fedora. Here's a screenshot: ![annoying bug](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FU40M.png) So far, it's the only character that I have noticed missing. Any ideas?
