I would expect all of the following to give the same answer (`2.12467`) but only half of them give this answer. The others seem to be using the default `NormFunction:>(Norm[#,2]&)`. Can anyone explain this?               α = 3;     n /. FindFit[{1, 3, 9, 20}, x^n, n, x, NormFunction :> ((Null; Norm[#, α]) &)]     n /. FindFit[{1, 3, 9, 20}, x^n, n, x, NormFunction :> ((Norm[#, α]) &)]     n /. FindFit[{1, 3, 9, 20}, x^n, n, x, NormFunction :> (Norm[#, 3] &)]          Block[{α = 3},  n /. FindFit[{1, 3, 9, 20}, x^n, n, x, NormFunction :> (Norm[#, α] &)]]     With[{α = 3}, n /. FindFit[{1, 3, 9, 20}, x^n, n, x, NormFunction :> (Norm[#, α] &)]]     Module[{α = 3}, n /. FindFit[{1, 3, 9, 20}, x^n, n, x, NormFunction :> (Norm[#, α] &)]]          (* Outputs: 2.12467, 2.13284, 2.12467, 2.13284, 2.12467, 2.13284 *)
