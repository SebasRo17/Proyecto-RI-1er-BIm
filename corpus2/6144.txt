I'm looking for robust code to solve the "Longest Common Substring" problem. I can just code it up from that description, but I'd thought I'd ask here, first, in case someone knows of an implementation either distributed with Mathematica or available from an open source. I found a hint here that a solution might be part of the (huge) `Combinatorica` package, but a quick search of the documentation did not disclose it.
