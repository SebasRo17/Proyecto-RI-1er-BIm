My problem is related to statistical testing with weighted data. I have a data sample and I assume that a part of the data follows a specific distribution (Pareto). So I fit my data to a distribution by using `EstimatedDistribution` and in turn I obtain a p-value related to this fit according to different statistical tests (Cramer-Von Mises, Kolmogorov-Smirnov and possibly others). Everything goes well as long as I do not include weights (I really know it works, since I have replicated my results in another software package...). When including weights by using the function `WeightedData` I run into problems. `EstimatedDistribution` still works well on `WeightedData` (again results are replicated in another package), but the `DistributionFitTest` does not work any longer. When trying to apply `DistributionFitTest` on `WeightedData` I get an error message of the following form: > "rctnln: The argument [my weighted data object] at position 1 should be a > rectangular array of real numbers with length greater than the dimension of > the array." I got the intuition behind these error message and intensely searched for an appropriate work-around or alternative Function, but could not find any suitable tools. Could anybody help me out on this?
