I have been trying to plot fourier series but the plot is allways empty. I guess there is something wrong in my code but i dont know exactly what is it. Looking here for some previous questions/answers I plotted the function in a lot of different ways but none of them worked. Can someone help me with this :) ? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0OiNs.png) fx[n_, t_] := !( *UnderoverscriptBox[([Sum]), (i = (-n)), (n)](((Exp[ I*(((-1)*ima))*[Pi]]*((I*1 + ima*[Pi])) - 1))* Exp[I*ima*[Pi]*t])) psums = Table[fx[n, t], {n, 1, 10}]; Plot[Evaluate[psums], {t, -4, 4}]
