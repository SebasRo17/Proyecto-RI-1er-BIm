Does there exist a function in Mathematica that simply takes out a common factor from a vector/list of expressions? This seems like such a simple operation that I am surprised that I could not find it in Google or the Mathematica help. It could return the common factor and the list without it:               Function[{a b c , b c, c d}] = {c,{a b, b, d}}      Or it could even simply return the common factor:               Function[{a b c , b c, c d}] = c      edit: sorry I was not completely clear. It would factor out algebraic expression too. So:               Function[{x^2 y, x}]      would yield:               {x,{x y, 1}}
