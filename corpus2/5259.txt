I have a colleague who want to go back to programming after 5 years of doing something else. Five year ago he was working with C++ / linux, delphi, and a lot with mSQL . He asked me to help him to go back to programming. I started to support him (in C# and Java) but I see that he is less and less motivated to practice. Probably he is getting frustrated about slow progress or overwhelm by things he had forgotten. I am looking currently for a way how to encourage him. Currently I think about two possible approaches:   1. find an opensource project that he can start to work    2. set up a project together (e.g., on assembla.com) and try to develop together something that is interesting for him.  Maybe I should advice him to start with script languages (e.g., groovy, jython) that let to program faster and to not write so much boiler code?
