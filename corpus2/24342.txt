I really enjoy programming games and puzzle creators/games. I find myself engineering a lot of these problems the same way and ultimately using similar technique to program them that I'm really comfortable with. To give you brief insight, I like to create graphs where nodes are represented with objects. These object hold data such as coordinates, positions and of course references to other neighboring objects. I'll place them all in a data structure and make decisions on this information in a "game loop". While this is a brief example, its not exact in all situations. It's just one way I feel really comfortable with. Is this bad?
