Lately I come across what I think not uninteresting problem which is a good exercise for the usage of `Dynamic`. Assume you have files in a directory structure (a tree) like the one you find in the `AddOns/Packages` subdirectory. Here a snip of it               Packages/BarCharts     |-- Charts.m     |-- Charts3D.m     |-- Kernel     |   `-- init.m     |-- PacletInfo.m     `-- Usage.m     Packages/Benchmarking     |-- Benchmarking.m     |-- Kernel     |   `-- init.m     `-- PacletInfo.m     Packages/BlackBodyRadiation     |-- BlackBodyRadiation.m     |-- Kernel     |   `-- init.m     `-- PacletInfo.m      What I would like to have is a dynamically updating row of `PopupMenu`'s which let's me select a file or directory like this ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SHPXD.png) There should be a possibility to select directories (like the `Benchmarking/Kernel`) directory as well. Note that not all `PopupMenu`'s are always visible. Their number depend on the depth of the selected file/directory. For instance consider this case ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dlZBU.png) What I tried so far is to extract all files with `FileNames` and use `Gather` and replacement rules to convert them into a tree-structure. In this tree structure you can access then different levels and update the `PopupMenu`'s in dependence of each other. I'm really keen to see nice* ideas of others. *short, interesting, intuitive, mind-boggling
