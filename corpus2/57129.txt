I have a series of axisymmetric images of a jellyfish swimming in fluid. Overlaid on these images are plots of the Lagrangian coherent structures associated with swimming, which highlight the fluid transport and mixing: ![A plot of the jellyfish bell kinematics and the Lagrangian coherent structures](http://i.stack.imgur.com/W76CQ.jpg) Since these images are axisymmetric, I was wondering: is there a way that I can revolve a single two-dimensional image about its x axis, so as to create a three-dimensional surface, and then visualize this as a volumetric render? If possible, I'd like to retain the same colors as in the two-dimensional image, as they are significant. As well, I'd like to create a cut-away that removes a fourth of the volume, like in the following image: ![A three-dimensional plot of the jellyfish bell kinematics and the Lagrangian coherent structures](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7DP4F.jpg) I'm aware of the following posts: How to show solid bodies using volumetric rendering? and How to create blurred Graphics3D objects?. However, they don't cover a crucial step: how to do the x-axis revolution.
