I want to find the values of the parameter $m$ to the graph of the funtion $$x^4 - 2 m x^2 + m + 1$$ has three extremal points make an equilateral triangle. I tried               Clear[f];     f[x_] := x^4 - 2 m x^2 + m + 1     sol = Solve[D[f[x], x] == 0, x]     t = x /. sol;     a = {t[[1]], f[x /. sol[[1]]]};     b = {t[[2]], f[x /. sol[[2]]]};     c = {t[[3]], f[x /. sol[[3]]]};     ab = EuclideanDistance[a, b];     bc = EuclideanDistance[b, c];     ac = EuclideanDistance[a, c];     Solve[{ab == bc, bc == ac, ac == ab}, m, Reals]      The correct answer is $m =\sqrt[3]{3}$. But, when I tried               Solve[{ab == bc, bc == ac, ac == ab, m > 0}, m, Reals]      Mathematica out put empty set. How to get the correct answer? And how to reduce my code?
