I have a mysql table whose column name has space. I tried inserting the data into this column. I got an error I tried a sample code, which tests accessing the columns with a space and that returns the same error.               Needs["DatabaseLink`"];     conn = OpenSQLConnection["demo"]     SQLCreateTable[conn,      SQLTable["TEST1"], {SQLColumn["COL 1", "DataTypeName" -> "VARCHAR"]}]      I got this error at the last line.               JDBC::error: ""Wrong data type: 1 in statement [CREATE TABLE TEST1 ( COL 1]">>      I tried other combinations to access that column names, such as               "`COL 1`"     "COL\ 1"     "`COL\ 1`"      and they din't work either. What is the proper way to create/access/insert data into columns with a space? (I am on Windows 7, using Mathematica 8)
