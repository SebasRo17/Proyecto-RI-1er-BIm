Our developers demand that someone external to the development team completes the functional testing. Their argument is that they are biased and cannot test their own code as they are too close to it. Our last round of testing is with the client in the form of UAT. To be clear by 'functional testing' I mean testing the code against the specs, eg. when you click on 'submit' the index page should load. By UAT I mean the client comes in and runs through use cases on the release candidate. While I understand this argument of bias, is it reasonable for the developers to demand someone else complete their functional testing or is this just a way to avoid doing their job?
