I'm a newbie who tries to be a good boy, and use `Map` instead of writing out a list of functions. I have a table I want to `Map` onto:               ratios = Table[10^(n/10), {n, 0, 10}]        and a function               rp[x_, r_] := 1000 x (r + 1)/(r + x)      which I want to `Plot` for the 11 ratios, for `x in [0, 1]`:               Plot[Map[rp, ratios], {x, 0, 1}]      This doesn't work, and I can guess why: `rp` requires two arguments, and MMA probably doesn't know which one is the ratio. And `x` also doesn't appear as a parameter. How do I fix this?
