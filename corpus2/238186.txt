Whether or not a value is `null` could be checked implicitly like this:               assertThat(value).isEqualTo("something");      Or it could be checked explicitly:               assertThat(value).isNotNull();     assertThat(value).isEqualTo("something");      The latter makes the expectations a bit more clear, but it blows up the test code. Is there a good reason to prefer the second approach over the first?
