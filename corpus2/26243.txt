I use mathematica on a computer with linux operating system. The computer has 2 cpus and each cpu has 4 cores, so there are totally 8 cores available. Now I got confused with whether the evaluation of `Eigenvalues` is parallelized or not. I present two kinds of codes below one use `ParallelDo`               ParallelDo[         Eigenvalues[# +              ConjugateTranspose[#] &[Table[RandomReal[], {i, 5000}, {j,5000}]]         ];     ,{4}]//AbsoluteTiming      the time it takes is 135.12254 second. And use `Top` command in linux during the evaluation, it shows like below: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2BKyH.png) It show that 4 cores are trying their best, that's quite reasonable. the other use `Do` only               Do[Eigenvalues[# + ConjugateTranspose[#] &[Table[RandomReal[], {i, 5000}, {j,5000}]]];,{4}]//AbsoluteTiming      this time it takes 109.004395 second. It evaluates even faster!!. And use `Top`, It shows like below: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cdVSm.png) Almost 800%, it means that this time, the evaluation uses all the cores? **I don't know why it shows one 800% instead of eight 100%s. What is the difference?** If `Eigenvalues` really evaluates in a parallelized way automatically, why `Parallelize[Eigenvalues[matrix]]` gives error message saying that " **`Eigenvalues` can't be parallized;proceeding with sequential evaluation**"??
