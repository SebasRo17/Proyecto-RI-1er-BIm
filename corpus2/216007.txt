In the default folder structure for a Symfony2 project the database and mail server credentials are stored in `parameters.yml` file inside `ProjectRoot/app/config/parameters.yml` with these default values:               parameters:         database_driver: pdo_mysql         database_host: 127.0.0.1         database_port: null         database_name: symfony         database_user: root         database_password: null         mailer_transport: smtp         mailer_host: 127.0.0.1         mailer_user: null         mailer_password: null         locale: en         secret: ThisTokenIsNotSoSecretChangeIt      During development we change these parameters to the development database and mail servers. This file is checked into the source code repository. The problem is when we want to deploy to the production server. We are thinking about automating the deployment process by checking out the project from git and deploy it to the production server. The thing is that our project manager has to manually update these parameters after each update. The production database and mail servers parameters are confidential and only our project manager knows them. I need a way to automate this step and suggestion on where to store the production parameters until they are applied?
