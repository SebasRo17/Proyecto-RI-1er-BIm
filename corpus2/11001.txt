I know mathematica is probably not the best choice for intense numerical integration, but its the only software I know. I would like to create an animation (not real-time, but pre-render the frames) of a Gaussian wave-packet scattering against a spherical square-well, whose stationary states are known. Basically, I need to carry out the following integral: $$\Psi(\vec{x},t)=\int\frac{d^3\mathbf{k}}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^3}}\tilde{f}(\mathbf{k}) \psi_\mathbf{k}(\vec{x})\,e^{-i E(\mathbf{k})t}$$ where $\tilde{f}(\mathbf{k})=\exp(-\frac{(\mathbf{k}-\mathbf{k}_0)^2}{2(\Delta k)^2}-i \mathbf{k}.\vec{x}_0)$ is the Gaussian wavepacket in Fourier space, and $E(\mathbf{k})$ is a very simple function quadratic in $\mathbf{k}$. The integral needs to be done at several different times, and then compiled together to form an animation (this last step I know how to do). Is there a good reference that I can look up that will accomplish my task?
