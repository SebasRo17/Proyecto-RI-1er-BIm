Recently, I started learning about iOS application development, and while the simulator is fine for starting out, I've gotten to the point that I really should be testing the Apps I write on an actual device. To do this, you must be a member of the $99/year iOS developer program, which also allows you to publish on the App Store. I'm more than happy to pay the fee, but my problem is that I'm still a minor, and to join the developer program you must be over 18 in the U.S. (I'm not sure how it works in other countries). I've talked to a few others that were in a similar position, but their responses have been varied. From what I've gathered, the best course of action is to register in the name of one of my parents. My problem with this is that if I were to ever publish an App on the store, it would be ideal to have my name as the seller instead of my dad's. It wouldn't be the end of the world if this happened, but as I said, this wouldn't be ideal. Have any of you been in this position or known somebody who has? How have others solved this problem? Any tips or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
