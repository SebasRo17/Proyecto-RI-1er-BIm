Since _Mathematica 10_ every time your mouse cursor appears above some function or even variable, an annoying tooltip appears offering help: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Agjlt.png) I've become quite used to _Mathematica_ now and I don't need these tooltips everywhere every second, and I can just as easily click the function and press `F1` to get help. I've tried almost every promising-looking option in `Edit->Preferences->Interface` page, but I couldn't remove these tooltips. So, how do I finally get rid of them?
