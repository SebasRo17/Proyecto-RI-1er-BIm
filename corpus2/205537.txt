I have been reviewing C# code that has a lot of generics (and generics with generics...) and its taking me longer to grok the code. I know the gang of four patterns, and I know some of the fowler enterprise patterns (learning them as I go).   1. Are there any techniques you could suggest when tackling understanding systems like this?   2. Are there any resources on developing systems like this?
