What I think about Build Numbers is that whenever a new nightly build is created, a new BUILDNUMBER is generated and assigned to that build. So for my 7.0 version application the nightly builds will be 7.0.1, 7.0.2 and so on. Is it so? Then what is the use of a REVISION after the build number? Or is the REVISION part being incremented after each nightly build? I am a little confused here... do we refer to each nightly build as a _BUILD_? The format is mentioned here: AssemblyVersion - MSDN
