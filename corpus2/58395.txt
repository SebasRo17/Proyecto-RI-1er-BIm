Consider the following:               pts = RandomReal[4, {10, 2}];     vor = VoronoiMesh[pts, {{0, 4}, {0, 4}}];          Graphics[{GraphicsComplex[        MeshCoordinates[vor], {Thick, Blue, MeshCells[vor, 1],          PointSize[0.02], Red, MeshCells[vor, 0], Opacity[0.2], Yellow,          MeshCells[vor, 2]}], PointSize[0.02], Point[pts[[1]]], Green,        MeshPrimitives[vor, 2][[1]]}]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2HLxl.png) Looking at the above, we see that the Voronoi sites (points that generate the Voronoi diagram) do not correspond to the Voronoi cells (in the order) generated by `VoronoiMesh`. Since `VoronoiMesh` discards the points used in generating the diagram, there's no obvious way I can see to align the Voronoi sites with their corresponding cells. This feels like an oversight to me, since one will have to do some complex post-processing to obtain such correspondence. **My question is:** is there an easy way to obtain a site - cell alignment of the Voronoi diagram obtained via `VoronoiMesh` other than using e.g. `RegionMember` which seems like an unnecessary overkill when this information should be available in the `Mesh` object. So e.g. with the points above, an output of the form shown below is desirable:               Transpose[{pts, MeshCells[vor, 2]}]      > >     {{{3.15429516, 1.68154241}, Polygon[{20, 11, 6, 15}]}, >      {{0.925806386, 3.57266721}, Polygon[{12, 3, 1, 13}]}, >      {{2.12535296, 3.88158116}, Polygon[{14, 5, 8, 18}]}, >      {{3.52419343, 0.689832144}, Polygon[{18, 8, 7, 17}]}, >      {{0.590442758, 1.53821808}, Polygon[{10, 4, 9, 6, 11}]}, >      {{2.70632597, 3.81614775}, Polygon[{19, 13, 1, 5, 14}]}, >      {{2.23994147, 1.5141697}, Polygon[{15, 6, 9, 2, 16}]}, >      {{3.68657472, 2.93505855}, Polygon[{16, 2, 3, 12, 21}]}, >      {{0.12127097, 2.63380289}, Polygon[{17, 7, 4, 10, 22}]}, >      {{2.21266451, 2.69765978}, Polygon[{1, 3, 2, 9, 4, 7, 8, 5}]}} >
