Code:               #include <stdio.h>     #include <stdlib.h>     #include <string.h>          int main()     {            int n = strcmp("hello","help");         printf("%d\n", n ) ;         return 0;     }      Result:               -1      Does the value for this program have to be the same on all machines or different compilers? In other words can this return value take on different values for the same program when run on different compilers or different machines?
