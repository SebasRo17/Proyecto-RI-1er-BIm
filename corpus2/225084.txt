So I've lead the charge with my fellow engineers to, at the very least, start "thinking" Lean. We hit on a few major areas of waste, and 2/3 lead to the exact same point..."Extra Features". We dogfood our own software on two fronts, sales and project management. It works great for sales, because that's what a CRM is great for. It's not so great for managing projects, and we're often tasked with adding extra features to make it work for this use case. Does it make more sense to continue adding features that don't add any customer value, or should we accept that having our sales team using our own product is "good enough" and perhaps look for an off-the-shelf solution?
