In the following `Manipulate`, the style (font?) of the _a_ changes between when it is a control label and when it is a label in the graphics. Is there a way to make the 'control a' look like the 'graphics a'?               Manipulate[      Graphics[{       Style[Text["a", {0, 0}], Italic, 14]},       Axes -> False, PlotRange -> 3, ImageSize -> {100, 100},        GridLines -> None],           {{a, 0, Style[Text["a"], Italic, 14]}, 0, 100, 1}]       I can't find anything in the stylesheet, that can help me. I have set the font of `Output` to _'Georgia'_ , but I assume that I need to select the font somewhere else too?
