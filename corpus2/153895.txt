> Given an array of integers A[1...n-1] where 'N' is the length of array A[ ]. > Construct an array B such that B[i] = min(A[i], A[i+1], ..., A[i+K-1]), > where K will be given. Array B will have N-K+1 elements. We can solve the problem using min-heaps Construct min-heap for k elements - O(k) For every next element delete the first element and insert the new element and heapify Hence Worst Case Time - O( (n-k+1)*k ) + O(k) Space - O(k) Can we do it better?
