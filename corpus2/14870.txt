What I would like to do is generate a histogram of the consecutive time spent under a level. For example if the level I was interested in was 1.0 and I had this data;               {{{2010, 1, 1, 6, 15, 0.}, 0.04375}, {{2010, 1, 1, 6, 30, 0.},0.04375},      {{2010, 1, 1, 6, 45, 0.},0.04375}, {{2010, 1, 1, 7, 0, 0.},5},     {{2010, 1, 1, 7, 15, 0.}, 0.5},{2010, 1, 1, 7, 30, 0.}, 5}}}      I would get a histogram containing two values, 45 (7:00am - 6:15am) and 15 (7:30am - 7:15am) minutes. Any help would be appreciated.
