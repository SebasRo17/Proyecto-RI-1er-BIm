I would like to know the idea behind the working of 'docking' in applications. I have worked with applications where components from individual forms are docked on a single main form to provide the necessary GUI. But I don't have any idea whats happening in the background. According to Wikipedia   _A dock is a graphical user interface element that typically provides the user with a way of launching, switching between, and monitoring running programs or applications._ Now I am a bit confused if it is some component or an event or a property or something else. EDIT : The applications was developed in Delphi on windows platform. There is something more in Delphi (manual dock and automatic dock).
