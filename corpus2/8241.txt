I have two data sets, `data1` and `data2`. For example:               data1 = {{1, 1.1}, {2, 1.5}, {3, 0.9}, {4, 2.3}, {5, 1.1}};     data2 = {{1, 1001.1}, {2, 1001.5}, {3, 1000.9}, {4, 1002.3}, {5, 1001.1}};     ListPlot[data1, PlotRange -> All, Joined -> True, Mesh -> Full, PlotStyle -> Red]     ListPlot[data2, PlotRange -> All, Joined -> True, Mesh -> Full, PlotStyle -> Blue]      ![ListPlot 1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/6AMcJ.gif) Their $y$- _values_ are in vastly different regimes, but their _oscillations_ in $y$ are comparable, and I'd like to compare them visually using `ListPlot`. But if I simply overlay them, it is nearly impossible to see and compare their oscillations, because of the scaling:               Show[{       ListPlot[data1, PlotRange -> {{1, 5}, {-100, All}}, Joined -> True, Mesh -> Full,          PlotStyle -> Red, AxesOrigin -> {1, -50}],       ListPlot[data2, Joined -> True, Mesh -> Full, PlotStyle -> Blue]     }]      ![ListPlot 2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/PLDGg.gif) Is there a way to "break" or "snip" the $y$ axis so that I can compare `data1` and `data2` on the same plot? There is no data in the range ~3 to ~1000, so I would like to snip this $y$-range out, if possible, and perhaps include a jagged symbol to show that this has been done.
