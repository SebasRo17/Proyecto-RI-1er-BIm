Is there anything that can be done for a single general purpose application to affect the power consumption of the device it is running on? I am not familiar with how optimizations to individual applications may affect power consumption in a general way, can someone explain if different approaches to writing applications affect power consumption of the device they are running on? That is, can a single program, that does the exact same thing functionally, written in different ways drastically affect the power consumption of a device in general, not about how different un-related programs might affect the power consumption of a device.
