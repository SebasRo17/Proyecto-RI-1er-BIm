PHP supports the `list()` language construct which, in short, allows you to return multiple values from a function and then attach them to different variable, eg:               function myBigReturn(){         return array("foo", "bar");     }     list($fooer, $barer) = myBigReturn();     echo $fooer; // echoes "foo"     echo $barer; // echoes "bar"      I have failed to find much info about such a language construct and I am curious - is usage of PHP `list()` construct considered a bad coding convention? Are there any serious articles/literature on this subject?
