We have some pretty old, clunky .Net 1.1 apps in our business that - rather than be forcably upgraded - just get an iFrame added so that new functions can be dropped in. It's become such a well-known option that many management staff who don't really have a great deal of technical knowledge or experience suggest just throwing an iframe on a page as if that would be the only way to solve the problem. I don't have an issue with the iframe element per se if it's absolutely necessary, but it does seem that it's a very convenient tool for something that might be better achieved with a little more thought and consideration for design. Are iframes the web design equivalent of a code smell?
