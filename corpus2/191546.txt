I've been asked to provide something for a client and I'm not really sure on what they want. I wondered if anyone has heard the term used before. The situation is that we have a program which receives .xml files from a host system (the files are put in a directory and our program picks them up every x mins). The files contain various bits of information. The IT manager for the company who has the host system has requested some details about the XML protocol which is being used. I assumed he wanted an XML schema and some example xml files which I sent through to him. However he said he didn't want this and reiterated that he wanted to know what XML PROTOCOL was being used. Could anyone tell me what an XML Protocol is? I think I'm probably being really stupid about all this but I don't know what he means. Thanks everyone
