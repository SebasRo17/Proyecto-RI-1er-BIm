I'm running a webMathematica server (running Mathematica 9) and am getting some weird stuff in the log - specifically, I keep getting the following message:               General pool request background 61 > [      ] Input MSP`Utility`DestroyRequest[] generated message:     Remove::rmnsm: There are no symbols matching "Global`$InterfaceEnvironment".      I can't find any documentation for this, so it's possible that this is a user created symbol that I'm not seeing, but I think this is unlikely. Is this error something I should worry about?
