New to the site so sorry if this is the wrong section. I'm starting app development and wondering what is the best practice when initially releasing my app. Do developers tend to keep some of the features for future updates to keep users active, or do they try to release the most complete app possible? Basically, is it advised to release an app as soon as possible, and then periodically update it to the complete app you have in mind, or wait until you have it fully developed and release it with fewer update prospects? EDIT: Thanks for the answers. I am currently just designing the app and writing down all the features I can think of and trying to prioritize which to include to the initial launch. Based on the answers given, I think I will get a MVP (thanks for the term) out as soon as it is ready, and then update with new features as soon as they are built. I am not holding back built features, was just torn between if I should build them all before launch or just the necessary ones, release, and then build the others. As far as I am aware this isn't a clone. It is my first app though and I will be using it as a learning experience
