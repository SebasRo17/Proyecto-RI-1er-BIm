I'm trying out the new Code Review tool in Visual Studio 2012. Which seems okay for the most part, but I've hit a wall in regards to when changes are required. How should this be handled in a code review in VS2012 land?   1. Joe submits a code review   2. Fred reviews and requests some changes   3. Joe makes the requested changes   4. ????? How does Joe associate a new changeset with the review so Fred can see it?   Abandon the existing review (thus losing all the original comments), and create a new one? Or is there a way to attach the new changes to the existing review?
