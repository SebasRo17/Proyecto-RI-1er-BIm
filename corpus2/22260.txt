The Wikipedia page on Rindler coordinates shows a nice example of how a coordinate transformation can be represented in a plot. They start with two coordinates $T,X$ with $0 < X < \infty,\; -X < T < X$. Then, they introduce two new coordinates $t, x$ by $\begin{align*}t &= \mathrm{artanh}\left(\frac{T}{X}\right) \\\ x &= \sqrt{X^2-T^2}\end{align*}$ From the plot below, it is clear how curves of constant $x$ and constant $t$ run in the old coordinate system: ![Coordinate transformation from \(T,X\) to \(t,x\)](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Pj00M.png) How could you make a clear plot like this with _Mathematica_? I would like to include the labels as well. I guess you need the inverse transformations to express T and X in terms of t and x. I entered them below               T = x Sinh[t]     X = x Cosh[t]
