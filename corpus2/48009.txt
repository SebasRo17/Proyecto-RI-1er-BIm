1. As in the title, I want to output the image of a 3D body with its volume and surface area shown nicely beside it. (Maybe in a table?) But how can I do it?   2. Is it possible to calculate the surface area for each specific facets?  For example, consider the simple case:               Manipulate[       {RegionPlot3D[x + y + z < A, {x, 0, 1 - A}, {y, 0, 1 - A}, {z, 0, 1 - A},           PlotRange -> {0, .5}],        NIntegrate[Boole[x + y + z < A], {x, 0, 1 - A}, {y, 0, 1 - A}, {z, 0, 1 - A}]},        {A, 0, .99}]      What I can get so far is showing both the plot and data but not formatting it well. ![Current progress](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Di2BY.png)
