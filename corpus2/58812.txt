What assumption is needed to make both outputs equal to `Sqrt[P^2]/2`               In[65]:= tps = (1/2) (1 - T (1 - P^2) + Sqrt[(1 - T(1 - P^2))^2 - P^2]);              tms = (1/2) (1 - T (1 - P^2) - Sqrt[(1 - T(1 - P^2))^2 - P^2]);              FullSimplify[Sqrt[tms tps]]              FullSimplify[Sqrt[tms] Sqrt[tps]]               Out[67]= Sqrt[P^2]/2          Out[68]= 1/2 Sqrt[1 + (-1 + P^2) T - Sqrt[(-1 + P^2) (-1 + T (2 + (-1 + P^2) T))]]                   Sqrt[1 + (-1 + P^2) T + Sqrt[(-1 + P^2) (-1 + T (2 + (-1 + P^2) T))]]      Comment: There are many similar questions on the web but I couldn't find a proper answer. To assume that T and P are real isn't enough. Edit: T and P are real numbers and not necessarily equal to zero. So the question should better be, what is the reason that both ways don't yield the same result and how can I change this?
