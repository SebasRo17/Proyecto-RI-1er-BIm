I am wondering in Mathematica Can we generate histogram plot with descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, and skewness, attached to the plot ? For example, we may place all the statistics to the right of the plot Here is what I have done. First I created the function:               descriptivestatistics[       data_] := {{"Mean", "Median", "Stdv.", "Skewness",          "Kurtosis"}, {Mean[data], Median[data], StandardDeviation[data],          Skewness[data], Kurtosis[data]}} // TableForm      Then, I placed them on the same list as follows: `{Histogram[data,"PDF",Automatic],descriptivestatistics[data]}`, but I think there is better way to do it. Also, I want to export to be a report e.g., .doc or .pdf Can any one give me suggestions ? Thank you
