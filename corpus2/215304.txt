_I'm not sure if this would fit better inStackExchange/English, but regardless, there is no practical use to the answer, other than to cure my curiosity._ Note this sentence at the end of the Artistic License 2.0: > THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS' AND > WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. It does not affect any legal aspects of the license, but is there a reason they mixed the use of single and double quotes on `"AS IS'`? The license is so new that this wouldn't have been for "command prompt friendly" reasons. Is there special use or meaning behind this in the English language, or was it a typo?
