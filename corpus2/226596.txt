I have a codes table that stores name value pairs and a group name. So for this example let me demonstrate with two rows, each row would represent one value in the same drop down. Group Name = 'Drop_Down_1' Name = 'Value 1' Value = 'This is my value' Group Name = 'Drop_Down_1' Name = 'Value 2' Value = 'This is my value 2' This value would be apart of a drop down on a webpage. When selected and submitted the backend code would get the value 'This is my value', if that value in the drop down was selected. Now depending on the drop down selection I want to do something. So now i need to compare the string in the request command to something. What I do NOT want to do is something like this:                   if(requestParam.equals('This is my value') {             do something         }         else if(requestParam.equals('This is my value 2') {             do something else         }      Now I can query the database and get the appropriate codes back and check against those for equality. But How would i know what action to perform?
