Using .NET - I have an interface IPerson. This interface is implemented by classes in multiple, separate repositories, e.g. EF6 (EfPerson), custom SQL (SqlPerson), or even custom assembly connecting to a web service (WebPerson). Assuming rich domain model, my idea is that my lovely rich domain object 'Person' could have a private member variable _PersonDto of type IPerson, supplied via constructor. The members of Person would be the only way to access data from the _PersonDto. Q. Is there anything actually inherently wrong with that approach? (Assume I'm not lazy loading, and that I will possibly have a service layer for cross- cutting stuff). Please note I'm using DTO here to simply mean the anaemic objects I get back from my repositories.
