I have been asked to write an application (visual application) that can be run both online and locally. This application contains a lot of external data (video, images and audio) files so the main issue I have is deploying this over the web. I want to architect this so that I only have to write 1 system and not a separate code base for the online version. What I and a colleague have come up with so far is;   * Tomcat/Application server - for the code logic   * HTML Pages for the delivery of the content   * A number of small Silverlight Scenes depending on the page that is severed. I have only got a few months so writing 2 sets of applications is not efficient for me. Is this a scalable approach? Are there better ways to write/deploy this type of application?
