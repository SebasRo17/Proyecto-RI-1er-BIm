Let's say that a user requests for some piece of data. Usually the data is processed via a server and then returned in XML/JSON format. Im guessing another piece of processing happens to convert it into HTML/CSS so that it could be displayed on a browser. Why do we bother returning XML/JSON for API requests? Why can't we just directly process whatever the user wants and just return the modified web page (HTML/CSS/JS)?
