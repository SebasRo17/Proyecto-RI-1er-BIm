I would like to write some code in my init.m to save all inputs `{In[1],In[2],...In[lastone]}` right before I close the kernel (or exit Mathematica). Such a script probably should be kernel-specific but I can settle with one log file. In this way I will be able to review each day's work and assess my productivity. Also I can trace some tweaks I am implementing without the need to remember in which file I did this and that ... I hope others in SE also would like such an option.
