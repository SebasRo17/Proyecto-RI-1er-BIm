I have a simple image, for example a blowup of a Times New Roman character like 'R' saved as a PNG. I then perform the following operations to extract a minimum representation of the contour lines around the character:               MorphologicalComponents[Thinning[EdgeDetect[Import["http://li.c-b.co/is/image/LandOfNod/Letter_Giant_Enough_R_232459_LL/$web_zoom$&wid=550&hei=550&/1308310656/not-giant-enough-letter-r.jpg"]]]] // Colorize      (The image in the picture is the best I could do looking around for an example on the Internet...) I'd now like to find a way to pull out an ordered set of coordinates representing the center of pixels connected through their Moore neighborhoods. The hope is that this will yield a polygon representation of the character for 'R'. Is there a simple way to do this that doesn't require me having to compute a Hamiltonian path or cycle?
