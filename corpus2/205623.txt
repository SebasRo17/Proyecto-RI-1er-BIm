I study multicore pipelining and the diagrams are not UML sequence diagrams for instance ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WQrP1.png) Why not remake this diagram like an UML sequence diagram, would not that be more clear so that we can see both how time progresses as well as the data paths since I do not think it is clear distinction between data path and time? In UML time goes downward and the data path goes right and left. Can you comment or answer why pipelining generally is not illustrated with UML?
