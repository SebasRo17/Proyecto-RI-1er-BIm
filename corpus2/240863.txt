My team has all agreed that writing a company development blog is a good idea. There are a lot of documented benefits to blogging, both for the individuals and the company. However, while everyone agrees that a blog is a good idea in theory, no one seems to want to actually sit down and write an entry. Between having and endless flow of other work to be done, most of the team being introverts who don't generally like to put themselves out there, and the notion that there's a good chance the blog won't catch on and will be left to rot in some corner of the internet anyway, I'm not really sure how to get people excited about actually getting started. I don't want to just force someone to start writing if they don't want to, it doesn't help anyone to have a hastily written uninformative boring blog. What can I do to get my team excited about actually getting some article written?
