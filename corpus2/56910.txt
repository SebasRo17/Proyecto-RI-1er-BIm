I am interested in how each individual smart phone is allowed to handle data transfers within a third-party app. I am interested in designing apps that allow customers to update, transfer, download, etc. data from their smart phone to their personal computer and vice-versa. (Ranging from just text, to XML, to a Relational Database) I only have experience with the Ipod Touch before and one particular app that maintained all the data on an online server, so to update the data on your pc or iphone you had to go online, are there other ways to do it? Like bluetooth, wireless LAN, USB, etc? I believe Apple has certain policies on this in order to control the App Store and individual Iphones. I suppose each company has a particular policy on how an app is allowed to transfer data to another system, does anyone have a good understanding of this? Thank you.
