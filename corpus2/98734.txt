I'm a software dev team leader (I recently took control of a new team), and ultimately responsible for maintaining high productivity, good quality and organized priorities. I have 6 senior developers in my team, but things feel like a mess here. The situation is that I have to deal with JIRA requests from about 10 different points of contact in our company, and they all represent different business units, or clients. The problem I have is that my job mainly consists of putting out fires the whole day and making sure that everyone's problems are being worked on. Unfortunately, the culture in our company has been high productivity (fast releases) but low quality (production bugs), and our clients won't accept a sudden delay in results. What are some good ways of handling this? I have tons of theories, but I'm looking for an answer from someone who actually has working experience in a situation like mine. Here is a small list of how things work:   * Each developer is responsible for a specific application and services interacting with it;   * Releases are typically tested by the client in a simulated production server, and then deployed to the live server;   * Each application is used by an average of 50-80 people, with 8 applications in total. Thanks
