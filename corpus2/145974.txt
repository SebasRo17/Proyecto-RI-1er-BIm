I'm writing something on how iterative Fibonacci is substantially better than recursive Fibonacci - a few lines. The main reason of this I find, as do many prominent researchers I believe, is that you don't recalculate values - space vs time. From this I thought **ah ha!** caching! But I'm not sure if it is caching, memoization, buffering or one of the others. I personally think buffering to be the preloading of material before something is done with it vs caching and memorization being more of a processing based thing. The buffering notion is that I get from such a _buffering_ a picture or a video. What is the difference between buffering, memoization, caching and page filing?
