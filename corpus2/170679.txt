There are some programming languages for which exist their own package management systems:   * CTAN for TeX   * CPAN for Perl   * Pip & Eggs for Python   * Maven for Java   * cabal for Haskell   * Gems for Ruby Is there any other languages with such systems? **What about C and C++?** (that's the main question!) Why there are no such systems for them? And isn't creating packages for `yum`, `apt-get` or other general package management systems better?
