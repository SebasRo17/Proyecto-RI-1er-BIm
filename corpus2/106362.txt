I had a discussion with a coworker today, whether usage of using the Java operator `instanceof` is a kind of reflection. And the discussion quickly evolved into what actually defines reflection. **So, what is the definition of reflection?** **And is the usage of`instanceof` considered "using reflection" ?** And in addition, if `instanceof` is considered reflection, then is polymorphism not also "using reflection"? If not, what is the difference?
