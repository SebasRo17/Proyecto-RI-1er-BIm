I think the title says it all. I know about `ImageCapture` which seems to capture stills. Can `ImageCapture` be made to capture a movie analogous to using say QuickTime player (and export to video format)? Likewise, if a microphone is connected to your computer (e.g. something that can be used by QuickTime to record) can Mathematica record sound? **Edit** Because I was aware of `ImageCapture` prior to posting this question I did some searches looking for functions that may involve recording e.g.:               ?*ecord*      But got no hits. It is frustrating to find that capturing an image gets its own intuitive function name whereas recording sound does not. But even more frustration that on my Mac I get this:               SystemDialogInput["RecordSound"]     SystemDialogInput::unsupt: "The \!\(\"RecordSound\"\) dialog type is not currently supported on this platform. "      **Edit 2** Thanks for the frame by frame type capture solutions posted below but I was hoping for a more direct (native) solution -- even if undocumented -- that would be analogous to me just controlling QuickTime from within Mma (which can be done). As for recording sound, does anyone know why `SystemDialogInput["RecordSound"] ` isn't supported on Macs and what potential methods exist for Mac? thanks Mike **Edit 3** In Version 9 `SystemDialogInput["RecordSound"]` works on Macs.
