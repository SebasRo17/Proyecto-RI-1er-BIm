I'm a growing programmer who's finally putting unit testing into practice for a library that I'm storing on GitHub. It occurred to me that I might include the test suites in the repo, but as I look around at other projects, the inclusion of tests seems hit-or-miss. Is this considered bad form? Is the idea that users are only interested in the working code and that they'll test in their own framework anyway?
