It was suggested on my Stack Overflow question that this might be better suited to this site, so I'm cross-posting it. I'm working on my first ground-up build of an MVC site. I have a collection of views, a collection of models, and I've tested most of my views and fixed the obvious bugs. The last step I need to do is tie the views together - to enable the user to click links/buttons and move between them. Most of my Google searches for Actions and ActionLinks in MVC/Razor lead me back to StackOverflow, to very specific questions which don't really help me out - the questions assume what I'm trying to learn. I'm trying to learn at a high level the way to pass various things to controller methods (i.e. override the controller method for a view to accept 2 parameters versus 3, or to accept POST data, understand what will be passed along from one view to another action from an Html.Action call, etc).
