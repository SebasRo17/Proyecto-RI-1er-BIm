As part of a PHP project, I have to insert a row into a MySQL database. I'm obviously used to doing this, but this required inserting into 90 columns in one query. The resulting query looks horrible and monolithic (especially inserting my PHP variables as the values):               INSERT INTO mytable (column1, colum2, ..., column90)      VALUES     ('value1', 'value2', ..., 'value90')      and I'm concerned that I'm not going about this in the right way. It also took me a long (boring) time just to type everything in and testing writing the test code will be equally tedious I fear. How do professionals go about quickly writing and testing these queries? Is there a way I can speed up the process?
