I'm not a game developer or anything, but I know that Java is not very widely used for game development. Java should be fast enough for most games, so where's the catch? I can think of some reasons:   * Lack of game developers with expertice in Java   * Lack of good game development frameworks   * Programmers don't want to accept Java as a games programming language. Most only accept C++ as that?   * No support for game consoles (though the PC market still exists) It could of course be something else. Could someone who knows the business better than me explain why Java isn't getting momentum when it comes to game development?
