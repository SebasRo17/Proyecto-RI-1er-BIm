I have a set of user queries from a search engine that I want to cluster. The only clustering algorithm I have come across so far is the K-means clustering algorithm, which requires defining the number of clusters up front. But in this case, I do not know how many clusters exist in the data. Is there any clustering algorithm that performs clustering without predefining the number of clusters?
