Is it possible to refer to the next element of the list when I'm using `Map` or should I always use `For` in this case?   For example I can write:               (1 + #1) & /@ {a, b, c, d}      but I can not write:               (1 + #1 + #2) & /@ {a, b, c, d}      The problem with the last element should be also avoided. So in last example I would like to get something like               { 1 + a + b, 1 + b + c, 1 + c + d, 1 + d}
