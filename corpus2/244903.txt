I have following development setup for my PHP projects:   * Working station running on Windows 7 with PhpStorm IDE.   * GIT for version controlling.   * CentOS on virtual machine (VirtualBox) with Apache and MySQL (copy of production server). So far, I've been sharing project's source folders between host and guest systems and it was working quite well only really slow. The reason behind this is that Apache was reading files from remote folder (mounted locally). After doing some research, I found out that this set up can be improved by using disk mapping (Samba) instead of folder sharing. So I did that change. I configured my PhpStorm to automatically deploy files to mapped drive. Everything works like a charm now, except for one problem - when I change branches I need to synchronize project's local folder with the one on mapped drive and that takes time, a lot of time (like branching in SVN). Is there another way to handle this than just working on files directly on mapped drive?
