I've seen a few instances where programmers have been stymied when installing a new piece of software or creating a non-trivial software project, due to a lack of knowledge of how to use compilers, build systems, and binutils. Examples of errors where someone gets stuck are   * 'make' doesn't know how to build a particular filename   * A build system invokes a program with arguments that it doesn't understand    * A header file outside the project is not found   * A symbol name isn't found at link time How do you teach developers what they need to know to understand what a build system error means, narrow down its cause, and fix it? Is there a good reference on how linux development environments work?
