[If this fits more to stackoverflow then transfer it there please.] Hi, I'm trying to implement a priority queue in C. The easiest way I found to do it is with a circular array (rather than using a linked list). I have an array of fixed size, the index for the `first` element in the queue and the index for the `next` free place in the queue. But I'm struggling with dequing the maximum value... I know how to get the maximum value, but not how to move next and first so that the queue stays contiguous in the array (the only way I know of it working). How should I do this? Or do you have a suggestion for a better implementation? Thanks
