Let's say I have a list, for instance {10,5,3}, indicating the bases for each digit of my 3-digit number. Using this basis, if I wanted to increment {8,4,1} a couple of times, here's what I would get:               {8,3,1} -> {9,3,1} -> {0,4,1} -> ... -> {9,4,1} -> {0,0,2} -> and so on      Now I can go ahead and do this using loops like one would normally do. But I'm sure there's a more elegant way of implementing this using some of Mathematica's already existing functions. Can anybody think of a sleek way to do this? Thanks in advance,
