We are a small team that is about to start developing a localized version of a successful US web app in Korea, using RoR. Our question is: What process would you recommend we use to go about developing the app? Should we start with the data models? The views in HTML and then code them? Take a single feature, develop it and then add additional features as necessary? A few more details about the project:   1. it is a web app for small business owners   2. it includes the usual crm-reporting-dashboard-user admin-document mgmtfeatures that most small biz apps tend to have   3. team size is initially 2 people: a programmer and a designer/CSS guru (just one coder)   4. experience level is medium. good knowledge of Git, Ruby, Rails and XHTML/CSS, less experienced with deployment issues. this is the first project of its kind that we are doing together as a team
