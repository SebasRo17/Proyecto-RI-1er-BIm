I am trying to compute the following integral:               Integrate[Exp[Sum[-((cw λ - b[i])^2/(2 σ^2)), {i, 1, n}]], {cw, 0, 1}]      And currently _Mathematica_ outputs > >     (Sqrt[π/2] σ (Erf[(Sqrt[n] (λ - b[i]))/(Sqrt[2] σ)] + >          Erf[(Sqrt[n] b[i])/(Sqrt[2] σ)]))/(Sqrt[n] λ) >   Which is not only blatantly incorrect (there can be no dependence on `i` for example), but also has little connection with my input. If I replace `n` with an integer in the first expression, the output is the correct result for the integration, but I want the general result with `n` summands. What am I doing wrong? **Edit:** I am willing to make assumptions, such as that `λ`, `σ` and all `b[i]`'s are real. Nonetheless, that does not seem to matter here.
