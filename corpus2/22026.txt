I've got this simple problem with two lists. I select some items from a list, but I want to visualize the difference between the previous list and the list that I create with `Select`. For instance:               a = {{7, 0, 0, 2}, {0, 0, 2, 5}, {10, 4, 8, 7}, {7, 1, 9, 2}, {1, 3, 6, 7},           {6, 9, 2, 9}, {2, 0, 7, 1}, {2, 5, 1, 1}, {9, 6, 4, 0}, {9, 9, 2, 8}};     b = Select[a, #[[4]] > 5 &];      I want a list that compare the two lists in this manner               results =        {{7, 0, 0, "-"}, {0, 0, 2, "-"}, {10, 4, 8, 7}, {7, 1, 9, "-"}, {1, 3, 6, 7},         {6, 9, 2, 9}, {2, 0, 7, "-"}, {2, 5, 1, "-"}, {9, 6, 4, "-"}, {9, 9, 2, 8}};
