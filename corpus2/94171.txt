I have been designing a database where it is very important to provide users with a good search mechanism. So I was wondering what some of the best practices are for using keywords to search over multiple database tables and return the relevent records? Some other things I am curious about:   * The users location, if they provide an address   * The speed of the algorithm Additional Information: I am using C# and LINQ-To-SQL.
