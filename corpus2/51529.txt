I'm a complete newbie to Mathematica. I've been using Wolfram Alpha Pro as well as MS Mathematics for a few months but wanted to dive into using a more powerful tool. I'm having a problem with calculating a simple derivative and I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. I tried using free-form input after unsuccessfully trying to use Mathematica syntax but I get the same results. The same query works fine in Wolfram Alpha Pro. I'm getting pages of repetitive output. Here are a couple of screenshots. The second one is a continuation from further down showing "MaxFormatDepthExceeded" errors. Any help is greatly appreciated. I apologize for such a basic question. P.S. I've added a 3rd screenshot to illustrate the successful results for the same query in Wolfram Alpha Pro. As an aside, can anyone suggest any resources to quickly jump-start my usage of Mathematica? I started to go through the documentation but some of it was quite dense and assumed a level of knowledge that I don't yet have as a first semester calculus student who hasn't done math in some time. ![screenshot 1](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8Gpuu.png) ![screenshot 2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/r4p1z.png) ![same query in Wolfram Alpha Pro](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3SC25.png)
