I am trying to assign values to some model parameters using WSMSetValues function, however, it seems to be working only with values greater than 10^-4. Is this normal behavior or I am doing something wrong? Of course, I could manually type in these values in Model Center and it would work fine, but I wish to do this programmatically. Here is an example:               Needs["WSMLink`"];     param = {"TT1.C2" -> 1. 10^-7, "TT1.C1" -> 1. 10^-7,      "TT1.R6" -> 10000., "TT1.R5" -> 10000., "TT1.R4" -> 10000.,      "TT1.R3" -> 5400., "TT1.R2" -> 10000., "TT1.R1" -> 10000.};     m = "filter";       WSMSetValues[m, param];       WSMModelData[m, "ParameterValues"]        and this is an output showing that C1 and C2 did not take desired values:                {TT1\[UpPointer]resistor1\[UpPointer]useHeatPort -> False,       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor1\[UpPointer]T ->       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor1\[UpPointer]T\[UnderBracket]ref,       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor1\[UpPointer]R -> TT1\[UpPointer]R1,       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor1\[UpPointer]T\[UnderBracket]ref -> 300.15,       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor1\[UpPointer]alpha -> 0,       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor2\[UpPointer]useHeatPort -> False,       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor2\[UpPointer]T ->       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor2\[UpPointer]T\[UnderBracket]ref,       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor2\[UpPointer]R -> TT1\[UpPointer]R2,       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor2\[UpPointer]T\[UnderBracket]ref -> 300.15,       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor2\[UpPointer]alpha -> 0,       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor3\[UpPointer]useHeatPort -> False,       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor3\[UpPointer]T ->       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor3\[UpPointer]T\[UnderBracket]ref,       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor3\[UpPointer]R -> TT1\[UpPointer]R3,       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor3\[UpPointer]T\[UnderBracket]ref -> 300.15,       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor3\[UpPointer]alpha -> 0,       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor4\[UpPointer]useHeatPort -> False,       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor4\[UpPointer]T ->       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor4\[UpPointer]T\[UnderBracket]ref,       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor4\[UpPointer]R -> TT1\[UpPointer]R4,       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor4\[UpPointer]T\[UnderBracket]ref -> 300.15,       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor4\[UpPointer]alpha -> 0,       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor5\[UpPointer]useHeatPort -> False,       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor5\[UpPointer]T ->       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor5\[UpPointer]T\[UnderBracket]ref,       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor5\[UpPointer]R -> TT1\[UpPointer]R5,       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor5\[UpPointer]T\[UnderBracket]ref -> 300.15,       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor5\[UpPointer]alpha -> 0,       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor6\[UpPointer]useHeatPort -> False,       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor6\[UpPointer]T ->       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor6\[UpPointer]T\[UnderBracket]ref,       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor6\[UpPointer]R -> TT1\[UpPointer]R6,       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor6\[UpPointer]T\[UnderBracket]ref -> 300.15,       TT1\[UpPointer]resistor6\[UpPointer]alpha -> 0,       TT1\[UpPointer]capacitor1\[UpPointer]C -> TT1\[UpPointer]C1,       TT1\[UpPointer]capacitor2\[UpPointer]C -> TT1\[UpPointer]C2,       TT1\[UpPointer]R1 -> 10000, TT1\[UpPointer]R2 -> 10000,       TT1\[UpPointer]R3 -> 5400, TT1\[UpPointer]R4 -> 10000,       TT1\[UpPointer]R5 -> 10000, TT1\[UpPointer]R6 -> 10000,       TT1\[UpPointer]C1 -> 0, TT1\[UpPointer]C2 -> 0}        Since I could not attach the model here, I am providing a link for the same question I asked at Wolfram student forum where i was able to attach the model: http://forums.wolfram.com/student-support/topics/487059 Thank you, Tatjana
