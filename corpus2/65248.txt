I recently went through the article on "Advice for Computer Science College Students", by Joel Spolsky - http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CollegeAdvice.html . In that Joel says that a programmer who understands the fundamentals of business is going to be a more valuable programmer, to a business, than a programmer who doesn't. Many ideas do make sense in code, but not in business. I'd like to know if there are some quick reference manuals for CS students to learn micro-economics. I'd like to know the ebooks that would help one to understand the basics of it.
