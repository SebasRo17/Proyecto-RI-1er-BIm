In grad school I took a class in multiprocessor and distributed operating systems. I think multiprocessor software development will become increasingly important and will be driven by the need to maintain the gains we are accustomed to having from Moore's law as described in an article from Herb Sutter. The Free Lunch Is Over : A Fundamental Turn Toward Concurrency in Software http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm From the class we learned a little about threads, processes, mutual exclusions, spin locks, p-threads, semaphores, UMA and CCNUMA architectures, and OpenMP. But I think this is just a start.   * What should I learn to better prepare for this kind of work?   * Who is doing projects in this area?   * Is this going to a a common skill soon, and if so, how can I best leverage what I know today?
