I gave up on programming a little over a year ago when I kept hitting this wall. I am revisiting the subject because I want to create basic Android application. But I feel that my limited knowledge will not suffice. Here is my problem. I have read a few books and watched video tutorials on C#/Java, followed examples, then finished the book. In the end they always seem to leave me dumbfounded as to what to do next. What a mean is they teach you from your basic "hello world" application all the way up to if's and arrays then seemingly expect you to know how to go out into the world of coding and create anything. Am I missing something here? I know these are the building blocks of all programs but books that I read never really show me what to do next. The easy answer I suppose would be to 'start coding', but where? I read "Head First Java" for example; up to the part were they tell you take everything you have learned and create a dog racing game.... "try not to cheat and look at the source code provided, you should be able to do this by now" _ that's not an exact quote but basically that's what I was told....... Half an hour ago they were just explaining how to do arrays, then without any theory I am meant to create a working game? The reason I ask this is because I fear that this is all I am supposed to know to at least start coding, yet it feels like I have been given a small toolbox and been told to build a skyscraper. Thank you for any advice
