I want to learn OOP. I know Python and I know very little things about OOP. But when I search for "learn OOP" in forums I saw a guy saying that "Python is so new that's why you can't learn OOP on Python. you should learn Java then understand OOP on Java" Is it true? Is there any difference understanding OOP on different programming languages? like learn it on Java, C#, C++, Perl or Python?
