Please take a look at following toy example:               Graphics[{      Dynamic[{       If[CurrentValue["MouseOver"], Red, Blue], Thickness@.05, Line[{{0, 0}, {.5, 0}}]}],      Dynamic[{       If[CurrentValue["MouseOver"], Red, Blue], Disk[{.5, 0}, .2]}]       }, PlotRange -> {{0, .6}, {-.3, .3}}]      > ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/U6aIC.png) You can put cursor over the `Disk` or `Line`. As you can see the `Disk` covers the `Line`, so you can only get: > ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1jioK.png) or > ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/wUYbr.png) But as soon as we add `Deploy` (`Deploy@Graphics[...`), the `Disk` becomes transparent to the `"MouseOver"` event, and we can get the following result (with cursor on the right place): > ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Zfhfl.png) This behaviour is so unexpected, I'm tempted to call it a bug. This change in behaviour is huge! In this context, `Deploy` as a quick and nice function seems to be unreliable. :/ V9.0.1 Win7 * * * The walkaround is similar like there: Delay of events detection dependent of “MouseDown” position. But I doubt the reason is the same.
