I have studied 2 out of 4 years in college, mainly math and physics so I am fairly technical. For some reason I have never really learnt to code before last month. And I was so thrilled and I am going to concentrate my last 2 years in college solely for learning to program. My question is: If I study like a Mad Man my last 2 years before graduation can I learn enough programming to get a good and reputable entry level software engineer job/intership. And by reputable I mean something like Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Google, IBM, Oracle etc. Is it possible to start from scratch and learn in 2 years enough skills to make it?
