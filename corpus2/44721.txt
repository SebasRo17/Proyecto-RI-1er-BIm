I have a list of lists. For example,                list = {{0,1,0,1,true},{0,0,0,0,false},{0,1,1,1,true},{1,1,1,1,false},{2,2,2,2,false}}      I'd like to find all lists that have the fifth element set to `true`. I'm looking for a general method that works for any lists in this format. How can I do this? In the above example, the result that I'm looking for would be:                {{0,1,0,1,true},{0,1,1,1,true}}      Sorry for such a basic question. I looked through the documentation for lists, and couldn't find a way to do this. I'm still fairly new at _Mathematica_.
