We have a university programming course and fellow students are asking some programming questions in our Facebook group. I'm a little hesitant to share all of my programs, especially if it's something cool for one of the assignments, since these are looked at by the TAs and they might notice if somebody has the same program and start asking questions on where it came from. Still, sometimes I'd like to share my code to help others, but I don't wanting people just grabbing my work. _(Clarification: We are allowed to collaborate with the tasks)_ This is of course a thin line. While I want to help some people, I'm concerned that they may not have the academic honesty to rewrite the code on their own. Most of my fellow students are not very advanced in their skills, so I'd get away with say hiding my name in Base-64 encoded string crafted into a discrete place. Still, it may be too obvious for a random string to be sitting around. **What options exist to hide my name in a program without it looking suspicious?** I've seen over at CodeGolf that they have made ascii art turn into other things when evaluated. Are there similar strategies I could utilize? The ideal solution would be something that looks like something that fits in discreetly but in reality has a function to prove that I coded it from the beginning. Clarification: _(Sorry, should have said this earlier)_ We're allowed to collaborate but have to explain our programs to the TAs to get the points. It's just for satisfaction to hide some Easter Eggs in other's code if it leaks out, especially since it may be tempting to exchange programs to check that the answers to problems they generate are equivalent etc or to see how others solve the problem.
