Which of the following options take less processing time/is less expensive in a graph traversal algorithm for a (indoor)navigation system? a) To produce all possible paths between start and destination points (nodes on the graph) then applying a filtering mechanism to match the navigation user's capabilities and preferences (such as finding all the paths on the graph and then exclude stairways for wheelchair users), or b) As soon as the user's profile is available to the system, filter the graph and exclude the paths which are non-traversable for this user and then run a shortest path algorithm?
