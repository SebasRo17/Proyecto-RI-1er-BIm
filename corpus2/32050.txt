While working on How to capitalize the first letter of each word in a string and trying to understand why certain characters were not considered letters I tried this:               StringCases["áéíóöőüű", _?LetterQ]      > >     LetterQ::string: String expected at position 1 in > LetterQ[Removed[$$Failure]]. >> >   >     LetterQ::string: String expected at position 1 in > LetterQ[Removed[$$Failure]]. >> >   >     LetterQ::string: String expected at position 1 in > LetterQ[Removed[$$Failure]]. >> >   >     General::stop: Further output of LetterQ::string will be suppressed > during this calculation. >> >   >     {} >   I then tried a `Print` function to see what was going on:               StringCases["áéíóöőüű", _?Print];      > >     á   >     é   >     í   >     ó   >     ö   >     ő   >     ü   >     ű   >   No errors. Then I tried a function that Prints, but returns `True`:               StringCases["áéíóöőüű", _?((Print["(", FullForm@#, ")"]; True) &)]      This produced interleaved lines of characters (expected) and `Removed[$$Failure]` (not expected). I can't include the output properly because of this StackExchange bug.   * What is the cause of this?   * Has it been fixed since version 7?
