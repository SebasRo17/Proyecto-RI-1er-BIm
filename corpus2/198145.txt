Here is my problem: programming (learning about programming, coding, etc) is my hobby. I do it in my freetime.   I have a full time job, which literally drains my brain (no kidding!) by the end of the day so much I can't even add three-digit numbers, but I still want to do some programming-related things. Learning in this state is stupid, finding bugs is impossible. Writing unit test worked sort-of :D   I understand that programming is a very conscious activity, but I need to get my job done every day and I still want to deal with some programming-related stuff, as it's very fun to me. What do you suggest ?   I tought about watching videos, but what topic should I looking for with this state of my mind (which are easy to understand but I can still learn a lot from them) ?   (I can't do it before work, as it is far more important to be fresh there than during my hobby...) Edit: The question need a bit of addition, which I left off intentionally at first, because I tought my question is clear.   I have no problem at all with my brain activity or anything like that, the "brain drain" cause is that I do 9-10 hours _very intense_ mental job a day (much more intense than for example programming or thinking about solving problems), with only less than 5 minutes pause every hour. It is not possible to change it or pause more or think less (huh?!) between those working hours.
