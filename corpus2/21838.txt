Why are the messages almost always defined like this (at least in packages):               If[Not@ValueQ[function::usage], function::usage = "Usage message"]      and not just like this?               function::usage = "Usage message";      Is this some sort of safety measure in case of double loading of the package?   I also notice that error messages, coming after usage messages, are usually defined the second way.   I cannot imagine a reason why I would do that.   Are there situations when someone would like to import a package, redefine some usage messages and be sure they are not reset in case of reloading of the package?
