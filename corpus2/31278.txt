I've got a pretty basic problem, which is probably easily solved, but for all my efforts I haven't found a solution yet: I want to make an Image importer of the following form: An `InputField` in which the name (either on computer or on web) can be put in, and next to it a button saying `"Import"`, and clicking of which imports, and displays the picture in the output. I've tried the following, but I keep getting an error message                DynamicModule[{x = "image name"},                     {InputField[Dynamic[x]],                      Button["import", Print[Import[Dynamic[x]]]]                    }                   ]      > >     Import::chtype: >   What am I doing wrong? Might be something very basic, I'm still pretty new to _Mathematica_ and `Dynamic` functions in particular.
