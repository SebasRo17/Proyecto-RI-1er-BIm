I want to use the `MinCut` function of the `GraphUtilities`` package to find minimum cuts for a few graphs. I'm completely new to _Mathematica_ , so I took a look at the documentation of the function and the tutorial. Here's what I did:               Needs["GraphUtilities`"]     g = {1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 1, 2 -> 4, 4 -> 5, 5 -> 6, 6 -> 4};     c = MinCut[g,2]      After the second line, I'm getting an output representing the cut sets, such as               {{1,2,3}, {4,5,6}}       If I plot the output, I can determine from the figure the size of the cut. With a bigger graph, that is not feasible. Hence the question: > How can I easily count the size of cut, that is the number of edges between > the two sets, i.e. the number of crossing edges?
