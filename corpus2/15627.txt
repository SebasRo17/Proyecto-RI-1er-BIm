I am looking for opinions from _Mathematica_ users about _Mathematica_ itself. After reading the faq, I thought that in some sense I "wish to solve a problem using _Mathematica_ " ... although I understand that this question is probably too vague. I hope not to be distracting here. I see that some researchers (in math and computer science) at my university use _Mathematica_ to carry out intricate calculations. I wonder if mathematical software today is so good that it can do better than humans at symbolic manipulation. This would mean that it would be really worthwhile to acquire some background in using such software, especially in those fields of research where one often has to deal with huge formulas. Also, two subquestions:   1. How does one cite the use of _Mathematica_ in a research paper? One could in principle say "beginning from formula X, using _Mathematica_ we get Y". Would that be accepted professionally?   2. Are these systems foolproof (particularly _Mathematica_ )? I mean, is it known that there are no special instances of symbolic-manipulation problems for which the software could end up doing an error dealing with them? P.S. I didn't find a proper tag for my question.
