I have been programming for around 3-4 years now (completed my degree in CS where we were taught the Java programming language). Now my question is: > Do many people find it a difficult task knowing how to write code from off > the bat? What I mean by this is that when I approach a task I would normally look on google to find examples of pre-existing programs to which I would cut and pick sections that would be of use to create my programs rather that think totally logically, knowing what I would need to use from the class libraries to puzzle together to reach my end goal. An example of this is say I was creating an animated GUI. Now for that GUI to work I would usually look at other examples on google and piece together code to reach my desired effect, rather than going to the class libraries and working out exactly what I need to piece together a working program as the libraries can be quite daunting in knowing where to start to find sections that would be useful to you! Just wondering if many others do the same as me or if I'm a minority? Don't know if others find it hard but sometimes I just get confused in knowing what classes I would need or what would be the best way to approach a task.
