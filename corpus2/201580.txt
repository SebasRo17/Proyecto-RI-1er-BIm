I am busy writing a Python application using ZeroMQ and implementing a variation of the Majordomo pattern as described in the ZGuide. I have a broker as an intermediary between a set of workers and clients. I want to do some extensive logging for every request that comes in, but I do not want the broker to waste time doing that. The broker should pass that logging request to something else. I have thought of two ways :-   1. Create workers that are only for logging and use the ZeroMQ IPC transport   2. Use Multiprocessing with a Queue I am not sure which one is better or faster for that matter. The first option does allow me to use the current worker base classes that I already use for normal workers, but the second option seems quicker to implement. I would like some advice or comments on the above or possibly a different solution.
