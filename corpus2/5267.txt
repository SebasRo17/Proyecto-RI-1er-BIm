I've founded a startup with my friends a few months ago, and—due to some personal issues like starting college and moving to a new town—I've found that I'm likely going to miss an important deadline for the project we're working on. I'm stressing out about this, and I'm not sure what I should do. How can I handle this stress and communicate the delay to my team?
