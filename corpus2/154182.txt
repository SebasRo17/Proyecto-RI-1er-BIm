I'm writing an app that will make available a set of api functions that require cross site scripting to work. I'll be utilizing jsonp which will allow other developers to consume these services for their web applications.   * What security concerns should I consider to protect my server data?   * What security concerns should other developers take when consuming my services via jsonp?
