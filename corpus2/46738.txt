I am trying to make a `ButtonBar` that prints the name of the card in question. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/x50De.png) What I have so far is as follows:               myHand = {{1, "Spades"}, {4, "Hearts"}, {5, "Clubs"}, {8,         "Spades"}, {9, "Hearts"}, {9, "Spades"}, {11, "Spades"}};          ButtonBar[Table[       ToString[myHand[[i, 1]]] <> " of " <> ToString[myHand[[i, 2]]] :>        Print[myHand[[i]]],       {i, Length@myHand}]      ]      However, instead of working as expected and printing out the name of the card in question, it always prints out `{9, Hearts}`. When I looked into the `FullForm` for this it made sense why:               ButtonBar[List[RuleDelayed["1 of Spades", Print[Part[myHand, i]]],       RuleDelayed["4 of Hearts", Print[Part[myHand, i]]],       RuleDelayed["5 of Clubs", Print[Part[myHand, i]]],       RuleDelayed["8 of Spades", Print[Part[myHand, i]]],       RuleDelayed["9 of Hearts", Print[Part[myHand, i]]],       RuleDelayed["9 of Spades", Print[Part[myHand, i]]],       RuleDelayed["11 of Spades", Print[Part[myHand, i]]]]]      The rule is to print out `i`, not the actual number. How can I remedy this so that my `Table` generates a list of actual rules without holding the `i`s back from being evaluated in the `Table`?
