I have the following MWE               Show[      Plot[x, {x, 0, 2}, Frame -> True,        FrameLabel -> {Style["frequency", Medium],          Style["\!\(\*SubscriptBox[\(v\), \(mean\)]\)", Medium]},        PlotLegends -> {"asd"}],      ListPlot[{{0.5, 0.25}, {1, 0.5}}, PlotStyle -> Red,        PlotLegends -> {"asd"}]]      There are several things I am trying to do, which I can't get to work. I will list them here   1. How can I make the two legends be inside the graph, not outside?   2. How can I make the legends be aligned over/under eachother, exactly? Now the are aligned to the left.   3. I am really interested in finding a way to alter the size of the `FrameLabel`, ticks and legends in a easy way. So far I have only been able to do it by using `Small`, `Medium` and `Large`, but that is not very dynamic.
