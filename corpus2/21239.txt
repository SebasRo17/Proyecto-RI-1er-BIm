I am trying to model a 1st order Gauss Markov Process (gyroscope drift). I know the Allan Variance characteristics of the process (bias instability, random walk characteristics). I know the model should look like:               RandomFunction[SomeProcess[some_process_args], {some_time_characteristics}]       but not quite sure where to start. I looked up `ARProcess` but it only seems to work with a unit time increment
