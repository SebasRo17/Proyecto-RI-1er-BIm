I know I should not expect a lawyer's notice here, but programmers advices would suit me well enough. I want to publish a program which is derivated from a GPL-licensed program. I understand from the GPL legal notice that the whole work is to be licensed under GPL as well. Now, I'd rather publish my work under a more permissive license â€” namely, I don't care about attribution. It seems to me that CC0 or WTFPL licenses, for instance, don't need the work to be considered as a whole, right ? So as they are compatible with the GPL, in principle I could just say something like (in addition to the GPL notice) the following : > This work is GPL as a derivative work of foobar. In addition, modifications > with regards to the original foobar are WTFPL/CC0. Would this be valid licensing ?
