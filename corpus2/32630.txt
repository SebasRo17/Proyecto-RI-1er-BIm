I have a list of data and for the calculation I only need the a of portion of the data. I know that `Take[data, {1,100}]`, for example, is taking line 1 to 100 of the file. But what I need it for me is to take percentage of the data like, drop first 10% and drop last 10% of the data. So I'll only have 80% of the middle portion to work with. So that if I have multiple list with amount of data changing I would not have to keep counting the number of lines or length to calculate. Thanks.
