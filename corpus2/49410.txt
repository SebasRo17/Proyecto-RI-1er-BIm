I'm a first year student in CS and I absolutely love programming. Many people have told me it isn't so good once you start working due to bringing your work home (thinking about how to solve problems throughout the day), working many hours when the deadline is near, and so on. I've heard being a system administrator is a less stressful job, since you don't have to worry about it at home. So my questions are (for experienced programmers):   * Is it worth becoming a programmer?   * Does your job satisfy you enough to overcome these problems? Thanks in advance.
