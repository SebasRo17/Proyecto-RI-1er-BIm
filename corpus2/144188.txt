## Background I was just asked in a tech interview to write an algorithm to traverse an "object" (notice the quotes) where A is equal to B and B is equal to C and A is equal to C. That's it. That is all the information I was given. I asked the interviewer what the goal was but apparently there wasn't one, just "traverse" the "object". I don't know about anyone else, but this seems like a silly question to me. I asked again, "am I searching for a value?". Nope. Just "traverse" it. Why would I ever want to endlessly loop through this "object"?? To melt my processor maybe?? The _answer_ according to the interviewer was that I should have written a recursive function. OK, so why not simply ask me to write a recursive function? And who would write a recursive function that never ends? ## My question: Is this a valid question to the rest of you and, if so, can you provide a hint as to what I might be missing? Perhaps I am thinking too hard about solving real world problems. I have been successfully coding for a long time but this tech interview process makes me feel like I don't know anything.
