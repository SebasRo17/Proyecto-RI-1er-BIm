When I try and simplify this expression:               In[1]:= FullSimplify[Sqrt[ x^2 + 2 y^2 + 2 y Sqrt[x^2 + y^2] ], (x | y) \[Element] Reals]     Out[1]= Sqrt[x^2 + 2 y (y + Sqrt[x^2 + y^2])]      it does not simplify properly.   However, _Mathematica_ knows it equals a simpler expression:               In[2]:= FullSimplify[ Sqrt[x^2 + 2 y^2 + 2 y Sqrt[x^2 + y^2] ] == Sqrt[x^2 + y^2] + y, (x | y) \[Element] Reals]     Out[2]= True      Why doesn't _Mathematica_ simplify this expression, and how can I make it do it anyway, even if the expression is part of a larger expression?
