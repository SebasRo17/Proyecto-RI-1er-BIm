I am more of a desktop developer that a web developer. Therefore I only know XHTML and CSS when it comes to the web (and C#, if that is in any way useful). I have a _little_ experience with ASP.NET with C# but I am in no ways an expert in it. Say I want to write a small website to give a preview to any new software I make. Is XHTML and CSS enough to make it? Will I _need_ to learn some server- side language? (or web development framework?) If so any suggestions? I don't want to create something as awesome as Facebook or Stack-overflow. Just a normal website, kind of like http://thenewboston.com.
