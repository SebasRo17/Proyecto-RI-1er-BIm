I'm not quite sure if this is a question for programmers.se rather than stackoverflow, but here goes. So Facebook [or any other large company] when given something like an apostrophe or html, can strip it of its malicious intent, but still display it properly. My current sanitizing function in PHP just strips those characters/makes them harmless via htmlentities() and such. So if I wrote an HTML tag, I would want it to be sanitized but also displayed on the website. How do I do this?
