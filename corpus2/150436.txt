Microsoft released Silverlight 5 but there has been no news of any future versions (except service releases) being released. Combined with the increasing visibility of HTML5 and modern JavaScript libraries it now makes a lot of sense to start adopting the new and emerging technology instead of relying on Silverlight whose future is in doubt. Given this what are the migration strategies that you are using to move away from Silverlight? Any lessons learnt so far?
