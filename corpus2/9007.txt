Is it possible in `Histogram3D` to substitute frame ticks text labels and have the layout in x-y plane? Starting with a `Histogram3D` such as ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SSh8Z.jpg) Then combining with additional `Graphics3D` text elements, eg:                Text[Style[lbl, Medium], {-1, pos + 1/2, 0}, {1, 0}, {1.5, -1}]      Text orientation changes with histogram rotations, and they look awful. Any ideas?
