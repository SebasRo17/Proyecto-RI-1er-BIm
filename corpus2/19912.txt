Where I can find overview of computer science, programming etc.? I graduated in physics and want to begin programming or similar and I'm not even sure of what's out there or where to begin. What I'm looking for is some broad overview of existing technologies - just like you have a book "Physics of elementary particles" that explains general view of that area, but for computers/programming of course. Do you have some book to recommend?
