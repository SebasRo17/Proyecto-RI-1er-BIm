I would like to find out how to programmatically turn off the LED on the USB flash drive. I haven't found any tutorials or good source to get to started with it. I'm willing to try to rewrite or to debug drivers if it will be required. I have experience with programming(any language, but preferably C or Python). I have experience with OllyDBG and IDA PRO. I have some experience with engineering(small devices like Arduino). I'm not interested in disconnecting LED form the board, or closing it with black duct-tape. I need to do it manually using some script, tool, or by rewriting the driver. I have seen a lot of question like this, but non of them have any information that can be used. I also tried to contact some of the persons who have answered to similar question, but no luck so far. I would really appreciate if someone could give me some information or guideline of how to do this. P.S. I need this a start with another project. I want to disable LED on the USB webcam that I have, but I don't know where to start, so I think it will be easier to do with a USB flash drive first. Also, I want to do this on Windows. But if any information is available for Linux I will gladly look at it. Any information regarding any flash drive or webcam will do just fine. * * * I think I have confused many of you. This question is not about turning off LED on **webcam**. It's about turning off LED on **flash drive**. Regular USB flash drive, where no hard can be done if LED will be disabled. I'm sure that they have opinion to blink. For example when transmitting data on flash drive LED in blinking. When it's inactive the LED is on or off. Of course it depends on the flash drive model and manufacturer. But if someone can point how to do it on any flash drive and point where to buy it(eBay, Amazon or any other e-shop), I will be gladly to try it out.
