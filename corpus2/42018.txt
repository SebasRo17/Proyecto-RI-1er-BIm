I am trying to use RSolve with indexing beginning at 0. Whenever I enter a basic command such as to solve a difference equation such as $a_{n} = 2a_{n-1} + 1$:               RSolve[a[n + 1] - 2 a[n] == 1, a[n], n]      it gives the solution               {{a[n] -> -1 + 2^n + 2^(-1 + n) C[1]}}      Which is the solution if indexing begins at 1. I am interested in finding a solution where indexing begins at 0. I know that this can be achieved by giving an initial value for x[n], however I am looking for a way to get a solution without specifying an initial value. Is this possible? Perhaps we could specify the range of values for _n_? Thanks.
