I am trying to create a button that uses `SystemDialogInput["FileOpen"]` to browse for a file and assigns the file name to a variable. For example:                {Button["Select the file", fname = SystemDialogInput["FileOpen"]], Dynamic[fname]}      This works most of the time; however, when the file that I browse to is several nested folders away from the default directory, it does not update the value of fname. Is there some way around this? Or is there a better function to use? I eventually would like to use this button within `Manipulate`.
