I am having to use Java due to needing one backend library. Is it still considered good practice to set up Apache as the front-facing server and have Tomcat behind it? I am spending a lot of time configuring mod_jk. Also, what do people usually use for CMS or web-page templating in such a setup? I wanted to use Drupal, but was advised that since I'd have to set up mod_jk and jump through extra hoops configuring it, it might not be a good approach. Could you guys please suggest some common considerations or good approaches in this sort of a situation? Thanks, Alex
