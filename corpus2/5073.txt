I came across a bit of code that uses the syntax `/:` and I don't know what it does. I can't find its documentation, or maybe I'm just not looking properly. The code snippet is something like:               F/:F[A___,b_?NumberQ B_, C___] := b*F[A,B,C]      (i.e. part of the definition of multi-linearity). How does this behave differently than the following?:               G[A___,b_?NumberQ B_, C___] := b*G[A,B,C]      Thanks!
