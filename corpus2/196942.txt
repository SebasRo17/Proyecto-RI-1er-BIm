If you are working on something **new** you have less than the required time to do it, and sometimes you are expected to work late, weekends etc (even when you are waiting on people who are not working those hours). I even had a boss once who came by and told me to make sure I had something to do on Saturday. This seems to be true even when no competitors are putting something similar on the market. If you are working on **feature enhancements** or **maintenance** you are encouraged to take your time, review your options, study up on things, etc. Sometimes I even get the feel that you are expected by leadership to catch up on your fantasy football and analyze topics like Game of Thrones, Call of Duty, etc. My question is: why not just take the extra time from the existing software development and spend it on the new projects that are starving for time?
