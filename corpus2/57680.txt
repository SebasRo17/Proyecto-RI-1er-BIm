If I use WeatherData[] only some of my requests work. For example if I use               WeatherData[{"Chicago", 3}]      I get the correct output:               {"C3175", "KCGX", "C8163"}      But if I try               WeatherData["Chicago", "Temperature"]      I get:               $Failed      Other Collections of Curated Data like ChemicalData[] work fine, so I don't think it's a connection problem.
