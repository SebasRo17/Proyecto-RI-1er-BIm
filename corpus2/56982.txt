Let's take this example:               DensityPlot[Sin[x] Sin[y], {x, -4, 4}, {y, -3, 3}]      How do I retrieve the minimum value and position of the minimum of a plot from the plot? How do I tell Mathematica to mark the position of the minimum/minima within the plot? And for `ContourPlot`s               ContourPlot[Sin[x] Sin[y], {x, -4, 4}, {y, -3, 3}]      Is there a way to mark the exact minimum position within the plot even though it's a contour plot? Yes, Jens and Szabolcs, that would be the best way if i could manage to write the code for that. I'm still a beginner with mathematica and haven't managed so far to cope with that problem because....well i think i have to post a piece of my code to show it. I have deleted most of the variables and replaced them by constants for simplicity reasons:               eislexpl[epsilon_, n2_, x_] :=  28 (epsilon)^2 - 1 +      ((-2 Log[E^(1/2) x])/x^2 + (2.7(0.3 - epsilon))/x +      (10 epsilon^2 n2^(3/2))/x^(3/2));          eislminx2[epsilon_?NumericQ, n2_?NumericQ] :=      (minx = FindArgMin[{eislexpl[epsilon, n2, x], 0 < x}, x];     eislexpl[epsilon, n2, minx]);          ueislexpl[epsilon_, h_, n1_, n2_] :=      n1 (40  epsilon^2 - 1) + (1 -1.27 ) (1 + (n1 - 1) HeavisideTheta[1 - n1] -      (-1 + Exp[-(n1 - 1)]) HeavisideTheta[n1 - 1]) + n2  eislminx2[epsilon, n2] +      (h - n1 - n2) (28  epsilon^2 - 1);      ueislexpl[epsilon_, h_, n1_, n2_] is the function i need to find the minimum for. But the problem for me is, that it calls this function eislminx[epsilon_?NumericQ,n2_?NumericQ]. So my problem is that in order to have a function that mathematica is able to find a minimum for, i have to plug n2 in eislminx[epsilon_?NumericQ,n2_?NumericQ], so that this part of ueislexpl[epsilon_, h_, n1_, n2_] determined, but at the same time i want to find the minimum for ueislexpl[epsilon_, h_, n1_, n2_] with respect to n2. So if anybody know how to find the minimum of ueislexpl[epsilon_, h_, n1_, n2_] with respect to n2 and n1 i would be happy to learn how. Thanks for the help. Well, my actual question has been answered by kguler, thanks again ;) And the question of how to find the minimum of that function above i will source out to here: FindMinimum of function
