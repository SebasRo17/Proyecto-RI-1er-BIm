In most of the multi-tasking CRM applications I've seen, MdiWindow is used to allow users to open multiple windows at the same time. But MdiWindow doesn't seem to be commonly used in WPF. Looking through Codeplex, I only found one abandoned MdiWindow project. In some of the WPF-based CRM applications I've seen, they create a dashboard and only let users work on one thing at a time. What's the best way to handle multi-tasking in a WPF application? Is there a better alternative to MdiWindow in WPF?
