I am working on a exercise to fit a theoretical density function,presented below, with log-return series of a stock. $\frac{1}{2}a e^{a(x-\mu)} \quad \text{if x } < \mu $ or $ \frac{1}{2}be^{-b(x-\mu)} \quad \text{if x } \geq \mu \\$ I am now stuck on estimating the parameters for the function. I have tried different approaches, such as creating a probability distribution and use FindDist.Param. and also tried to fit it with a ExponentialDistr(or Laplace), multiplying neg. returns with -1 for case $(x < \mu)$, however without any success. Given I have the moments of the sample and at least think I have worked out the correct moments (mean, var, skew, kurt) I would also like to try a method of moments, but not sure how to do proceed with the above function? As I am relatively new to _Mathematica_ and keep getting lost but enjoying the endless possibilities, any suggestions or recommendations on procedure is greatly appreciated. For importing my log-returns I have used `ImportString["...", "List"]`. Many thanks for the feedback guys! Alas, my original post was written 4 am in the morning. Anyway, I'll be more thorough in coming posts. The following is the procedure I have tried,   1. `logretun = ImportString["r1, r2, .., rT", "List"]` Where $r_i$ are daily log-returns of a stock, copied from an .csv spreadsheet.    2. Define the above density as a function,               f[x_] = 1/2*a*Exp[a*(x - m)]*Boole[x < m] +        1/2*b*Exp[-b*(x - m)]*Boole[x >= m]      (is the use of Boole correct?)   3. Define a function from (2) as distribution               fdist = ProbabilityDistribution[f, {x, -Infinity, Infinity}]        4. Run               FindDistributionParameter[logreturn, fdist]       With no luck. (Just runs and runs with no answer - even if I take a smaller sample, so I do not think its me just being impatient..). I have gotten some values for $a$ and $b$ (87.76922562 and -82.00007391, respectively) through the following method; however I am not sure it is justifiable. Step (3) piecewise, for a `ExponentialDistribution[Î»]`:   1. Sort the return series, select the ones that are $x < \mu$ and multiply by -1 and import as "minuslogreturns"    2. Run step 3 as               FindDistributionParameter[minuslogreturns, ExponentialDistribution[a]]        3. Run again for the positive part, with $b$ as the parameter for `ExponentialDistribution`. I am not confident that this is a feasible approach. I have tested my $a$ and $b$ by moments ($\mu$ = sample median), getting relative close mean, variance and skewness, however I cannot seem to get the kurtosis close. (sample kurtosis 9.494758128 vs estimated 15.33348985). On a side note, it might be very well that the expressions for expected return, variance, skewness and kurtosis also be off, as they are quite long expressions. I can post these if deemed necessary? Hope this make my questions a bit more clearer.
