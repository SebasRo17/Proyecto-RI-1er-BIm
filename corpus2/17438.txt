I build a lot of presentations and custom notebooks with very different stylesheets, and use `Button` and `CreateDocument` quite often to accommodate optional/procedurally generated content. For instance,               Map[Button[Style[ToString[#] <> " random images", "Text"],             CreateDocument[               {Cell["Here are " <> ToString[#] <> " random image(s)", "Title"],                             ExpressionCell[Column@Table[RandomImage[2, {200, 200}], {#}],                "Output"]}]] &,        Range[5]]      What I'd like to do is specify that the notebook generated by `CreateDocument` inherits the StyleSheet from the parent notebook, without having to save the StyleSheet and provide the `StyleSheetPath` Option in the `CreateDocument` function each time I change a style. I imagine there's an undocumented feature, but haven't found it in my brief searches of StackExchange.
