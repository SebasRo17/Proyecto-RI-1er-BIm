Given the smooth function `u[x,t]` on a domain, how do I find the maximal `t` at which `u[x,t] == 1` (leaving `x` unconstrained)? I can plot the level curve with               ContourPlot[ u[x,t] == 1, {x, -50, -58}, {t, 50, 58} ]      but I'm not sure how to numerically locate the point I want. Edit: My `u` is the solution to a PDE:               sol = NDSolve[           { D[u[x, t], t] == D[u[x, t], x, x]                + D[u[x, t], x] - u[x, t]^3               + 3 u[x, t]^2 -2 u[x, t],             u[x, 0] == 3 Exp[-x^2 /6],             u[-100, t] == 0,             u[30, t] == 0 },             u, {x, -100, 30}, {t, 0, 100}]      The point of interest lies in the domain $-58<x<-50$ and $50<t<58$.
