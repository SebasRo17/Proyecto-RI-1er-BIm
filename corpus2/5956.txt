I have a polynomial with coefficients that are integer polynomials in another (complex) variable. For example:               1 + (1 - v^2) #1 + (-3 - v^2) #1^2 + #1^3 &      I want to solve for $v$ such that the second root of this polynomial is a root of unity. Notice that $v=0$ is such a solution:               In[67]:= Root[1 + (1 - v^2) #1 + (-3 - v^2) #1^2 + #1^3 &, 2] /. {v -> 0}     Out[67]= 1      My two attempts to pull this information out of Mathematica have not worked. Namely,               In[68]:= Reduce[RootOfUnityQ[Root[1 + (1 - v^2) #1 + (-3 - v^2) #1^2 + #1^3 &, 2]], {v}]     Out[68]= False      and               In[66]:= Solve[RootOfUnityQ[Root[1 + (1 - v^2) #1 + (-3 - v^2) #1^2 + #1^3 &, 2]], {v}]     Out[66]= {}      both say that there are no solutions, which is not the answer that I am looking for. # Question: How do I solve for $v$ such that some expression is a root of unity?
