I have the following data:               data = {{0, 0}, {20, 1.4}, {25, 9.8}, {30, 32.2}, {35, 38.2}, {40, 15.6}, {45, 2.7}, {50, 0.1}};      where the second coordinates are frequencies measured as percent of total (adding, therefore, to $100$). I would like to produce a cumulative frequency plot. What would be the neatest way to do so?
