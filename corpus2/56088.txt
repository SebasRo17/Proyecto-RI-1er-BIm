Suppose I have a nested listed as follows,               {{{1,2},{3,4,5},{2,3}},{{2,3,4},{5,4,1},{1,4,3}},{{3,4,5},{3,4,5}}}      Where the elements are, > >     {{1,2},{3,4,5},{2,3}} >   >     {{2,3,4},{5,4,1},{1,4,3}} >   >     {{3,4,5},{3,4,5}} >   I would I create a new list where I drop any sub element that has 1 or 2 in its first part. The output should then look like this, > >     {{{3,4,5}},{{5,4,1}},{{3,4,5},{3,4,5}}} >
