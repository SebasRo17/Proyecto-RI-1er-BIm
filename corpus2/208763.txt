So in the past few weeks I was introduced to Bootstrap 3-RC1. I made some web sites using it, and I actually enjoyed it. Then, recently, I discovered Twitter Bootstrap has already released version 3-RC2. It makes me wonder if it's okay for me to use Bootstrap RC2 for production now? Is it wise if I used it considering it still in RC phase or should I just wait for the official, completed version 3?
