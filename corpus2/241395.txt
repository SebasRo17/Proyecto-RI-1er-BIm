I just had a little fight with my boss over this topic (well, the boss always wins so I will do what he wants to be done) but I'd like to have the opinion of others about this: We are making a complex application that will be used by expert users (like the one who manages the company backups). I made an **Advanced log** , which contains 3 types of log:   * messages   * alerts   * errors Every error is translated and handled by the GUI, so the user will always know why something went wrong. My concern is about the **messages** : The main goal of those messages is to have a detailed idea of what is happening and help the expert user to solve problems by himself without calling for assistance. To do this I log a message (that will remain in RAM only, with a max message count) for every little kind of stuff, like               Connecting to server     Connection successfully     Request file list from path XXX     Starting receiving file list     File list successfully received      This can help to know **when** a problem occurred and to determine who is guilty for it. The main problem is: Our program is translated in more than 10 languages! Translating that HUGE amount of little messages will be expensive and it will be used only by some users. You can access to this messages list using an **Advanced console panel** , so it's clear it's for **Advanced** users. My boss wants those messages to be translated, but he doesn't want to spend a lot in translation, so he asked me to limit myself in using those messages. If I limit myself this message log can become useless, but if we don't translate it our program loses its " _friendly, translated approach_ ". What is the best thing to do? Pay more and translate everything? Limit message usage? Try to convince my boss that Advanced Users **SHOULD** know English?
