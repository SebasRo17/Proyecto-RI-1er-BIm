Any idea how to remove the top bar saying "Wolfram Mathematica .... Demonstrations MathWorld Studenforum Help" from the Mathematica main window (see screenshot). It has no use to me and it steals real estate from my laptop sreen. Also: How do I remove the bottom bar with the zoom button? Appreciate any help!
