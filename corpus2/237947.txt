From time to time we face difficult problems which are hard to reproduce. Creating a planning for solving such an issue is (nearly) undoable. What we do at the moment is break these up in analyses/reproduction and solving the problem. As long as know nothing we plan a number of hours to investigate and book off these hours by effort and not by result. This does not feel like a true agile sprint. Do you guys have any suggestion how to improve this situation?
