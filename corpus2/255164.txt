We are localizing all parts of our website to many languages. We use XML localization files. I think this scenario is so common, and even there should be a standard solution to this, but still I couldn't find any good advice, and every developer here has different opinion about it, so I'm asking you. **Suggest the following example:** _If you have question, please ask our`<a href="blabla" target="_blank" title="Our nice Customer Support + boilerplate SEO bullshit">`Customer support`</a>` or write an email to `<a href="mailto:XXX">`Jane Doe `</a>` our specialist._ **Or a long, formatted text:**                <p>A very long, marketing blah-blah. A very long, marketing blah-blah. A very long, marketing blah-blah concluding in a list:</p>      <ul>        <li>1</li>        <li>2</li>        <li>3</li>     </ul>      **1) Would you put html tags into the localization XML file?** My concern is the View is **separated into 2 files** : your page and your localization file. People will forget to check the localization file. Also, **there's logic and style embedded in html** as well (see `target="_blank"`, or the fact that the above mentioned list is unordered...) **2) Or splitting it to smaller parts?** `<msg id="IfYouHaveQuestion">`If you have question, please ask our`</msg>` `<msg id="CustomerSupport">`Customer support`</msg>` `<msg id="OrWrite">`or write an email to`</msg>` ... Now, View can contain all the markup and style. It's easy to change it, flexible. But. There's absolutely **no guarantee** that the **word order will be the same** in all languages. Also, this would make the **translator's work a nightmare** , making it a puzzle. **3) Or introduce BB-style markdown?** `<msg id="HaveQuestion">`If you have question, please ask our `[link url="{customersupportlink}" title="{{CustomerSupportTitle}}">`Customer support`[/link]` or write an email ...`</msg>` But probably this is over-complicating the issue, and also we have to write our own parser for this (though, I think it wouldn't be so hard). And probably does not solve the long, formatted text problem. **4) ??? (Your golden solution here) :)**
