I have a question about the 3-clause BSD license based on it's Wiki description. It states: > Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without > modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met: > ... What is understood by "modification"? Specifically I am interested whether any/all of the following is considered as such modification:   1. Reading the original sources and then re-implementing a custom way.   2. Reading the original sources, waiting for a year and then re-implementing something based on whatever you could remember.   3. Direct and very significant "complete" refactoring of the original sources.
