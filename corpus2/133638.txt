We are a small team of 4 devs rather green in Scrum. Coming from all over the country, we often take odd days off or whole weeks off to go home. Therefore our team capacity changes dramatically from one iteration to another due to annual leaves, which leads to very different velocities from one iteration to another. How do we account for team capacity when estimating velocity at the Planning Meeting? Historical data will reflect very different capacities and we cannot wait one whole year to derive an average for our estimate velocity.
