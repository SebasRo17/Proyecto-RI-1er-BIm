I'm new to Mathematica and my goal is to write a simple program in order to demonstrate self-similarity of the Koch curve by zooming in. Here is a good example of what I mean (it's a Java applet). I was going to start learning the built-in powers of Mathematica for a long time and it seems to be a good opportunity. Given the simplicity of the program and popularity of fractals I was sure I'd find many working examples online, yet it turned out to be not the case. In particular, how can one make this zoomable:               f[form_, {a_, b_}] :=      AffineTransform[{{b - a, ({{0, -1}, {1, 0}}).(b - a)}\[Transpose],      a}][1/Norm[      Last[form] - First[form]] TranslationTransform[-First[form]][     form]]          g[form_, points_] :=      Flatten[Map[f[form, #] &, Partition[points, 2, 1]], 1]          Manipulate[form = Append[Prepend[pts, {-Sqrt[3], 1}], {Sqrt[3], 1}];     base = Nest[g[form, #] &, form, refinements];     If[maketriangle,      triangle =      Join[base, RotationTransform[4 \[Pi]/3.][base],      RotationTransform[2 \[Pi]/3.][base]]];     plaatje =      Graphics[{If[     maketriangle, {ColorData[1][1], Polygon[triangle]}, {}],      AbsoluteThickness[1.3], Line[If[maketriangle, triangle, base]],      If[refinements == 0, {Thick, Line[form]}, {}]},      PlotRange -> {{-3.5, 3.5}, {-2.3, 2.3}},      AspectRatio ->      Automatic], {{pts, {{-Sqrt[3]/3, 1}, {0, 2}, {Sqrt[3]/3, 1}}},      Locator, LocatorAutoCreate -> True,      ContinuousAction ->      If[refinements > 2, False, True]}, {{refinements, 0,      "Refinements"}, 0, 6, 1,      SetterBar}, {{maketriangle, True, "Make triangle"}, {True, False}},      SynchronousUpdating -> False, SaveDefinitions -> True]      Source: Create Alternative Koch Snowflakes
