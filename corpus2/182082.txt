I have been going round in circles with this question for days - which is the best PHP framework to use to create a RESTful Web service? I've trawled the web for info and have come across three main factors that are important:   * must have REST architecture built into the framework   * must be a stable application   * must be full featured It may be that what I want does not exists, but I wanted to check with the community to see of I had missed something. Currently the three contenders are: **CodeIgniter** Is a very stable framework with a large community and plenty of features and 'extensions'. Issue is that it's not RESTful. I have found a RESTful controller but there are a few things that I don't like about it. Mainly that it does not seem to correctly use the HTTP methods as per the RESTful architecture definition. I think this stems from restrictions in the CodeIgniter core though. **Yii** Again, seems like a large community and is stable with plenty of features, but not RESTful. **Laravel** A framework that is RESTful straight out of the box, and it has a good amount of features. The issue is that this is a relatively new framework so lacks stability. Other frameworks I've considered: Zend \- from what I've read, avoid unless writing Enterprise software. Recess \- RESTful, but seems very inactive and under used. **UPDATE:** In the end I went for Laravel. Can't recommend it enough! I had a RESTful API up and running in a week and also a simple web client. Amazing framework.
