Firstly, forgive me for my lack of knowledge of programming and Mathematica. I have an optimization problem involving very large matrices when they are in analytical form. If I tried to generate analytical expressions for what I want to optimize it would be computationally intractable (the matrices are only on the order of 10x10 but each element is many pages worth of analytical expression). But, if for each iteration of the optimization I could plug in the guessed values, compute the numerical value of each cell of the matrix, the problem would become very tractable. Is there a way I can do this with the existing Minimize, NMinimize or FindMinimum functions? To be even more specific, when I try to evaluate Minimize[A(x,y,z) . B(x,y,z) . C(x,y,z), {x,y,z}], where A, B and C are matrices and their dot product would become a huge analytical mess, Mathematica hangs trying to compute the expression before plugging in test values for optimization. How can I fix this or get around it by just plugging in values, evaluating each matrix to just a ~10x10 array of numbers, without building an analytical expression? I'm not even aware of the jargon I would use to search for similar or relevant answers, if anyone could point me in the right direction it would be greatly appreciated.
