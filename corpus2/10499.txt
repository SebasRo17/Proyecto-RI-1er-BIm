As an answer to my code I will get a periodic discrete time dependent function called "data" which I want to get a Discrete Fourier transform of it using just one period of it,but I think some thing is wrong with the way I do Fourier transform.here is my code:               a = 0.05; L = 15; T = 20 \[Pi]; hdc = 2.1;     sol = NDSolve[{a*D[u[t, x], t] == D[u[t, x], x, x] - Sin[u[t, x]],      u[0, x] == 0, Derivative[0, 1][u][t, 0] == Tanh[t/0.01]*hdc,      Derivative[0, 1][u][t, L] == 0}, u, {t, 0, T}, {x, 0, L},      MaxStepSize -> 0.005, MaxSteps -> 10^6];     q := NIntegrate[(      Evaluate[First[Derivative[1, 0][u][tp, x] /. sol]])^2, {x, 0, L},     Method -> "LocalAdaptive", MinRecursion -> 50,      MaxRecursion -> 100];     data = Parallelize[Table[q, {tp, 25.8, T, 0.5}]];     ListLinePlot[data, PlotRange -> All]     ListLinePlot[Abs[Fourier[data]]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/DWCoI.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/GzxPP.png)
