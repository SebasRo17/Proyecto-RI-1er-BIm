As shown in the following program, the `q[t]` in `a` can be collected from the integration by defining the integration of `fe1[x]` as `Infe1[x]`, the same is true for `fe2[x]` in `b`. But for the equation `c`, how can I collect `q[t]` from it?               fe1 /: Integrate[fe1[x_], x_] := Infe1[x];     fe2 /: Integrate[fe2[x_], x_] := Infe2[x];          a = Integrate[fe1[x]*q[t], {x, 0, L1}]          b = Integrate[fe2[x]*q[t], {x, 0, L1}]             c = Integrate[fe1[x]*fe2[x]*q[t], {x, 0, L1}]
