I have got few huge matrices named by ascending numbers, e.g. `x1, x2, x3,...` and I need to do the same operation with all of them - to multiply their components, obtain the absolute value etc. As I am beginner with _Mathematica_ I usually copy the expression and rewrite indexes as `x1 -> x2`, but this is very lengthy. I would like to have only one expression with something like `xX`, where I just change `X` by index of particular matrix.
