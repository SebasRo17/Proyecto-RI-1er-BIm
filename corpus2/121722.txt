We are on the stage of planning a CakePHP project. It is a relatively a big project for us, as a developer+project manager, I want to hire someone to work with me. But what I really want is to spend less time on actual coding, without losing control of the code quality. What I want to do is that I will design all the functions of the project in CakePHP, at least all the model's functions, and leave the implementation part to the coder who I am going to hire. But my worry is still if I am going to lose control of the code quality using this approach? is it feasible to do so or it is going to turn this project to a chaos. Thank you all in advanced for reading my question and give me answers.
