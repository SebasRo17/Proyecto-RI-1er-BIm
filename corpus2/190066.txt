I need to correlate requirements for a plugin/extension of an application with development best practices. I thought there might be best practice advice that applies to plugins and extensions available but cannot find any literature. Of course best practices are often common sense, but my task involves applying a framework to describe design choices. If any resources specific to plugins/extensions are known that would be great. Otherwise, I would like, to at least find a well respected language agnostic list of software development principles.
