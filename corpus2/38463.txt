On the one hand, the agile approach stresses a tight-knit team that holds each other accountable and accepts collective ownership of the project. On the other hand, companies use contract programmers so that they can manage the peaks and valleys of funding without laying off actual employees. If there is a shortfall in funding, the contractors are the first to go, even if they are fully integrated members of the team (and there are employees are not). Companies also only like to keep contractors around for a limited amount of time. This is somewhat mitigated by the possibility that some contractors could be brought on as regular employees. Thus my question of whether there is a fundamental contradiction of having an agile team with a mix of employees and contractors, and the vastly different statuses that entails? * * * EDIT: The answers are indicating that I may not have expressed the tension I'm facing well, so let me take another shot. I'm a permanent employee. The agile approach (at least as implemented here) encourages me to see all team members, both permanent employees and contractors, as equal members of a cohesive team. The corporate approach to contractors encourages me to see them as expendable resources to whom we shouldn't become overly attached. I'm curious how others have resolved this tension.
