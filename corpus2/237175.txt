For fun and for practice, I'm thinking of maybe implementing a very basic programming language to run on a simple interpreter written in Java. My question is this: **Is it a 'must' to know regular expressions when designing an interpreter, for parsing the text?** Should I learn this topic before starting to implement the interpreter? Or is it enough to just run through the text, break down into strings, etc, i.e. do 'basic parsing' without regular expressions?
