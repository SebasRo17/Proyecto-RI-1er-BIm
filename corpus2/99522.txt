I saw an article a few months ago that explain a company's practice of randomly choosing management via lottery. The employee would manage his peers for some fixed amount of time until the next management raffle. The writer went on to explain in detail why this worked better than the traditional expert-manager model. I'm completely unable to remember where I read this, and unable to get useful results from Google. Does anyone recall seeing this? I'd really like to find it again. \--buck
