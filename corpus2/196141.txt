I am looking at a codebase where a developer never uses SQL transactions i.e. each update/insert into the SQL database is an atomic operation. I believe the codebase would benefit from transactions. I was looking online today and in one Stackoverflow question an answerer says: "In some situations it is better to have a partial update rather than none at all". Is there any truth in this? I suppose it depends on the problem domain to some extent.
