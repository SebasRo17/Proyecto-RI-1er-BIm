I'm beginning to think that I might be best suited for a job in R&D. The reason being that I like jobs that allow me to be creative and I generally am more interested in solving puzzles than building things. I really dislike jobs that just boil down to translating requirements into code. Here's the kicker though: I don't have a bachelor's much less a masters or phd. Is it possible for me to land a job like this?
