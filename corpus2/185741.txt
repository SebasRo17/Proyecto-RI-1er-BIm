I am currently working on a web app and want to design the interface between nodejs / mongoose and the backbone app. A short description of the app: A user signs up to the application and gets a user account where he can create an organization (e.g. footballclub). Within these organizations you can set up projects. Within these projects you can define tasks you could assign to somebody) I want to have a RESTful api for the app. My problem is: A user could have more than one organization, if i have an api for projects like GET /projects/   POST /projects/   GET /projects/:id   PUT /projects/:id   DELETE /projects/:id How do i determine to which organization the project belongs? Do i add a parameter to the api or do i send an extra field containing the id of the organization? Any help is appreciated!
