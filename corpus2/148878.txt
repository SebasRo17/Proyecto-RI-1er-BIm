I often want to have the same unit test applied to data multiple items that are roughly equivalent (two non-empty strings). Currently I implement these in multiple unit test methods, with names like `MethodNonEmptyValidString1` and `MethodNonEmptyValidString2`. This has a bit of a code smell to me. Is it better to have the multiple data items in one method with multiple asserts? Is there another design pattern that models this more accurately?
