I am considering investing time to learn Hadoop and it's related technologies. The problem is that my current day job will not be using Hadoop any time soon and even if I learn from books, blogs personal projects I will not have much to backup when I actually need to show that I have Hadoop experience. So while continuing my job I would like to invest into my own training and I am thinking about Hadoop certification from cloudera. What do you think about it? Please answer from your perspective (if you took the certification and training course or are in the market for hiring new hadoop developers and what do you look for) I am sure that there is no shortcut to becoming an expert in Hadoop, but certification and training seems like a jump start.
