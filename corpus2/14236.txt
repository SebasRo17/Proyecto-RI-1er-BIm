> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Non-commutative symbolic linear algebra I want to multiply two matrices, for example,               A = {{e, f}, {g, h}}     B = {{a, b}, {c, d}}      Using `A.B`, _Mathematica_ returns               {{a e + b g, a f + b h}, {c e + d g, c f + d h}}      I would like to get, however, the following result:               {{e a + f c, e b + f d}, {g a + h c, g b + h d}}      since, for me, the entries `{a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h}` are operators, i.e. they are non-commutative. I could solve this problem clearing the attribute `Orderless` in the built-in function `Times`:               ClearAttributes[Times, Orderless]      I know, however, this can be dangerous. I tried to define a function               Times2[a_,b_]:=Times[a,b]      and then use `ClearAttributes[Times2, Orderless]` but it doesn't work. How could I solve this problem? Thanks in advance
