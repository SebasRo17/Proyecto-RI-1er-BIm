Two lists:               line = {{0, 2.15}, {0.05, 2.03}, {0.1, 1.94}, {0.2, 1.8}, {0.3,      1.68}, {0.4, 1.58}};     points = {{0.1009`, 1.206`}, {0.19455`, 1.4569`}, {0.3597`, 1.2315`}};      I'd like to plot the line with the points, and have a legend.               ListPlot[{line, points}, PlotRange -> {0, 2.5}, PlotLegends -> {"line", "points"}, PlotMarkers -> {" ", \[FilledSquare]}, Joined -> {True, False}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/U0YDn.png) Why doesn't PlotLegends pick up the line? Any way around this, other than manually?
