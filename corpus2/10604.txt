I am trying to get my head around how `Manipulate` evaluates functions in a Plot. I have read the introduction to Manipulate, and introduction to Dynamic, but I still can't figure it. For my specific example, I have a function `bigA` parameterised by `m1` and `m2` (this relates to question),               bigA[t_]:= (m1+m2) ((m1 m2 t)/(m1+m2)^3)^0.25      So when I try to plot it in Manipulate,               Manipulate[      Plot[bigA[t], {t, 1, 10}],      {{m1, 1.4}, 0.8, 3},      {{m2, 1.4}, 0.8, 3}]      Nothing appears. I presume this is because `m1` and `m2` aren't being evaluated. But I don't know what the order is supposed to be. # Edit The thing is, this seems to work when I `Evaluate` and don't plot, i.e,               Manipulate[Evaluate@bigA[t],      {{m1, 1.4}, 0.8, 3},      {{m2, 1.4}, 0.8, 3}]      So couldn't I just stick a `Plot` command in there somewhere?
