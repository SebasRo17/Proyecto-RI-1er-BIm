I was reading Agile Manifesto Principles. Everything seems clear and reasonable except for one point: > Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential. I dont understand this. Does this mean that the work that wasn't done should be somehow exaggerated? If so, it doesn't really make sence.
