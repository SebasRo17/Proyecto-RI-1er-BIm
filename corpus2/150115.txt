I stumbled upon this question and a couple of other along the same lines. While we know creation of enum is thread safe and `enums` are by birth singletons . It kind of confuses me that why would any one want to have a `synchronized` method with in an `enum`. Yes I am fully aware that methods in an `enum` are not thread safe but then what? They must **not** try to change the state of an enum any way . If we are not concerned about change of state of an enum then why would we ever like a method in an enum to be thread safe.
