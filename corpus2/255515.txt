I was asked during a job interview the following question, to which I couldn't find an answer then, and this thing is still bothering me. I was hoping someone might know the answer here: Consider two banks that communicate through an encrypted channel, where you are able to listen to the communication between them: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rUNov.png) Bank A is about to send some credit card numbers to Bank B (you can refer to the credit card numbers as decimal or binary number of some length of your choice - it doesn't matter). Now, suppose that you somehow gained access to Bank A's database, where it holds credit card numbers, and you are given a chance to plug your dok into it, and run any code you'd like on it. How will you then be able to steal Bank A's credit card numbers? I hope I didn't omit any important details (I should've write that down). Is it doable?
