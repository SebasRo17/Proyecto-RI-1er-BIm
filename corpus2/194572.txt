I have an existing website theme that I have built. I've been using github to maintain this theme, let's call it `dragon`. We are changing the theme entirely but we're using the existing theme as a foundation. Should I create a new github repository for the new theme? Or should I just continue pushing to the `dragon` repo? If I do create a new repo should I use clone `dragon` and use that as the base for the new repo?
