I have a grid of density plots, say something like:               GraphicsGrid[Partition[Table[       DensityPlot[Sin[i x] Sin[y/i], {x, -4, 4}, {y, -3, 3}],       {i, 1, 4}], 2]]      I want to show a color legend bar next to this plot. I know that the option `PlotLegends -> Automatic` does this for a _single_ density plot, so if I do               GraphicsGrid[Partition[Table[       DensityPlot[Sin[i x] Sin[y/i], {x, -4, 4}, {y, -3, 3}, PlotLegends -> Automatic],       {i, 1, 4}], 2]]      I get the same color legend bar repeated four times, one for each density plot. But naturally what I want is to show a single bar common to all the density plots in the `GraphicsGrid`. How do I do this?
