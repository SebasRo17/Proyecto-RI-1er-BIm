**Brief History** I am new to Automated Unit Testing and Mocking objects world; previously we used to do Unit Testing (including Integration Testing and we mistakenly referred that as Unit Testing) manually, but now ~~we have planned to change all of that to~~ I am pushing our organization to do Automated Unit Testing. **Problem is:** I have a component for which I have written unit Tests (note: I am not using any TDD here, code is written first and then Unit Tests are written) covering each and every branch(if/ else or loops) of code. If I run the Unit tests suite it says that every method works as expected. That's good; but when I try to traverse the entire flow, I see there are many bugs( missing method) that should have been added. Is there a way to check this automatically? **Update** As per the below Answers from KeithS and Schleis, it seems that I need Functional tests (or integration tests). Are there some useful links on automated functional tests? I tried it on Google but they are all showing generic results talking about manual testing.
