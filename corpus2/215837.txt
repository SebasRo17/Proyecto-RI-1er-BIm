When should code that looks like:               DoThing(string foo, string bar);          DoThing(string foo, string bar, int baz, bool qux);          ...          DoThing(string foo, string bar, int baz, bool qux, string more, string andMore);      Be refactored into something that can be called like so:               var doThing = new DoThing(foo, bar);          doThing.more = value;     doThing.andMore = otherValue;          doThing.Go();      Or should it be refactored into something else entirely? In the particular case that inspired this question, it's a public interface for an XSLT templating DLL where we've had to add various flags (of various types) that can't be embedded into the string XML input.
