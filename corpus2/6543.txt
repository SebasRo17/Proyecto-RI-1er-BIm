I'm starting to use the ORM recommended by the framework I choose, and though I like the idea of the added layer of abstraction the ORM provides, I'm starting to realize what this really means. It means I'm no longer working with my database (mysql) and any mysql-specific features are gone, out the window, like they don't exist. The idea the ORM has is that it's trying to help me by making everything database agnostic. This sounds great, but often there is a reason why I choose a specific database system. But by going the database agnostic route, the ORM takes the lowest common denominator, which means I end up with the smallest set of features (the ones supported by all databases). What if I know that for the long term I won't be switching the underlying database? Why not access the database-specific features, too?
