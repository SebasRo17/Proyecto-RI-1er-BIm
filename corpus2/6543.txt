Given a List of rectangular nx3 arrays of data, each of the form {...,{x,y,z},...}, (the ellipses are not Mathematica pattern syntax, just for illustration). Some members of this list may be - by coincidence - square, ie 3x3. What's the appropriate method to match each {x,y,z} row regardless of whether n is 3 or not? For example, the following expression,               With[{n = 4},      Graphics@ Table[Random[], {i, 1, n}, {j, 1, 3}] /. {a_, b_, c_} :>         Line[{{1, a}, {2, b}, {3, c}}]      ]      Only works as intended for n!=3. When n==3, then "a" matches the 1st row, "b" matches the 2nd, "c" the 3rd row. I've tried Repeated, ie, {{a_,b_,c_}..}, but that results in a different error that I've not analyzed. This is a simplification of a more involved database problem. Any suggestions?
