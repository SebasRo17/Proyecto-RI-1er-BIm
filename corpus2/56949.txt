I have a list like this:               list = {{a,{1,2,3}},{b,{1,2,4}},{c,{{1,4,5,5},{6,3,2,1}}}}      This is a nested list which each element has a name. I want to export it to CSV so I want to un-nest it to look like:               unlist = {{a,{1,2,3}},{b,{1,2,4}},{c1,{1,4,5}},{c2,{6,3,2,1}}}      As the list is very dynamic, the solution solution should be dynamic as well. I mean in different files the `list` has different lengths but the nesting structure is the same. How can I deal with this?
