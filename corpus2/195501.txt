So my company is using TFS and SQL to Manage their Database (MS SQL Server). It integrates with the nightly build servers to do builds and produce scripts to build the entire Database. Also the Compare Schema tool that visual studio offers is really handy. We want to do the same with Oracle, Preferably with TFS if that's even possible. It can be done without, but is this a possibility? Also are there any tools to assist in automatically creating the Database in a Nightly Build? What about Managing Upgrades? Our Big worry is moving triggers and the MS SQL Service Broker to Oracle... this we might have to do manually though.
