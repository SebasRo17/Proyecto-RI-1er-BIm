I'm writing a mobile app & web service combo that requires user to login. The web service will be using SSL, so are there any reasons against sending the user name and password in every web request? I know some sites generate a token after the user logs in, that they can use for authentication, but the token seems equivalent to the username/password pair - so I'm not sure there's much point in doing that. Am I about to make a big mistake in terms of security?
