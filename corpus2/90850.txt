My goal is that i can show fractals either into a plane or an space... I thought opengl is the best beggining, but which is the best book oriented to "maths" and "maths graphics"?   1. Red book? http://www.opengl.org/documentation/red_book/   2. Opengl superbible? http://www.opengl.org/documentation/books/#opengl_superbible_4th_edition   3. Any other? And... can you suggest any IDE?
