Find the area between `y = 1 - x/π` and `y = Sin[x]`. Here is what I have typed in so far into _Mathematica_ :               Clear[f, g, x]     f[x_] := 1 - x/π     g[x_] := Sin[x]     Plot[{f[x], g[x]}, {x, 0, 2 π},        PlotStyle -> {Red, Blue}, PlotRange -> {-1.2, 1.2}, Filling -> {1 -> {2}}]      The graph worked, so I have that. However, when I try to do the next step, `Solve[f[x] = g[x], x]`, it will not give me the intersects. I have even tried retyping the equations in: `Solve[Sin[x] = 1 - x/π, x]`, but nothing is working. What am I doing wrong?
