What is the (slightly pejorative) term for checking the negative of a condition (rather than the positive which is often more readable): e.g.               if(!someVar) {       return null;     } else {       return doSomethingInteresting();     }      instead of doing this (which is arguably more readable)               if(someVar) {       return doSomethingInteresting();     } else {       return null;     }      I vaguely remember there being a term for this; something in the same spirit as the term Yoda conditions.
