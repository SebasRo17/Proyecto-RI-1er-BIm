I recently had to investigate a field issue for our large enterprise application. **I was horrified by the logs** that I had to comb through in an attempt to find the problem and at the end of the day the logs did not help at all identifying/isolating the bug. _Note: I understand not all bugs are discoverable through logs. This does not change the fact that the logs are horrible._ There are some obvious problems with our logging that we can already attempt to fix. I do not want to list those here and I cannot simply show you our log files so you can give advice on what to do. Instead, in order to assess how bad we are doing on the logging front, I would like to know:   1. **What are some guidelines** , if any, **when it comes to logging** for an application, especially large application.    2. **Are there any patterns** we should follow **or anti-patterns** we should be aware of?    3. **Is this an important thing to fix** or **can it even be fixed** or all log files are simply huge and you need supplemental scripts to analyze them?  _Side note: we use log4j._
