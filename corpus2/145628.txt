I am trying to draw a use-case diagram for a software project. Two requirements for the software I am trying to model in use-case diagram are:   1. A customer (i.e. `Client`) should be able to cancel its previous request. In this case, the client must select the relevant request from their list of request.   2. A `travel agent` should be able to cancel a request. in this case, the agent must the client from the list of clients and the request from the list of request issued by that client. How should I model this two requirements in a UML user-case diagram? I've ended up to something like this: ![My use-case diagram](http://i.stack.imgur.com/VjW4B.png)
