Having worked on several different web application code bases, I've seen some divergence in how back-ends serving JSON to front-ends structure that data. In particular, when a backend wants to return a number of objects of the same structure. Do you just wrap up all of the objects in an array? What about the "key" of the first array? What should that be? For example, say my back end wants to return a number of "image" items. Each image item is structured like this:               {         "id" : 123,         "filename" : "someFile.jpg",         "caption" : "some image or other",         "gallery" : 123     }      How would I structure a grouping of these items properly for consumption by a javascript front-end?
