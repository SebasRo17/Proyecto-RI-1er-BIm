In last December's Science David N. Reshef, et al. proposed an interesting method to detect associations in data ( _Detecting Novel Associations in Large Data Sets_ , Science **334** , 1518, 2011). Contrary to classical correlation methods, this method is able to detect non-linear relationships. ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/qdnah.png) (table from the cited article) On their website, the authors provide a Java application, MINE, and an interface to the language R. Having no Java experience I never took up JLink but it is my guess that it should be reasonable straightforward to interface MINE with Mathematica. Could someone show me how? Native implementations of the method in Mathematica are more than welcome too. I'm planning to do that in the near future, but still haven't found time to read the technical report yet.
