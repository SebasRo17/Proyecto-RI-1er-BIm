I use `MathLink` to call Mathematica from C program. After any opening to Mathematica, I do close the connection. However, I don't know why some connections are still there. I've been debugging for days but couldn't find the point. Thus, I want to ask if there is any way to close all connection before I open the new one? Seems like not an optimal solution but for now its ok for me. Thanks,
