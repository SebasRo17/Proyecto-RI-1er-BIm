I recently applied to work at a tech company which - to the best of my knowledge - usually does two rounds of phone screening before bringing applicants in for the on-campus interview. They contacted me and want to bring me up without doing a phone interview. I know this isn't much to go on, but should I take this at face-value or should I read something into this? Call me an optimist, but it seems like a positive thing. Maybe somebody on the inside recommended me without my knowing? Or They found something on my resume/online they liked the look of? Or maybe there's some sort of interview quota they had to fill? Any insights from hiring managers/HR people would be greatly appreciated. If this is a common thing that means something specific, knowing what it is might be to my advantage. Thanks! EDIT: Since a few people seem to indicate that it might depend on the company in question, let's say that it's a large national company (not Google or Microsoft, though), and that I don't live anywhere near the headquarters (it's about as far away as two places can be in the continental US).
