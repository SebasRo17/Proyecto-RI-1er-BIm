I want to export figure from Mathematica in PDF format. Also I want to include Author and Title fields into the PDF. For example, to include Author field, I use the following code:               pp = Plot[{x^2}, {x, -1, 1}]     Export["plot-example.pdf", pp, "Author" -> "Dmitry"]      However, when I open generated PDF file in PDF viewer, the "Author" field is not filled. How should I specify Export call to include Author and Title fields in the generating PDF file?
