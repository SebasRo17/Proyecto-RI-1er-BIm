I'm fitting some data to a Logit model in both _Mathematica_ and `R` and I'm getting slightly different results. `R` code:               data = read.table("http://www.rni.helsinki.fi/~kja/epid12/BCG.dat",header=T)     logitmodel = glm(cbind(D,H)~BCG,data=data,family=binomial(link="logit"))     summary(logitmodel)      _Mathematica_ code:               {d, h, bcg, age} =       Transpose@       Rest@Import["http://www.rni.helsinki.fi/~kja/epid12/BCG.dat",          "Data"];     logitmodel =       GeneralizedLinearModelFit[Transpose@{bcg, d/h}, BCG, BCG,        ExponentialFamily -> "Binomial", LinkFunction -> Automatic,        Weights -> d + h]     logitmodel["ParameterTable"]      The results are estimates that are almost the same but differ in a few decimals. For example, the `R` estimate and standard error for BCG are -0.74152 and 0.12744 respectively. The corresponding _Mathematica_ results are -0.742492 and 0.127755. Am I making a subtle mistake somewhere or is this the result of some numerical approximation?
