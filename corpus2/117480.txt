I am working on a library which had several headers that are meant to only be used by the library itself. I also have a few classes and functions in headers that I do not want the client to use. For instance, I have a header that contains debugging functions, but they should not be used outside of the library as it could cause problems. Should this code be hidden from the client? If so, how?
