I'm trying to achieve something similar to Bret Victor's brilliant Scrubbing Calculator in Mathematica. By using Manipulate I'd like to change the values of the variables such that if I modify one the others adapt to ensure the equation is always true. In the example below I'd like to be able to move spaces and have boxes change accordingly.               Manipulate[4 spaces + 3 boxes = 640, {spaces, 0, 640}, {boxes, 0, 640}]      ![The simplest case](http://i.stack.imgur.com/cHgE2.png) Solving for the two variables explicitly I can achieve the desired effect but doing so kind of voids the idea of an intuitive calculator.               Manipulate[{Dynamic[spaces = 160 - (3 boxes)/4],        Dynamic[boxes = -(4/3) (spaces - 160)]}, {boxes, 0, 640}, {spaces,        0, 640}]      ![The hard way](http://i.stack.imgur.com/fAX5N.png) Now, kind Mathematicans, my question is this: Is there a way of doing this the first, more intuitive, way?
