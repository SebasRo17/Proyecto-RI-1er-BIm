Ram limitations make import impractical for large CSV files. Is it possible to Stream CSV correctly?               str = OpenRead["EU.csv"]     Read[str, "CSV"] #=> Read::readn: "Invalid real number found when reading from \!\(\"EU.csv\"\)."     Read@str #=> Read::readt: "Invalid input found when reading \!\(\"lTid,cDealable,CurrencyPair,RateDateTime,RateBid,RateAsk\\\\n\"\) from \!\(\"EU.csv\"\)"     Close@str      Here's the CSV file. Though I think it's properly formatted.
