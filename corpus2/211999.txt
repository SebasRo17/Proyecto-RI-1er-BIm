I am working in QT .   1. Can a static library depend on another static library?(Static Lib is made by linking another static lib)   2. If yes, is it possible that after linking to lib2, the generated lib(lib1) would not contain all the codes of lib2? In my Qt Project I am using a static library, which depends on multiple libraries. I had to add all the libraries (with all their headers in my project), although I need only one lib (and one .h of that class) in my code. Please explain the scenario.
