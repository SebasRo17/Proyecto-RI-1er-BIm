So for example I have this code:               points = {}; k = 0;     Dynamic@k     Dynamic@Graphics[Point@points]          x = .1; y = .3; K = .9;     While[True,       k++;       {x, y} = {FractionalPart[x + K y], FractionalPart[x]};       AppendTo[points, {x, y}];     ]      The problem is that the list of points is growing and it slows down with time. What I want is to be able to add a point (or another primitive) directly on the dynamic graph without storing unnecessary chunks of data.
