I've put Eric Weisstein's `Hyphenate.m` package in `$UserBaseDirectory/Utilities`; installed the requisite `texhyphj` files in my local `texmf` tree; run its `Makefile` to create the Java classes corresponding to the distributed `.java` source files; and in `Hyphenate.m` set `$HyphenPath` to the path for `texhyphj`. Yet when I load the package, I get a Java `ClassNotFoundException` error for the Java class `net.davidashen.text.Hyphenator`. What am I doing wrong or also need to do to get this add-on package to work? (The package provides a functions that hyphenate a given string and list the syllables of a string.) P.S. Yes, `WordData[word, "Hyphenation"]`will give a list of syllables for `word`, but I would expect using Java for this may be quicker, since no delay is involved in going out to the WRI server to import the needed word data paclets.
