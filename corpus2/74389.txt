I'm a lone developer and am thinking about version control now. I don't particular want to pay for an online service if I don't have to, so I was thinking about using Windows Home Server as the location to manage versions. Has anyone done this before? Are there WHS plug-ins for this (I can find any based of searching the big G and big B)? If not, any recommendations for a super simple server side product that runs on x64 WinServer 2008? All I need is to commit changes about once per day right now, and maybe fall back to an earlier version about once a month. Eventually, I may bring on another developer who is remote, but would have access to WHS with credentials. Tools are VS 2010 and WHS Vail.
