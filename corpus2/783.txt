I am trying to convert a list of string names into symbols, which will then be used to store data. I have 24 files (where the name of each file is a member of the list mentioned above) that I need to process, which is why I am trying to accomplish my goal progammatically. The code below results in a Tag warning. I have read the normal documentation sources, and appreciate that you can not inappropriately assign something to a protected symbol, but this doesn't help me solve the problem. Would you have any advice how to accomplish my goal?               Table[(ToExpression[mmsignalnames[[i]]] =         Extract[ToExpression[celfilenames[[i]]], mmammindices[[j]]]), {i,        1, Length[mmsignalnames]}, {j, 1, Length[mmammindices]}]          Set::write: Tag ToExpression in ToExpression[mmsignalGSM356796] is Protected. >>
