In Mercurial I can do this with the bundled Purge Extension and executing the following command:               hg purge      Also good to get rid of ignored files:               hg purge --all      I'm curious about the most practical/used equivalent solution in git. **Edit** : I want to just get rid of the untracked files, not reset everything (e.g. suppose I have a program generating cache files or generated code and I want to delete them with git's help)
