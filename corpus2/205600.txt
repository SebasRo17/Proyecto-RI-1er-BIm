I am a single developer working on a large system. I was recently informed that there may be an opportunity to recruit another developer or maybe two. I have incorporated source control into my approach using Subverison and Tortoise SVN. I was talking to another developer who I used to work with recently and he reminded me about the concept of a compilation tool chain and specifically nightly builds for unit testing. I have two questions:   1. Is it good practice for all software development teams to use unit testing and nightly builds? Is there any criteria that identifies teams that are more suitable than others for nightly builds.   2. How do developers identify areas suitable for unit testing? I assume that you look at the use cases. I assume that these use cases could include different processing methods e.g. users interacting with a web application or a batch processing job that runs via a scheduled task each night.
