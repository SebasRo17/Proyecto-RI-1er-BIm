I am a web developer. Worked in many projects. Now I have changed my work place. It is big organisation. I and my group are thinking about new project. There is no difficulty to write project but our organisation is big and it's has little offices in many places (within the country). There is no any problem about internet in center. But there is problem with internet in remote areas sometimes. My question is: is there any solution to solve problem as it? If anybody has create project such this please tell little about what technologies you have used. Thanks
