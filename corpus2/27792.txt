I would like all new input and output cells, in fact all new cells including section headers and such, to have a specific stylistic property (`CellBracketOptions -> {"Color" -> MyFavoriteColor}`). This is easy enough to do with `CurrentValue[$FrontEnd,...]=...`. However, I want this behavior to be exhibited only by _new_ cells created in a specific Mathematica installation. I.e. a notebook generated elsewhere should look like it would in a default Mathematica FrontEnd, and only new cells created in this Mathematica installation should have the new property. My use case here is that I have a notebook that I would like to use for collaborations, where each person would be assigned a color, and when they use their copy of Mathematica the cells they enter would automatically have a distinctly colored cell bracket. When exchanging this notebook, the cells authored by each user would be readily identifiable by their cell bracket color.
