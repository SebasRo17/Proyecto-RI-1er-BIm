I'll start by saying that I've done 95% of my database work using SQL. Recently, I did some investigation of various ORMs, such as NHibernate and Doctrine. I can see the advantages of not needing to know much SQL and the database portability that an ORM provides. But I can also see that knowing SQL will make working with an ORM more effective and I can only think of one time in my career that an application's biggest change would be the database vendor. Because I'm very comfortable writing SQL and am apparently not realizing the often taught benefits of using an ORM, my question to heavy ORM users is this: **What kind of Web development projects benefit the most from using ORM?**
