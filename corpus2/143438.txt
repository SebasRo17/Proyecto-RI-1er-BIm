I'm kind of inexperienced with programming (ie less than a year) and I have recently been getting discouraged, mostly from not being able to solve problems with my own code (Not forgetting parentheses or syntax issues but more logic based problems). I just wanted to know, is this something that will dissipate with practice and time or does it only get worse as my programs become more complex?
