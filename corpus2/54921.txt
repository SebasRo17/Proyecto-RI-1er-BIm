Recently I am told that information unknown to the user is sent to Wolfram Servers. Is there any truth behind it ? I was told that more than just an IP address of the user is sent to them and that they catalogue all info and built a database from it. Even if you do not click on "internet connectivity option" info is sent to them. **Update** Question applies to three parts to make it easier to answer.               a) Mathematica on Raspberry Pi     b) Cloud Mathematica     c) Mathematica that can be installed on your personal computer      The answer to (a) and (b) are blatantly clear because the Wolfram Corporation takes control over the computation through their own servers. So they can hear, see and infer every bit of what's happening. For (c) is **fishy** what is going on and how the data is being used by Wolfram Corp. Just think of what can be deduced from I.P. data, USER ID and MACHINE ID AND HELP FUNCTION BROWSING EVERY TIME YOU USE Mathematica. This is metadata that Wolfram Corp has no real hesitation admitting to gathering. Wolfram Corp can profile user and possibly predict what she will do ? a not so hypothetical example. what if we know it was sold to research division who control and make policy. Based on user patterns here and there simple info will help us predict whether they will do this or that ... Banks, federal banks, Bank of England ? whether they will raise interest rates or cut them, other policy institutions. A simple footnote privacy http://www.wolfram.com/legal/privacy/wolfram- mathematica.html pointer is not really an answer to what is going on here.
