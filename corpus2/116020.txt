What is the fascination with taking old concepts coming up with a buzzword for them and pitching it as new technology complete with 800 page tome with nerd on the cover? A long long time ago, lets say the 80's, I wrote software. It was designed reasonably well and it worked and was maintainable. It separated out different high level functions into different libraries of code and so on. Sometime in the past 10 years, I lose track of the exact time, "Patterns" became popular. Whole encyclopedias were written about design patterns and this patterns and that patterns. We've been doing it for decades (and I'm sure long before I started programming) yet it is suddenly new and novel. Is this just a gimmick to sell books and educational classes? Why add so much noise to the already overcomplicated world of programming when getting things done well is really what matters.
