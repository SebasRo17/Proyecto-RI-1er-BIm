I have been programming for a year so far and I know 2 languages: C and C++. I've covered the basics, I've written functional windows programs, and I've written complicated bits of code. When I was using Turbo C for learning the C language I noticed a library called "Graphics.h". I've looked it up and I received amazing examples of graphics manipulation. My question is straightforward. How can I get started with learning graphics in C++? Is there a good tutorial that covers it all up?
