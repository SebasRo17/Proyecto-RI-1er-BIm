I'm an extremely novice web programmer working at a 2 person shop building websites, and we're in the process of writing a simple website template system in PHP from scratch. My manager is entirely self taught. He has been insisting that we put our HTML directly quoted in variables, mixing our back end code with the front end stuff.               $foo = "<html>             <body>                 <div class=\"bar\">" . $bar . "</div>             </body>             </html>";          echo $foo;      He claims that it is easier to work with this way. I insisted that we should at least use PHP tags in our HTML, rather than the HTML in the PHP.               <html>     <body>         <div class="bar"><?php echo $bar; ?></div>     </body>     </html>      I feel like this is a real pain in the ass to read and it just looks like a mess. I think it would be a lot easier to separate the logic from the presentation, but he is certain that his way is best. How can I explain the importance of this so that he will understand? I can't put it into words, exactly. EDIT: Think you guys could leave a comment when you're down voting me? I have no idea how to fix my question if you just down vote it and leave without suggesting improvements.
