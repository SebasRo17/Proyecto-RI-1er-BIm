I've got three Raspberry Pis sitting around. I want 2 of them to be able to chat while the 3rd routes the messages (acts as a server between them). The general flow of events should be something like this:   * Server starts running on Pi #1   * Pi #2 starts running and connects to the server (who's IP will be static I guess) with a name he chooses. Pi #3 does the same as #2.   * Pi #3 can then, knowing the name of Pi #2, send a message to Pi #2 using ... something. This is the general outline of what I want to achieve. I'm not sure what the server that runs on Pi #1 should be (I've heard of webserver frameworks like Flask but I don't have enough knowledge to determine if they fit my needs). I'm also not sure on what I should be using for the client side (Pi #2,3). I could probably use sockets but I assume there is a better / easier way.
