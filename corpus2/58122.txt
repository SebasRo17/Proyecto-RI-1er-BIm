When an application presents a user with a list of items, it's pretty common that it permits the user to filter the items. Often a 'filter' feature is implemented as a set of _include_ or _exclude_ rules. For example:   * _include_ all emails from bob@example.com, and   * _exclude_ those emails without attachments I've seen this include/exclude pattern often; for example Maven and Google Analytics filter things this way. But now that I'm implementing something like this myself, I don't know what to call something that could be either _included_ or _excluded_. In specific terms:   1. If I have a database table of filter rules, each of which either _includes_ or _excludes_ matching items, what is an appropriate name of the field that stores `include` or `exclude`?   2. When displaying a list of filters to a user, what is a good way to label the `include` or `exclude` value? (as a bonus, can anyone recommend a good implementation of this kind of filtering for inspiration?) * * * ### Edit: My solution Thanks for your answers. I decided that to use **operation** to described an include or exclude. So the database fields and program variables are called operation. I like the name because it roughly aligns with the meaning of operation in set theory. As for how it's displayed to users, I fudged it by never labelling 'include' or 'exclude'. Instead it is always presented as part of a full sentence: ![Mockup](http://img824.imageshack.us/img824/3695/examplerestrictionslist.png) The only label used is 'Restrictions' which I think is more specific than 'Filters'. Our users are ususlly not very technically savvy, so — much as I like the word operation — I decided that displaying a label called 'operation' would be unclear for most of our users. Using full sentences might be a little slower to read, but avoids confusion.
