I am wanting to combine equations with sets of static data points in a manipulate and do the curve fitting by moving the slider bars on my independent variables. The best examples of this art may be found at: http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/search.html?query=Normand Could someone please point me to one or more detailed tutorials that would make me as good a Mathematica programmer as Mark D. Normand?
