Is it possible to split non-convex polygons into convex plygons with Mathematica 9? For example:               pts={{-5, 29.6537}, {-4, 16.3031}, {-3, 13.8614}, {-2, 9.22332}, {-1,        6.89646}, {0, 6.76047}, {1, 9.20436}, {2, 6.65919}, {3,        18.2084}, {4, 18.9102}, {5, 31.6521}}      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/R5ajO.png)
