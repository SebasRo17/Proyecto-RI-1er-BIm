I have a requirement for executing a C program within Mathematica. The user will provide the inputs and the expected results on a front end. Mathematica runs the C file, obtains the result for the provided inputs and compares with the user provided expected results. Further, a green pass button will be displayed if the results matched else a red failed button will be displayed. Later, I want to be able to do the same for C++, Python, Java, and Perl programs. Anyone has worked on this before ? Warm regards, Anuk
