I would like to start getting more contracts in the mobile, smart-device, and console development space and, having little prior work experience in the field, I need to build a portfolio of example projects. Most of my professional experience is based on the .NET stack, so that is helpful in covering Windows Phone, Windows Metro, and XBOX (non-game) development such as Kinect UI development, media applications, etc. But I also need to demonstrate that I can handle Android development, Linux development (i.e. Smart TV apps), possibly Arduino development and so forth. I have the tools and the knowledge to at least knock out some Android and Arduino examples, though iOS and Linux is stretching a bit out of my comfort zone. In any case, what are some ways in which I could demonstrate that I understand and can code for these platforms? Media search and filter apps? Kinect navigation? Android app that gets you the location of the nearest Starbucks based on GPS coordinates? Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.
