I do not understand the latter part of this quote. Can you please explain or elaborate? P.S. I have grown up in India. I speak Bengali at home; I speak Marathi in the community that I live in; Hindi is the national language and very widely spoken, so I know that, and in school and college I was taught with English as the first language. Of course, now I think in a multitude of languages and I must admit I don't have _mastery over any_. Is this really affecting my programming aptitude? If yes how ? and are there any _solutions_?
