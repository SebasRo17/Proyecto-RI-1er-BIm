When it comes to merging, each control version has it's engine to do it. Conflicts are unavoidable but the question is - which revision control has best AI to avoid conflict. Is it possible to measure such thing? More specifically, we are thinking to move to GIT cause it has nice hype and rumour that handles conflict better... Any comment is appreciated...
