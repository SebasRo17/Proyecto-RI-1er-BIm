I have an idea in mind and would like to know if that's the way to go for my end application. Think of my application as a social networking system in which I want to implement chat functionality. For that, I'd like to push data from the server to the client. I have heard I could use Node.js for that. In the meanwhile, I want a 'regular' system for posting status updates and such, for which I'd like to use PHP and an apache server. The only way I can think of is having Node.js and apache running parallel. But is that the way to go here? I'd think there would be a somewhat neater solution for this.
