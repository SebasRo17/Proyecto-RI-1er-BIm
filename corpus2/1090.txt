Language shortcuts can often be used to make code more concise. For example, ternary and null coalescing operators can reduce the amount of code, but arguably to the detriment of readability: In C#:               Person newGuy = new Person();     if (boss == null) {         newGuy.Boss = GetDefaultBoss();     } else {         newGuy.Boss = boss;     }      is functionally equivalent to:               Person newGuy = new Person();     newGuy.Boss = boss ?? GetDefaultBoss();      but obviously a lot more verbose. **Where do you draw the line when it comes to conciseness vs readability?**
