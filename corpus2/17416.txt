Is there an easy way to generate an arbitrary two-dimensional Polyomino tiling: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyomino? Specifically, I would like to generate an array of integer coordinates, for example: {{0,1},{10,11},{15,6},...}, and then output a graphic showing a tiling pattern where a tile is centered at each integer coordinate in my array, and where each tile is labeled with its integer coordinate. Is there a way for me to do this in three-dimensions? I have access to Wolfram Mathematica 8.0.
