I'm trying to evaluate the roots of a complex function at different starting points on a grid using `Do[Do[FindRoot[g[z], {z, j + k*I}], {j, 10}], {k, 10}]`. However, it gives me the following error messages:               FindRoot::jsing: Encountered a singular Jacobian at the point {z} ={-17.0839+14.7475 I}. Try perturbing the initial point(s). >>     FindRoot::lstol: The line search decreased the step size to within tolerance specified by AccuracyGoal and PrecisionGoal but was unable to find a sufficient decrease in the merit function. You may need more than MachinePrecision digits of working precision to meet these tolerances. >>     FindRoot::lstol: The line search decreased the step size to within tolerance specified by AccuracyGoal and PrecisionGoal but was unable to find a sufficient decrease in the merit function.

I know most of the starting points will generate those errors. I'm trying to use the Do loop so I can get past those errors to the valid starting points. Does anyone know how to suppress the errors and keep the loop running? I tried 'Off[General::stop]', but that doesn't seem to work.
