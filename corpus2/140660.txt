I'm currently playing with LISP (particularly Scheme and Clojure) and I'm wondering how typical data structures are dealt with in functional programming languages. For example, let's say I would like to solve a problem using a graph pathfinding algorithm. How would one typically go about representing that graph in a functional programming language (primarily interested in pure functional style that can be applied to LISP)? Would I just forget about graphs altogether and solve the problem some other way?
