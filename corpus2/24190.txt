This might be a stupid question, but it's been in the back of my head for a while and I can't find a decent answer anywhere else. I have a teacher who says we should explicitly list each parameter with a description, even if there's only one. This leads to a lot of repetition:               double MyFunction(const int MyParam);     // Function: MyFunction     // Summary: Does stuff with MyParam.     // Input: int MyParam - The number to do stuff with.     // Output: MyParam with stuff done to it.      When writing in-code documentation, how detailed are you?
