I was wondering if there was a standard for laying out a class's regions. I currently use               Fields     Constructor     Properties     Public Methods     Private Methods      `Fields` being Private Properties and `Properties` being the public ones. I'll normally use subregions within that if needed, or will occasionally add other regions below (such as interface or baseClass members).
