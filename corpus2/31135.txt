I am trying to use _Mathematica_ to simplify a symbolic expression involving `Sum`. Particularly, I define a sum via               y = (x - x0)^Î± Sum[a[n] (x - x0)^n, {n, 0, Infinity}]      Then I take the derivative of `y` with respect to `x` and simplify via               FullSimplify[D[y, x]]      This yields $$(x-\text{x0})^{\alpha -1} \left(\alpha \sum _{n=0}^{\infty } a(n) (x-\text{x0})^n+(x-\text{x0}) \sum _{n=0}^{\infty } n a(n) (x-\text{x0})^{n-1}\right)$$ However, the expression above can be easily simplified further to $$(x-\text{x0})^{\alpha -1} \sum _{n=0}^{\infty } ( a(n) (x-\text{x0})^n(\alpha+n) ) $$ Is there a way to "make" _Mathematica_ recognise this simplification? I presume the problem has something to do with the fact that I use the unknown function `a[n]` in the expression, but I am not sure what can I do about it to get similar functionality. I am quite new to _Mathematica_. Apologies if this is a trivial question.
