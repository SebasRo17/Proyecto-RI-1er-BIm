In case I want to know whether a given function $f(t)$ have some property, I tried to write something like this:               IsSuppFun[f_[t_]] := Resolve[     ForAll[t, 0 <=t <= 2&&t\[Element] Reals,      f[t] + D[f[t], {t, 2}] >= 0]]      Which means, if the given function satisfies the condition: $f(t)+f''(t)\geq 0$ for all $0\leq t\leq 2$, then return TRUE, else return False. The problem is that it is not work as I supposed, for example, if I define               F[t_]:=t^2-3      then the output is:               IsSuppFun[-3 + t^2]      If I separate the code as               Resolve[ForAll[t, 0 <= t <= 2 Pi && t \[Element] Reals, F[t] + F''[t] >= 0]]      Which will get the Right Answer! Where did I go wrong? Solution is use the HoldAll attribute for the function IsSuppFun, Please see below for the answer! * * * there is my another problem in the same line: If I have tried to add another condition as:               SetAttributes[IsSuppFun, HoldAll]     IsSuppFun[f_[t_]] :=      Resolve[ForAll[t, 0 <= t <= 2 && t \[Element] Reals, (f[t] + D[f[t], {t, 2}] >= 0)&&(f[0]==f[2])]]      then with the same test function:               F[t_] := t^2 - 3      the output is not as desired True or False, but as:               \!\(\*SubscriptBox[\(\[ForAll]\), \(t\)]\(! \((0 <= t <= 2 &&  t \[Element] Reals)\)\)\)      * * * May be I should change the last question as (to make things clear and simple):               SetAttributes[{IsSuppFun}, HoldAll]     IsSuppFun[f_[t_]] := Resolve[     ForAll[t,     0<= t <= 2 && t \[Element] Reals,     f[1] >= 0]     ]      with the test function as:               F[t_] := Sin[t]      then the output of               IsSuppFun[F[t]]      is True; But if I have change it as               SetAttributes[{IsSuppFun}, HoldAll]     IsSuppFun[f_[t_]] := Resolve[     ForAll[t,     0<= t <= 2 && t \[Element] Reals,     f[1] <= 0]     ]      Then the same test function gives neither True nor False. (I Suppose it False!) Why?
