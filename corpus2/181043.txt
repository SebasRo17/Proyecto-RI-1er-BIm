In several places on the Internet there's the interview question > Classify the Hashing Functions based on the various methods by which the key > value is found. with answers like   * Direct method   * Subtraction method   * Modulo-Division method   * Digit-Extraction method   * Mid-Square method   * Folding method   * Pseudo-random method which I find strange. I think I know a lot about hashing, but this is plain gibberish to me, could anybody explain?
