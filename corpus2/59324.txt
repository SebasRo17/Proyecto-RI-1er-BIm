I have troubles to output an entire symbol, a function in this case, from a module or a block. For instance                myf = Block[{f}, f[3] = 33; f[4] = 4; f]      Then I want to get the values of `f` from the module valorization, but I get                In[531]:= myf[3]           Out[531]= f(3)      instead I would like to get the value that I have put in the module, in this case `                "desired behaviour"           In[531]:= myf[3]           Out[531]= 33      I might be asking a RTFM question, but I do not see it answered anywhere. Thanks for your help, Roberto
