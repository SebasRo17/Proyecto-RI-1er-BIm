It is easy to confirm that the `AstronomicalData` is not interpreting its arguments as UTC (or "GMT", which is, in any case, ambiguous) dates by verifying that the changes in the data it reports do not show a jump over a leap second:               ListPlot[         AstronomicalData["Pluto", {"Azimuth", #, {51.4773673, 0.00000000}}, TimeZone -> 0] &          /@ (DateList[{2012, 6, 30, 23, 59, N[58 + 2/3*#]}] & /@ Range[0, 6])]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/iBfEo.png) What timekeeping system is `AstronomicalData` assuming its date argument corresponds to? It could be any of the "smoothly flowing" timekeeping systems. Either one of the uniform ones, TAI, TT/TDT, or GPS, each of which differs from UTC by a different amount beyond the cumulative number of leap seconds to date (0s, 32.184s, and -19s, respectively); or, more likely, UT1.
