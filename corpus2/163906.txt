I'm making an app that will be used in multiple hospitals in the US. As per `HIPAA` compliance requirement, every hospital will have its own server that complies with these requirements of ensuring patient data security, etc. Now the task is that the app should communicate with a particular server based on the login info. An additional requirement is that new hospitals(servers) are likely to be added along the way, even after the app is available on the market. So basically, according to some login credentials, the app should communicate with the server of the hospital assigned to that person. One pretty crude way is to set up our own server which links the hospitals with the login info and accordingly, provides a `base-url` for data exchange. Is there a more efficient way to handle this?
