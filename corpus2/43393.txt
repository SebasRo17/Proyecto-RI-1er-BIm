Autocomplete in Mathematica 9 offers suggestions from inside SetDelayed and Module. For example, after running:               func[thing1_, thing2_] := thing1 + thing2;     Module[{thing3},      thing3 = 10;      thing3 + 4     ]      autocomplete will offer `thing1`, `thing2`, and `thing3` as suggestions. Since they are intended to be local, this gets in the way. Is there a way around this?
