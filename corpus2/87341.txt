I'm an UG Student and an Entrepreneur. I have started a small company with which I'm trying to provide solutions, to various companies in my city, through my software. I put in 30-40 hours of coding and development. I've been a huge fan of Open Source projects and I've also built by software on python. But now when it comes to selling my software to my customers, I expect money. (Am I being a Hypocrite?)   1. Is there any OSS license under which I can make money and also make my source open? Please suggest.   2. Or any other way to make money with my softwares? (I guess I deserve some credit. If not the code, atleast the ideas? :D )
