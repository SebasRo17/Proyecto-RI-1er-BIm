I am currently new to Dependency Injection pattern. I am influenced by link by Mark Seemann. **I have a confusion regarding whether an interface for an agent class of some agent module should be included in domain layer?** _by agent I mean a class / module that interacts with external wcf/ webservices._ I have a diagram that shows it. In short, is it Ok to have: IProductAgent interface in Business layer where the actual implementation will be in an Agent Module. The confusion arises by the fact that: **Is calling a service even considered a business rule?** Today a service fulfills a facility, tomorrow there might be some another means of catering this same facility. Liskov's Substitution Principle. Apologies if I am mixing things here.
