I am trying to simplify the following expression.               Sum[       Binomial[2 k, m] (1 + (-1)^m)/2 Beta[(1 + m)/2, (n - 2)/2]          (Gamma[(1 + m)/2] Gamma[1/2 (-1 + 2 k - m + n)])^2 ,        {m, 0, 2 k}]      Before doing it, I first set the `$Assumptions = {n ∈ Integers, k ∈ Integers};` since I know `n` and `k` are integers. The answer I got from _Mathematica_ v10 was rather complicated. However, one thing I found strange was that the solution contains `Floor[k]` and `Ceiling[-k]` that are clearly just `k` and `-k` since they are integers. What is more strange thing is I get an error if I try to further simplify it. What is the precise way to achieve this goal?
