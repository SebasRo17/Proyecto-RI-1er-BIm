I have pretty large code base for the client product I am working on. I am using Visual Studio 2010 for my development and it's hectically slow. I can get rid off this by disabling the installer project within the solution file.   * Is it a good idea to include setup projects within the same solution?    * How can I increase the performance of Visual Studio when working with large projects (including installer?)   * How about a different build configuration separately for installer? Will that help?
