I'm creating a data transfer object and can't decide whether it would be better to just give public access to the instance variables or if there would be a purpose to using getters and setters to access the data? According to the Data transfer object Wikipedia Article: > A DTO does not have any behavior except for storage and retrieval of its own > data (accessors and mutators). DTOs are simple objects that should not > contain any business logic that would require testing. It seems that public access would be justified for a DTO's instance variables. Here is the example I'm working on: **Ivars with public access modifier:**               class ServerContext     {         public String host;         public String user;         public String password;         public int port;              ServerContext(String host, String user, String password, int port) {             this.host = host;             this.user = user;             this.password = password;             this.port = port;         }     }      vs. **private access modifiers:**               class ServerContext     {         private String host;         private String user;         private String password;         private int port;              ServerContext(String host, String user, String password, int port) {             setHost(host);             setUser(user);             setPassword(password);             setPort(port);         }              public String getHost() {             return host;         }              public void setHost(String host) {             this.host = host;         }              public String getPassword() {             return password;         }              public void setPassword(String password) {             this.password = password;         }              public String getUser() {             return user;         }              public void setUser(String user) {             this.user = user;         }              public int getPort() {             return port;         }              public void setPort(int port) {             this.port = port;         }     }      **EDIT:** Could these be valid arguments for keeping the ivars private:   1. The potential of refactoring a DTO later to have more functionality?   2. Wanting to keep implementation consistent between DTO and regular objects?
