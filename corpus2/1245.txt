Mathematica has a cross platform data exchange format, WDX. Unfortunately importing or exporting large data from/to WDX is very slow. Using MX files is very fast, but they are not compatible across different computer architectures (32 or 64 bit). Sometimes it is suggested to `Compress` the data and write out or read it in manually. **Question: How can we extend`Import` and `Export` to allow convenient and fast importing/exporting of arbitrary Mathematica expressions using `Compress`?** The aim is to define a fast-to-load format, and make importing from it as easy as `Import["data.mmaz"]` or `Import["http://server.com/myfile.mmaz"]`, by integrating it into the `Import`/`Export` framework. Ideally the format should be recognized based on a file extension. If there is a better solution than using `Compress`, I'd like to hear it!
