given Apple's bizarre geographical segregation I was wondering if, as an Italian, I am allowed to create an English application sold on the US app store for $0.99 (regardless of the current USD <=> EUR exchange rates). It seems a really stupid question and I really hope that I can but who knows, since I can't buy them maybe I can't sell them either.
