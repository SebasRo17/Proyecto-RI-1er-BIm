I have three column as follows:   * Month   * Tech   * Circle According to this column I need to fetch the data. In Month Column, Data is : Jan,feb, March... and so on.   In Tech Column, Data is : Gsmnqi, Gsmboi... and so on.   In Circle Column, Data is : Ap ,Kol, Mumbai.. and so on.   I want to prove four condition as follows:   1. if I select the month it will fetch the data related to month, tech and circle will not be selected.   2. if I select the month and tech it will fetch the data related to month and Tech, circle will not be selected.   3. if I select the month and circle it will fetch the data related to month and circle, Tech will not be selected.   4. if I select month, tech and circle it will fetch the data related to month, tech and circle. But my if condition is not working, seriously I get confused in if, else and else if for this four condition.                 if (nqiSqiEntity.Month != string.Empty)       {           query.AppendLine("select * from K2_NQISQI with (nolock) where MONTH = '" + nqiSqiEntity.Month + "'  order by id asc");       }       else if (nqiSqiEntity.Month != string.Empty && nqiSqiEntity.Tech != string.Empty)       {           query.AppendLine("select * from K2_NQISQI with (nolock) where MONTH = '" + nqiSqiEntity.Month + "' and TECH = '" + nqiSqiEntity.Tech + "' order by id asc");       }       else if (nqiSqiEntity.Month != string.Empty && nqiSqiEntity.Circle != string.Empty)       {           query.AppendLine("select * from K2_NQISQI with (nolock) where MONTH = '" + nqiSqiEntity.Month + "' and CIRCLE = '" + nqiSqiEntity.Circle + "' order by id asc");       }       else       {           query.AppendLine("select * from K2_NQISQI with (nolock) where MONTH = '" + nqiSqiEntity.Month + "' and CIRCLE = '" + nqiSqiEntity.Circle + "' and TECH '" + nqiSqiEntity.Tech + "' order by id asc");       }      In condition, instead of `string.Empty` I need to put the value or I need to check if the value is present then only condition should get executed. Please kindly help me in my understanding this code.
