My understanding of permissive licenses (MIT, BSD) is that they allow a user to re-license the software, provided that they attribute moderate portions to the original author. Is there a reason why anybody would dual-license with something like MIT and GPL, if the MIT license would allow any person to take the code and license it as GPL? I know JQuery does this, but I don't understand why. Am I misunderstanding the MIT license or is it just redundant?
