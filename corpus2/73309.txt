We have a project here in my company of developing a new CRM. It's, basically, a big CRUD, with sub-CRUDS, with various details, such as, some users can do that, others don't. We will develop the system in PHP with Symfony. Developing is easy, but we're having some difficulties in the analysis part of the job. We have to present the project specification, as well the tecnical specification of the project. We have to draw and explain how to system will work. And we're not sure on how to do this. We always just... did the system. Not planning with graphics or text, or explaining what we were doing. We already asked everyone and got suggestions, as well requirements. Apparently, we have to take that and explain the system. Any tips, guys? :)
