I'm actively developing a large codebase that I load every time I use _Mathematica_. I frequently quit my kernel and reload the codebase to incorporate new changes. I've created a custom menu by editing `MenuSetup.tr` to include menu items and keyboard shortcuts that allow me to quit the kernel and reload my codebase quickly and easily. Unfortunately, the 'Quit' functionality no longer works in _Mathematica_ 10\. Both the `"EvaluatorQuit"` `FrontEndToken` and manually running `KernelExecute[ToExpression["Quit[]"]]` from a `MenuItem` cause the FrontEnd to crash (the code used in my `MenuItem` is derived from this thread). The same bits of code work fine when run directly from the FrontEnd. There clearly still exists a viable method of quitting a kernel from a menu, because the 'Quit Kernel' submenu in the 'Evaluation' menu still functions fine without crashing the FrontEnd. Unfortunately, the way this is done seems to be hidden behind the `"MenuListQuitEvaluators"` token used to generate that submenu. Any advice on how to get around this bothersome crashing behavior would be most welcome.
