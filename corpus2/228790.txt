You can do it this way:               [Route("api/DeliveryItems/{ID:int}/{CountToFetch:int}")]      ...calling it like so:               http://localhost:28642/api/deliveryitems/N/N      ...which has the benefit of the routing attribute documenting exactly which args the methods needs. Or you can do it this way:               [Route("api/DeliveryItems")]      ...calling it like so:               http://localhost:28642/api/deliveryitems?ID=N&CountToFetch=N      ...which has the benefit of having a clear "separation of concerns" (or perhaps "separation of context" or "separation of intent"), so that path info is one thing, args are another, and never do the twain meet (in the routing attribute string, at any rate). Any powerful reasons to opt for one style over the other?
