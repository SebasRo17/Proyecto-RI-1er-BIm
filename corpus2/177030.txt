I'm developing a big community/forum website and I'd like to upload my code to GitHub to have at least some sort of version control over it (because I have nothing other than a .rar file as a backup, not even SVN), to let others contribute to the project, and also perhaps using it to let my potential future employers see some of my code as some sort of curriculum. But what I'm wondering now, and I'm suprised I haven't seen anyone mention it before is the security aspect of it. Isn't publishing the code of a website a **_HUGE_** security hole? Is like giving a potential hacker or anyone who would like to find any potential exploit possible, even considering that the critical files aren't uploaded (database passwords, authentication scripts, etc.). Of course that there are millions of projects uploaded to GitHub and no one will find mine just 'by chance'. But if they look for it, it would indeed be there. Bottomline: my problem is not about copyright or licenses, but others finding exploits in my website. I'm I missing something here?
