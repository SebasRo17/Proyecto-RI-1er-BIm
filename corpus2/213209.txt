Now that Lucene supports joins (at indexing time and at querying time) can one use Lucene as a databse (a NoSQL one, with Eventual Consistency)? Note: I was pondering on that for sometime and this is an idea that comes around again and again from time to time and there are proof that on actually can do that - to some extent (RavenDB). Besides I think referential integrity is over-rated - I never use foreign keys in a RDBMS when I work on a big, fast changing project with a small team; from experience it's pure maintenance headache and kills productivity. The only thing that seems to me a hurdle in building up this mindset is the lack of transactions - and yes; you can have 2 step transactions (with say MongoDB and Lucene uses that for some internals) but that's lots of work; and I do not know how that would be possible with Lucene.
