I've already read this question on CodeReview. I was hoping for general advice. I'm writing a service which will go to numerous data sources. Each source requires getting copious amounts of data and changing it to a single format. What is the best pattern for a task like this? I currently have a "base" class which exposes a static `GetData` method, which the other classes inherit from and implement. This doesn't seem like the cleanest approach, so I was wondering what other approaches might suit my needs?
