I want to generate a path to cut an arbitrary shape into a set of jigsaw puzzle pieces.   1. All pieces must be unique to preclude placing a piece in the wrong spot.   2. Pieces must be interlocking such that each piece is held by adjacent pieces.   3. It must be possible to generate different paths (sets) for a specific shape that are not merely rotations or reflections of the first. Since jigsaw puzzles are mass produced there must be a known solution. However, my interest is not in simply implementing this solution, rather I am curious to know how one might approach this task, aided by _Mathematica_. I am also interested in alternatives to the standard puzzle piece such as these (even if pieces are not 100% interlocking): ![jigsaw puzzles](http://i.stack.imgur.com/59JKT.jpg)
