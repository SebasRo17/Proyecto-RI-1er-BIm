Suppose I have a form in my web application where users can upload a profile picture. I've got few requirements about file size, dimensions etc, but when the user uploads the image, how should I name them on my system? I suppose it would need to be consistent and also unique. Maybe a GUID?               a5c627bedc3c44b7ae7c06a44fb3fcf8.jpg      A timestamp?               129899740140465735.jpg      A hash? Ex: md5               b1a9acaf295cf14ffbc5b6538294562c.jpg      Is there a standard or recommended way to do this? Maybe an ASP.NET framework I should use?
