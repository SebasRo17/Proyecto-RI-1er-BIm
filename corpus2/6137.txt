I have many .gif images and I would like to export them as a single video file (I prefer .mov, but any video format is fine). But what if I have several tens of megabytes of .gif images? Is it possible to export them efficiently, without running out of memory? For example, suppose I have many .gif files in the current directory. One way to compile them into a .mov video is to import _all_ the images at once, in a single table, and then call `Export`:               files = FileNames["*.gif"];     images = Map[Import, files];     Export["video.mov", images]      But, for several tens of megabytes of .gif images, pre-importing all the images in a list (i.e., `images`) may be impossible because of insufficient memory. Is there any way to work around this?
