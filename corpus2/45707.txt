Why doesn't this work:               mergeList[a_, b_] := (       list = a;       Insert[list, 98, 3];       Do[        Do[         (          If[           b[[f]] < list[[s]],           (Insert[list, b[[f]], s]; Break[])           ]          ),         {s, Length[list]}         ],        {f, Length[b]}        ];       list       )      It doesn't give an error, it just outputs the original value of list = a For example:               mergeList[{1, 2, 3, 4}, {2, 3, 4, 5}]      outputs `{1, 2, 3, 4}`, and I don't know why.
