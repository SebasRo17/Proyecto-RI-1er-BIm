I'm trying to figure out what all is happening in the LinkedIN links URL. A link from LinkedIN community opens with a window shade (?) containing the LinkedIN site tools much like the alerts here at SE. The target link is embedded in a LinkedIN url as a GET variable. This is a LinkedIN link in three parts (the middle part is the target URL), `http://www.linkedin.com/news?viewArticle=&articleID=5567246644694487049&gid=87719&type=member&item=90729979&articleURL=` **+** `http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nypl.org%2Fblog%2F2011%2F03%2F24%2Fprecarity-readers-guide` **+** `&urlhash=mQ1h&trk=group_most_recent_rich-0-b-shrttl`   1. What is this GUI widget I called "window shade" commonly referred to as?    2. What is the technical code reference?    3. What is the term I can use to describe the way LinkedIN uses GET data?
