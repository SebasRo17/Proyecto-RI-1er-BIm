I have the following code:               ser[x_] = FourierSeries[(\[Pi]^2 + a)/(3 x^2 + a), x, 10] // N // Chop      It gives me some series, which I then try to plot. And surprisingly, the result isn't even similar to the function I passed to `FourierSeries[]`: for comparison, I've used this code:               Plot[{ser[x], 1000 (\[Pi]^2 + a)/(3 x^2 + a)}, {x, -\[Pi], \[Pi]}]      ![output](http://i.stack.imgur.com/2Mntb.png) Fourier transform for function given in documentation works correctly, while for this one doesn't. I've tried using directly the formula given in documentation as default formula (used `NIntegrate[]`), and that gives me expected results.   What have I done wrong? Is this a bug? _Addition to answer comments:_ ![some more code](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WrPSL.png) As one can see, the Fourier coefficients computed via `NIntegrate[]` are _quite_ different from ones generated by `FourierCoefficient[]`. _Update:_   As pointed in comments, setting `GenerateConditions->True` appears to yield correct result, not generating any conditions though. Why should this be needed?
