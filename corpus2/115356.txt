in this question OP has presented a site where some puzzle are available. He described the problem about solving them. I was curious is that really so problematic. The first one was really easy, so I tried next one this time from the end that should be the hardest one (puzzle). And here I have some problem with understating it or probably I am messing something. Let focus on the example: Data:               M1      C1      C2      277317     M2      C2      C1      26247     M3      C1      C3      478726     M4      C3      C1      930382     M5      C2      C3      370287     M6      C3      C2      112344      Result:               617317     2 3 6      My problem is that relying on the assumption that > any one compound can be used in a chemical reaction to create any other > compound The solution could be               508878     2 6 5      Why ? In the content of the task, we do not have sad anything about that we have to start with compound one then from this get two then from two, three etc. So the result should be to have all cheapest compounds, basing on the assumption we dont need to care how it was created. So this reduce our problem to structure like this.               M1      C2      277317     M2      C1      26247     M3      C3      478726     M4      C1      930382     M5      C3      370287     M6      C2      112344      And from this list we should pick the lowest cost for each compound. * * * So how did the achieve that solution, `2 3 6` ? By me they have used to complex logic for that, their basic assumption was that C1 -> C2 is the same as C2 -> C1 so they have used a rank (hash code)               17 * 37 * 1 * 2 == 17 * 37 * 2 * 1      (for this post i have used easier representation using the bit shift and bit- wise or that is more less the same)               M1    001 | 010 = 011  277317     M2    010 | 001 = 011  26247     M3    001 | 100 = 101  478726     M4    100 | 001 = 101  930382     M5    010 | 100 = 110  370287     M6    100 | 010 = 110  112344      After such operation the set of solution is reduced to this form               M1    3  277317     M2    3  26247     M3    5  478726     M4    5  930382     M5    6  370287     M6    6  112344      So now I don't have the information about compounds, but only a rank that provide the solution. We had three compounds on start we have three ranks so is seams to be correct, and the result is the same that in the example (cost 508878 machines 2 6 5). * * * My observation is that the content of the puzzle is very funny but have a lot of holes in the limitation about the method that should be applied to achieve the result. So concluding, what i am messing ?
