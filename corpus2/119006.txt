This is an Agile development project and I do not have the ability to change that. The design that will be the fastest and most obvious for the first phase of our project will not be compatible with the needs of our second phase. The change would not be difficult to implement now but it would take a little more time to implement. Our PM is pushing for the quick phase 1 approach saying we will deal with the problem in phase 3 when we get there. Making the change at phase 3 will require refactoring and data transformation will be very intensive. Is there anything I can or should do now that fits in the agile methodology?
