Apologies if the question is too basic; I've searched the manual and the web but couldn't find a solution. I would like to present some data on a discrete plot. The data is divided into $K$ series or numbers, $y_{k,1}, y_{k,2},\dots, y_{k,r_k}$ (with length $r_k$ depending on $k$, but is small). I would like to plot points corresponding to numbers in one series on a vertical line corresponding to the series. So, on the line ${x=1}$, one unit left of the $y$-axis, I would like to place all the points $y_{1,1}, y_{1,2},\dots, y_{1,r_1}$; then on the line ${x=2}$ I would like to place all the points $y_{2,1}, y_{2,2},\dots, y_{1,r_2}$; and so on. Thus, the points I need on the plot have coordinates $(i,y_{k,i})$. I'm fairly sure Mathematica has something like this as a built in type of plot, but I can't find it. Any help will be appreciated.
