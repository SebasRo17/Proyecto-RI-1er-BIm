I asked Mathematica 9 to execute the `SeriesCoefficient` command on a rather horrendously complicated expression. After some time I decided to abort the evaluation and try something different. Somehow, this has caused the `Series` and `SeriesCoefficient` commands to stop working properly. They can still correctly expand known functions, for example things like `Series[x^2*BesselJ[Sin[x],x],{x,0,5}]` do work as expected, but for arbitrary, not-yet-defined functions they no longer work, so `Series[f[x],{x,0,2}]` now returns just `f[x]` rather than the expected `f[0]+f'[0]x+f''[0]x^2/2+O[x]^3`. Does anyone know what exactly might have caused this and how I could fix it without having to restart the kernel? (Presumably the previous call to `SeriesCoefficient` changed some obscure internal parameter in the kernel which may be reversible...) I have a bunch of long, precalculated expressions in the kernel's memory and it would be quite annoying to have to export all of them and reimport into a new kernel.
