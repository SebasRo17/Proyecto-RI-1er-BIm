IÂ´m trying to solve a system of ODEs using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. I have to recreate certain results to obtain my degree. But I'm a beginner at _Mathematica_ programming and with the Runge-Kutta method as well.               {A=0.30, B=1, C=40, D=1, E=0.75, F=0.11,      r=2.5, a=2, e=0.475, g=2, d=0.03, n=0.01, p=-0.00005}          x'[t]/x[t]=(A+B x[t]-Cx[t]^2-F)/(D+E^(r y[t]));        y'[t]/y[t]=g(((a s[t] x[t] k[t])/m[t])-e)(1-y[t]);      m'[t]/m[t]=n;     k'[t]/k[t]=x[t]-d;     s'[t]/s[t]=-p;      I'd appreciate any kind of help. For over a month now, I've tried to solve this system myself but have only gotten bad results. This model is suppose to fluctuate around the equilibrium point but in the code I have so far, this doesn't happen.
