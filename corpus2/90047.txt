I'd like to begin working with quantum computers as a hobby. Is this possible?   1. Where can I buy a quantum (personal) computer so I can run (my) quantum computer programs?   2. What quantum computing programming languages are out there? Is there something like a compilable quantum computing programming language? Any pointers to resources, tutorials are very appreciated. I've read Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists and it's very interesting! Can't wait to begin programming.
