I need to do some very specific web search, but in order to do that I need to know what's the technical name of the category/type of variables like NEW, OLD, USER ( the could be more ) that you can access from within a trigger in a RDBMS without having to declare them. The question I want to post is "does `<RDBMS>` support `<xxxx>` variables in triggers ?" but I don't know what to put in the `<xxxx>` placeholder. For example, variables like this `:var` in a query are called _bind variables_.
