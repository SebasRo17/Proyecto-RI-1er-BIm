When I first started working a mainframe assembler programmer showed me how they swap to values without using the traditional algorithm of:               a = 0xBABE     b = 0xFADE          temp = a     a = b     b = temp      What they used to swap two values - from a bit to a large buffer - was:               a = 0xBABE     b = 0xFADE          a = a XOR b     b = b XOR a     a = a XOR b      now               b == 0xBABE     a == 0xFADE      which swapped the contents of 2 objects without the need for a third temp holding space. My question is: Is this XOR swap algorithm still in use and where is it still applicable.
