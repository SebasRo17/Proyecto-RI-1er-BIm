I have an NDSolve problem that needs a list of a large number of events that are generated programmatically. Here is a simple example that demonstrates the problem on Mathematica 7 and 8 (the versions I have access to):               NDSolve[       {y''[t] == 10, y[0] == 0, y'[0] == 0},       {y},       {t, 0, 1},       Method -> {"EventLocator",         "Event" :> {y[t] - 2, y[t] - 1},         "EventAction" :>(*{Throw[Print["i=",1],"StopIntegration"],Throw[          Print["i=",2],"StopIntegration"]}*)          Table[Throw[Print["i=", i], "StopIntegration"], {i, 3}]         }       ];      The code as it is does not work (the second event should be triggered first, and it prints `i=1`), but if I use the commented block in `EventAction`, it does work, and prints `i=2`. What is the right syntax to make this work? Thanks for any help!
