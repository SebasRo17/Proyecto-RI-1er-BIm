I'm currently a one person development team. My employer is looking at hiring a manager. They do this because, for the more complicated projects, I tend to take a "this is how much I've got done - this is how much there is to go" approach rather than "this is when it will be done" and they think it's going to magically change if a manager comes on board. Would I be correct that second developer is more efficient? Could I maybe cite the advent of pair programming as evidence, or is that really a specialized thing?
