I would like to sell the compiled binary of my android application in the Google Play Store when it reaches production. Which license can I use to prevent people from downloading my source code from the open-source page and selling an exact copy of my work on the play store? I want the code to be free and open for geeks/hackers to download and play with, but I don't want people who check out my source code to have the ability to use it for commercial use.
