The following code selects a special element from a list               thelist = {"this", "notthis"};          Select[thelist, (# == "this") &]      What I want is a function which does just that and which takes lists (like _thelist_ ) and a string (like _"this"_ ) as argument. However I have a problem, because _Select_ already uses an abstract function and so the naive idea               sel:=Select[#1, (# == #2) &]          sel[thelist,"this"]      doesn't work. This is really about the Function command and the problem might not just appear with _Select_ but any abstract function nesting. How to construct the object I need?
