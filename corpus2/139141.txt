If I want to host a website from my home, I buy a domain name. Then, I get a static IP from my ISP. Next, I point it to the IP address of my home system. I can even use the SQL server installed in my system and not worry about the size. I am not talking about piles of servers here. Just one server. I was wondering if it is that easy, why not do it? Is there something that I am missing here? I am talking about moderately simple website. But does it matter?
