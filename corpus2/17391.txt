I have just started using _Mathematica_ with v9.0. I am trying to follow a computation from a book on Fourier series with the function $f(x)=x$ on the interval $-\pi < x < \pi$. Here is the code I have tried:               f[x_] = x;      a[0] = 1/2 Pi Integrate[f[x], {x, -Pi, Pi}]     a[n] = 1/Pi Integrate[f[x] Cos (nx), {x, -Pi, Pi}]     b[n] = 1/Pi Integrate[f[x] Sin (nx), {x, -Pi, Pi}]      I got the same result for a[0] and a[n] as per the book; for b[n] the answer generate by _Mathematica_ is 0, but the answer in the book is $\frac{2}{n}(-1)^{n+1}$. Can someone explain why is this the case? Note: I found a post here Fourier Coefficients in Mathematica but I can't seem to follow it.
