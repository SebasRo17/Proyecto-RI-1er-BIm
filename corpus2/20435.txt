I'm constantly dealing with non-commutative algebras. `**` is inbuilt, non- commutative and associative. That's good :-) But it is not distributive. Rats.   * What is a simple way (I probably won't need much more) to have, say, `(a1 + a2 + a3)**(b1 + b2 + b3)` always expand to `a1**b1 + ... + a3**b3`, on the fly?   * And if I like to add (also executed on the fly) laws like `a1**b1 = c1 + d1`?   * And, last question, if I did and have `a2**a1**b1` (with, say, `a2**a1 = e1` forced), do `(a2**a1)**b1` and `a2**(a1**b1)` substitute to `e1**b1` and `a2**(c1+d1)`, respectively, or both to `e1**b1` due to flatness of `**`?
