I would like to be able to visualize the empty space in a Graphics3D plot. For example, if I plot hexagonally close packed spheres using something like:               Show[Graphics3D[Sphere[#, Sqrt[2]/2] & /@ Select[Tuples[{-1, 0, 1}, 3],      Mod[Total[#], 2] == 0 &], Boxed -> False]]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XZzVA.png) Then how would I show the space between the spheres? That is, I would like the space occupied by the spheres to be empty and the space between them to be filled in.
