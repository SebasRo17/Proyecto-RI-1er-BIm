Let's say we have a method `setFoo` that sets a flag in a Bar object e.g.               class Baz {          public void setFoo(String foo)(            ...         }     }      inside setFoo, the method is doing some expensive load of the `Bar` object from the database.               class Baz {          public void setFoo(String foo)(            Bar bar = expensiveGetBar();            ...         }     }      To avoid the need to get the `Bar` object again, the developer changes the method to return it.               class Baz {          public Bar setFoo(String foo)(            Bar bar = expensiveGetBar();            ...            return bar;         }     }      Questions are:   1. Is this discouraged?    2. If yes, why and what is the alternative    3. Should the solution be adding some sort of cache instead?   4. How would you prefix the method? set? get? seget? geset?
