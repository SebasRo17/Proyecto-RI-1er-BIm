I'm interested if there are any websites or software out there to aid in initial project design, and then management of the project's design over time as features are implmented, bugs are found, etc... My design will include requirements (functional & non-functional), use cases, and basic database schema design. Most sought-after feature:   * Being able to define requirements and track their changes over time (i.e. how is version 1.5 different than 1.0?) Nice-to-haves:   * Being able to collaborate with other project managers and the team when putting together the specifications What I'm _not_ looking for:   * Ticket trackers (JIRA, fogbugz, etc...)   * Software version control systems   * Wikis (unless they are built with requirements management in mind) Thanks.
