In short, my question for you hardcore Emacs users is this: have you achieved this "self-reinforcing performance" Steve Yegge talks about? > Emacs is self-hosting: writing things in it makes the environment itself > more powerful. It's a feedback loop: a recursive, self-reinforcing, > multiplicative effect that happens because you're enhancing the environment > you're using to create enhancements. Do you **really feel** that enhancing your Emacs eventually made you **10X times more productive** , and your productivity continues increasing exponentially, and so on and so forth?   Do you have some examples / experience to share? As for me, I was using both Emacs and Vim for development (currently stick with Vim), my `.emacs` and `.vimrc` are both quite configured to suite my needs and I appreciate power of both of these editors. But I didn't experience this Emacs' "self-reinforcing loop", neither met someone who did (of course, this could be because I'm not truly hardcore Emacser, and haven't met that many Emacsers yet). For example, at Facebook, the guy next to me was using Vim, and the guy next to him was using Emacs. Both of them were quick and productive as hell, and I attribute this not to the editor they were using, but to their own intelligence and attitude. But anyway, I'd be glad to see astounding examples from Emacs proponents that would turn me back to the Church of Emacs.
