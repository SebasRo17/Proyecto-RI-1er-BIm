I am a hobbyist programmer who makes and maintains one production system, largely coded in Python, which now has to be ported to Android. I don't know Java at all. However, SL4A in Android makes Python a bit of a second class citizen re APIs, such as Google Cloud Messaging etc. However, for me, Java appears intimidating with its verbose syntax and strict typing. Scala's syntax is more appealing and seems like a possible compromise. From this question and this one on Stack Overflow it seems that Scala development on Android is feasible. However, as a 'beginner', I would like to know what problems I might encounter by using Scala instead of Java. The available information that I can find on the 'Net (including the question from this site cited above) is from early 2012, at the latest, and I imagine the situation has changed since then.
