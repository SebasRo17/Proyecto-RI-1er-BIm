I have the following code that gives you a phase portrait of a 2d system and I can't understand what means the 3rd and 4th line (sol1 and sol2).               sys = {x'[t] == 3 x[t], y'[t] == -y[t]};          ss = DSolve[sys, {x[t], y[t]}, t];          sol1 = ss[[1, 1, 2]];          sol2 = ss[[1, 2, 2]];          toplot = Flatten[       Table[{sol1, sol2} /. {C[1] -> i, C[2] -> j},          {i, -0.5, 0.5, 0.25}, {j, -0.5, 0.5, 0.25}], 1]          graphs = ParametricPlot[Evaluate[toplot], {t, -3, 3}]      I searched the documentation but I couldn't figure it out. Thank you. @J.M. @belisarius I try to extend it in non linear eqiations. I tried another example with a non linear diff eq. What I wanted to find was the phase space. When I put μ>0 then it plots a solution, but it does not show the other fixed point that is non stable. For everything else μ it does not do anything. `sol = NDSolve[{x'[t] == μ - x[t]^2, y'[t] == -y[t], x[0] == x0, y[0] == y0}, {x[t], y[t]}, {t, 0, 100}]` `toplot = Table[{x@t, y@t} /. sol, {x0, -.5, 2, .25}, {y0, -.5, .5, .25}];` `ParametricPlot[Evaluate[toplot], {t, 0, 100}, PlotRange -> All]` I now the dynamics of the above, I do not want you to explain that to me. I want your help because I am trying to learn mathematica.
