I'm a new intern in a fairly large company's IT department. I've been learning a whole lot of stuff and I'm loving every minute of it. However, the more people I meet in the company, the less I understand their titles or the general title hierarchy. Here are some examples:   * Senior Designer   * System Architect   * Systems Analyst   * Systems Analyst II   * Technical Support Analyst II   * Infrastructure Operations To name a few. But from what I gather sometimes two people will have the same title and do 2 completely different things, whereas sometimes they will have different titles and do the same things. No more do I actually understand anything from the titles themselves.
