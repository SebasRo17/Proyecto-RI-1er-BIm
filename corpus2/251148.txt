Most of the version control systems I have used have a lot of similar functionallity for source code files: they work on their text content, diff using well known diff algorithms, the changes contain deleted and inserted lines of text, the whole workflow is based on some form of commits, branches and merging of branches. Several days ago I found and I started playing with Darcs, a version control system created by the Haskell community based on Patch theory. I wonder if there are any other, more esoteric version control systems based on different concepts(e.g. different kind of commits, working on code structure, etc)
