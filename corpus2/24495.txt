question is as follows define a list               ttt={1,2};      and if I set values in this way               {ttt[[1]],ttt[[2]]}={3,4}      then the value of list ttt now becomes {3,4} Now I try this               f:={ttt[[1]],ttt[[2]]}      then `?f` will show that `f:={tmp[[1]],tmp[[2]]}` then if I just write               f={3,4}      this will not affect the values of list ttt . **the question is that I want the values of list ttt changes as well when I set values to f. How to do this?** * * * **More Question!!** why the following code didn't change the value of ttt??               Table[With[{i = i}, Defer@ttt[[i]]], {i, 1, 2}] = {111, 222}      while               Table[With[{i = i}, Defer@ttt[[i]]], {i, 1, 2}]      really gives               {ttt[[1]],ttt[[2]]}
