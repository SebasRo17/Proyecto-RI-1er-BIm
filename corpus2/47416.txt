Almost every developer has to answer questions from business side like:   Why is going to take 2 days to add this simple contact form? When a developer estimates this task, they may divide it into steps:   * make some changes to the Database   * optimize DB changes for speed    * add front end HTML   * write server side code   * add validation   * add client side javascript    * use unit tests   * make sure SEO set-up is working   * implement email confirmation   * refactor and optimize the code for speed   * ... These maybe hard to explain to a non-technical person, who basically sees the whole task as just putting together some HTML and creating a table to store the data. To them it could be 2 hours MAX. So is there a better way to explain why the estimate is high to a non- developer?
