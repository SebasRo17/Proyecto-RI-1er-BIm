A while ago the company I work for had outsourced a development project to a third party. They employed agile practices in developing the solution. However when asked for documentation they would just say it was required as it was incorporated in a wiki or as part of their sprints. They did leave at the completion of the project, with all but one of the project team. The project wiki site has now been closed down once the yearly subscription was due. When they left they took most of the knowledge and understanding of what was developed with them. So I do have 2 main questions;   1. Is this normal for agile or just an excuse for not wanting to write it?   2. What are the industry norm for documentation in agile projects to record development requirements, designs, key decisions and context?
