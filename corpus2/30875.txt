I have a general query about simplifying expressions in Mathematica, which I will illustrate using quadratics. If I tell Mathematica to simplify $a x^2 + b x + c$ then   * `Simplify` will give the same (fully expanded) form $a x^2 + b x + c$    * `FullSimplify` will give a form like $((ax+b)x+c)$ Clarification: The coefficients in the simplified form (of course) need not be the same values $a,b,c$. The variable names are meant for demonstration of the format. Example               poly = x^2 + 4*x + 1     Simplify[poly] (* gives 1 + 4 x + x^2 *)     FullSimplify[poly] (* gives 1 + x (4 + x) *)     (*Desired answer (x+2)^2 - 3 *)      However, I desire the format: $a{(x-b)}^2 + c$ which I find to be more intuitive in "understanding" the expression.   1. What measure of "expression complexity" does Mathematica work with?   2. How could I get the kind of result that I want? If possible, I'd like to know how to do this for not just quadratics, but also more complicated polynomial expressions.
