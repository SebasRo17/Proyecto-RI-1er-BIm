Background: I want to explain the Sylow Theorems as detailed as possible, therefore I am rewriting the proof using concrete examples. Since the answers to my questions ( about Mathematica ) have often, if not always, exceeded my expectations, and I lack the tools to adequately show a table, I start with a compact description of my question. I can elaborate if required, of course. Question: **Is it possible to create a group action table with Mathematica?** For example: Let $G = \left\\{ 1,a,a^2, b, ba, ba^2 \right \\}$, where $a^3=b^2=1, ab=ba^2 (D3) $ . Let $S$ be the set of subsets of size $3$ of $G$: $\left\\{ \left\\{ 1,a,a^2 \right \\}, \left\\{1,a,b \right \\}, ..., \left\\{b,ba,ba^2 \right \\} \right \\} $ . Define the map $f: G \times S \rightarrow S \ $ by $(g,s) \mapsto gs$. **The group action table, illustrating the map $f$ would be of size 20 X 6 with each cell containing an element of $S$.** I have ( experience with ) the Mathematica AbstractAlgebra package. I'll accept answers in GAP also.
