I have a binarized image in Mathematica 9, and I would like to generate a list of coordinates for clusters of pixels connected through their Moore neighborhoods, e.g. $((c_{1,1},c_{1,2},...),(c_{2,1},c_{2,2},...),...)$ where some $c_{n,k}$ is the coordinate for the $k$th pixel in the $N$th set of pixels connected through their Moore neighborhoods. Is there a simple way to proceed with Mathematica 9's image analysis tool set?
