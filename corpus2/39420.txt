I have a lesson notebook for a class I am teaching. I'd like to separate the lesson content and the practice problems. Students are using the CDFPlayer program, not _Mathematica_. I created a button that will open a specific notebookâ€¦               Button[       "open",       NotebookOpen[FileNameJoin[{NotebookDirectory[ButtonNotebook[]], "sample.nb"}]]]      and this works fine in the CDFPlayer. However, selecting a "random" question from a list of files doesn't. Something in my code doesn't work in the free player. (The same code works fine in _Mathematica_ ) This is what I tried:               Button[       "open",       NotebookOpen[RandomChoice[FileNames[{"*.nb"}, {NotebookDirectory[ButtonNotebook[]]}]]]]      I'm wondering if someone could offer a suggestion? I'd like a button that when clicked, will open a notebook from a folder of practice problems, and work in the CDFPlayer. Any suggestions are appreciated. I see (and appreciate) the feedback that the free CDFPlayer is NOT able to open files. So that answers my question...
