I am trying to use `HorizontalGauge[Dynamic[expt], {0.1, 100}, ScalingFunctions -> "Log"]`, i.e. a gauge with a logarithmic scale. This creates an error, a graph with a pink background. Monitoring the output with `Dynamic[expt]` and a second gauge `HorizontalGauge[Dynamic[expt], {0.1, 100}, ScalingFunctions -> None]` indicates that the logarithmic `HorizontalGauge` actually generates the expected output. Unless, somebody realizes a mistake in this rather simple code, I must assume this is a bug in Mathematica 9. **EDIT** Unluckily, this error has not been corrected in version 9.0.1               ... , ScalingFunctions -> {Exp, Log}      sort of works, but the locations of the tick marks are of course wrong. In the other order `{Log, Exp}` the error from above is reproduced. I reported this as an error.
