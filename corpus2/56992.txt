I have a matrix made mostly from `"x"` with a few `0`'s thrown in:               list = {{0, "x", "x", 0}, {0, "x", "x", "x"}, {0, "x", "x",         "x"}, {"x", "x", "x", "x"}, {"x", "x", "x", "x"}, {"x", "x", "x",         "x"}, {"x", "x", "x", "x"}, {"x", "x", "x", "x"}, {0, "x", "x",         "x"}}      I know that there are 31 `"x"`'s in the matrix, and I want to replace each of them with a numbered variable: `x1`, `x2`, and so on til `x31` (without quotations). Here's the expected result:               (* {{0, x1, x2, 0}, {0, x3, x4, x5}, {0, x6, x7, x8}, {x9, x10, x11,        x12}, {x13, x14, x15, x16}, {x17, x18, x19, x20}, {x21, x22, x23,        x24}, {x25, x26, x27, x28}, {0, x29, x30, x31}} *)      Below is the list of the numbered variables that you may use:               numberedx = Table["x" <> ToString@i // Symbol, {i, Range@Count[list, "x", {2}]}]     (* {x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8, x9, x10,      x11, x12, x13, x14, x15, x16, x17, x18, x19, x20,      x21, x22, x23, x24, x25, x26, x27, x28, x29, x30, x31} *)      I can't for the life of me figure out how to do this. My gut tells me that some procedural method is in order since each `"x"` is replaced by its numbered form, then the next `"x"` down the line is replaced by the next member in the list of numbered variables. Unfortunately I'm very uncomfortable with procedural programming. I also tried `MapIndexed` but the `0`'s are mapped as well. I'd really appreciate any help or insight.
