What are some good ideas, common approaches and appropriate questions that you would bring when interviewing a software development intern to join your team? I really don't have expectations of any kind for this person, I understand that as an intern with no prior work experience that he won't have much to bring to the table. I am more or less looking for a good attitude and somebody willing to learn. What would be appropriate if you intend to put this intern 70/30 (QA Testing/Coding)? Would that be a good internship experience in your opinion?
