I am using _Mathematica_ for visualization of DeBruijn graphs. However, I am having a bit of trouble using `ListNecklaces`. I want to know how many cyclic shifts of length `n` with variables `x` and `y`. This is equivalent to looking at the number of necklaces (cyclic) with `n` beads and 2 colors. However, I'm not sure how to use the command `ListNecklaces`. I don't get anything back when I input `ListNecklaces[n ,2, Cyclic]`. I also am having trouble with some of the graph theory commands. In versions older than V9, I would need to load the Combinatorica package. Is it true that now I don't have to? Sometimes, _Mathematica_ doesn't recognize `ListNecklaces`, `DeBruijnGraph`, etc. What is the proper way to set up _Mathematica_ to use these? I am using Version 9, Student's Edition.
