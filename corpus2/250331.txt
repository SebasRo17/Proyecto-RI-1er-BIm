We have a textarea field in a desktop client server application which in the end stores all the data in a database server, this text area is used to take notes and similar text areas have been put throughout our application as a marketing choice so that users can never blame the application for missing some fields and the marketing department can always answer "put it in the notes field". Recently however we realised some customers use the notes area heavily to write letters or copy paste documents, so we had to increase the notes field in the database from 1024 to 10240, we are realising however that this way the desktop application takes always more time to download all this backlog of information. What is the compromise between giving practically no limit to user input length and letting the users use it as they deem necessary and putting a strict limit justifying the choice as "performance mandated"?
