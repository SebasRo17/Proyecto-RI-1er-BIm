I had the opportunity to develop applications in several niches:   server back-end, desktop clients, and recently a small scale website. Once indulged in the website design I am asking myself and you   how come the UI design process is so different? Can you point out the differences, and why they originated? Once, HTML was for marking up text and desktop GUI was the front-end for doing the real job, but today, why the GUI development process is still so different? Here are some for a start: Desktop: **Use of explicit layout**. (ex: StackPanel in WPF, BorderLayout in Swing)   Web: **Layout is a set of CSS properties** (ex: height/width, margin/padding, float, display..) that are given to each container like element. Desktop: **Isolation of GUI components** to OO classes, easy reuse.   Web: **Components are not reused in html level** , they may be reused in dynamic server-side html generation. Only CSS styles may be reused. Can you name a few more? and why? Why can't they be similar? Side note: I have some experience with GWT, it creates a client application that runs in the browser, but why can't I make a webpage (like a blog page) with desktop UI design methods and tools?
