I have the following PDE (a master equation, and $P$ is probability density, $0\le x\le1$ and $0\le y\le1$): $$ \partial_t P(x,y,t)=x\partial_xP(x,y,t)+(1-y)\partial_yP(x,y,t)+2P(x,y,t) $$ The initial conditions are $P(x,y,t=0)=\delta(x-0.05,y-0.85)$. For the boundary conditions, if the probability density is going to flow through the boundary, I won't do anything to stop it. ( **How to express the BC in Mathematica?** ) I used the following command:               NDSolve[{D[P[x, y, t], t] ==      x D[P[x, y, t], x] + (1 - y) D[P[x, y, t], y] + 2 P[x, y, t],      P[x, y, 0] == DiracDelta[x - 0.05, y - 0.85]}, P,      {t, 0, 2}, {x, 0, 1}, {y, 0, 1}]      First, Mathematica gave the following warning:               Warning: an insufficient number of boundary conditions have been specified for the direction of      independent variable y. Artificial boundary effects may be present in the solution. >>      Moreover, the result it gave obviously is wrong:               Plot3D[Evaluate[(P[x, y, t] /. %) /. {t -> 0}], {x, 0, 1}, {y, 0, 1}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dHIrn.png) **My question is** : 1) How can I express the boundary conditions I mentioned 2) How can I make the `NDSolve` work?
