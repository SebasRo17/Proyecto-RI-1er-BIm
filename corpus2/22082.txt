I have a set of 2D points with machine precision coordinates. I need to remove all duplicates. Performance is important. This is the most obvious fast solution:               Union[points]      Unfortunately it turns out that unlike `Equal` and `SameQ`, `Union` has no tolerance for any difference with machine precision numbers, which makes it unusable for this purpose.               In[1]:=      a = 1.;     b = a + $MachineEpsilon;          In[3]:= a == b     Out[3]= True          In[4]:= a === b     Out[4]= True          In[5]:= Union[{a, b}]     Out[5]= {1., 1.}      Using the `SameTest` option of `Union` works, but it is not a good option because it makes the complexity $n^2$ again. So what is the fastest way to get rid of duplicates while allowing for a tolerance of comparisons, and preferably being able to control it (`Internal`$EqualTolerance`, `Internal`$SameQTolerace`)?
