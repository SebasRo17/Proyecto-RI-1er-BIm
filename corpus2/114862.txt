I'm 8 months into my first job as a developer at a mid-small company. The four development teams have about 7 developers each, the design team consists of about the same number, and the administration / sales / marketing / hr team is 4 people. We mostly develop web apps, a one-time deal, to run on the client's (usually existing) environment. I'm finding myself setting up development environments to match, usually things I've never used before (from C#.NET 1.1 and MS-SQL to a regionally developed WAS called JEUS), which takes a significant amount of time. Sometimes I get help from other developers but mostly I follow online tutorials until it seems to work, and then I spend more time fixing my code when it breaks because the settings aren't exactly the same as the actual environment. I'm starting to think that one guy who specializes in this stuff would make it much easier for the developers to actually do what they're paid to do. When does it make sense for a company to get a dedicated systems engineer? Or am I wrong and should just suck it up and learn to do it? I do realize that being familiar with different environments would improve my employability...
