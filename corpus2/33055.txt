I have two integral equations               -Sin[v]*Integrate[          (x[v, z]*b*Sin[v])/Sqrt[(a^2*(Cos[v])^2 + b^2*(Sin[v])^2 + z^2)^3],          {v, 0, 2*Pi}, {z, -l, l}] == 0          -Cos[v]*Integrate[         (x[v, z]*a*Cos[v])/Sqrt[(a^2*(Cos[v])^2 + b^2*(Sin[v])^2 + z^2)^3],         {v, 0, 2*Pi}, {z, -l, l}] == 0      I would like to find a solution for `x[v,z]`, that is going to solve bough equations. Than I would like to plot 3D graph with axes `v,z,x[v,z]`. Can anyone help me in finding a solution?
