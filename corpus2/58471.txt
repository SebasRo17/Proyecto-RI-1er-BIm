I'm working with a simple software application written in _Mathematica_ , composing of several .nb and .m files. The application is centered around a simple mathematica GUI, which includes several numerical input fields and selection options, and produces output graphs. What I wish to do is keep this GUI, but somehow hide the source code so that a user (who would access the machine remotely) cannot edit or see the algorithm producing the GUI. I know two potential options may be converting to .CDF or recompiling the mathematica code into C. I'm interested in any other possibilities, but I have two specific questions based on these options:   * Can I export multiple .m and .nb files into a single .CDF, and if so would there be any way to view the algorithms underlying the GUI?   * If I compile the mathematica code into C, would it still be able to produce a GUI?
