For example I want to find solution with maximum value among solutions (and possibly plot it):               answers = Piecewise[List @@@ Last @@@ N @Solve[{            z == 40 x + 50 y,            6 x + 10 y <= 672,            0.25 x + 0.15 y <= 24,            1.5 y <= 42,            0 <= x,            0 <= y            }, {z}, Integers]]      In this case it is : `{4230.,x\[LongEqual]87.\[And]y\[LongEqual]15.}`
