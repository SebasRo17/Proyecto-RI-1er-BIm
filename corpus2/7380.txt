Do you think we'll ever see an IL (or other bytecode) processing unit? It sounds possible and would have a major benefit, because we wouldn't need the JITter. This isn't the same as compiling .NET directly to machine code, since the bytecode here is designed to be programmed and disassembled easily, unlike the bytecode used in x86 processors which is designed to work faster. What's stopping Intel (for example) from partnering with Microsoft and making such a .NET-optimised processor?
