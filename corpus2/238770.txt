The title is very bad so let me explain what I need to know. I have a server with let's say different images. What I want to achieve is be able to embed a frame, into any HTML site, and be the server the one that determines what image to show on that remote frame. Imagine the situation where you want to add a piece of advertising to your site, but you just need to paste a piece of JS or HTML into your HTML and be the advertising seller be in charge of showing whatever he wants on the size of the frame. My question is what is this technique/technology named ? What should I know, is it websockets ?, is it embedding ? How could I achieve this ? Thanks !
