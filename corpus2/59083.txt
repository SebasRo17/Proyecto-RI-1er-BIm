I want to go from               Graphics[{Red, Rectangle[{0, 0}, {1, 3}], Blue, Polygon[{{1, 1}, {3, 1}, {2, 2}}]}, Frame -> True]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/7uJJS.jpg) to ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/S0L0a.jpg) I have rather clumsily written:               RectangleToLines[r_] := With[{n = Flatten @ r},       Line[{{n[[1]], n[[2]]}, {n[[3]], n[[2]]}, {n[[3]], n[[4]]}, {n[[1]],n[[4]]}, {n[[1]], n[[2]]}}]       ]          RectangleToLines[{{0, 0}, {1, 3}}]      > Line[{{0, 0}, {1, 0}, {1, 3}, {0, 3}, {0, 0}}] and similar with the triangle. Terrible, because I would end up with many "FormToLines"-definitions. I feel - that especially with **V10** \- there should be a much cleverer way to do this.
