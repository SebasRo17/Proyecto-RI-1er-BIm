Today, my manager **_told_** me that I must work over time to make up for a lack of planning and project management. Instead of incentivizing this unpaid mandatory overtime, my manager has made it clear I have no choice in the matter. This isn't a single project. We currently have a dozen projects all on the go at one time, and I simply can't get them all done. Therefore, I must work overtime so we don't have to push deadlines.   * Is this a sign of an ignorant or disrespectful manager, or simply an inexperienced one?   * I'm in this position because of a lack of planning and project management (I think). How might I avoid this in the future? I'm no Project Manager, it isn't my strength.   * What are good ways to get an employee to work overtime if you can't directly pay them? Good incentives, etc. From what I hear, gaining your employee's respect is the single best way to get your employees to work over time, although you should never make a habit of it.
