Been writing code since about 18 years now. Lately, I've got into the habit of not indenting elses and when I look at the code it does worry me a bit mostly that someone who might look at the code might cry foul. The snippet below explains the need for the style               if(condition) {        ...     } //1      if(condition) { // Don't want this second block to be entered unnecessarily        ...     }      So I put an else where the comment labelled 1 is               if(condition) {        ...     } else     if(condition) {         ...     }      Putting an else there helps maintain readability especially when forgetting to put one there doesn't necessarily break anything. What I'm uneasy with is that it doesn't strictly follow conventions (Sun's in this case) in two different ways - 1) proper indentation 2) having an open brace after the else I guess what I'm trying to do is prevent having massive indents which really makes a difference in blocks that have a lot of conditions - 5 or more although only three are showcased below.               if(condition) {        ...     } else {        if(condition) {            ...        } else {           if(condition) {               ...           } else {              ...           }        }     }      I find it a lot neater to have the else unindented and without a brace following. What are your thoughts?
