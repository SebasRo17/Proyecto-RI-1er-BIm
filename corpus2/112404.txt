I have a multi tenant ASP.NET MVC website and all client specific text is stored in resource files. Every time someone wants to change text I have to jump through hoops and fill out forms and let someone else put it in production. This was fine with 2 clients, but now we have 6 and are looking to roll out to 40+. **I can't spend all day making text changes!** Does anyone have any advice on how to make life eaiser? I was thinking a CMS may not work because as far as i know most CMS's idea of multitenancy is to add an additional independent site. We frequently roll out new features and I fear I'll be in the same boat adding modules and updating 40+ sites. I prefer one site with different text if I can. Any help is most appreciated!
