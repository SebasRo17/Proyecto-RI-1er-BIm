I don't understand why Fibonacci heaps have marked nodes (picture). A node is marked when its child is deleted. Quoting from Wikipedia: "[Keeping degree of each node low] is achieved by the rule that we can cut at most one child of each non-root node. When a second child is cut, the node itself needs to be cut from its parent and becomes the root of a new tree." Why do we need to do that? Why not just leave the node where it is after the second child is cut? The heap structure is not violated. I don't see the point of this optimization.
