How can I programmatically open a palette from the Palettes menu? Is there a Front End token for this? * * * Motivation: Certain settings for the palettes that are installed into standard locations and show up in the Palettes menu are stored in the `"PalettesMenuSettings"` global option (accessible through the Option Inspector or `CurrentValue[$FrontEnd, "PalettesMenuSettings"]`). These settings become active only if the palette is opened through the Palettes menu. If the palette notebook is opened directly (through the operating system's file manager or `File -> Open...`), then these settings do not take effect. Use case: I need to re-open the image uploader palette after it has updated itself. The upload history is stored in the `"PalettesMenuSettings"`.
