I'm trying to write a code where each matrix element swaps with a randomly selected neighbor (cardinal directions only) to redistribute the matrix. So far I've been able to replace an element with its neighbor, making the elements twins, but I want to preserve the relative amount of "-1"s to "1"s. What you see below is what I have currently, which shows how I identify the neighbors of each element, and how I randomize which one switches with it. The output of this process gives me something in the form of `{i,j}`, which means I can't use `Si[[choice]]`, because that would be effectively saying `Si[[{i,j}]]`, which isn't correct syntax. I'm pretty new to Mathematica, so any help would be greatly appreciated! :) Input:               Si = {{-1, -1, -1}, {1, -1, -1}, {-1, 1, -1}};          Off[General::stop];          ii = 3;         jj = 3;          For[i = 1, i <= ii, i++,      For[j = 1, j <= jj, j++,            choices = {{i, Mod[j - 1, ii, 1]}, {Mod[i - 1, ii, 1], j},          {i, Mod[j + 1, ii, 1]}, {Mod[j - 1, ii, 1], j}};(*identifies neighbors*)            choice = choices[[RandomInteger[{1, 4}]]]; (*randomly chooses a neighbor*)            Si[[i, j]] = choice;(****************)            Print[choices];       Print[choice];       Print[Si]       ]      ]      Output:               {{1,3},{3,1},{1,2},{3,1}}          {3,1}          {{{3, 1}, -1, -1}, {1, -1, -1}, {-1, 1, -1}}          {{1,1},{3,2},{1,3},{1,2}}          {1,2}          {{{3, 1}, {1, 2}, -1}, {1, -1, -1}, {-1, 1, -1}},      etc. and so forth. Okay, so if I replace               Si[[i, j]] = choice;      with               Si[[i, j]] = Extract[Si, choice];       I can get the output to have replaced my original element, but I still don't know how to replace the neighbor with the value of the original element then.
