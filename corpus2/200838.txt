I am pretty much unaware about the detailed computing history that surrounds internet but it has always made me think why strict parsing was not chosen when creating HTML. Browsers accept any rubbish you write and try their best to parse it. The process, if I am not wrong, hinders performance, allows people to write insane markup, and also allows the obsolete features browsers support because of legacy reasons. Is there a specific reason for why HTML is not strictly parsed?
