What I want to show is:               Plot3D[       Sum[1000*Subscript[C, i]^2/(1000*Subscript[C, i] - 600)^r, {i, 1, k}],       {k, 1, 30}, {r, 0.1, 1.5}]      And, I want the list of `Subscript[C, i]` to be the elements of the subsets:               Select[Subsets[Range[30], {k}], Total[#] == 30 &]      For example, if `k = 2`, the results of               Select[Subsets[Range[30], {2}], Total[#] == 30 &]      is               {{1, 29}, {2, 28}, {3, 27}, {4, 26}, {5, 25}, {6, 24}, {7, 23}, {8,        22}, {9, 21}, {10, 20}, {11, 19}, {12, 18}, {13, 17}, {14, 16}}      Further, I want to assign `{1, 29}` to C1 and C2 of Sum firstly, and then assign `{2, 28}` to C1 and C2 of Sum secondly, etc. As a result, I will be able to get the graphic I want by `Plot3D`!
