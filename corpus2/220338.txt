In online shops there are areas with complicated rules. For example   * is a product visible in the product catalog   * is a product sold out   * what is the price for the product (Discounts, Promotions, ...) Is it a good idea to have an additional explanation API for each complicated rule? Example: `boolean isProductVisible()` has an additional `String explainIsProductVisible()`? How to make understanding these rules easier? Background: Yesterday I as a software developer had the problem that my standard- testproduct on my local test system was "sold out" and I needed this product to test the order-confirmation page. So I had to debug the `IsProductAvailable` routine to correct the test data before I was able to do the original task "test the order-confirmation page". In order to find out, why my test product was sold out an explanation message would have been helpful. In a similar situation in the price calculation engine I already added log messages like this               double calculateItemPriceForProduct(Product product, int quantity, Cart cart, ...)     {         double cumulatedPrice = 0;         ...         if (quantity > 1) {             Price price = getScalePrice(product, quantity);             if (price != null) {                 cumulatedPrice = price.getValue();                 if (log.isDebugEnabled()) {                     log.debug("calculateItemPriceForProduct("+                         product.getCode()+                         ") using scalePrice " +                          price.getCode() + " for quantity " +                          quantity + ":" + price.getValue());                 }             }         }         ...     }      As a developer I can look into the server log and hopefully find out what happened. If I were a product manager it would be more comfortable to have role-specific tooltips on the webpage that shows the explanation part. Of course these tooltips would not be available for ordinary customers, just for developers and product managers. My questions:   * Are there other ways to make understanding complicated rules easier?   * Is it a good idea to have an additional explanation API for each complicated rule?   * Does such a feature pay off the cost of developing this feature?
