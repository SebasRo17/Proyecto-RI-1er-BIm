> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Using the result of Solve in subsequent calculations   >  extract values from replacement list I am trying to define a variable (`k1`) as the expression that is given as one of the possible solutions from the `Solve` function so that when I have "`k1`" further in the program, it will use the solution from the `Solve` function. Here is the code in question, simplified:                Solve[Eq4==0,k1]           (* {{k1-> 4.3*(2.4+1.4*c2+Sqrt[4.6*c2^2+2.02*c2^4]},{k1->4.3*(2.4+1.4*c2-Sqrt  [4.6*c2^2+2.02*c2^4]} *)      So then I have been typing `k1:=` on the next line and copy-pasting this part in to get:                k1:=4.3*(2.4+1.4*c2+Sqrt[4.6*c2^2+2.02*c2^4      So that I can use it in:               Eq3:=m1*k3+m3*k1+c1*c3-c2^2     Solve[Eq3==0,c2]      To get a value for `c2`. Surely there is a way to avoid copy-pasting? I feel like the . is supposed to come into play, but I don't understand the syntax for it and can't figure out what to search for to use it! Thanks!
