This question is a follow up from this one. It may also be considered a duplicate since I have already asked this question in stackoverflow almost a year ago. For a background on using numbered equations see my post from SO. Since then I had not messed with the question till today. Consider the following:               ExportString[         Cell[             BoxData[                 FormBox[RowBox[{RowBox[{"f", "(", "x", ")"}], " ", "=", " ", "x"}],             TraditionalForm]         ],         "NumberedEquation",         CellTags -> "eq:myEq"         ]         , "HTML",         "FullDocument" -> False,         "ConversionRules" -> {             "NumberedEquation" -> {                 "\\begin{equation}\n", Convert`TeX`BoxesToTeX[#] &,  "\n\\end{equation}"             }         }      ]      The output is:               \begin{equation}     <a id="eq_myEq"></a>     f(x) = x     \end{equation}      Notice how it was able to detect the cell tag using html. But if you were to export it using latex, it just doesn't. What we want is this output when using latex:               \begin{equation}\label{eq:myEq}     f(x) = x     \end{equation}      The question is, how we can use the conversion rules to take advantange of the cell tag.
