I use `Simplify` mostly to make expressions look neat. However, _Mathematica_ often does not produce expression in, what I consider, the optimal way. Look at this: ![Mathematica expression](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nRnjb.png)               FullSimplify[      -((E^(-((t-μ1)^2/(2 σ1^2))) p w1)/(Sqrt[2 π] σ1))+      (E^(-((t-μ1)^2/(2 σ1^2))) p w2)/(Sqrt[2 π] σ1)-      (E^(-((t-μ2)^2/(2 σ2^2))) (1-p) w3)/(Sqrt[2 π] σ2)+      (E^(-((t-μ2)^2/(2 σ2^2))) (1-p) w4)/(Sqrt[2 π] σ2)]      Obviously, I would prefer the `Sqrt[2 Pi]` to appear next to the two `σ`'s. This is just one example of how `Simplify` sometimes does not do what I want. Any general tips?
