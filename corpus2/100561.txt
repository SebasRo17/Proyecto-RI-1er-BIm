As the years progress , I can't help but see how web apps and the cloud is replacing normal computer software. Developers of systems programming languages like C/C++ are going down the hill and PHP / ASP.NET(C#) is rising to the skies (cloud?). Since I am a serious C++ fan and like to develop mostly in C++, I was wondering whether it is prudent to say on this path. Will there be employment for C++ programmers after , say , 10 years? I have seen a lot of unemployed C++ programmers while there are no .NET programmers or Web Developers going downhill. So should I move to the web and/or cloud now, when there is still time, or should I continue going down the C++ path? Will there be enough employment for C++ and other Systems (offline?) Programming Language developers?
