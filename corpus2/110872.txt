I've been studying couple of books of how to exactly implement agile. I am confused about release planning. Our application is a Insurance System consisting of different modules (Quoting, Policy Management, Claims management etc). During the first phase we are just planning to release Quoting and we are estimating approximately 4 months for it. Now my question is, do we have to identify user stories for overall system (including all the other modules) first before start working on our first release (i.e quoting)? Or is release planning is an iterative process too?
