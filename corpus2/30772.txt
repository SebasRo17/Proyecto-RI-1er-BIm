I have a number of lists and want to plot all of them vs each other. E.g.:               l={     {a,2,5,4,6},     {b,4,6,6,2},     {c,2,8,3,5},     {d,1,5,2,5}     }      Now I want multiple plots with a vs b a vs c a vs d b vs c etc. I know there is a function in Mathematica, which does exactly this – because I have used it before. Unfortunately I can't remember the function name and didn't find it in the help menu or here after extensive searching. So I hope someone can remind me of the function name – which I will immediately write down and never forget!
