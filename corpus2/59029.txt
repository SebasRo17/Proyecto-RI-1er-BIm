When I tried to get 3D graphics for molecule CAS52364-73-5 using _Mathematica_ 10 it produced following result               ChemicalData["CAS52364-73-5", "SpaceFillingMoleculePlot"]      > >     Missing["NotAvailable"] >   but it makes a plot for caffeine. How can I get for my compound?               ChemicalData["Caffeine", "SpaceFillingMoleculePlot"]      How can I get a plot for my compound?
