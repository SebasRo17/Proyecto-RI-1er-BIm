m = Table[i - j, {i, 5}, {j, 6}]     n = Table[i - j, {i, 3}, {j, 7}]     o = Table[i^j, {i, 3}, {j, 7}]     Export["mfile2.xls", {"m Data" -> Transpose[m],"n Data" -> Transpose[n]}]      The above code creates a spreadsheet with two sheets named "m-data" and "n-data". Now I would like to be able to add more data to the existing spreadsheet. But when I do this:               Export["mfile2.xls", {"o Data" -> Transpose[o]}]      The earlier data is deleted and now my `mfile2.xls` just has the one sheet names "o-data" containing o-data. Is it possible for me to `Export` data into some particular existing sheet and maybe even a specific cell of some pre-existing excel file and/or maybe get MMA to create a new sheet in addition to the existing ones.
