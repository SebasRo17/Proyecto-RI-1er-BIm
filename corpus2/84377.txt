First I firmly believe in the code review process and always want someone else to review my code. My question really centers around how can I do a better job at performing a code review for someone else? I know that to perform a code review you need to have knowledge of the how the existing code works and a knowledge of what the local standard is, both of which I feel that I know very well. Still I feel like I never do a good enough code review for other people. Also I know that certain people seem to do a better job review code than others so I am wondering for those that are great code reviewers what are the techniques that you use?
