I'm a software developer and have been working at my current employer for almost 2 years. I joined straight out of university, so this is my first real full-time job. I was employed as a junior developer with no real responsibilities. In the last year, I have been given more responsiibility. I am the official contact person at my company for a number of clients. I have represented the company by myself in off-site meetings with clients. My software development role has grown. I now have specialised knowledge in certain tools/products/technologies that no one else here does. My problem is that I am still officially a junior developer, and still earning less than I feel I am worth.   * Am I being taken advantage of?    * How long should I reasonably expect to stay a junior developer before I expect a promotion of some kind?    * What would you do in my situation?
