So, I'm tasked with organizing the code and building a library with all the common code among our products. One thing that seems to happen all the time and I wanted to abstract is posted below in pseudocode, and I don't know how to call it (different products have different domain specific implementations and names for it)               list function idk_what_to_name_it ( list list_of_callbacks, value common_parameter ):        list list_of_results = new list       for_each(callback in list_of_callbacks)         list_of_results.push(callback(common_parameter))       end for_each       return list_of_results     end function      Would you call this specific construct a               list ListOfCallbacks.Map( value value_to_map)       method or would it better be               value Value.apply(list list_of_callbacks)      I'm really curious about this kind of thing. Is there a standard guide for this stuff?
