I have               if (!b && c || a && c)       //do action a     else        //...      Due to some internal relationship between a, b, and c. `!b && c || a && c` **is proved to be equivalent to** `(! a && b) || c`. I just wonder will `(! a && b) || c` be simpler than `!b && c || a && c`? Can you prove it? Assume the chances of a,b,c to be True or False is equal. I'm **not asking which style is better**. **I'm asking which statement has lower computational complexity**. Just like asking quick sort and Bubble Sort, which has lower computational complexity. You will not answer it depends, it is related to compiler and hardware because some hardware have special instruction for Bubble Sort. I hope to hear nlog(n) and n^2.
