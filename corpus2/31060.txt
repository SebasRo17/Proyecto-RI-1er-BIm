Can anyone help me please? I don't want a Histogram; I don't want a BarChart, not even a ListPlot with drop down lines. I want a list plot with drop down columns/bars: please see the link. ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/EQGkc.png) It is basically a histogram but of a different kind. The data structure contains two variables for example in the above figure it was energy and standard deviation. And the frequency distribution was done based on two cut- offs {0.5,2.0} and finally it was plotted along the energy axis. Therefore, it contains overlapping bars/columns.
