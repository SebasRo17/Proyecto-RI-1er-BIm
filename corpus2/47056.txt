Assume the following code (Below code is just an example to clearly illustrate my problem):               Res = {};     Iterations = 5;          Do[     Results = AppendTo[Res, i^2]     , {i, 1, Iterations}];      I have 2 questions:   1. I want to save the results in each iteration in an identical excel file (.xls file). In the end, when the iterations are finished, I will have one Excel file with all the results in it.   2. I tried to make the code more faster and elegant using `Scan[]` , but I failed to do it and I couldn't do that.(It is good to mention that I am just a rookie _Mathematica_ programmer and I don't have much experience in it!). Could you please help me with these poroblems ?
