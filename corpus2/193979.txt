I've been playing around and learning javascript/KineticJS by making some simple games (think like board games). I have the game model that is relatively logically simple. When a "move" is given to my game model, it updates the properties of all the pieces. However, I would like to make the view have some nice-looking animation. For example, when six pieces are taken I don't want them to disappear all at once, I'd rather have them animate out 1 by 1. To solve this problem, I basically have the game model tell my view "I updated the following pieces: [list]" And my view adds them to a "visual update queue" that a timer thread is always checking and handling one by one each time it triggers. I'm interested in any opinions on this approach, and since this has obviously been considered before, if any of you handle this problem differently. Thanks!
