Im new to Socket programming and im building a Socket over TCP-IP system with this architecture: ![system](http://i.stack.imgur.com/N2txX.png) **Server:** Basically a TCPIP Listener that waits for connection from the clients. **Client:** It knows the server Ip and try to connect, when the connection is set i can send commands from another client that acts like the ADMIN. In other words its like a chat system adapted to this use case. Once the client receive the commands form the admin console it pass it to the LED display connected by Serial Port. My question is: If want to remove those clients(Laptop, PC) from the system, and connect directly to the led Display, how can i do it? What happen to the Client logic? Can i send the commands from the server directly to the led display?
