I would like to use Mathematica to help me simplify a given Binary Decision Diagram (i.e. pick the optimal variable ordering). I don't seem to find anything at all on the topic, although it is something everyone with a little CS background knows very well. Given MMA's ability of dealing with graphs and boolean functions the task seems feasible, but I wouldn't want to waste a long time to solve a problem that is already solved. Is anybody aware of MMA resources on the matter?
