How can I programmatically create a CDF which is similar to the CDFs created by `File -> CDF Export -> Standalone...`? `Export` supports CDFs but it does not use the same options as File -> Export... and it does not seem to allow setting the `WindowSize` which I also need. * * * My current solution is the following (ugly):               manip = Manipulate[Plot[k x, {x, 0, 10}], {k, 1, 5}, SaveDefinitions -> True]          Export["file.cdf",        doc = CreateDocument[manip,         ScrollingOptions -> {"VerticalScrollRange" -> Fit},          ShowCellBracket -> False,          Deployed -> True, CellContext -> Notebook,          TrackCellChangeTimes -> False]];          NotebookClose[doc]
