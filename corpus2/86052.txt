I've been reading up on Entity Framework, in particular, EF 4.1 and following this link ( http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/07/16/code-first- development-with-entity-framework-4.aspx) and it's guide on Code First. I find it neat but I was wondering, is Code First supposed to be just a solution for rapid development where you can just jump right in without much planning or is it actually intended to be used for large scale applications?
