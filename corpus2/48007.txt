My goal is to work out on the following equation: $$Mean(P)(1-Mean (P))\left (h + (1 - 2 h) (1 - \frac {Var (P)} {Mean (P) (1 - Mean (P))}) (1 - Mean (P)) + \frac {Var (P)} {Mean (P) (1 - Mean (P))} (1 - h) \right)$$ where $P$ is a sample, $Mean(P)$ is the `Mean` value of the sample $P$: $Mean(P) = 1/n \sum_{i=1}^n p_i$. $Var(P)$ is the `Variance` of the random variable $P$. How can I `Simplify` this kind of equation with _Mathematica_? I thought I could eventually define a sequence of $p_i$ of undefined length and work with it. Is something similar feasible? Here is the _Mathematica_ code:               Mean[P](1-Mean[P])( h + (1-2h)(1-(Variance[P])/(Mean[P](1-Mean[P])))*       (1-Mean[P]) + (Variance[P])/(Mean[P](1-Mean[P])) (1-h))
