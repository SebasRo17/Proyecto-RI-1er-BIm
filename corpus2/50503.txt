I have a weird issue, that cropped up recently: If I type `\[UpArrow]` and hit return, the uparrow is not displayed in the output (it is in the input). Changing the format of the output cell (Tried every option) doesn't affect this; copying and pasting to an input cell and it is displayed again. The version of _Mathematica_ is 9.01 on 64-bit Scientific Linux 6.5 and it seems likely that this happened on updating; there are issues with graphics as well (I now need to do "mathematica -mesa" to show 3-D graphics) Opening notebooks that were run on my work computer generates a huge number of failed assertions, all of which seem to be linked to missing glyphs. Anyone seen this before?
