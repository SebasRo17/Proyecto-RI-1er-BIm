I read on various sites about licenses. I did just put the license type in the header file (in my case a javascript file, open-source):               /*      * "codeName" "version"      * http://officialsite.com/      *      * Copyright 2012 "codeName"      * Released under the "LICENSE NAME" license      * http://officialsite.com/LICENSE NAME      */           javascript code      ...      In the same folder I leave a copy of the license. The listing of the folder looks like this:               * codeName.js     * LICENSE      In the file `LICENSE` is the full text of the license my code uses. What I cannot find anywhere that says is this is enough to say _my code is licensed_ (the case of open-source). Is something more required?
