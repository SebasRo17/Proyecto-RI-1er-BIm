Based on previous posts about plotting two y axes on the same x axis, I wrote this function:               plotyy[x_, y1_, y2_] := Module[{xy1, xy2, p1, p2},       xy1 = Table[{x[[i]], y1[[i]]}, {i, Length[x]}];       xy2 = Table[{x[[i]], y2[[i]]}, {i, Length[x]}];       p1 = ListLinePlot[xy1, ImagePadding -> 25,          Frame -> {True, True, False, False}, Axes -> False];       p2 = ListLinePlot[xy2, ImagePadding -> 25, Axes -> False,          Frame -> {False, False, False, True},          FrameTicks -> {None, None, None, All}, PlotStyle -> Red];       Rasterize[Overlay[{p1, p2}], RasterSize -> 600, ImageSize -> 600]]      which takes three lists with the same length and plots y1 and y2 on x. I've values for image quality by `RasterSize` and `ImageSize` for using the plot in my report but for different plots it may need different values for those two options. How can I can set the optimum values for `RasterSize` and `ImageSize` in my function? Thanks, Amin.
