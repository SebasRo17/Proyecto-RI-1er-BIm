I have a problem of trying to store some output in an external file. In one note book I define a function `f[x_]:=AdvancedCalculation`, where this function generates a relatively large output and is dependent on a significant number of definitions. In another notebook, I would like to have the expression `terms=f[x]`, but I do not want to actually calculate `f[x]` more than once because it would take too long. Currently I have stored the output of `f[x]` in a file called `Terms.m` that has a single line of code.               terms=OutputFromOtherNotebook      I then load this file in my second notebook using the command `<<Terms.m`. My current solution is to copy and paste `OutputFromOtherNotebook` directly from the first notebook into the file `Terms.m`. I would like to automate this process because larger outputs have become too cumbersome. I am trying to use `Put` to write the output using the following line of code.               terms=Evaluate[f[x]]>>Terms.m      However, I cannot find the resulting file. Where does the function `Put` create the file? As a side issue, how can I ensure that `f[x]` is evaluated before being written to the external file?
