DDD promotes rich domain models with behavior in it, POCO naked objects without any objects in it. **Is it possible to have them both combined?** I have a Multi Layer Solution   * Core - has POCO Entieties, interfaces for Repositories and Services   * Data - Repository implementations   * Service - Service Implementations   * Infra - IoC Locator/registrar, viewmodels, (could be merged to webui)    * WebUI - asp.net mvc presentation layer I was saying that I use DDD but recently I've been told that I'm not because my Entities don't have behavior, **is this true?**
