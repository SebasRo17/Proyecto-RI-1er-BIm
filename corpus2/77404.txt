For a programmer/cs student that wishes to dive into web development and freelancing... what are some good books/publications/portals/blogs? Please take into consideration also that I'm used to developing websites by googling my each step to find an example. I'm interested in technologies like php, javascript, jquery, ajax.. And maybe later: ruby and ror. It would be great if there would exist a book (or a collection of books) on web development that would cover the whole process of development, plus different techniques, principles, examples.. etc.
