I need to add custom (vertical) grid lines to a plot (to a `DateListPlot`, to be precise). I know there is the option of `GridLines -> {xgrid, ygrid}`. However, this removes the automatic grid lines which I would like to keep. Is there a simple option to add _additional_ grid lines to the automatic ones? Thank you! * * * **Update:** Added a minimal working example. Take the following `DateListPlot`               DateListPlot[RandomReal[1, 20], {2000}, Joined -> True]      ![automatic grid lines](http://imgur.com/1SUSWgr.png) It automatically includes vertical grid lines for each year in grey, which I would like to keep. But let's say I'd like to add a grid line for Guy Fawkes Day 2007, e.g. because I need to later label the event in the plot. I could write                DateListPlot[RandomReal[1, 20], {2000}, Joined -> True,                   GridLines -> {{"5 Nov 2007"}, None}]      ![custom grid lines](http://imgur.com/SZRkVus.png) but this removes the yearly lines. So I was wondering whether it is possible to _add_ the custom grid lines to the automatic ones rather than to overwrite the latter. Of course, I could manually re-add the annual grid lines, but I hope to avoid this solution because the plots will have different date ranges so I do not always know for which years I'd need to include the lines.
