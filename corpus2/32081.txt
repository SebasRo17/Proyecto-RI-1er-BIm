There are several answers where _Mathematica_ used mesh points to show graphically where curve intersections exist. For example: Marking points of intersection between two curves or Is there a better way to get the eight points of intersection? Is there a way to include the actual point values (maybe they are simply labeled as `a`, `b`, `c` ...) and then the actual value is displayed on the right of the graphic? Here is the specific example I am working.               Plot[{Cos[x],(1/2)^x},{x,-1,11},      PlotPoints->84,      MaxRecursion->9,      MeshFunctions->{Cos[#1]-(1/2)^#1&},      Mesh->{{0}},      MeshStyle->Directive[Red,PointSize[Large]]]
