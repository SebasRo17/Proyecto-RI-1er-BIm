I'm reading _Coders at Work_ by Peter Seibel, and many a time it has been mentioned that programmers who can't write generally make poor programmers - it's been claimed by Douglas Crockford, Joshua Bloch, Joe Armstrong, Dijkstra (and I've only read half the book). What's your view of this? Is an inability to express yourself in writing in a natural language such as English a hindrance of writing good code?
