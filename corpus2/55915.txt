I try to use this simple algorithm (paper) to calculate the Eccentric Anomaly expansion:               a[0]=0;     Do [     t1 = 1-a[k-1]^2/2+a[k-1]^4/24;     t2 = a[k-1]-a[k-1]^3/6;     a[k]=Expand[e*Sin[u]*t1+e*Cos[u]*t2,Trig->True];     Simplify[a[k]];     TeXForm[a[k]] >>"tex.01";     Print [a[k],k], {k,2}]      The result should be this one ![from Paper](http://i.stack.imgur.com/lOQQR.png) but maybe because the algorithm is write with an old version of Mathematica I have as an output this different (in terms of trigonometric function) ![result](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nB7As.gif) How can I re-arrange it to have the one in the paper? And when I have the result of the paper is it possible, then, to regroup the equation in terms of power series of sin(u), something like that: ![equation](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZMwBM.gif) Thanks a lot !
