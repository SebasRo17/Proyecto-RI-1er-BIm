I am currently working on implementing a web shop on my site to sell some software products. This web shop needs a customer and a product database so it can give licenses to users. It would be time consuming for me to implement this user, product and license management system from the scratch so I am asking, for those who have experience with this kind of stuff, what are considered to be the best out of the box products? EDIT Here are some additional details. All of the software is developed in house, so source code integration is possible but this part is already present. Software will check for a valid licence etc. I already have a code that will generate licenses. I am asking about the "server side" of the problem. Let mi clear that up. There are two kinds of software being sold:   1. Desktop applications - User goes to the web shop, enters credit card data and buys an licence for one of these applications. Then user enters the license and application works.   2. Web based applications - User goes to the web shop also enters credit card data and then user gets an username and password so he can login to the web application and use it. I need a central database of all the buyers and all the licenses that they bought. So is there any system (in form of a web application) that can manage buyers in that way and provide a API for a web shop (or any other application) to query the database, add new buyers, add new licenses ...
