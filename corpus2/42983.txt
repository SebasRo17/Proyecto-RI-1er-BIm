Reading the brouhaha surrounding Reflector going paid got me thinking about the product and its uses. Many people seem to consider it an essential tool. I have to admit, I haven't used Reflector in years. I mean, there's documentation for both the .Net APIs and the third party components I use. In the past, whenever a colleague pulled Reflector out of his tool belt, I got the sense he was headed into the weeds. Reading all the passion around Reflector is leading me to question if I'm really missing something here. Why do you need something like Reflector so often that you consider it an essential tool? I can see it being needed on very rare occasions, but not enough to be considered an essential tool. Please enlighten me.
