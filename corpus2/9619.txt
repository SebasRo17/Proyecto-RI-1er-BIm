In the documentation for fold, it says                   Fold[f,x,list] gives the last element of FoldList[f,x,list].      But this is surely not the way it is implemented, right? In those cases where each step of the `Fold` returns a large object, it would be a huge waste of memory to actually store the whole list and then just pick the last element at the end. How can I test this? Does `Trace` work as advertised, or does it skip printing intermediate steps sometimes?
