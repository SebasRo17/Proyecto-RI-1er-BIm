Normally, when using `Manipulate[expr, controls, options]`, the graphics updating should be carried out at the very end of expr. But now I encounter a situation where the graphics result is evaluated at each step inside a double-`Fold`-iteration. Yes I can still adopt the method mentioned above and write following code,               DynamicModule[{g},      Manipulate[       Module[{a},        Fold[(           k = #2;           Fold[(a = #2; g = v[a, k]; Pause[.05]) &, {}, Range[5]]          ) &, {}, Range[15]];        Dynamic@g       ],      {{k, 1}, ControlType -> None},      TrackedSymbols :> {},      SynchronousUpdating -> Automatic,      Initialization :> (v[a_, k_] := Plot[Sin[x (a + k x)], {x, 0, 6}])]     ]      But the problem is that I will have to first wait for the double-`Fold`-evaluation to complete and only after this can I see the updates in a queued sequence. The code I used here is but an over-simplified example and the actual code will take much longer time for computation. I wonder if it is possible to do the graphics updating at every iteration step when `v[a, k]` is evaluated?
