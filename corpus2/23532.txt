I'm trying to create a BarChart on which images are the labels of each bar. A Minimal example of what I'm trying to do:               image1 = Import["test1.png"];     image2 = Import["test2.png"];     image3 = Import["test3.png"];     BarChart[{0.4, 0.2, 0.8}, ChartLabels -> {image1, image2, image3}]      The problem is the position of the image on the label. The image is not resized to fit within the Bar width, and so it fills a great part of the plot. Another problem is that the image is not centered: the bottom left corner of it is on the label's expected position, and not the center of it. Any ideas how I can solve this? EDIT: as example of an image, wikipedia's picture of the day:               image1=image2=image3=Import["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Cabiria_1914_poster_restored.jpg/401px-Cabiria_1914_poster_restored.jpg"]      works for the problem in hands. (Thanks J.M. for pointing out)
