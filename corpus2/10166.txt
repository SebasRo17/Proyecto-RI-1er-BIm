20% time it's the culture of an employer allowing it's employees to spend 20% of their time working on projects that they find interesting - it may be inventing a new app, or improving an existing process, etc. Some people _may_ know this as skunk work, however that term may not mean anything (or something entirely different) to you. There are many documented cases of great products being born out of 20%/skunk work at a company. It seems like a win/win situation; the company potentially gain a great new product or application, and the developer has the opportunity to flex his/her creative muscles and innovate. I tried on numerous occasions to introduce some form of 20%/Skunk working at my previous employer with no success. How can I better justify it to management? What's the "right" way to approach this kind of work arrangement?
