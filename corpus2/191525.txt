I read in one of the article "45 minutes of coding and 15 min of resting". I started implementing this, Initially for smaller task, I felt very nice, but as tricky and complicated tasks came,I was not able to finish the task in 45 min and it started putting pressure upon me and I stressed out. what would you suggest me on this strategy, Is this good one to apply? or are there any other good ones?
