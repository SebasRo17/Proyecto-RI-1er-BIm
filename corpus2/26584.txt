It seems that there is a lot of interest in enhancing the use of units in Mathematica; various solutions in the name of brevity, correctness, and general utility have been demonstrated. I've begun treating unit conversions in a very simple manner as listed below. My question: what problems might I run into making conversions in this manner? (It saves a little typing and seems somewhat easier to read to me, at the expense of defining "in" and "to" aliases.) (Mathematica v.9.0.1.0)               in = Quantity; to = UnitConvert;          Express x "in" feet:            x = 100.0~in~"Feet"          100. ft          Convert "to" yards:          x~to~"Yards"          33.3333 yd          Convert to SI units:          x // to          30.48 m          "One stop shop" conversion:          x = 1.0~in~"kg"~to~"lb"          2.20462 lb
