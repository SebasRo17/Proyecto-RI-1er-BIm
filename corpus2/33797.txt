While looking into building a simulation for an ant colony, I started encountering some memory leakage issues.                ymax = 1000; xmax = 1000;      nest = {500, 500};      maxAnts = 30;      steps = 200;      maxSpeed = 20;      maxAngle = π/6;           orientation =         RandomVariate[UniformDistribution[{0, 2 π}], maxAnts];     ant = Table[        agent[∞, nest, orientation[[i]], #] & /@ Range[i], {i,          maxAnts}];          update[agent[symbol_, location_, direction_, t_]] :=      Module[{dir, speed, loc},        dir = First@         RandomVariate[          UniformDistribution[{direction - maxAngle,             direction + maxAngle}], 1];        speed = RandomVariate[UniformDistribution[{1, maxSpeed}], 1];       loc = Flatten[location + Round[{speed*Cos[dir], speed*Sin[dir]}]];       loc = Min[#] & /@ Transpose[{loc, {xmax, ymax}}];       loc = Max[#] & /@ Transpose[{loc, {0, 0}}];       agent[symbol, loc, dir, t + 1]]          display[agent[symbol_, location_, direction_, t_]] :=      Text[Rotate[symbol, direction], location]     display[list_] := Module[{lst = display[#] & /@ list}, Graphics[lst]]          history =        Join[ant[[#]],           NestList[update, Last@ant[[#]], steps - Length[ant[[#]]]]] & /@         Range[maxAnts];          Animate[Show[Graphics[display[history[[All, i]]]],        Graphics[{Red, PointSize[Large], Point[nest]}],        PlotRange -> {{0, xmax}, {0, ymax}}], {i, 1, steps, 1}]      ![Animation](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XfjZd.gif) The issue I have is that Mathematica seems to have a memory leak, as the Animate, or manipulate, or exporting to gif runs, the amount of memory allocated to Mathematica keeps growing until it just stops working. Below is a gif in which I turn the animation on and off to show that the memory keeps growing as Animate (or Manipulate) runs. A bummer because this limits the number of ants and steps to use. ![Memory Leakage](http://i.stack.imgur.com/NZJm4.gif)
