It seems there are a lot of related topics but I haven't found an answer. I want to automatically quit _Mathematica_ after some procedures are done but dialog window appears:               1 + 1;     NotebookSave[EvaluationNotebook[]];     FrontEndExecute[FrontEndToken["FrontEndQuit"]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/mTJcI.png) One can put this inside `Button`               Button["close",             1 + 1; NotebookSave[EvaluationNotebook[]];             FrontEndExecute[FrontEndToken["FrontEndQuit"]]           ]      what will work but I need it works as a part of procedure because the notebook is called automatically and no one is going to click OK. This Q&A is almost a duplicate of undisputed FrontEndTokenExecute but there was the work around. **I appreciate a work around but also the general question, how to stop or automatically agree with`Dialogs` is what I'm interested in.** Maybe it's relevant: Win XP/Win 7 _Mathematica_ V9.0.0.1
