> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  I don't know C. And why should I learn it? My goal is to be able to create online apps and dynamic, database driven websites. For instance, if in the future I get the idea for the next Digg or Facebook, I want to be able to code it myself. To arrive there I think I have basically two paths: ### Path 1 Start at a basic level, learning C, then C++ for OOP, then algorithms and data structures, with the goal of getting a solid grasp of computer programming. Only then move to PHP/MySQL/HTTP and start working on practical programming projects. ### Path 2 Start directly with PHP/MySQL/HTTP and getting my hands dirty with practical projects right away. What would you guys recommend?
