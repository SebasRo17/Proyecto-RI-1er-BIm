> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Importance of learning to google efficiently for a programmer? Avoiding lengthy discussions, as a senior level student in CS, how can I get away from Googling problems I run into? I find myself using it too much; I seemingly reach for the instant answer and then blindly copy and paste code, hoping it works. Anyone can do that. I've read the related threads about being a better programmer, but mostly those recommend practicing on pet projects, which I have done, but again I feel EVERY wall encountered, from design through completion, was hurdled with Google. Do professionals instantly "research" their problem? Or do you guys step back and try and figure it out yourselves? I'm talking about both 'algorithm/design' problems as well as compiler issues.
