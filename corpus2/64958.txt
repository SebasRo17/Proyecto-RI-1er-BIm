Is there any place on the web where can I join a team when they are just starting their project? Is there any place where developers can make groups for projects? I know there are some /dev/forums where you can have luck to find something interesting in some topic ... but the chances there are really low. I know that you can find some projects on CodePlex or GitHub but they will be already started projects and it's not so easy to understand and join it ... I want to find some place where new ideas comes to new teams. So ... maybe starting project must already have a good base, but not to big base and then project leader must Promote it and find developers who like the idea ? Sometimes that is really hard to catch such promotions.
