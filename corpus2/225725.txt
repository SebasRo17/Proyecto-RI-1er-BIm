I'm trying to find the best way to process about 20,000 lines of a statute in text format into HTML so that it can be displayed and manipulated in a granular fashion, i.e. by clause. The format is essentially a nested list like (a)(1)(A)(i)(II)(aa) and is fairly consistent. Each clause begins with a new line and is enclosed in parenthesis like above. The goal is for each clause to be enclosed in a paragraph tag with a unique id like p id="sec101a1AiI" (sorry I can't figure out the code formatting). The point is to be able to refer to a specific clause later on. I've played with regular expressions but they don't seem to allow me to iterate through the entire statute and tag things in a unique fashion. I'm sure there are better options using a custom script but I don't know where to start looking for that. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
