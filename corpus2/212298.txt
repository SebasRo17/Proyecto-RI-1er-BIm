I was reading the following article: Polynomial interpolation of GPS satellite coordinates, Milan Horemuz and Johan Vium Andersson 2006 and it states the following: "The estimation procedure of the ai coefficients is done with the Matlab function polyfit, which estimates the coefficients in a least squares sense. **To improve the numerical precision, the dataset p is normalized** by centering it at a zero mean; by subtracting its mean value p; and scaling it to a unit standard deviation by dividing each observation with the standard deviation Ïƒp as follows..." My question is how does the value normalization improves the numerical precision of computational operations?
