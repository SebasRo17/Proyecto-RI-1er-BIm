I want to mimic the below image type using Mathematica's `BarChart3D` function. For this purpose I wrote the following code but it isn't working. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/P1SIa.png)               BarChart3D[{1, 2, 3},        ImageSize->{550,250},LabelingFunction -> Above,         ChartLabels -> Placed[barChartLabels, Below], BarSpacing -> 1,         ChartStyle -> Green,         ChartElements -> (Graphics3D[{Purple, Glow[Purple], EdgeForm[Purple],                           Cuboid[]}, Boxed -> False]),         LabelStyle -> {Directive[Bold, 15], Directive[Bold, 15]}     ]
