In a recent question I posed, it was noted that by design, Sqrt[ blah] only returns the positive branch, even though we might want to obtain all possible symbolic solutions. So, taking care to avoid the Sqrt function here in my input :), suppose I am interested to find the intervals that, when squared, generate the Interval[{0,4}]:               Solve[Interval[{0, 4}] == y^2, y]      This returns:               {{y -> Interval[{-2, 0}]}, {y -> Interval[{0, 2}]}}      How should we then obtain the missing solution:               expr = Interval[{-2, 2}];  expr^2     Interval[{0, 4}]      â€¦ that nests all others? [P.S. I suppose a Union applied to the output might do the trick, but I'm not sure a trick is the real point to the question.]
