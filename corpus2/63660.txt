I never understood why C and C++ compilers try to recover from errors and continue parsing. Almost always, the first error generates a stream of bogus errors that will disappear as soon as the first one is fixed. After several years of experience, I simply stopped looking at any error except the first one of every file. I rerun the compiler and then do that again until there is no more errors. Is it a common practice?
