I am required to computed following Expectations : $E[\displaystyle\sum\limits_{i=1}^N \frac{X_{i}}{N}] = \bar{x}_{0}$ & $E[\displaystyle(\sum\limits_{i=1}^N \frac{X_{i}}{N})^2] = \frac{(N\bar{x}_{0}^2 + \sigma_{x}^2)}{N}$ with $ X_{i} \sim N(\bar{x}_{0},\sigma_{x}^2) \forall i = 1,2,\cdots,N$ & $X_{i} \bot X_{j} \forall i\not=j$ I'm looking to solve these expectation in symbolic as all these variable are unknown. Thanks for your help Alexandre
