I'm sure this has been addressed before, but I can't find it! I want _Mathematica_ to simplify               Sqrt[1 - Sin[π/6 - θ]^2]      to               Cos[π/6 - θ]      Just as               PowerExpand[FullSimplify[Sqrt[1 - Sin[θ]^2]]]      Does what you would expect. Maybe the polite question would be how to transform               Sqrt[1 - Sin[π/6 - θ]^2]      to               Sqrt[Cos[π/6 - θ]^2]
