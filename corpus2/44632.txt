I was just wondering what makes PHP work faster. I have a few methods that I always go and do, but that only improves the way I can read it, but how about the interpreter? ### Should I include the curly braces when there is only one statement to run?               if(...){         echo "test";     }     # Or..     if(...)         echo "test";     === Which should be used?      ### I have also found http://beta.phpformatter.com/, and I find the following settings to be good, but are they? > ### Indentation: > > Indentation style: `{K&R (One true brace style)}`   >  Indent with: `{Tabs}`   >  Starting indentation: `[1]`   >  Indentation: `[1]` > > ### Common: > > `[x]` Remove all comments   >  `[x]` Remove empty lines   >  `[x]` Align assignments statements nicely   >  `[ ]` Put a comment with the condition after if, while, for, foreach, > declare and catch statements > > ### Improvement: > > `[x]` Remove lines with just a semicolon (;)   >  `[x]` Make normal comments (//) from perl comments (#)   >  `[x]` Make long opening tag (<?php) from short one (<?) > > ### Brackets: > > `[x]` Space inside brackets`- ( )`   >  `[x]` Space inside empty brackets`- ( )`   >  `[x]` Space inside block brackets`- [ ]`   >  `[x]` Space inside empty block brackets`- [ ]` ### Tiny var names: often I go through my code and change `$var1` to `$a`, `$var2` to $b and so on. I do include comments at the start of the file to show to me what each letter(s) mean.. ### Final note: So am I doing the right thing with the curly braces and the settings?   Are there any great tips that help it run faster?
