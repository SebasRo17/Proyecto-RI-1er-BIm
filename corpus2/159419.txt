I bought "Beginning C++ Through Game Programming" yesterday to start learning about C++ and programming. I'm going on hour 33, and I can't seem to put this book down. I was talking to a friend who's more experienced, and he suggested that I should now spend my time learning about algorithm design and data structures because languages come and go but in depth knowledge of theory (as in not just knowing about all the different types of algorithms, but being able to create my own) will be everlasting and more beneficial. I guess what I'm asking is this: Should I focus more on learning more C++ and buying more books or should I instead buy a book on algorithms and focus more on that? (Yes, I know I can do both and I plan to, but I'm asking which should receive more attention) P.S. - I've been looking into Financial Engineering for college and apparently C++ is the dominant language, but as my friend said, "languages come and go" so would I be wasting my time by trying to master C++?
