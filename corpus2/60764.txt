I found myself in a pickle after writing some specs for freelance programmers that I hire. It seems that I'm missing some basic structure and I'm not placing the points in clear enough view for the programmer to understand. Any advice that would help me convey the specs better to an average Java developer would be very helpful. **For example:** * * * I have spring project that is very complex at this point. And I'm hiring people to integrated all sorts of payment, social and authentication APIs. (it is the site in my profile if you want to have visual example) As far as they are concerned they will be working only with small segment of the project so no need for the big picture. I require first sample application that will perform what I need outside of the spring container. Than I have the developer integrate the logic into existing system. In specs I usually traverse the input from UI to the the database, with little examples here and there. What I found is helpful to just make draft of the specs and have the developer put his input in it and then adjust the specs after. * * *
