Is it possible to figure out in what file a certain packaged symbol lives in (assuming there is no shadowing between multiple identical symbol names)? I would like to have a function that if, given a context or a symbol from a context, opens up the relevant package file. With `Needs` _Mathematica_ automatically loads all symbols in each package file of the given context if directories are set correctly with `$Path`. It seems though that I cannot access the information **from which file** _Mathematica_ pulls each symbol. It is an overkill to scan through all directories in `$Path` and through all files in each directory to find the given symbol. Is there an easier method?
