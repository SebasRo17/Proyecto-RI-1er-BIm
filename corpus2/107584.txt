I'm a teen who has been programming for about 3 years, I can do some basic Software and so, but I feel I can't do all by myself. What can I do to find people interested in Programming ? None of my friends does, I only have a Cousin which is studying Software Engineering, but he is in another country. I live in Spain, so It's more difficult that in USA.
