I am dealing sparse matrices of very large dimensions. I need to locate the positive and negative elements of the matrices and make lists of their corresponding positions. Of course I can write a program which scans every element and gives the output. But is it possible to do it in a neater way? for instance, to make a list of `1`'s, I used `Position[S,1]`, but in future I need to get a list of positions of all entries which are `>0` for example. As suggested, I am giving an example of one of the smallest lists. For instance, I want to make a list of positions of elements which are `>0`.               S={{1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0},        {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},              {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},        {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},        {1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0},        {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},        {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},        {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},        {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},        {-1,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0},               {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},               {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},        {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},        {-1,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0},              {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},               {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},        {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},        {-1,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0},        {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1},        {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},        {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},        {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},                 {-1,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,-1,0,0,0,-1,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1},        {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},        {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},        {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},        {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1}};
