I have been an Eclipse user as long as I can remember, and have always been happy with what it has offered. As you know, Idea is now free, and one of my main excuses for not using Idea has been "I'm sure it's very very good, but Eclipse is free and it's easily good enough for what I need". So, now that Idea is free, in order to try it out I decided to start a new Play Framework project, and instead of typing `play eclipsify` I typed `play idealize`, and followed the steps to import the project into Idea. This worked fine, and at some point along the way I was given the opportunity to choose my key layout mappings, so I chose Eclipse. I have made lots of progress, and am really impressed with Idea's superior refactoring and variable name suggestion. However, at the same time, I am missing some key features of Eclipse that I would be astonished not to find in Idea:   * In Eclipse, I can type `CTRL`+`Shift`+`O` to organise imports. All the imports are sorted out for me, and for anything ambiguous it asks. In Idea I seem to need to move to any ambiguous ones with the cursor and hit `Alt`+`Enter` for each one so that I can choose which import to do.   * On methods with misspelled names, incorrect signatures, etc, in Eclipse I can hit `CTRL`+`1` and a dropdown gives me suggestions. I don't seem to be able to do this in Idea.   * `CTRL`+`O` gives me the quick outline, which is a nice popup showing the current class's high-level outline. I don't seem to be able to do this in Idea.   * `CTRL`+`Shift`+`T` in Eclipse brings up a dialog to type the name of a class to open. More often than not, Idea seems to stop responding at this point, and I have to, at the very least, move focus away and back again in order to get it to start responding again.   * how on earth do I expand a collapsed import statement without resorting to the mouse? In Eclipse I would just move the cursor to it and hit enter. In Idea the best I can do is a `CTRL`+`D` and then `CTRL`+`Shift`+`O` :) I'm guessing that these are features that I've just not found beceause Idea's keyboard mapping is not a 1:1 match with Eclipse's, or that the functionality can't be perfectly matched to a specific hotkey combination because Idea goes further in what it offers. The problem where Idea stops responding seems more like a bug to me. I really really want my 'relationship' with Idea to work out, I can 'feel' it is a very very good IDE, but these little niggles are getting in my way. Is the latest free release buggy, or have I just not given myself enough time to change my habits and expectations compared with Eclipse (I've only been using it for a week or so)?
