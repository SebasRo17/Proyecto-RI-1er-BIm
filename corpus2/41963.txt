I have a plot that includes a `Region Plot`. I want to make a rectangle with the same shading as in the region plot to show as a legend. The dumb way I can think off is to make another region plot over a small rectangular space and show that as a legend, but that does not seem like a great idea considering I might want to change the plots. Any better suggestions? For practice, I want to label the following example:               RegionPlot[x^2 + y^3 < 2, {x, -2, 2}, {y, -2, 2},        MeshFunctions -> {(2 #1 - #2) &, (2 #1 - #2) &}, Mesh -> 100]
