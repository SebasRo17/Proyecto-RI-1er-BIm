I've created a notebook for use in an in-class presentation. There is a fair amount of MMA code, and my students know nothing about MMA nor do they need to. I don't want to distract them with the code. I understand how to collapse the input cells and show only the output, but the input cells expand whenever I evaluate the notebook so I'm back to where I started. This notebook is meant to be interactive, so it has to be evaluated whenever I change the input. In this case, I have an InputField that requests a ticker symbol and then the code uses FinancialData to get the data and from that creates the results. I've tried creating a slideshow, but that has the same behavior. I've looked at the resources and answer in "Best way to give presentations with Mathematica" without finding any mention of this issue. So, in MMA 8.04 is there any way to force the input cells to stay hidden after the notebook is evaluated? Surely, there must be an option for this somewhere.
