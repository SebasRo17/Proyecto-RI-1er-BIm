I have two codes to find the integer numbers $m$, $x$, $y$, $z$ in the system of equations. First code               Solve[{( m  x +   y - 7 z)^2 ==         Cos[\[Pi]/3]^2*(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)*(m^2 + 1^2 + 7^2), -10 <= m <=         10, -10 <= x <= 10, -10 <= y <= 10, -10 <= z <= 10}, {m, x, y,        z}, Integers]      Second code               Clear[a, b];     a = {m, 1, -7};     b = {x, y, z};     Solve[{Abs[a . b]/(Norm[a] Norm[b]) == Cos[\[Pi]/6], 0 <= m <= 10,        0 <= x <= 10, 0 <= y <= 10, 0 <= z <= 10}, {m, x, y, z}, Integers]      The first code run faster the second code. I can not get the answer of the second code. How to edit the second code? How do I tell _Mathematica_ to do that?
