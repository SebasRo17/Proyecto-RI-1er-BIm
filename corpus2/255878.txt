In an answer to a previous question, a small debate started about correct terminology for certain constructs. As I did not find a question (other than this or that, which is not quite the right thing) to address this clearly, I am making this new one. The questionable terms and their relationships are: _type, type constructor, type parameter, kinds or sorts, and values_. I also checked wikipedia for type theory, but that didn't clarify it much either. So for the sake of having a good reference answer and to check my own understanding:   * How are these things defined properly?   * What is the difference between each of these things?   * How are they related to each other?
