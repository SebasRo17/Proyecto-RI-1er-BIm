I'm sorry but I'm not sure how to phrase this question well. Frequently I have a function that produces and returns a Plot[] or array of Plot[]'s, which I can then display with Show[], or combine with Plot[]'s from another function and then use Show[]. Normally to tell which curve is which on a graph with many curves, you have a legend. Except here, the function produced an arbitrary number of plots, and also I maybe later want to combine them with other Plot[]'s in Show[], so they all have the same color in the legend. Is there a way to make Show[] give them different colors so I can tell them apart? I can think of some very contrived ways to do this (make some sort of global variable that keeps track of how many plots have been created, and uses this as a counter to change the color to be used for the next plot), but they're very ugly and I imagine there must be a better way in elegant MM. Does anyone know of one? Thank you! Edit: An example of the code:               (*Creates and returns a plot.*)     PlotSomething[freq0_] := (     Plot[Sin[freq0*x], {x,0,3.14}])          (*Call the above plotting function several times, create and return an array of Plots.*)     MakePlotArray[numplots_] := (     plottable = {};For[i = 1, i <= numplots, i++,     AppendTo[plottable, PlotSomething[i]];     ];     Return[plottable];)          (*How can I make these plots have different colors and labels?*)     Show[MakePlotArray[5]]
