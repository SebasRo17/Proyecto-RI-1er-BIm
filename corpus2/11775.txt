I have three`PopupMenu` and they work in such a way that second `PopupMenu` value depends on the value selected by the first `PopupMenu` and third `PopupMenu` value depends on the second `PopupMenu` value being selected. If first `PopupMenu` has two option a and b. Then second `PopupMenu` should have c,d,e if a is selected and f when b is selected. And if c is selected from second `PopupMenu` then third `PopupMenu` should have g,h and so on. These options are imported from Excel files. I wanted this to be dynamic; if someone makes any change to this file, then it should work accordingly. At the starting time, all three `PopupMenu` should show Popup1, Popup2, Popup3 as the name of `PopupMenu` and the selected value should be shown in its title name from White color and all `PopupMenu` background is black.
