I'm in a little need of names clarification. First a brief description of my position. I prepare as debutant giving a junior developer job descriptions, which also provided another perspective on how important communication is, and to put it beyond doubt. Simply; I like to understand what he mean with "Context" and I like to give a adopted description of what a POCO is. Now, this is not the exactly problematic words. We haven't even spoken yet. I describe it more as the semantic problem and focus on data and IoC, because there is the place we're going to met (He = GUI, I'm BL). I give a manual-typed sample just as a reference for naming different part of it. Some terms are local to a Manufacturer or tool and some are used more Generic, which I prefer the latter.               // Poco, Model?     public class Customer     {         public int CustomerId { get; set; }         public string Name { get; set; }     }               // A short sign of repository pattern     public class CustomerContext     {             // Is this a context or even a entity?         List<Customer> cust;        public CustomerContext()        {           cust = new List<Customer>();           cust.Add(new Customer() { CustomerId = 1, Name = "Doe" });           cust.Add(new Customer() { CustomerId = 2, Name = "John" });           cust.Add(new Customer() { CustomerId = 3, Name = "Zelda" });           cust.Add(new Customer() { CustomerId = 4, Name = "Kim" });        }             public IQueryable<Customer> Get()        {           return cust;        }     }      * _What terms fit best? *_ Are 'Customer' a Model (tooked from MVC)? Does we, simply put, mean the same with POCO? What do I call the sample typed data above? Mocks? Simply "Data"? What do I call the object CustomerContext? A repository? A Context? Is it an Entity? Are there other terms that have escaped this scope? It appears common to write about repositories and generics, even though fell into a scope of a manufacturer (where i.e. 'Entity' commonly means Entity Framework). A strong indication of what terms means what (and when), would be of help.
