If a server certificate is published to Github, a la:               -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----      is that necessarily a bad thing? Is there ever a legitimate reason to do this? I ask because of a recent wave of attention Github has gotten since allowing users to search for certain things as `.ssh/id.rsa` and the like in public repositories. Also, server certificates are involved in the `https` protocol, but honestly I'm having trouble determining if they are generally regarded as sensitive information.
