Can I sell a closed source commercial product inside a virtualbox VM? This is extremely useful when you want to deliver server side software to users, and not mess in with different OS's (windows/osx). By reading some of the answers here in programmers, I get that it should not be a problem since my software does not link a GPL library, and that's practically the biggest concern of GPL FOSS. So, if I use GPL software just **bundled** with Closed source software that's fine?
