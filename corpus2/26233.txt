To address circular symmetric cases of 2D Fourier Transformations the so called Hankel Transform can be applied (for a detailed derivation of the relation between the 2D Fourier transform and the 1D Hankel transform see Link). For more complex or numerically tabulated radial functions, a numeric implementation of the Hankel transform (similiar to FFT) would come in handy.There has been an interesting proposal by Oppenheim from 1980 (full text is available on the Web), which explains the use of the highly optimized FFT algorithm to do the Hankel transform. Is anybody aware of such an implementation of the Hankel transform in Mathematica?
