I am trying to color a `BSplineSurface` in a complex way but not having any luck using `ColorFunction`. I can use `ColorFunction` if I using `BSplineFunction` and `ParametricPlot3D` but would prefer not to go that route. Here is an example of the surface I would like to color:               Graphics3D[{EdgeForm[], SeedRandom[4];       BSplineSurface[Table[{x, y, 0.25 + UnitStep[30 - Abs[x] - 0.001] UnitStep[50 -Abs[y] - 0.001] (0.25/RandomReal[{0.1, 2}]^2)},        {x, -30, 30, 5.}, {y, -50, 50, 5.}]]}, Boxed -> False]      I would like to be able to color the peaks with one color (red) and have that color fade away to gray in the flat parts.![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UYVUq.png)
