I am just join a firm and they are working in a (their called) SCRUM methodology, They have very sharp deadline and the project development doesnt seems to have any direction or neither it is looking like (This is what we want.) I am developing a module which doesnt have Database, neither I have any information which needs to linked to this module, the people who are linked to the modules and messed up with their own work because which I am not able to get their support in it. Now could anyone suggest me that is this the good way to go ahead in this methodology, which doesnt contain any DB table for to be developed module? Please Suggest Something.. Thanks
