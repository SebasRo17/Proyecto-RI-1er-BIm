In the past 2 years since I started writing business applications (before I did either high level front end or very low level systems programming), learned datasets, linq to sql, and now entity framework. The logical thing to look at next seems to be NHibernate. Reasons I eventually ended up at EF are: (1) it has the best designer support and (2) it is the most supported by Microsoft. Reasons (these have elements of assumption) I am interested in NHibernate are: (1) it might not get superceded by a totally different thing as quickly as MS churns data access technologies (2) It seems like its either the front running or second to front running tool for what it does and (3) It appears to be stable and tracable back through time quite a bit. Has anyone published a comparioson of the two? Is one better than the other for certain types of architectures? Or is it just a matter of style and preference?
