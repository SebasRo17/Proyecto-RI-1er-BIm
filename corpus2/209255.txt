I'm working on a project to update our (out of support) middleware stack to a stable but supported version. There are several teams with applications running on the version we currently have in production and understandably nobody wants to carry the risk of being the first to run on the newer version. What strategies have you used or found most compelling to move to a new release like this in the past? There are some performance and functional benefits offered by the newer version but there isn't really any major technical incentive for the teams to move that's a must-have right now. This is mainly being driven by the cost of extended support for the old version and also a desire by the infrastructure teams to be running on a supported version with the improved management offered by the newer version. It's more of a people question than a technology question.
