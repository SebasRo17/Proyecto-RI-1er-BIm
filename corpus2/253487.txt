I would like to know any executable files launched or loaded by an executable file (if possible without running it,if it is not possible i don't want any change in the system). For example i have this source code compiled in an executable :               CreateProcess("C:\\Windows\\explorer.exe", NULL, NULL,NULL,FALSE,0,NULL,NULL,&SI,&PI);     hKernel32 = LoadLibrary("kernel32.dll"); // I can know this by looking in the import table     g_LoadLibrary = (pLoadLibrary)GetProcAddress(hKernel32, "LoadLibrary");     g_LoadLibrary("unknow.dll");     ShellExecute(NULL,"open", "script.py", "", "", SW_SHOWDEFAULT );      Here i want to know he spawn explorer.exe, load kernel32.dll ,unknow.dll and start script.py. How i can do that ? Thank you!
