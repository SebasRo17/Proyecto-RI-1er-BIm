I am writing unit tests for a library written in Qt/C++. The library is rather big, with lots of functionalities. I have a separate `unitTest` folder which I have my `UnitTest.cpp` in there. Having all test case / unit tests in the same file, makes it one very big `.cpp` file. I was wondering what is the best approach to unit test huge libraries. Should I have different `UnitTest.cpp` files in different folder? Like one for every class? or every name space?
