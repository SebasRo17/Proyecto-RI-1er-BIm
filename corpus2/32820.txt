I have a 2D array of complex values and I want to apply a function to every entry of the array, for every timepoint t in a list. I know how to apply my function to one entry for every time t in a list, and I know how to apply my function for one t to every entry in an array. (I keep finding answers to those problems when searching with google and on SE) Somehow I cant get both to work at the same tim, and I cant find an explanation of how to do it either. Maybe someone has experience in doing this? Example:               In:     function[source_, t_] := source(1+Sin[2Pi*t]);     lena = Import["ExampleData/lena.tif"];     size = ImageDimensions[lena];     data = ImageData[lena];     times = Table[i, {i, 600}]/10;     complexred = Fourier[data[[1;;size[[2]],1;;size[[1]],1]]];     newdata = function[complexred, times];          Out:     Thread::tdlen : Objects of unequal length in      {{...some complex values here...}{<<1>>},<<48>>,<<430>>} cannot be combined.      Thanks!
