If I have a function at a number of non-uniformly spaced data points:               youtReal[7.8]=2.0332;, youtReal[8.54]=6.24352354;..................      ......... and the imaginary parts:               youtImag[7.8]=2.54345345; youtImag[8.54]=-5.2434;.................      Is there an easy way to generate an InterpolatingFunction from this data consisting of complex values i.e. so I have yout[7.8]=2.0332+2.54345345I; and can also just get an interpolated value for say yout[8.12] and so on. To make this more concrete, the initial data is read in from a text file that looks like               youtReal[39.983881559265192985] =0.003175121157662356963;      youtImag[39.983881559265192985] =-0.025570345562818877981;      youtReal[39.945803445544929806] =0.0030816430773355882379;      youtImag[39.945803445544929806] =-0.025607948113924885628;      youtReal[39.907725331824666628] =0.0029879382430246325535;      youtImag[39.907725331824666628] =-0.025645261479980185081;      youtReal[39.869647218104403449] =0.0028940073645911109315;      youtImag[39.869647218104403449] =-0.025682284691974913792;       youtReal[39.831569104384140271] =0.0027998511548903118804;       youtImag[39.831569104384140271] =-0.025719016782491712295;       youtReal[39.793490990663877092] =0.0027054703297639490629;      youtImag[39.793490990663877092] =-0.025755456785713930289;      youtReal[39.755412876943613914] =0.0026108656080328711776;      youtImag[39.755412876943613914] =-0.025791603737433792661;     youtReal[39.717334763223350736] =0.00251603771148972405;      youtImag[39.717334763223350736] =-0.025827456675060525123;      .      .      .      and so on all the way down to around youtReal[~29]. So I read this in then have a function with quite arbitrarily defined value points, and lots and lots of them. I don't have a nice list of points I can just feed into `ListInterpolation` ab initio, I need to somehow generate this.
