I have a problem in obtaining a $2n \times 2n$ Symplectic matrix $T$, with $n=2$. I couldn't find a direct command in _Mathematica_ to achieve this. Conditions:               Transpose[T].HH.T={{v1,0,0,0},{0,v2,0,0},{0,0,v1,0},{0,0,0,v2}     Transpose[T].JJ.T = JJ      where:               JJ={{0, 0, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 1}, {-1, 0, 0, 0}, {0, -1, 0, 0}};     T={{T11,T12,T13,T14},{T21,T22,T23,T24},{T31,T32,T33,T34},{T41,T42,T43,T44}};     HH={{HH11,HH12,HH13,HH14},{HH21,HH22,HH23,HH24},{HH31,HH32,HH33,HH34},{HH41,HH42,HH43,HH44}};
