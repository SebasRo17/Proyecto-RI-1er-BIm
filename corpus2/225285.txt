I have interviews scheduled for two, large, respectable, somewhat competing, American companies. One of them (the one for which the interview takes place first) has asked that I bring a signed NDA to the interview. I'm not a specialist - more of a general Java server kind of guy with years of experience - but I don't have any conflict of interest between my previous employers and either of these two and have not been in a similar situation before. However, I am worried that signing the NDA for the first employer might pose a problem should things go well with the second and I decide to go there. Is this a reasonable fear? If so, what can I do?
