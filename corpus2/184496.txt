I'm thinking of using a LGPLv3 library in a closed source commercial program running in a closed embedded environment. According to what I know from LGPLv3 licensing, I can use it as long as the closed source software dynamically links with the LGPLv3 library and leaves the freedom to the user to change or update the LGPLv3 library by changing the library binaries. Since my software runs in a closed, controlled, validated environment, it would be really odd to respect the part of allowing the user to change the LGPLv3 library. I could add a functionality to my environment allowing to update the library binaries, but it would be odd to present this functionality to our customers since they would have no interest into changing that library and would see that as a security hole, so they'll want us to remove it (or restrict the access to no one). Is adding an update binary functionality the only way to respect LGPLv3 ? If by using it, I require to call my company to give access to it (by a password), Will I still respect the license ?
