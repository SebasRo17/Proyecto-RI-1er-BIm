I am trying to calculate eigenvalues of a sparse matrix with only two distinct non-zero elements, here Alpha and Beta, which are both negative reals. Mathematica returns some complex expressions with `Root[]` values when using the `Eigenvalues[]` command on the following matrixA: In all cases the matrices are symmetric and real and hence have real eigenvalues.               matrixA={             {α, β, 0, 0, 0, 0, β, 0, 0, β},             {β, α, β, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},             {0, β, α, β, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},             {0, 0, β, α, β, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},             {0, 0, 0, β, α, β, 0, 0, 0, 0},             {0, 0, 0, 0, β, α, β, 0, 0, 0},             {β, 0, 0, 0, 0, β, α, β, 0, 0},             {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, β, α, β, 0},             {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, β, α, β},             {β, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, β, α}             }      For comparison, with all the other similar matrices I've tried (see below e.g. matrixB) Mathematica will put out simple decimal approximations (using `Eigenvalues[matrixB] // N // Simplify`) Can anyone point out a way to get expressions for the `matrixA` as simple as for `matrixB`? And yes, the desired simple answers for `matrixA` do exist, I can get them with other programs, but I want to use Mathematica! * * * I should add that I already have already used `$Assumptions = α<0 && β <0` at the top of my worksheet.               matrixB={             {α, β, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, β},             {β, α, β, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},             {0, β, α, β, 0, 0, 0, β, 0, 0},             {0, 0, β, α, β, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},             {0, 0, 0, β, α, β, 0, 0, 0, 0},             {0, 0, 0, 0, β, α, β, 0, 0, 0},             {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, β, α, β, 0, 0},             {0, 0, β, 0, 0, 0, β, α, β, 0},             {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, β, α, β},             {β, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, β, α}             }
