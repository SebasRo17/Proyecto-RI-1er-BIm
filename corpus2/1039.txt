I have to create a `Graph` object, which can be manipulated by the user, though I do not want to have the `Graph`-specific cursor (an arrow with an `UndirectedEdge` symbol next to it) not to confuse the user with any extra information. I assumed this would work:               MouseAppearance[      Graph[{1 <-> 2, 2 <-> 3,3 <-> 1},       ImageSize -> 200,       EdgeShapeFunction -> ({Black, AbsoluteThickness@2, Arrowheads@.1,            MouseAppearance[Arrow[#1, .1], "Arrow"]} &),       VertexShapeFunction :> ({Hue[.6, .2, .8],            MouseAppearance[Disk[#1, .1], "Arrow"]} &)       ],      "Arrow"]      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/OX3tH.png) But it doesn't work. While all graphics objects and the whole graph itself are wrapped into `MouseAppearance` still the `Graph`-specific cursor appears when I move the mouse away of edges or nodes. Over nodes and edges, the standard arrow cursor is displayed correctly, as expected. Unfortunately, when I capture the screen with the cursor included, it **always** saves the normal arrow cursor irregardless how it looks on screen. Strange. That's why I did not include a picture with a cursor over it. Can anyone answer the following questions?   1. Why `MouseAppearance[..., "Arrow"]` does not work here (only partially)?   2. How can the `Graph`-specific cursor appearance be invoked? The documentation for `MouseAppearance` (under More nformation) does not list it among the built-in ones.   3. Why `PrintScreen` or any other screenshot application is unable to capture the `Graph`-specific cursor? Platform is: Win7 64bit
