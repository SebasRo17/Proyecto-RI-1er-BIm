My company has grown seriously over the last years. Until a few years ago we could work with 1 agile team and everything went quite smooth. Now we have multiple teams, all working agile and things go less smoothly as we would hoped. One of the main [psychological] problems is how to organize the working methods in the teams.   * If every team has its own way of working (its own type of Excel sheets where the progress is kept, its own way of calculating capacity, ...) the teams seem to drift apart and seem to compete rather than cooperate on things (developing similar code in parallel)   * If all teams use the same methodologies and work flow procedures, then again we have two alternatives:      * 'Forcing' the methodologies by management seems incorrect since management does not clearly know how agile/scrum methodologies should work (only the actual teams know this)     * Letting teams making suggestions for improvements and them 'forcing' this onto other teams might improve the competition rather than the cooperation (teams will refuse to use the methodology because it comes from another team).  Does anyone have any experience with multiple teams working together in an agile/scrum way? How do promote the teams working together without making them 'blaming eachother' for things that don't work?
