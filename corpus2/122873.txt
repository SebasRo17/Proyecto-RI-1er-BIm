I'm frustrated by the lack of concrete explanations on how to go from being able to script (bash, awk) and write simple applications (c, php, python) to designing and developing larger, more complicated software. It seems that on one side there are programming language books and on the other side there are the software engineering/project management books designed for teams of programmers. I've read plenty of both. I've read the XP/Agile classics and have a decent _theoretical_ understanding of the software development process. I like to read other people's code and can follow it fairly well. But when I have an idea for a project or want to go from "here's the problem/need" to "here's the solution", my mind draws a blank and I don't know where to begin. Do I just hack it out? Are there any structured workflows for individual developers that don't work in teams or for a big software house? I really don't have any desire to get a PMP or work for a software company. I'm just looking for an effective, efficient, practical workflow.
