While working on a new project with MVC3, a DI framework (Ninject), and unit tests (NUnit) paired with mocks (Moq), I found setting up the Membership Provider felt a bit "awkward". I've run into tasks that seem disproportionally hard, just as others have: injecting a repository to the provider, creating unit tests, and mocking the provider. This led me to a SO question on alternatives to the standard Membership provider (in turn linking to another interesting question on whether to roll your own authentication system), which didn't get as much attention as the votes on the question would warrant. So I'm finally left with **the question** : _Does anyone know what the future for Authentication in ASP.NET is? Or more specifically: did Microsoft provide any (official) insights on their direction for authentication?_ I couldn't find any blog posts from MS employees/teams. The only real related thing I could find was this highly upvoted ASP.NET uservoice ticket which doesn't seem to have any official response.
