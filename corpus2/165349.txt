I have programming interviews coming up in a couple weeks. I took an algorithms class a while ago but likely forgot some key concepts. I'm looking for something like a very short book ( **< 100 pages**) on algorithms to get back up to speed. Sorting algorithms, data structures, and any other essentials should be included. It doesn't have to be a book...just looking for a great way to get caught up in about a week. What's the best tool for a **quick** algorithms intro or refresher?
