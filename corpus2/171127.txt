I'm really curious right now. I'm a Python programmer, and this question just boggled me: You write an OS. How do you run it? It has to be run somehow, and that way is within another OS? How can an application run without being in an OS? How do you tell the computer to run, say, C, and execute these commands to the screen, if it doesn't have an OS to run in? Does it have to do with a UNIX kernel? If so, what is a Unix kernel, or a kernel in general? I'm sure OSes are more complicated than that, but how does it work?
