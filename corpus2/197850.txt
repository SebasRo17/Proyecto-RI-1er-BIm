ViewController is a term for classes that handle views in a framework. This is especially used in MVC frameworks. I go through various projects, written by various programmers, who implement MVC in different ways. Especially, i get confused, about the relation between the MainView ( parent view ) and some CustomView ( widget etc) in the framework. **I personally pass reference of the MainView into the ViewController to be instantiated. All the subviews of ViewController are added to that reference of MainView. Additionally, ViewController itself is added as a child of MainView.** Like this : ![main-view and view-controller relation](http://i.stack.imgur.com/VkkVz.jpg) Want to know, if this is the right way to relate each other ?
