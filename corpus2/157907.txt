I am new to BitBucket. I have my repository. And 2 people working on it me, Admin and another developer with **Read** only access. So in order for him to do changes he forked repository and made changes, uploaded to his repository and created pull request. Now I merged this pull request with my repository. And made few small changes afterwards and also committed them and uploaded to my repository. What would be the next step for him to continue working? Does he have to fork it each time I make changes to my repo? Is there some way for him to sync his with my repository without creating new fork each time?
