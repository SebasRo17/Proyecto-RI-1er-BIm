I am trying to solve an equation using _Mathematica_ , but I keep getting the following error > Solve::nsmet: This system cannot be solved with the methods available to > Solve. More importantly, it is running for more than half an hour without giving any solution. I have also tried `Reduce`, but that does not work either. Any suggestions? How I can fix the error? I am new to _Mathematica_. My apologies if this is a very basic question. I am trying to find θ1 (angle)?               x = (e*b*Cos[θ1] + v)^2/(v^2 + e^2*b^2 + 2*e*v*b*Cos[θ1])          Eq2 = a^2 + e*(Sin[θ]- Sin[θ1]) + v/b(θ-θ1)-a*Sqrt[x] ==         a^2*x + e^2*(Cos[θ]-Cos[θ1])^2- 2*a*e*(Cos[θ]-Cos[θ1])*Sqrt[x]          Solve[Eq2, θ1]
