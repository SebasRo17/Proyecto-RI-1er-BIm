I was recently talking with a recruiter who wants to put me at a company for a position of Developer in Test. He essentially made it sound like a position where you get to fiddle with new programming techniques and test bugs and improvements in software but where you don't need to worry about standard deadlines. You get to be very creative in your work. But that description was still kinda vague to me. I have been a Web Developer for a number of years now, mostly working in PHP. So I wanted to know if others in the community know more about what these positions typically entail. I know that this might not be a subject appropriate for this forum, but it was the best fit I could find among Stack Exchange and I would really appreciate it if this wasn't closed since there is really no where else here to ask about it. I have tried Googling it, but there isn't a lot of information out there. So what exactly is a Developer in Test?
