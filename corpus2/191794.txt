I am currently working on an app for a local hospital. The hospital wants a rough version of my app to test on their employees before committing to full application development. I am currently enrolled in the iOS developer program but I don't know if I can use this account to push a rough draft to about 40 different devices, I'm afraid the app may get rejected. I have no experience with the enterprise program and I don't want to spend an additional $300 unless its absolutely necessary.
