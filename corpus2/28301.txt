I'm running the older Mathematica v6 which seems to go through the edges of graphs twice. Is this a bug? Is it fixed on the latest version? Please just try this command:               GraphPlot[{1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 1},       EdgeRenderingFunction -> (If[True, Print["e ", ##]; Black] &),       VertexRenderingFunction -> (If[True, Print["v ", ##]; Black] &)]                    v {0.496926,0.867793}11     e {{0.496926,0.867793},{0.999994,0.00354563}}{1,2}None{1,2}     e {{0.999994,0.00354563},{0.,0.}}{2,3}None{2,3}     e {{0.,0.},{0.496926,0.867793}}{3,1}None{3,1}     e {{0.496926,0.867793},{0.999994,0.00354563}}{1,2}None{1,2}     e {{0.999994,0.00354563},{0.,0.}}{2,3}None{2,3}     e {{0.,0.},{0.496926,0.867793}}{3,1}None{3,1}     v {0.496926,0.867793}11     v {0.999994,0.00354563}22     v {0.,0.}33
