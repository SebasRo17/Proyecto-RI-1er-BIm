I have been reading blogs about the basics of unit testing and am currently reading The Art of Unit Testing. I feel I have a fairly good understanding of how unit tests can be set up and implemented, but I am wary of implementing it because if things were set up wrong, no one would notice / my team would be writing bad tests thinking they were good tests. I feel that my whole underlying issue is with fear of failure, being in implementing unit testing or in persuading the team to start using / writing unit tests. How do/did you increase your confidence in your own knowledge about coding?
