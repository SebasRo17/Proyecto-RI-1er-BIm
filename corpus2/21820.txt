I have a big list. It contains nearly 60,000 sub-lists. It's structured like               bigList = {{x1,y1,z1},{x2,y2,z2},{x3,y3,z3},.....,{x60000,y60000,z60000}};      I have picked 1200 elements from the `bigList` at random.               smallList = {{x1,y1,z1},{x2,y2,z2},......,{x1200,y1200,z1200}};      I want to find the positions of the `smallList` elements in the `bigList`. To that end I wrote the following code.               Flatten[Map[Position[bigList, #]&, smallList]]      It's working fine, but it takes **30 seconds** to evaluate.               Timing[Flatten[Map[Position[bigList, #]&, smallList]]]      How can I reduce that evaluation time?
