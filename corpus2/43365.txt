Suppose we defined a pattern with custom pattern name provided by user, like               Quiet[myCustomPattern@terms_ := f[terms : (_[_, _])..]]      for use in further definitions:               myTransform@myCustomPattern@localNameForTerms := Reverse /@ {localNameForTerms}      However, in definitions like this one, `localNameForTerms` is not by default highlighted the way it would be in case of appearing in explicit Pattern expression. Is it possible to Style it as a properly localized symbol, by putting               myCustomPattern -> Composition[myCustomPattern, Style[#, Darker@Darker@Green, Italic] &]      somewhere in the low-level notebook representation rules, for example?
