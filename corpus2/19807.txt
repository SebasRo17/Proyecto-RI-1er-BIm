I'll be forming a remote team, and I want to be able to use scripts (or something) to make _sure_ that people's code is checked in every night. I currently use some BASH scripts that are kindof wonky and aren't customizable easily. Does anyone have any useful tools, tips, or resources for this?   Are there any pitfalls to doing this that I'm not seeing, or can I do it better another way? (cross-posted to super-user)
