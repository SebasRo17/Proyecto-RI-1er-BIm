I have been trying for years to master Swing layout managers with no success. Every time I need to do something with Swing, it is like pulling nails to get the visual components to line up the way I want them to. I am familiar with frameworks like Matisse but that's not the point. My question is: Why does Swing even need layout managers? It seems like an overcomlicated paradigm. What I would like to be able to do is jave a simple JFrame and then for each component (like JLabel) simply specify X and Y coordinates where I want it to be situated -- done deal. Can anybody explain what is wrong with this simple approach that would work predictably 100% of times? Or is there an actual layout manager that does things exactly like this?
