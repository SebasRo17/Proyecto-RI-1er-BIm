Consider :               list = {100,102,103,99,106,107,104,112}      I want to consider, extract only the "big moves" of that time series. In this case the moves bigger then 5 from the moving point of reference. The pseudo code would go as such : Let's assume you have the data `x(t)` for `t=1` to `T`, You start from the first data point, `z(1) = x(1)`               if abs(x(2)-z(1))> delta,          z(2)= x(2),      elseif abs(x(3)-z(1))> delta,          z(2)= x(3),      elseif abs(x(4)-z(1))> delta,          z(2)= x(4),             if abs(x(5)-z(2))> delta,              z(3)= x(5),          elseif abs(x(6)-z(2))>delta,              z(3)= x(6),             if abs(x(7)-z(3))>delta,                  z(4)=x(7)             endif         endif     endif      I tried to write it with an `If` statement, but I don't know when my test is going to pass thus, how many `If`s to nest.               If[Abs[list[[2]]-list[[1]]]>5,        list[[2]],                  If[Abs[list[[3]]-list[[1]]>5,                  list[[3]]....      Here this process will stop at `list[[5]]` with `Abs[list[[5]]-list[[1]]=6` At this point, `list[[5]]` becomes my new point of reference :                If[Abs[list[[6]]-list[[5]]]>5,          list[[6]],                   If[Abs[list[[7]]-list[[5]]>5,                  list[[7]]....      So my desired output is the following :               {100,106,112}      I am pretty sure, this type of operation has a name but I don't know it. It felt like a `While[]` or `For[]` but I can`t figure it out. Please let me know how to improve the question.
