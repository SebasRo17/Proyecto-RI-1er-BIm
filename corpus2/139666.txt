I very often find myself in situations where I should have opened a parentheses, but forgot and end up furiously tapping the left arrow key to get to the spot I should have put it, and doing the same to get back to where I was - that, or removing one hand from the keyboard to do it with the mouse. Either way, it's a stupid mistake on my part and a poor use of time going back to fix it. For example, if typing something like               var x = 100 - var1 + var2;      I might get to the end of the statement and realize I wanted to subtract the sum of var1 and var2 from 100 and not add var2 to the difference of 100 and var1. I can't really expect an IDE to prevent my mistakes, but I was thinking there could be a simple enough feature that would save time when they're made. Specifically, some kind of function that, after a closing parenthesis is added where there isn't an opening one, would start ghosting in an opening parenthesis at different statements and allow the user to switch between them. For example: Say you have the following statement:               var x = oldY * oldX + newY / newX - left - right;      If you put a closing parenthesis after `right` and pressed the shortcut, the IDE would do: `var x = oldY * oldX + newY / newX - **(** left - right);` press left, and then: `var x = oldY * oldX + newY / **(** newX - left - right);` ...then: `var x = oldY * oldX + **(** newY / newX - left - right);` Anyway... Does this feature exist? If not, should it exist? What do senior programmers do when this happens?
