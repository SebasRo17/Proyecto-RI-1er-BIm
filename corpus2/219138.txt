I'd like to know if there's a technical reason of why PHP's designers decided to invoke a static method using `Class::static_method()` instead of `Class->static_method()` (like any other method). Does the syntax change reflect any technical requirement? I'm asking this because the syntax for every single other language I know to invoke a method is always the same, despite it being static or not.
