While this question might be relevant to other fields, I'm interested specifically in searching for jobs as a developer. Namely, when you are searching for an applying for a new job you might look for listings that are for C# or Java developers; however, most jobs aren't just writing one language so how do you determine which skills are worth highlighting on a résumé or more likely on a targeted cover letter? Likewise, are there some skills that aren't worth mentioning because it is implied that most developers should know it (i.e. XML) or is it better to list everything?
