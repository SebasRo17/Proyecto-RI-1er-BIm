I am going to write an graphical 2D application that allows user to create polygons and transform them through transformation such as rotation an so on. I was hoping someone can give pro and cons arguments for the different choices I got in my mind. (Its all in Java btw!) a). Represent vectors by filling matrices with 'real' numbers. This means making a matrix datas tructure that supports multiplication, transposing etc b). Make a own vector class, such that I can make a matrix class that support those vectors.
