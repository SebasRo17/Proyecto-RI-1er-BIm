It seems to me that everyone uses **NUnit** without even considering the other options. I think this is because:   * Everyone is familiar with it already so they won't have to learn a new API.   * It is already set up with their continuous integration server to work with NUnit. Am I wrong about this? I decided to use **xUnit** on one of my own projects recently and I love it! It makes so much more sense to me and conceptually it seems like a definite step forward from NUnit. I'd like to hear opinions on which framework is actually the best - not taking into consideration having to learn it or reconfigure your automated testing.
