I'm wondering, why would one (consider it not just a single developer, but a company) prefer C# or Java for web applications? What's their considerations regarding the question. I mean, a company, has an assignment to make a web- site for customer, or online game, or web-portal, how does the project management or/and the software architect (and the core team) came to the conclusion - "we will do it in ASP.NET MVC" for example? I know it's specific, but what are the common reasons? Especially, why instead of PHP? As PHP is purely designed for web. Maybe if it is for a single web-site, there are much CMS's where the customer is familiar with, but let's say PHP also has a lot of CMS's, and most of the ASP.NET ones are as spaghetti as wordpress is. Also, as I'm aware, the common webserver is a windows webserver, back in the days I started with computers, everyone was saying the administration in windows is worse than in unix-based platforms. I really don't see the point. For me is just like waste of resources, I think you will need twice better machine running on Windows for the same achievements. C# for desktop - thumbs up, but for web - why? Same for JSP. Its common server is cross platform, so no need of Windows, but still isn't it also waste of resources? And the question is the same as the paragraph - how a company would decide to use JSP. The question was raised, because of lots of the sites rising in ASP.NET nowadays. To be honest, I have seen too few sites in JSP. P.S.: Sorry, I didn't find the relevant tag for this, so I tagged the languages and the involved stuff
