I'm just learning about use-case analysis and use-case diagrams and am a little confused whether or not the MySQL database of a web app should be considered an actor. Is the databased considered outside of "the system" or my application, because it is its own server, most probably on another physical machine? On the other hand, the database in a basic web application won't ever initiate a use case.
