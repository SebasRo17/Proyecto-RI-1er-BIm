At the end of the month, I have to give a presentation on a software project that I've been working on by myself that will basically decide whether or not I will get a full-time job at the company I'm a temporary hire for now. I will be giving my presentation to the president of our department, and two VP's. The president has less programming knowledge than the other two VP's and is ultimately the person I need to impress. What are the most important things I need to convey in the presentation? I've already been told by my manager to emphasize the following things:   1. I am steering this project in the right direction and am in full control of everything.   2. I am completing this project on schedule. What other things should I focus on during my presentation to make myself appear as hire-worthy as possible? I'm thinking of highlighting the efforts I'm making on a design level to reduce risk and uncertainty in the software (two things I imagine are very important to the higher-ups). One thing I'm particularly worried about is finding the right balance between technical and non-technical details in the presentation. If I don't include any technical details, the president of our department won't know about all of the "under the hood" features that are in the software, but if I'm too technical, he might get lost and not understand important points in the presentation. Any tips would be appreciated.
