As part of my job, I regularly get ad-hoc requests from users for snapshots of our very large database. However, there's no fixed format for delivering these and they usually come through in the form of bullet-pointed text, for example:   * All customers    * All active in last 0-24 months (including non-contactable customers)    * All committed In this instance, "committed" is a flag, and "active/non-contactable" is both a text-based status and a dynamic status based on their last purchase. So this request could be interpreted as:   * All customers who made a purchase in the last 24 months, regardless of status   * All customers who have a "active" or "non-contactable" status regardless of last purchase.   * One of the above and then "either" having a committed flag, or "and" having a committed flag. I won't labour the point - you see the problem. And it's worth adding that the possible range of parameters is quite large. Normally I have to talk to the requestor and go through a rigmarole of explaining the problem and trying to clarify the requirements. This situation can't be that uncommon. Is there a more effective way of capturing these details, with a checkbox-style grid or other visual aid? Does anyone have any examples of experience of useful solutions?
