I'm basically done with my computer science classes in college but I don't seem to be "ready" for a computer science job, nor am I in a position to get an internship at the moment. I'm wondering if there is any way to prepare and gain experience I would need for a job without having an actual degree yet. Any certain books I can read or skills I should learn that would help? Thank you.
