I work for a small electronics and support software company that just recently got a contract with a large company that's very strict on documentation (I do the support software, essentially Windows or browser applications). Upon reviewing the required documentation from the large company, I realize that I wear more hats than I realized. Namely, we have to produce documentation describing:   * Requirement analysis (me)   * Architectural design (me)   * Detailed design (me)   * (Actual) Software development (me)   * Database design development (me)   * Testing plan, preparation, and results (me)   * Proof of compliance with requirements (me)   * User manual (me) I'll also be doing most (if not all) of the testing myself. And the deployment, training, and customer support. If there's any application technician needs for sales support, that's me too. Is that common? Do small software companies that get big contracts ask that commonly from single programmers?
