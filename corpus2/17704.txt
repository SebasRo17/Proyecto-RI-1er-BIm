Wolfram|Alpha has a whole collection¹ of parametric curves that create images of famous people. To see them, enter `WolframAlpha["person curve"]` into a Mathematica notebook, or `person curve` into Wolfram|Alpha. You get a mix of scientist, politicians and media personalities, such as Albert Einstein, Abraham Lincoln and PSY ![people](http://i.stack.imgur.com/iDgwn.png) The W|A parametric people curves are constructed from a combination of trigonometric and step functions. This suggests that the images might have been created by parametrising a sequence of contours... which is backed up by some curves being based of famous photos, e.g., the W|A curve for PAM Dirac is clearly based on the Dirac portrait used in Wikipedia. Here's a animation showing each closed contour as the plot parameter $t$ increases by $2\pi$ units: ![Animated Abe](http://i.stack.imgur.com/rHIJT.gif) Since the functions are so complicated, I can't believe that they were manually constructed. For example, the function to make Abe's bow tie is (for $8\pi < t < 10\pi$) ![{x,y}=...](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1cN3f.png)   The full parametric curve for Abe has 56 such curves tied together with step functions and takes many pages to display. So my question is, how can I use _Mathematica_ to take an image and produce a good looking "people curve"? Answers can start from line art and just automatically parametrise the lines or they can start from a picture/portrait and identify a set of contours that are then parametrised. Or any other (semi)automated approach that you can think of. ¹ At the time of posting this question, it has 37 such curves.
