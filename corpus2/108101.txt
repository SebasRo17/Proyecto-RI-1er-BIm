I am a web developer. My office sets a list of criteria such as   * Discipline   * Attendance   * Project Schedule   * Teamwork   * Problem Solving   * Idea Sharing   * Dedication for evaluating employees performance. Each criteria is allocated some points and the review is based on the total points scored in each criteria. My problem is I feel these criteria are quite vague and I don't think they can actually portray an employees performance. In software development, I think there are other other ways to measure an employees performance. Any suggestions? Thanks
