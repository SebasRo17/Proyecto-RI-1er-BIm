> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  Discrete Convolution I would like to be able to convolve two functions of two variables in Mathematica, and then plot derivatives (or functions of derivatives) of the solution. However, the result of the convolution is itself a function of two variables and in many cases there is no exact formula or it takes a very long time to compute. In Mathematica, is it possible to convolve two functions numerically (by this I mean compute g(x,y)*f(x,y) where x and y correspond to sets of data), obtain and take derivatives of the solution (also both sets of data)? I know the first answer will be "use MATLAB." I would prefer not to do this. If anyone has some example code where this has been done and is willing to share, I would be very grateful.
