This is a follow up question to the original question: Original Question The accepted solution (provided by @Mark McClure) can also be found in the original question. It is as follows.               u[x_, t_] = -(1/2) Cos[x - t]^2 + 1;     pics = Table[Plot[u[x, t], {x, -10, 10}, PlotRange -> {0, 1.5},      PlotStyle -> {Red, Thickness[0.005]}], {t, 0, 2 Pi, 2 Pi/50}];       Then, export as follows:               Export["anim.gif", pics]      Is there a way of creating a 3D animation from the 2D animation? Something along the lines of the following: Example Thanks, Radz.
