I am trying to attach a fructose molecule to a sucrose molecule by using information obtained from the following               ChemicalData["Sucrose", "CHColorStructureDiagram"]     ChemicalData["Fructose", "CHColorStructureDiagram"]      My question is how do you combine each separate structure diagram to form a single one shown here which is a combined structure arising from the two structures (description at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructan) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/t3FXg.png)
