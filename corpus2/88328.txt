Software development is often contrasted with the traditional branches of engineering, most commonly civil or mechanical engineering. For example:   * "Software development isn't like engineering, it's like craftsmanship!"   * "Software development isn't like engineering, but it should be!" Do software developers understand what it is that engineers do and how they do it? At least, do they understand it well enough to be able to make an informed comparison with what software developers do?
