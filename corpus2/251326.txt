There are times when an expression becomes confusing because of implicit operator precedence. Take this Python expression:               a, b, c, d = range(4)     e = a + b // c << d >> a ** b or a + c * d // c % c      With other languages it can become even more convoluted. Suffice to say, an experienced developer may do a double-take at code like this and add some parenthesis to clarify whats going on. While this is something you can do manually, It risks some human error, I'm curious if there are existing solutions which make the operator precedence explicit by adding parenthesis (Am not so fussed about the exact language, anything with in-fix operators is fine). Though not my aim, one could (for example), take some obfuscated code from http://www.ioccc.org and get a little closer to having something understandable. * * * _Note, for the purpose of this question, I'm not worried about non- communicative behavior of floating point operations in some languages._
