I have a dilemma. I have a candidate for a senior software developer position. The guy seems competent on a first talk with him and he answered the questions asked precisely and gave me proofs of his work. Moreover he has been highly recommended by some trusted colleagues. In this case I am tempted to skip the technical test HR requires as I need to fill the vacancy asap. Please share your experience. **EDIT:** Against a better judgement I have given the test. Top scores on almost all questions, even on subject that he did not boasted upon. But I had so support some irony from him when he saw the questions of the test - which were clearly not for a senior. So we made an offer. Thanks all for the insights.
