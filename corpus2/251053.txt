I have a list of users that are being assigned to a certain office. I use checkboxes to select each user and when the client is done, a PUT is performed:               PUT offices/:id          users[0] : 14     users[1] : 12     users[2] : 25      The problem occurs when the server has users saved, but the client decides to clear the board. So he deselects the users and hits save. The problem in this case is that the Ajax request is not sending an empty `users[0] :` parameter, because each checkbox is unchecked. In the case when a parameter is not included at all, should PUT overwrite that it and set it to null or should the request include the empty parameter somehow?
