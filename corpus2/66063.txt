I am a software developer with 3 years of experience in different domains. I was trying to find a job via online sites. Particularly I tried to send motivation letter with CV to UK vacancies. All companies which responded back to me asked to go to the interview on site. I explained them that I am from another country and maybe it is possible to do it over the phone/skype? Everyone replied that it is not possible. Could anyone suggest me what to do in this situation? Maybe I am doing something wrong? Any help would be the most welcome. P.S. it will really hit my pocket to go for every interview over there.
