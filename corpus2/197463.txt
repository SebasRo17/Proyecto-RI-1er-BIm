I have a Bird class. A bird can learn and a bird can fly (methods). A bird can only fly after it learns. Considering both methods are public. How can you make this clear to another fellow developer. Usually they should take a look at the public method names and understand what they do. But how can he understand without reading comments or understand the encapsulated code that method2 can be called only after method1?
