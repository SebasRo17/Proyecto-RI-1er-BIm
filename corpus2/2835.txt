I have a number of rotations computed by `rot = RotationTransform[theta, point]`, and I would like to compose them to produce one function that is the composition of all the rotations. I need this function in a form that I can then use in, say, `FindMinimum[]`. I solved my problem by using `TransformationMatrix[rot]`, multiplying all the matrices, and defining a function based on that. But it would be cleaner to create one function that is the composition of the others, rather than take the detour through matrices. Ideally I would input a list of `theta, point' values, and get back a function that is the composition of all those rotations. I'd appreciate learning how to do this. Thanks!
