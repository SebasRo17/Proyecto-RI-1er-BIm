I've used UltraEdit for years and never had a problem with sharing code with fellow developers whether they worked on Windows, Mac, Linux, Eclipse, Visual Studio -- what have you... But now I am in an office where some developers are using emacs and they complain profusely about the white space differences my code "introduces". I have UltraEdit set to write to files as UNIX-style (no Windows returns), but it seems the whitespace renders differently for the emacs developers. Since I don't use emacs (or vi), its a pain for me to try to figure out why this is impacting them, but I more so just want them to shuttup! lol This is even causing problems in SVN/Diff! Any thoughts on how to fix this? Forget about everyone using Emacs because thats not gonna happen lol.
