I'm setting up a web app in which people will upload images. Once uploaded the images will be watermarked then resized multiple times (Thumbnails, different sizes etc.) and finally uploaded to Amazon S3 for storage. The web app is written in Python with the Tornado framework, I don't really want to lock up the Tornado threads with the image processing so I'm going to send it out to a seperate script (and possibly even seperate servers) using Gearman (I've developed an async-gearman client for Python/Tornado). One of the advantages of Gearman is that it's possible to launch jobs in multiple languages, so the actual processing and uploading of the image could be done in ether Python, Ruby, PHP, Perl, Java, C, or something else. This leaves the question, is one better for the job? Are there certain libraries only available for specific languages that are especially good at image resizing? The most important thing will be performance: we'd like to be able to run as many jobs on a server as possible. Are there other factors I should be looking at? I'd prefer to stick with Python, Ruby, or PHP because that's what I'm familiar with but if the performance gain from doing it in Java/C is good enough I'd be okay with implementing it like that. I'm **not** looking for code examples, I can find those myself, but I'd like to know if there are any big differences between the image processing libraries. I know PHP probably has the easiest to use wit GD, and I've used a couple of the Python libraries before and they seem okay. I've never done anything with images in Ruby.
