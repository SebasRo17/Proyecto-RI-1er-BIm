I just sent out emails to five local web design companies to my area asking to take drawings to HTML/CSS/jQuery. None of the ones who accepted the deal seem suitable to myself. Others rejected the offer because they wanted to 'provide an end-to-end solution' or are 'booked till June'. The local companies did not seem suitable to myself because my review process is this: goto their website, do a view-source. I'll see really weird things (contact us forms that go nowhere), really old things (mm_menu.js), and portfolios that are non-existent (aren't on the site, don't link anywhere, or otherwise). The company would like to hire as locally as they can rather than out-source to another country. **Answers I'm looking for**   * Processes you use when searching for someone   * How you qualify their aptitude for the project   * Anything that you think I'm doing wrong, or should be doing also. **Answers I'm not looking for:**   1. "Hello sir please contact me we do everything for 10 dolla."   2. My bud's great at this stuff, call him.   3. example.com is the best for this.
