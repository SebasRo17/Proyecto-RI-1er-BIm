I was using Wolfram Alpha to explore some set which is defined by an inequality. Somehow I was not able to reproduce the picture with mathematica. What is the best way of plotting a set defined as $F(x,y)\leq0$ where $F$ is a polynomial? I have tried ImplicitPlot, but this did not give nice results. Further, how is it possible to add something to such a plot? In fact I would like to also plot a certain curve which lies inside the set defined by the inequality. How is it possible to obtain this in the same graph?
