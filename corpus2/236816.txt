I need to read some of your opinions. I'm developing a desktop app (.net/winform) to keep data in one place. This is used by several clients and the data is stored in MS SQL Server (client-server arch.) One of the feature is to be able to send notifications via email when conditions met. I've never did something like this so I can't figure out the best way to implement this. Mails are sent on a daily basis. They don't have attachments nor heavy content. Just plain text.   * Send mails directly from SQL? Stored Procedure?   * Make a separate app to handle this? (Running on serverside).   * Use a schedule task? (Windows Server)   * Use a 3rd party app? Hope anyone know what is the best way to do this. Thanks for you time & answers.
