I need to use the discrete Fourier transform for function that represented as list of values. I started with an easy task to check my understanding. I tried to get the amplitude values for `2*Sin[x]`. I think they should be somwhere about 2. But using the discrete `Fourier` operation produces something quite different. Can someone tell me where my mistakes are? Here is what I tried.               data = Table[2*Sin[x], {x, 0, 100}];     ListPlot[data, Joined -> True]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YtAVI.jpg)               ListPlot[Abs[Fourier[data]], Joined -> True, PlotRange -> All]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ND47Q.jpg)               ListPlot[       Table[Abs[FourierTransform[2*Sin[x], x, w]] /.          DiracDelta -> DiscreteDelta, {w, 0.1, 10, 0.1}],        Joined -> True,        PlotRange -> All]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0wyzX.jpg) How can I get the same results from 'Fourier' as I get from 'FourierTransform'?
