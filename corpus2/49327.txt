nm = "start";          d1 :=        Dynamic[Grid[{{         TextCell["Enter a name: "],         InputField[Dynamic[nm], String],         DefaultButton[DialogReturn[ret = nm]]}}]];          CreateDialog[TabView[{"dlg1" -> d1, "dlg2" -> d1}], WindowTitle -> "tt"];      In _Mathematica_ initially the edit box will show `Start`. After exiting the dialog both variables, `ret` and `nm`, will have value that was entered in the box. In Player Pro the initial value of `nm` is not shown in the edit box and the entered value is not assigned to the variables. What is the reason for that and how to pass values in and out of the dialog in _Player Pro_ or better how to make the code exhibit the same behaviour? Both _Mathematica_ and _Player Pro_ are _v9_. I believe the player in previous versions behaved like _Mathematica_.
