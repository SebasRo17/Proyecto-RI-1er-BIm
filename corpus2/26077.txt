Or maybe a better question is - how can I get a `stdin` stream? I need to run on Linux. I did look at Reading from STDIN, or: how to pipe data into Mathematica, but that talks about text data. I need to import an image, sent to standard output by another program. According to Mathematica documentation, there is no pre-defined standard input stream, there's only `$Output`, which is standard output, and `$Input`, which is the script being executed. There are only 2 functions that read from standard input in the expected way - `Input`, which tries to read a Mathematica expression, and `InputString`, which tries to read a string till it gets a newline. Neither of these is good for reading non-text data. What I would prefer to do is read from a stream, preferably using `Import`. I want to use this Mathematica script in a shell script, and pipe data to it. I tried `Import[OpenRead["/dev/stdin"]]`, but this only seems to work if I have an actual file on disk and I redirect input using `<`. It doesn't work if I pipe data to the Mathematica script.
