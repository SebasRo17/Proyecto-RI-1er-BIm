I want to write a computer program to generate 3-D plots (with x-y-t axes) to demonstrate the evolution of the two missiles in the following case: i. $x = 100t$, $y = 80t-16t^2$ for $0\leq t\leq 5$ for the incoming missile ii. $x= 500-200(t-2)$, $y = 80(t-2)-16(t-2)^2$ for $2\leq t\leq 7$ for the interceptor missile I coded it like this:               ParametricPlot3D[{{100 t, 80 t - 16 t^2, 60 t}, {500 - 200 (s - 2),      80 (s - 2) - 16 (s - 2)^2, s}}, {t, 0, 5}, {s, 2, 7}]      The problem is that How can I animate this two functions in 3D form (with x-y-t axes)? I want it to display two moving objects,so i can see if there's any collision.By the way,please help me to correct the code if I'm wrong.
