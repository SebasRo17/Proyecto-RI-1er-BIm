## Background I have read people rebutting the fact that a certain software is free as in free speech, even when it is licensed under GPL. Some say Java isn't free because to obtain a professional certification you must get it from Oracle. Some say Java JDK is not free to re-distribute. Some people even say the openJDK is not free or open. But Java is officially GPL. ## Questions   1. Doesn't GPL explicitly mean you are free to re-distribute ?   2. Isn't GPL enough to make a software free as in free speech ?   3. How can Java be both GPL and not-free as in free speech ?   4. Is there is any license that trully makes a software free beyond any possible subjetive point of view? **EDIT: These question is not about names or trademarks, it's about the code.**
