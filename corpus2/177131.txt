I want to have fully cacheable pages in my websites, but one cannot do that if they contain user-specific data, like the userbar or things in the UI that can change depending on the permissions the user has. So I was thinking whether it was possible to pull everything that is user- specific via ajax, and update the UI accordingly. But I'm worried that this might be annoying for the user, and also it might be difficult to develop. What do you think? Is there a pattern or something I can follow to deal with this?
