I am trying to type (and evaluate) expressions of the following form: $$ G^{a,b} $$ into a mathematica. I've tried the obvious               G^(a, b)      or               Superscript[G,a,b]      But both of these give the same error               Syntax::tsntxi: "a,b" is incomplete; more input is needed.      I know one solution is to use Symbolize from the Notation package               << Notation`     Symbolize[ParsedBoxWrapper[SuperscriptBox["G", RowBox[{"_", ",", "_"}]]]]      however this solution will not suffice as I want to perform operations such as the following:               In[3]:= Sum[G^(a, b), {a, 1, 2}, {b, 1, 2}]     Out[3]= 4 G^(a, b)      Is there any sensible way to get around this? Why is Superscript so much more picky than Subscript? Thanks in advance.
