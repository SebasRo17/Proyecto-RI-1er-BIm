Background. See question Moving controls from Manipulate to a Palette ( or similar GUI object ). As suggested in the answer to this question I use a CreateDialog window to group and handle controls and added WindowFloating->True as an option. Clicking a second time on the external button creates an identical copy of the Window. Question: **What it is the best way to enforce that only one CreateDialog window can be created?**
