I am looking at the following variation of a integro-differential, with `y[0]=1`. The output is not great, any solutions to this?               Clear[s, t, J, w];     J[w_] := 1/(2 + w^2)     eqn = y'[t] == -Integrate[y[t1] J[w] Exp[I (0.1 - w) (t1 - t)], {w, 0, \[Infinity]}, {t1, 0,t}]           LaplaceTransform[eqn, t, s]           InverseLaplaceTransform[%, s, t]           ySol[t_] = y[t] /. First[%] /. y[0] -> 1          Plot[ySol[t], {t, 0, 10}, PlotRange -> {-1, 1}]
