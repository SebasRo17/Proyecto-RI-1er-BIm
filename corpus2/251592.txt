I'm going to become the custodian of an iOS project developed by a third party and my boss just asked me for a list of documentation that I think we should be asking the third party for when they hand over the code. I did some light searching on this and I've found incredibly varying answers to this, so I figured I'd ask a question more tailored to my particular situation. I'm working on a team of 7 individuals of varying experience levels, and I'm sure I'll be called upon to maintain or add features to this project in the future. What should I ask the third party to include when they hand off the code to help make my life easier? AppleDoc? UML diagrams?
