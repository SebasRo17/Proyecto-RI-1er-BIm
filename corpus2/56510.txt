I am trying to extract from a string all words that end with "-man", but the problem is that `WordBoundary` does not seem to work as it returns whole string ignoring actual word boundaries. Here is the code:               mystring = "I am a big fan of Superman, Spiderman and Batman.";     StringCases[mystring, WordBoundary ~~ __ ~~ "man"];
