Currently I've defined a specific quartz scheduler for all of my applications in a same schema with same tables. Also, there is a specific trigger for all of them. Everything is fine after running two applications. But when I run third and forth application I've got this warning, and quartz job isn't called for third and forth application.               Application A -> Scheduler A -> Trigger 1      Application B -> Scheduler A -> Trigger 1     Application C -> Scheduler A -> Trigger 1     Application D -> Scheduler A -> Trigger 1 and Trigger 2      `2014-02-11 13:56:13,465 [QuartzScheduler_QuartzJobCluster-1APP381392087198304_ClusterManager] WARN jdbcjobstore.JobStoreTX - This scheduler instance (1APP381392087198304) is still active but was recovered by another instance in the cluster. This may cause inconsistent behavior.` Now I want to use different scheduler's instance for each application with specific trigger in a same schema. So,I like to know is that correct to use a **same schema and tables** for all of the applications or I should use different schema for them? Does any one know what's the best practice for this situation? Also, the forth application has two triggers. The second one is different with others.               Application A -> Scheduler A -> Trigger 1      Application B -> Scheduler B -> Trigger 1     Application C -> Scheduler C -> Trigger 1     Application D -> Scheduler D -> Trigger 1 and Trigger 2
