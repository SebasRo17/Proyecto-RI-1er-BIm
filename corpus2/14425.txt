I'm setting up a stylesheet and and finding the process of defining related styles tedious and error prone. In particular, I have several related styles that need to have synchronized settings (e.g., such as "DisplayFormula" and "DisplayFormulaNumbered"). Is there a way to base one style on another, or perhaps simply to copy or duplicate an existing style as the starting point for another?
