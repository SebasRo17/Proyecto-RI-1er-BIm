so I run mathematica on my surface pro with windows 8 pro, when I opened a notebook in it and switched to my browser and some other apps it's sometimes impossible to go back to my notebook, it doesn't reopen the window. It gives me a windows warning sound but nothing pops up or shows, I just can't switch back is this a certain setting in windows that needs to be changed or a mathematica bug?
