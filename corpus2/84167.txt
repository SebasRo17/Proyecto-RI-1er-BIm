This summer I'd like to develop a number of applications, all of them relatively small, yet risky -they're complex, I'm inexperienced-. I'm gonna work on my own because my classmates or other IT people I know really don't have a genuine interest in programming (I swear!). Besides from making good code, I'd like to analyze, design and plan everything correctly. Probably applying standard methodologies would be excesive for a single-person project wouldn't it be? So, what lifecycle and diagrams should I use? In college I've been taught only a very superficial approach to software engineering.
