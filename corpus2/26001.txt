Say I have defined some function like               f[p_] := Plot[Sin[p*x], {x, 0, 2 Pi}]      Now in most cases, I just need to specify the value of `p` and retrieve the plot. In a very few cases, I also want to change some option of the plot, e.g. `ImageSize -> Large`. Since my function in reality is a lot more convoluted and already has various optional arguments, I am trying to avoid a solution like               f[p_, size_:Automatic] := Plot[Sin[p*x], {x, 0, 2 Pi}, ImageSize->size]      I have tried e.g.               f[*some value*] /. ImageSize -> Large      but to no avail. Is there any way to achieve what I am attempting? Apologies if I am missing some fundamental features of Mathematica...
