If you take the following line, right click on it and `Copy As Latex`:               Cell[BoxData[RowBox[{"what", " ", "are", " ", "you", "  ", "mode", " ",       Cell["f(x)", "Title"]}]], "Text",       CellChangeTimes->{{3.578697794669105*^9, 3.5786978134524927`*^9}}]      The result of pasting that is:               \text{are}\text{mode}\text{what}\text{you}\text{f(x)}      which is an alphabetization of the original set of words. How is it possible to copy the original text into $\LaTeX$ while preserving the ordering. Sometimes this kind of disorder occurs in converting to `TraditionalForm`.               ExportString[     Cell[BoxData[RowBox[{"what"," ","are"," ","you","  ","mode"," ",      Cell["f(x)","Title"]}]], "Text",        CellChangeTimes->{{3.578697794669105*^9,3.5786978134524927`*^9}}],"Tex"]      it's ok. how to add an item named `ExportLatexToString` below `Copy As Latex` in the menu comes via right click whose function is what `ExportString` done here, i.e. without the disorder of words? My system is Windows-8 X64, Mathematica 9.0.1 Updating1: I found `TextCell` and `TextData` should have not such disorders, maybe this is one of the right track, but the problem is how to convert default text- style-cell to `TextCell` like this one               CellPrint[TextCell[Row[{Style["bold", FontWeight->Bold], " are"}],"Text"]]
