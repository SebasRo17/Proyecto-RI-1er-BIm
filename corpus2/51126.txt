Below is a simplified code that I am trying to evaluate. I am basically getting the rms value of a Wakefield function. When I finally try to evaluate the rms, I get an error. Any help would be greatly appreciated.               sigmaS = 50*10^-6;          gaussian2[s_?NumericQ] := 1/(Sqrt[2 Pi] sigmaS) Exp[-(s^2/(2 sigmaS^2))]          fo2[s_?NumericQ] :=       NIntegrate[gaussian2'[sprime]/(s - sprime)^(1/3), {sprime, -Infinity, s}]          rms2 = Sqrt[       NIntegrate[         gaussian2[x] (fo2[x])^2, {x, -Infinity, Infinity}] - (NIntegrate[          gaussian2[x] fo2[x], {x, -Infinity, Infinity}])^2]
