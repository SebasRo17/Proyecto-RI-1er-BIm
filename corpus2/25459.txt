I'm trying to find the solution set of `{x, y}` variables for the following system of equations:               Solve[{0 == -1/2*Tan[Pi*x/2] + y, 0 == -1/2*Tan[Pi*y/2] + x}, {x, y}]      But when I try this, I can't get a result. Is there another function I should use? I can get the "basic" solutions by hand noting that if $x = 0$, then $y = 2n$ where $n$ is an integer (and vice-versa for when $y = 0$). But I think there are other solutions... Any help would be appreciated, thanks! I'm using Mathematica 8, BTW.
