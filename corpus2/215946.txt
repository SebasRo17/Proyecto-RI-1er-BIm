My name is Sael and I'm 14 years old. Since I was 12 and I got my first computer I instantly go interested in making games. So of course like any other I googled it, got discouraged and forgot about it for a few months. When I was 13 I decided to continue programming, and decided that java would best suit me. Now after a year, I have a basic understanding of java and how it works (it just clicked instantly one day). Anyways, my problem is that I know how I'm going to make a simple game in my head, but as soon as I click that "New Project" button on eclipse, I'm instantly lost and can't figure out where to start. I can't do much without a tutorial beside me since my mind is so dependent on it. So here's the question : what can I do to get past this problem of mine, and have any of you felt like this before?   * sorry if my English is a bit incorrect, Spanish is my main language* _I've made Minecraft mods before_
