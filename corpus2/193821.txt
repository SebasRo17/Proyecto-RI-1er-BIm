We have a URL in the following format > /instance/{instanceType}/{instanceId} You can call it with the standard HTTP methods: POST, GET, DELETE, PUT. However, there are a few more actions that we take on it such as "Save as draft" or "Curate" We thought we could just use custom HTTP methods like: DRAFT, VALIDATE, CURATE I think this is acceptable since the standards say > "The set of common methods for HTTP/1.1 is defined below. Although this set > can be expanded, additional methods cannot be assumed to share the same > semantics for separately extended clients and servers." And tools like WebDav create some of their own extensions. Are there problems someone has run into with custom methods? I'm thinking of proxy servers and firewalls but any other areas of concern are welcome. Should I stay on the safe side and just have a URL parameter like action=validate|curate|draft?
