By the following I'm trying to generate a list of random coordinates (ex. 4) each within unit distance from previous one, starting from origin. What am I doing wrong?               o = {0, 0, 0};          RP = Module[{},       RN = RandomReal[1000, 3];       RV1 = RN/(2*RootMeanSquare[RN]);      o = RV1 + o;      RV2 = {};      RV2 = Append[RV2, o]      ]          In[231]:= Do[RP, {i, 1, 4}]     RV2
