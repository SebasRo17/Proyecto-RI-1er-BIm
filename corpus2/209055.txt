I am a student currently studying an undergraduate CS course at a crappy university in a third world country. I do however have a continuous desire to improve myself. My Objective is to bring myself up to the standards of programmers in United States. To further that goal i program continuously(4-5 hours daily). But here comes my predicament. I am already considered better than most of my peers in university competitions but due to the really low quality of education the comparison is essentially useless. I have searched the internet for website that rank programmers based on challenges but haven't been able to find any. So the question is. Is there any way i can compare my programming skills with the rest of the world ? And finally while i do understand the SE prefers questions that can be answered and not questions that solicit debate, i would still ask for suggestions of the community. In my country mostly nobody cares about self improvement while this is a very big deal to me.
