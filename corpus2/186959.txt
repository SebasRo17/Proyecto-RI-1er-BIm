I have been having a debate about what to do with a trailing slash in a RESTful API. Lets say I have a resource called dogs and subordinate resources for individual dogs. We can therefore do the following:               GET/PUT/POST/DELETE http://example.com/dogs     GET/PUT/POST/DELETE http://example.com/dogs/{id}      But what do we do with the following special case:               GET/PUT/POST/DELETE http://example.com/dogs/      My personal view is that this is saying send a request to an individual dog resource with id = `null`. I think the API should return a 404 for this case. Others say the request is accessing the dogs resource i.e. the trailing slash is ignored. Does anyone know the definitive answer?
