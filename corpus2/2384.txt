Similar as in this question, I have to read in data from a file (exampleFile.txt) which is not so well formatted. Unfortunately, I cannot find a solution by myself. Since it is a bit complicated to describe in which part of the data I am interested in at the moment, you can see in the screenshot below where I have marked in orange the data of interest. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FyEgn.png) Here is the code I got so far:               originalData=Import[file,"Table"];(*Read in of data*)     lengthOriginalData=Length[originalData];     mainData=originalData[[38;;lengthOriginalData-4]];(*take bulk of data*)     mainData1=Position[mainData,"Ion"];(*Search for position all data of interest have in common*)     positionToDelte=Table[{2*i},{i,1,Length[mainData1]/2}];(*there are unnecessary positions*)     mainData2=Delete[mainData1,positionToDelte];(*delete unnecessary positions*)     mainData3=mainData[[mainData2[[All,1]]+3]];(*take the data of interest*)     emptyLine=Position   [mainData3,"======================================================================================================"];(*there are still unnecessary lines*)     emptyLine2=Table[{emptyLine[[i,1]]},{i,1,Length[emptyLine]}];     dataOfInterest=Delete[mainData3,emptyLine2];(*delete the unnecessary lines*)     arrayOfInterest=dataOfInterest[[All,1]];(*this is the array in which the data of interest are*)     arrayOfInterest1=StringReplace[arrayOfInterest,"Â³"->","];(*a try to get the data of interest out of this array*)      As you can test, I get almost all I want (perhaps not with the nicest methods). Actually, all I would need is that I can take in my `arrayOfInterest1` the right elements but somehow this does not work (I think the reason is that this is a string, but I need numbers).
