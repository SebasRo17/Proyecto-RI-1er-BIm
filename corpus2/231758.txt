_(I reworded my question to make it more specific)._ Consider a programming language, that it's programs may only be run inside a specific program that serves as an interpreter. The interpreter scans each line of the source code and executes it as it is. **Would the interpreter be considered a virtual machine?** Conceptually, a VM is a program that other programs use as a platform to run inside of. Thus this interpreter suits the definition. But this interpreter only interprets plain-text source code into executions (and not bytecode).
