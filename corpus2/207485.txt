I want to develop a mobile app for itinerary of major sport event. My confusion is whether there will be a copyright problem in sharing the schedules, venue of matches, player statistics and ticket information etc. on my application, or whether I should make it either a free app or a paid one. If I use official sports news channel information then would there be any issue?
