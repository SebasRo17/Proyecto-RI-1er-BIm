My company is in the financial sector and it is using PHP as programming language. I am a PHP developer myself. I am leading a big project started from almost scratch. I can see how PHP is not the best candidate for building robust platforms. I want to convince my company to _gradually_ switch to Java (which I have experience with). I was trying to find as many supporting arguments as possible. Can you help with this? So far I have found these:   * Most of the competitors are using Java (anyway not PHP)   * Most financial companies use Java rather than PHP   * On average, Java developers are better prepared (on average!)   * The compilation process catches a lot of problems before the software runs in production   * Strong typing makes everything more robust as contracts between interfaces is well defined Any other points I am missing? Thanks!
