I have always "custom developed" software for clients. This means:   * Develop the software   * Install SQL Express on client site   * Import DB, create DB user, set DB permissions etc.   * Install software on client site (multiple pc's)   * Voila! Now, I am looking at deploying your basic "end user" app, to a mass of unknown audience. I.e. your basic app someone will download. What are the best common methods for deploying an app with a database? I am looking for the classic (one setup app, deploying both app and db) without the user needing to do some technical configs. I would appreciate some ideas...
