In Common Lisp, `defmacro` basically allows us to build our own DSL. I read this page today and it explains something cleverly done: > But I wasn't about to write out all these boring predicates myself, so I > defined a function that, given a list of words, builds up the text for such > a predicate automatically, and then evals it to produce a function. Which just looks like `defmacro` to me. Is `eval` the `defmacro` of javascript? Could it be used as such?
