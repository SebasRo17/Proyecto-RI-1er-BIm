I am a freelance web developer geared towards Ruby on Rails. The main components of my current working environment are a 27" **iMac** , **Textmate** and **git** /github (which is not going to change any time soon). What I am looking for is a nice little/portable laptop that will allow me to make a quick `get-in/fix-something/test/push/get-out` dance when not at home (home is where I work from). I am fairly familiar with Linux and Vim and I think I can easily work with both environments (OSX and Linux). Granted that the laptop will only be used occasionally and in a hurry, **is there something I should be worried about when working with OSX and Linux at the same time?** (mind you that the laptop will solely be used for work and thus there is no requirement for it to be able to manage my photo library) **Anyone had an experience with a relevant setup?** * * * **EDIT:** I would like to stress it a little more since some answers have diverged from it. **What I am looking for is help for a secondary machine for RoR, not a primary one** Thus:   * battery life is not an issue - I believe 2-3 hours is all I'm going to require of it, so the clear Mac hardware advantage evaporates   * I'm not compiling any code - no fast CPU needed (I'm not really familiar with what is needed for compiling)
