I am currently a freelancer (JavaScript) developer, and now I am striving to work more on freelance marketplaces. Some time I want to move from Russia to Canada and find full-time work there. So: How I might provide evidence of expertise in this case? I can not just say in my resume/CV "I was super JavaScript Developer in the MacroHard from 2011 to 2017". Are my accounts (and 4,5/5 star rating) on these marketplaces will be relevant and adequate to show to the potential new employer (urls in the CV, for example)? Or maybe I should just add description of most interesting projects? I have found this article: http://gettingtozen.com/2010/10/how-to-list-your- freelancing-and-self-employment-experience-on-your-resume/ Author gives advice to not include many references to the freelance projects, but his field is not an IT (freelance corporate trainer). In my point of view, it is not very applicable for a Software Developer, since as Software Developer you can explicitly point to the application you worked with. Also, an option here is to refer yourself as "individual entrepreneur" instead of "freelance contractor". My experience in North American employment traditions is zero, so I hope to get advice from colleagues and HRs.
