I've decided to create a programming language of my own, mostly just for fun. However, I got interested in the legal aspect of it all. You can, for example, licence specific programs under specific terms. However, how do you go about licensing a _language_? Also, by that I don't just mean the implementation of the language (compiler & VM), but the standard itself. Is there something else to a programming language I'm missing? What I would like to achieve by such licensing:   1. Make it completely FOSS (can a language even be FOSS, or is that the implementation that can be FOSS?)   2. Establish myself as the author (can you legally be an author of a language? Or, again, just the implementation?)   3. Make it so that anyone implementing my language would be required to attribute me (MIT-style. Please note that I do not have any hopes for anyone actually ever doing that though, I'm just learning.) I think that the solution would be to separately license the VM and the compiler for my language, as "the official implementation", and then license the design document _as the language itself_. What exactly am I missing here?
