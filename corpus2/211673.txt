I've started a project that involves at least three repositories on GitHub. One of the repositories is a generic documentation-and-examples dump, and the other two contain the implementation of two programs that form the backbone of the project. Should I use a GitHub Organization to handle such a configuration?   Or should I just dump it all to my own account, along with a dozen other, completely unrelated repositories?
