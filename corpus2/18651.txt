I am fairly new to _Mathematica_ and am trying to write a function for the equation:               xx = [x/(Sqrt[h^2 + d^2 + y^2]))*(Sqrt[h^2 + (d + yy)^2])      where h, d are known and x, y and yy are functions that give lists of numbers of equal list length. Is there a way to write a function that encompasses all the variables x, y, yy? I'm assuming it would start with               xx[x_, y_, yy_] := .........      or is the best method to create a loop?
