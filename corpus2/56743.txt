I'm trying to understand how to easily solve equations that use `QuantityVariable`. Why does this fail?               Quantity["Speed of Light"] ==         QuantityVariable[ν, "Frequency"] (2 π)/QuantityVariable[k, "wavenumber"] /.           QuantityVariable[ν, "Frequency"] -> Quantity[2, "THz"]     // Solve      > Solve::units: Solve was unable to determine the units of quantities that > appear in the input. >> while this doesn't?               Solve[      QuantityVariable[k, "wavenumber"] == (2 π)/QuantityVariable[λ, "Wavelength"],       QuantityVariable[λ, "Wavelength"]]      > >     {{QuantityVariable[λ,"Wavelength"] -> (2 > π)/QuantityVariable[k,"wavenumber"]}} >   Nor does this,               Solve[ 3 10^8 == 2 10^12 (2 π)/k]      > >     {{k -> (40000 π)/3}} >   Notice that its not necessary to explicitly say which variable to solve in the last example as there is only one possibility, yet that fails if using `QuantityVariable`. The question is: Why does my first code fails?
