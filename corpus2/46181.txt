I have seen questions on saving data on "global" context. Now if I set my notebook's evaluation context "unique to this notebook". the global context doesn't work quite well. Any idea what should i do to save every variable to a file in such a case? Thanks! OK, solved. What I should do is to replace "Global`" by whatever $Context returns (Actually we should have a feature request so that Mathematica automatically saves everything in the notebook.)
