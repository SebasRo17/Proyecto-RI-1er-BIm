I always wanted to use randomly generated strings for my resources' IDs, so I could have shorter URLs like this: /user/4jz0k1 But I never did, because I was worried about the random string generation creating actual words, eg: /user/f*cker. This brings two problems: it might be confusing or even offensive for users, and it could mess with the SEO too. Then I thought all I had to do was to set up a fixed pattern like adding a number every 2 letters. I was very happy with my 'generate_safe_uuid' method, but then I realized it was only better for SEO, and worse for users, because it increased the ratio of actual words being generated, eg: /user/g4yd1ck5 Now I'm thinking I could create a method 'replace_numbers_with_letters', and check that it haven't formed any words against a dictionary or something. Any other ideas? ps. As I write this, I also realized that checking for words in more than one language (eg: english and french, spanish, etc) would be a mess, and I'm starting to love numbers-only IDs again. **UPDATE** Some links everyone should read: http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/The-Automated-Curse-Generator.aspx http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/06/27/8659071.aspx
