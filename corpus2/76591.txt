I've spent too much time on setup & maintain a development server, which contains following tools:   * Common services like SSH, BIND, rsync, etc.   * Subversion, Git.   * Apache server, which runs CGit, Trac, Webmin, phpmyadmin, phppgadmin, etc.   * Jetty, which runs Archiva and Hudson.   * Bugzilla.   * PostgresSQL server, MySQL server. I've created a lot of Debian packages, like `my-trac-utils`, `my-bugzilla- utils`, `my-bind9-utils`, `my-mysql-utils`, etc. to make my life more convenient. However, I still feel I need a lot more utils. And I've spent a lot of time to maintain these packages, too. I think there maybe many developers doing the same things. As tools like subversion, git, trac are so common today. It's not to hard to install and configure each of them, but it took a long time to install them all. And it's time consuming to maintain them. Like backup the data, plot the usage graph and generate web reports. (gitstat for example) So, I'd like to hear if there exist any pre-configured distro for Development Server purpose, i.e., something like `BackTrack` for hackers?
