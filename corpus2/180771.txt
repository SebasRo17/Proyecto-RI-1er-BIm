One of things that annoys me about SQL is that it can't think in terms of objects and it's lack of encapsulation makes me constantly have to escape commands to prevent injections. I want a database language that can be polymorphic and secure. I have searched online for non-procedural database programming languages and so far my google search has been unsuccessful. I know in languages like php there are ways to prevent the injections by making the PHP encapsulated well, but not all database programming situations involve embedding the database language in another language. In situations where it's database programming only, is there a database programming language that is object oriented in itself? If not, are they working on one?
