The only programming language I ever used 'seriously' to create relatively big applications, is Java. Thus, I'm very familiar with the fact that Java offers a lot of built-in libraries that help with lots of tasks, that otherwise you'd have to implement yourself. But I wanted to ask: Does Java offer significantly more built-in libraries than other modern OO languages, for example C#? Is Java especially generous in the libraries it gives you, compared to other modern languages? Also, as a different question: Is it considered 'less proferssional' to often use the built-in libraries instead of implementing thing by yourself?
