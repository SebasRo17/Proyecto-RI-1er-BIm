I'm having trouble with the simplifications of certain expressions.   A typical example of this is the following (all my variables are positive real numbers):               k1 = Exp[-t1/al];     et2 = 1 + Exp[-t6/al];     xi2 = 1 + Exp[-t6/al] + Exp[-(t4 + t6)/al];     Log[k1] Log[et2/xi2]      This produces $$ \log\left(e^{-t1/\alpha}\right) \log\left(\dfrac{1+e^{-t6/\alpha}}{1+e^{-(t4+t6)/\alpha} + e^{-t6/\alpha}}\right)$$ Now, I want to get rid of that trivial $\log(\exp)$, so I used `Simplify`               Simplify[%, Element[{t1, t4, t6, al}, Reals] && al != 0]      which gives $$ -\dfrac{t1}{\alpha}\log\left(\dfrac{e^{t4/\alpha}(1+e^{t6/\alpha})}{ 1 + e^{t4/\alpha}+e^{(t4 + t6)/\alpha}}\right)$$ This is right, of course, but unfortunately it produces an undesired effect: inside the second logarithm, Mathematica has factored $e^{-t4/\alpha}$ and $e^{-(t4+t6)/\alpha}$, turning negative powers in positive ones.   At the end of the day, I will let $\alpha\to0$, so really I'm more comfortable with negative powers of $e$ (it is apparent which terms will be negligible in the limit). **How can I tell Mathematica not to touch the argument of the second logarithm?**
