I have seen several applications that claim to convert Java code to valid C or even C++. Converting from a high level language to a low level language is possible, no doubt about it. At least in theory, can the reverse be done _without_ any manual steps? For instance:   * Converting Assembly to C or Machine Code to Assembly?   * Hardware Description Languages (HDL) to Assembly? (which ever is lowest?)   * C to C#?
