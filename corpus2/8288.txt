So I set a function f[x]               f[x_] := x*E^(-x) - 0.16064      Then I set a variable 'actualroot' to the function FindRoot, starting at 3               actualroot = FindRoot[ f[x], {x, 3} ]      and get the output               {x -> 2.88976}      Later I want to compare this output with a different estimate (-2.88673) of the root, and calculate error, so I have               Abs[ (actualroot - estimateroot)/actualroot ]      and i get this output:               Abs[ (-2.88673 + (x -> 2.88976))/(x -> 2.88976) ]      How do I get mathematica to evaluate this expression? I also tried using N[] to give me a decimal evaluation but it didn't work.
