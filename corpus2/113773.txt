I'm learning Java, and I found a great teacher. He explains everything perfectly. I understand it _all_. My problem, is that after learning a short section, for example "Nested If Statements" or "Many Methods and Instances", I can type it all great, but in 5 mins, after going on to a new section (when I'm comfortable with the last section) I forget the code to type for the last section. Any tips or techniques you guys use to remember code????
