I would like to ask you as experts about PHP, ASP.NET/C#, Python or any other server side language. How do they span multiple servers? When I see a big website and look how many dedicated servers it uses, at least it uses 10 servers. I sit and think how the langauge that was used in building this site span these servers? Is there something in the language itself or its architecture that make it able to go with this **and is there some language that are better than others regarding this?** **Edit:** But I see many ASP.NET and PHP powered sites that are on many servers, in this case how can the same programmed site be on server 1, on server 2, etc. Does **Server 1** contain some functionality for example and **Server 2** contain others? Or do they just progrm the site and the hosting company makes balance between these servers?
