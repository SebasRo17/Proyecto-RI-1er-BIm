Mathematica can do a RecurrenceTable with a vector, here is a simple example:               RecurrenceTable[{x[n + 1] == 2* x[n], x[0] == {1, 2, 3}}, x, {n,  3}]      with output > {{1, 2, 3}, {2, 4, 6}, {4, 8, 12}, {8, 16, 24}} I want to do something similar but instead of multiplying by 2 I want to multiple each element in x[n] by a different number. For example, one would think that this would work:               RecurrenceTable[{x[n + 1] == {1,2,3}* x[n], x[0] == {1, 2, 3}}, x, {n,  3}]      since Times is listable but I get an error > RecurrenceTable::excptn: Value {1,2,3,2,4,6,3,6,9} is a numerical exception. > >> I get the same result using MapThread etc. Thoughts?
