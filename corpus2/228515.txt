Scheduled website testing: Searching for a simple solution. One of my clients is having some tens of sites, with webform-based landing pages. He wants to daily test 3 different use-cases pre site, in order to make sure the site is working properly. I need to test the following use-cases:   1. Sanity test - check one page per site, to verify it loads and linked fields are not broken.   2. Webform test - verify that the user is redirected to the thankyou page when a webform is submitted.   3. Lead test - verify that a lead is recorded on the external CRM system when the webform is filled (the external CRM system has a web service interface which may be called from remote). The tests have to run from a remote server (the server doesn't allow for an internal cron). What is the quickest open-source tool to record such a test and run it daily from the cloud (or from my own external server, a dedicated ubuntu machine), then report if something happened?   * Is there a simple solution, where I simply record the test from a browser, then add parameters and schedule it to run daily via cron?    * Can installing BeHat on the external server up to the job?   * What about Selenium? (saucelabs, xml2selenium)?   * Can saucelabs-like cloud services do it alone, or do I need Jenkins CI as well?
