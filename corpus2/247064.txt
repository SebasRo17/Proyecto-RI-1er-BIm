We use RavenDB as our data store for transactional information, and it works well for data that is currently "in use". We also collect audit events as people use our application, where each event looks something like:   * Type, date, summary, etc. - pretty standard   * Related document IDs (could be one, could be 5) As a document store, Raven does a great job of indexing these so that we can ask questions like "find all events related to document XYZ". Unfortunately as the data builds up over time, these audit events can account for 90% of the data stored in our database - and it's rarely used. We'd like to get this data out of Raven, and into some kind of storage that might be better suited. What other storage solutions exist for storing hundreds of thousands of audit- type events? We're happy to sacrifice speed to save storage and indexing costs.
