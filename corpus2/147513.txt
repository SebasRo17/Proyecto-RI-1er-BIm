Should the developers who creates programs with Delphi, FPC, Lazarus agree with the name of the language? This struck me since every possible variation not only adds confusion for new programmers, also when I write or name each of them, I feel that it's not fully correct.   * Pascal. We know how Wirth dislikes OOP, so this plain naming is not correct. There were years where there were no objects in Pascal so it's also not correct to name it Pascal.    * Delphi ("please, give me a link to the code fragment in Delphi"). Seeing how strong fpc/Lazarus is while keeping the high level of compatibility, now it's also isn't completely correct.   * Object Pascal. Seems like a good choice, but the only places where it used noticeably is Delphi help and Wikipedia. And seems like there's even no badge "Object Pascal" at stackexchange/stackoverflow.  This also makes me sad because the developer of other languages don't hesitate at this moment. They can mention multiply compilers or dialects, but rarely hesitate in how to name the language.
