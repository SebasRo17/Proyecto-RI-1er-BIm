I've got my BSc in Computer Science 4 years ago and I feel like I've forgotten everything I learnt. I still know the basics such as CPU, mohterboard, RAM, software, hardware, etc but I forgot how they work exactly. In general, I know what a programming language is and I have worked with Java when I was at Uni. To be honest I was just trying to solve the assignments in that time and now I've found I have some interest in programming and I chose C# because I can use it for web and for desktop applications. Now, I want to learn C#. Is there any prerequisites for that? I mean do I need to come back to all the materials that I did study on my BSc? Or can I srart learning immediately?
