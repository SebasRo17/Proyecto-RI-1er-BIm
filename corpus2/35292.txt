Could anyone help me with plotting the following graph?               Integrate (-Inf, Inf) (exp(-i*x*t))/((4*pi)((x-1)^2 +25)(exp(-100x) +1))      It's not a code obviously, but I don't need a code, it's simple enough. Mathematica times out when I try to pot this. Is there a way around it? Could anyone try and plot it? Further info: Plot for t = 0 to 100. And the integration is over x.
