Which of these is better for maintainability?               if (byteArrayVariable != null)         if (byteArrayVariable .Length != 0)              //Do something with byteArrayVariable       OR               if ((byteArrayVariable != null) && (byteArrayVariable.Length != 0))       //Do something with byteArrayVariable       I prefer reading and writing the second, but I recall reading in code complete that doing things like that is bad for maintainability. This is because you are relying on the language to not evaluate the second part of the `if` if the first part is false and not all languages do that. (The second part will throw an exception if evaluated with a null `byteArrayVariable`.) I don't know if that is really something to worry about or not, and I would like general feedback on the question. Thanks.
