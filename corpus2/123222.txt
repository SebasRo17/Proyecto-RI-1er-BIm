I'm planning to build a payment receipt/booking application for a media company with several branches in different locations. The application should be able to move data across the network/internet to a central database where the administrator/accountant in a different location will be able to see the result of the entire job for the day from each branch. Application will run on windows environment. Will be able to send result of the booking to a Point Of Sales printer for print output. Now, I'm confused about choosing the right programming language to accomplish this task. I'm between beginner/intermediate level in PHP, I know HTML/CSS and JavaScript. I have tried to do this in PHP but, I'm face with several challenges and I fear for the POS part since PHP application run on the web browser. I don't know if python will be best suited for this and how long will it take someone with my experience level to pick up python. Any suggestion will be highly appreciated.
