This question is about good design practice in programming. Let see this example, we have 2 interrelated tables:               Table1     textID - text     1      - love..     2      - men...     ...          Table2     rID - textID     1   - 1     2   - 2     ...      Note: In Table1:   * `textID` is auto_increment primary key  In Table2:   * `rID` is auto_increment primary key & `textID` is foreign key   * The relationship is that 1 `rID` will have 1 and only 1 `textID` but 1 `textID` can have a few `rID`. So, when table1 got modification then table2 should be updated accordingly. Ok, here is a fictitious example. You build a very complicated system. When you modify 1 record in table1, you need to keep track of the related record in table2. To keep track, you can do like this: **Option 1** : When you modify a record in table1, you will try to modify a related record in table 2. This could be quite hard in term of programming expecially for a very very complicated system. **Option 2** : instead of modifying a related record in table2, you decided to delete old record in table 2 & insert new one. This is easier for you to program. For example, suppose you are using option2, then when you modify `record 1,2,3,....,100` in table1, the table2 will look like this:               Table2     rID   - textID     101   - 1     102   - 2     ...     200   - 100      This means the **Max** of auto_increment IDs in table1 is still the same (100) but the **Max** of auto_increment IDs in table2 already reached 200. what if the user modify many times? if they do then the table2 may run out of records? we can use `BigInt` but that make the app run slower? Note: If you spend time to program to modify records in table2 when table1 got modified then it will be very hard & thus it will be error prone. But if you just clear the old record & insert new records into table2 then it is much easy to program & thus your program is simpler & less error prone. **So, is it good practice to keep 2 related tables (using auto_increment PK) to have the same Max of auto_increment ID when table1 got modified?**
