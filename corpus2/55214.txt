I created with `Tuples[{{USD, EUR, JPY}, {UP, DOWN}}]` the following result: `{{USD, UP}, {USD, DOWN}, {EUR, UP}, {EUR, DOWN}, {JPY, UP}, {JPY, DOWN}}` I want to further have a 3 dimensional list of all combinations - but the same currency does not appear twice. Example output `{{{USD, UP}, {EUR, UP}, {JPY, UP}}, {{USD, UP}, {EUR, UP}, {JPY, DOWN}}, {{USD, UP}, {EUR, DOWN}, {JPY, UP}}, {{USD, UP}, {EUR, DOWN}, {JPY, DOWN}}, ... {{USD, DOWN}, {EUR, DOWN}, {JPY, DOWN}}}` Is there a simple way to do it?
