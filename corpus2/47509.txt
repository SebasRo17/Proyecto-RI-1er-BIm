For quite a while now I've been wondering how to assign variables programmatically, and I have finally figured out one way of doing this. For example in a game where you have a variable number of players and you want to assign all players a list with specific numbers. You want to create a variable `player1` for the first player, `player2` for the second, and so on. However you don't want to create excess players, nor do you want to create too few, but you want to make sure you only create as many players as are needed. This is what I've done so far:               Do[ToExpression["ClearAll[player" <> ToString[i] <> "]"], {i, 1000}];     players =       Table[numOfPlayers = i;        ToExpression["player" <> ToString[i] <> "=Table[i+j,{j,0,10}]"], {i,         3}]      The `Do` loop clears all `player`s up to 1000. The `Table` then creates as many players as required. My question is, although this method works, it's messy and I would rather not use `ToExpression` if I can avoid it (Wolfram don't like it when `ToExpression` is used in Demonstrations for example). Is there an alternative way of creating and assigning variables programmatically?
