I have MS C# and MS SQL 2008 database project. It can capture employees' records with pictures of more than 1000 records. Presently, I'm able to capture say 150 records on PC1 using my installed C# application, save the records into XML or CSV file format. My friends are able to continue registration or entering (i.e from 151 to 1000) after restoring or uploading the information contained in that XML or CSV using another copy of my C# application installed on their laptops at another location.   1. How can the content be hidden or locked from user viewing its content except for my C# app reading or writing to it (not necessarily in XML or CSV format)?   2. If I still use same XML or CSV, how can the file be compressed to smaller sizes?
