I am not sure if this is the right place to ask this but I wrote an app that shows all the movies in one's computer with the appropriate info such as genre, director, rating, etc. I am wondering how can I make it so that the user can filter them based on criteria such as genre, rating, etc? Most of them are enums, and I was thinking of using a `ComboBox` for these but they should be able to specify more than 1 genre. So should I use `ListBox` controls for these? Then it will be harder to present all these options in listboxes. I haven't seen any examples of apps doing similar things, that's why I am not sure. Any ideas? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/FXk8Q.png)
