For example,               Collect[(1 + x + Cos[s] x^2)^3, x]      gives the result               1 + 3 x + 3 x^5 Cos[s]^2 + x^6 Cos[s]^3 + x^2 (3 + 3 Cos[s]) + x^3 (1 + 6 Cos[s])           + x^4 (3 Cos[s] + 3 Cos[s]^2)      Terms of the form $x^n$ are in random order. I would like the result is to be as follows:                1 + 3 x + x^2 (3 + 3 Cos[s]) + x^3 (1 + 6 Cos[s]) +          x^4 (3 Cos[s] + 3 Cos[s]^2) + 3 x^5 Cos[s]^2 + x^6 Cos[s]^3      * * * Well, First Thank you very much, Jens! Second, I found there is something wrong with your statement "the HoldForm could be left out". I have tried on my mathematica 8, it turns out that the "HoldForm" is necessary . if "HoldForm" is not there, the order is still random in the output . And I tried to understand this as well as "rule" and "ruledelayed" stuff but can't figure it out. I have tried several input, each confused me. summarized as follows   1. `Replace[cx, List[x__] -> Plus[x]]` will give              Sequence[1, 3 x, x^2 (3 + 3 Cos[s]), x^3 (1 + 6 Cos[s]), x^4 (3 Cos[s] + 3 Cos[s]^2), 3 x^5 Cos[s]^2, x^6 Cos[s]^3]       But I suppose it should give the Plus result because              Replace[cx, List[x__] -> jjj[x]]      gives              jjj[1, 3 x, x^2 (3 + 3 Cos[s]), x^3 (1 + 6 Cos[s]),  x^4 (3 Cos[s] + 3 Cos[s]^2), 3 x^5 Cos[s]^2, x^6 Cos[s]^3]        2. `Replace[cx, List[x__] -> HoldForm@Plus[x]]` gives the right result              1 + 3 x + x^2 (3 + 3 Cos[s]) + x^3 (1 + 6 Cos[s]) +  x^4 (3 Cos[s] + 3 Cos[s]^2) + 3 x^5 Cos[s]^2 + x^6 Cos[s]^3        3. `Replace[cx, List[x__] :> Plus[x]]` gives              1 + 3 x + 3 x^5 Cos[s]^2 + x^6 Cos[s]^3 + x^2 (3 + 3 Cos[s]) + x^3 (1 + 6 Cos[s]) + x^4 (3 Cos[s] + 3 Cos[s]^2)      Although it gives the right plus result, the order is wrong.
