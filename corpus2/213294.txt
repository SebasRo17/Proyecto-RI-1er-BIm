I'm developing a simple text editor, just to practice a little bit. I'm developing it under Linux but since I am using Qt as GUI Framework I can easily compile this on a Windows or Mac with the same code (in other words, it's cross-platform). Qt offers a function `QIcon::fromTheme()`. This function allows me to get the standard Icon for e.g. the _New Document_ Icon and use it for whatever I want. These Icons are sadly only available on Linux. However, I wrote a simple function to save these icons as PNG files in different formats (16x16 up to 1024x1024) so that I can use these on a Windows as well. Now my question, is it even legal to use these images on windows as well? And would you find it strange if such icons appear in a windows program? Because Linux has a whole different style than windows... Same thing with OS X'. The _New Document_ Icon for example would look similar to this:   http://findicons.com/files/icons/2455/web_icons/48/empty_document_new.png
