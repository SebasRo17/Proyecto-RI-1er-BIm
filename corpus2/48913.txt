Suppose I have some data for a bar chart:               testdata = Map[{1, #} &, RandomReal[{-0.5, 4}, {3, 2}], {2}]     (* {{{1, 3.30023}, {1, 3.814}}, {{1, -0.353959}, {1, -0.364447}}, {{1,           1.82514}, {1, 2.56824}}} *)          RectangleChart[testdata, BarOrigin -> Left, Frame -> True,        ChartStyle -> {Red, Blue}, BarSpacing -> {-0.2, 0.6}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/05mW9.png) But what I really want is for the shorter, red bars to overlap _on top_ of the blue bars, not underneath.               RectangleChart[Reverse /@ testdata, BarOrigin -> Left, Frame -> True,        ChartStyle -> {Blue, Red}, BarSpacing -> {-0.2, 0.6}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/jRbXf.png) That works, but the red bars only overlap if they are _above_ the blue bars. If I had set `BarOrigin->Bottom`, the red bars would then be on the right.               RectangleChart[Reverse /@ testdata, Frame -> True,        ChartStyle -> {Blue, Red}, BarSpacing -> {-0.2, 0.6}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/yMs9p.png) Conceptually this is because later data prints after earlier data, so groups of bars on the right or at the top are "later" and print on top of the "earlier" bars on the left or below. This makes sense to me, but not to the person I am drawing the graph for. Is there any way to reverse the bar ordering such that the bars at the bottom of the group overlap on top of the upper bars when one has negative `BarSpacing`?
