I'm trying to develop a small image viewer just as an exercise to sharpen my programming skills. So far , all the features that I could think of adding to it are zooming in and out, inverting the colors of the image and resizing. Could anyone suggest me a few more features?? You are also welcome to suggest anything which has not been implemented yet. I would like to take it as a learning challenge. Thanks.
