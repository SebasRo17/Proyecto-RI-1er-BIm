I am looking for a method in Mathematica 8 to define my own derivative/variation (independent of built-in operations). I do not want to re-define built-in objects since I fear that this could cause subtle changes at different places. Does anybody know how to define such a "proto-derivative"? I would be thankful for posting a code and some explanations/documentation or a link to some document where it is described in detail.
