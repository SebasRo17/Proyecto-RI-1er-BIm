I open a new notebook and type               ClearAll[test];     test[x_] := x + 42;      I save it as `Temp.nb` and _also_ as `Temp.m`, using the menu _Save As... > Wolfram Mathematica Package (*.m)_. I now open up another notebook and type               << "Temp.m"      which succeeds. But the symbol `test` is not defined.               ?? test      > >     Information::notfound: Symbol test not found. >> >                 test[3]      > >     test[3] >   I'm confused, because the documentation for `Get`, a.k.a., `<<`, says > << name reads in a file, evaluating each expression in it and returning the > last one. It should have evaluated the expressions in `Temp.m`, then, I should think, and returned the [value of] the last one, which would be `Null`. One of those expressions is a `SetDelayed` for the symbol `test` and should have installed `test` in the Global namespace, no? Fresh kernel session, fresh reboot of MMA, also fails if file is saved as _Wolfram Language Package (*.wl)_ , yada yada.
