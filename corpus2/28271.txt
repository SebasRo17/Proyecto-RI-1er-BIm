Let's say I solve a system:               Solve[{a == 3* c, b == 2 *a}, {a, b}]      and then want to see if the values found for `a` and `b` satisfy an inequality:               Reduce[a < 7 b]      What I would usually do is copy and paste by hand the result of the `Solve[]` to make it available to `Reduce`:               Solve[{a == 3* c, b == 2 *a}, {a, b}]     (output) {{a -> 3 c, b -> 6 c}}          a = 3 c;     b = 6 c;     Reduce[a < 7 b]      but there must be a better way to do this? I would also like all those variables (`a`,`b` and `c`) to stay local because I will have to solve a lot of similar equations with the same variable names on the same notebook and I wouldn't want the values to mix.
