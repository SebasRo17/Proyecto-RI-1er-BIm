I have a function, `explicit` that takes dot product of two symbols, and replaces it with repeated dummy indices generated by `Unique[]`.               explicit[expr_] :=        expr //. {Dot[a_, b_] :> (Subscript[a, #] Subscript[b, #]) &[       Unique[]]};      So that if my input is `v.w`, then the output is $v_{$3}w_{$3}$ which is good. The problem is that if there is a single term multiplying two pairs of dot products, I don't know how to get `Unique[]` to generate a new symbol for each pair. That is, if I input `c.d e.f` the output is $c_{$3}d_{$3}e_{$3}f_{$3}$, which is bad. I want $c_{$3}d_{$3}e_{$4}f_{$4}$, with new repeated subscripts. How do I modify my code?
