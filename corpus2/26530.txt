I've been looking at a number of OSS java projects and a number of them still have not adopted generics. They're using raw types (e.g. `List foo`) instead of generic types (e.g. `List<string> foo`). Other projects have only begun using generics in the last few years even thought they've been around for a long time. I'm interested to know why people and projects eschew the use of generics when there appears (to me) to be now downside in using them instead of rawtypes. For those of you who use java, but not generics, what (if anything) would make you switch?
