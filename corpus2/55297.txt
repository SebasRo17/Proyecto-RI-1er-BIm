I've been developing Java EE web apps with Eclipse for about a year. My employer doesn't use Maven, but the more I read about it, the more convinced I am that Maven + Hudson will be greatly beneficial for us. First, though, I have to become comfortable with those technologies in my spare time, so that I can create a proof-of-concept. Right now, I'm still a Maven newbie. Is there a set of best practices for creating Java EE web apps with Maven? For example, I could create a project with a basic archetype and then add all of the necessary JARs by putting dependencies in the POM for the servlet container, EJB, EclipseLink, etc... That might work, but it might not be the best way to do it. I'd greatly appreciate any guidance that you could provide on this topic.
