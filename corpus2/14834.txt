![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BSRuw.png)I'm using one of _Mathematica_ 's built-in stylesheets, "Standard Report". When I enter an expression into an input cell and evaluate it, the input is shown with a white background, while the output has a grey background. However, when I generate a plot, the numbers on the axes have white boxes around them, which looks stupid next to the grey background. How would I get rid of these white boxes? Thanks!
