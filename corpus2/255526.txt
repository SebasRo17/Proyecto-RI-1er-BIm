I'm new on Java and I have experience building Node.js apps, so I'm thinking to create a program that it's kind of "multi-platform" where there's going to be a tablet kindle that's going to run the Java app, a PC that will show queues made from this java app in many tablets and another PC that's going to manage the data on the application (those could be web application from Node.js). So, Node.js could be the server managing queries and database while Java could be on Kindle Fire app making requests to the server, I really don't know Java too much but by the time I don't know if this project structure is fine, maybe it could work better using both sides on Java or Node.js web-app. Let's say this project is for a restaurant, waiters are going to have kindle fire (java app) instead of books, on a side there's going to be a big screen showing queues (this could be shown from Node.js) made from waiters on kindles, and the entrance there's going to be a PC that's going to manage the money and other stuff (maybe Node.js as well).
