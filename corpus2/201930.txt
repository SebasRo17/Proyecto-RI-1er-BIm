I'm currently working on an internal web application for my company in node.js We want to have certain configuration settings be changeable by management. For example, we pre-print some labels automatically during receiving if the quantity is less than 5 so the user doesn't have to stop to confirm a print dialog. What if we wanted to shift this to any quantities less than 10 because it is found to be more efficient? My question is this: What's the best approach to save custom configuration settings if I was to create an area for changing these params on their dashboard? Would saving this information in a json formatted text file on the server and then just parsing it using fs every time be the best way? or is there something I'm not thinking of? Thank you in advance.
