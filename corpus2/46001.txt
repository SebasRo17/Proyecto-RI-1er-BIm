We have index pages, running on an Apache Tomcat server, with links to other pages. > Welcome, you. What would you like to do? > > _Goto page x_ > > _Goto page y_ These links are hard coded. I want to be able to manage the index pages in a more dynamic way. So that I don't have to pull down the page, cause temporary down time, change / add links, and then have to redeploy. What route should I take?
