Suppose that I define               f = Function[#1 + #2];      And I want to define a new function, `argsNum`, so that it returns a number of arguments of input function:               argsNum[f]      > >     2 >   since `f` has 2 slots, `#1` and `#2`. I found the good Q&A, Function that counts the number of arguments of other functions but it does not work on functions of form like `Function[#1 + #2]` or etc. It works on `Function[{x, y}, x + y]`. But I need a function that works on slots. How can I modify the function in above link or define a new function which also works on slots?
