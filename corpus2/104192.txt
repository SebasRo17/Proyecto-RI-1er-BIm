Say you left your previous employer about 3.5 years ago to pursue a growth opportunity, my primary motivation for moving. If a position currently opens up in that same company today for a Software Team Lead, would you:   1. Apply for this position, if you still have a lot of good relationships    2. If you would apply and can speak to the Engineering Director, who did all he could to keep you, would you call him to discuss about their needs and your interest? If not, how would you go about this? As the Engineering Director, would you consider this candidate for Software Team Lead who left you 3 years ago despite all you tried to do to keep him, knowing that this guy has a tendency to seek opportunities for growth every 3-5 years? Yes, this person meets all of the requirements and has the potential to be a good leader.
