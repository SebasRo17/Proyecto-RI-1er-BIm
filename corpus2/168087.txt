I would like to learn federated WCF service. I have the following in my system. • Windows XP • Visual Studio 2010 Express • SQL Server 2008 Express Is it possible to create a federated service sample with this infrastructure? Is there any article for that? **UPDATE** Federation: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms730908.aspx Federation Sample: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa355045.aspx
