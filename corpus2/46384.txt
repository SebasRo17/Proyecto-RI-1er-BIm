**a.** Make a function `longest[lang_]` that gives the length of the longest word in the dictionary of lang. You should get `longest["French"]=25` For this part, I have `lang = DictionaryLookup[All];`   `longest[lang_] := Max[StringLength[lang]]` But this isn't working. **b.** Now give a list with entries `{language,longest[language]}`. `Table[{lang[[i]], Length[DictionaryLookup[{lang[[i]], All}]]}, {i, 1, Length[lang]}]` Again not working **c.** Make a function `lonegestwords[lang_]` that gives the output `{longest[lang],lang,longwords}` where `longwords` is the list of the words of longest length in lang. I tried `longestwords[lang_] := {longest[lang], lang, Select[DictionaryLookup[{lang, All}], StringLength[#] == longest[lang] &]}` **d.** Now get the list with entries `longestwords[lang]` for all languages and sort it in descending order by the longest word. I know that I have to use `Sort[longestwords[lang],#2[[1]]<#1[[1]]&]` But since I don't have the function, I can't do it.
