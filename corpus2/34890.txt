Imagine I have two sets of points:               pointSetPerfect = Flatten[Table[{i, j}, {i, 10, 40, 10}, {j, 10, 40, 10}], 1];          pointSetNoise = Table[pointSetPerfect[[i]] + RandomReal[{-2, 2} - 100], {i, 1, Length[pointSetPerfect]}];          r = RotationTransform[47.5 Degree, {0, 2}];     pointSetNoise = r[pointSetNoise];          ListPlot[{pointSetPerfect, pointSetNoise}]      Without knowing what I did above to generate `pointSetNoise`, I would like to overlay, as best as I can, a set of points on `pointSetNoise` with the same interpoint spacings as in the point set `pointSetPerfect`, and return these coordinates. If necessary, I could also click on the image to specify by eye a (very approximate) 1-to-1 mapping between points in either set. Is there a nice way of doing this in Mathematica v9?
