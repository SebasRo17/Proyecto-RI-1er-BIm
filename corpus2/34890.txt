This question I am asking because I couldn't find any source which gives complete overview of java development. I just want to know where java technology currently in market & what is preferable for development ! Java always remain top programming language for development point of view. However, java is combo of, j2ee, j2me, jsp, jsf, spring, other frameworks, ui components, jndi, networking tools and various other "J" are there ! However, learning java is definitely dependent on the development requirement, but still, to be a well-experienced java developer, what is the organised way of learning java? What is preferable in current technology ? and what is deprecated, currently ?
