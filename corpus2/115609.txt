This question might look like a mix of Is it unusual for a small company (15 developers) not to use managed source/version control? and How to convince a teammate, who sees oneself as senior, to learn SVN conceptual basics?. My interest is purely academical, since the company mentioned here does not exist any more, but it keeps popping up in discussions, so I would really like to hear the community's thoughts on how to behave in such situation. It has happened to me twice, with the most recent example being more interesting: I visited a company for a interview and was being asked for subversion experience. After that I got into an extensive QnA related concepts such as branching/merging, access rights etc. At the end I got the job. From my first day there, I saw that everyone was using a shared drive where they coded. Because subversion was used as a backup, people had to commit from their local machines, on a windows shared drive, which made each commit sometimes to last more than 30 minutes (I do not know the internals of why), while sometimes encountering locks or any othere issues where encountered. There was a template project from which we did a "branch". No merges anywhere. So once confronting my line manager about it I got told that we have an svn installation and that we use it properly, obviously we did not. So what should the appropriate action for developer/employee do in such case(s)?   * Nothing, accept it as a difference in perspective,   * Leave   * Try to educate the team
