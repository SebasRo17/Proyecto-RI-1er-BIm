I am trying to draw a picture using Mathematica of three loops linking together in 3D as follows. ![3D visualization](http://i.stack.imgur.com/V6spd.png)               Module[{r = 0.03, col1, col2, col3}, {col1, col2, col3} =      ColorData["HTML"] /@ {"Firebrick", "ForestGreen", "RoyalBlue"};     Graphics3D[{{{{col2,          Rotate[#, π/12, {0, 0, 1}, {0, 0, 0}]}, {col3,          Rotate[#, -π/12, {0, 0, 1}, {0, 0, 0}]}} &@      Translate[       Tube[Table[         0.5 {Cos[θ], 0, Sin[θ]}, {θ, 0,           2 π, π/24}], r], {1, 0, 0}]}, {col1,      Tube[Table[{Cos[θ], Sin[θ], 0}, {θ, 0,         2 π, π/24}], r]}},     ViewPoint -> {5, 0, 2}, Boxed -> False, Lighting -> "Neutral"]]      I used Graphics3D and Tube to draw the above picture. But I found that it is not easy to see which line is in front of which. So then I use Graphics and Circle to draw the following 2D picture, in which the overlapping relation is represented by a small gap of the underlying line at the intersection. ![2D visualization](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XbhOE.png)               Module[{col1, col2, col3},     {col1, col2, col3} =      ColorData["HTML"] /@ {"Firebrick", "ForestGreen", "RoyalBlue"};      Graphics[{{col1, Circle[{0, 0}, {2, 1}]},      Translate[{{White, Disk[{-0.47, -0.08}, 0.15]}, col2,       Circle[{0, 0}, {0.5, 1}, {0.07 π, 1.97 π}]}, {0.6, -0.9}],     Translate[{{White, Disk[{-0.47, 0.12}, 0.15]}, col3,       Circle[{0, 0}, {0.5, 1}, {0.02 π,         1.92 π}]}, {-0.8, -0.9}]}]]      I think the 2D picture is nicer and can be saved as the vectorized image with a much smaller size compared to the 3D version. However I need to explicitly tell Mathematica where and how to break the lines. My question is: is there a method to have Mathematica automatically draw links or knots in the 2D style with the underlying lines broken at the intersections.
