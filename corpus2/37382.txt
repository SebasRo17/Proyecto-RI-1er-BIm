I have a `2D` image as shown here and need to extract the spatial information about the curves in between each cell division. I have been able to analyze the image and output $\;(x,y)\;$ coordinates where the brightest values `(1.0)` are located in the grid of pixels. How might I be able to process the image to remove noise (inside the cells) leaving only the lines describing the cell outlines? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/IyUPZ.jpg)
