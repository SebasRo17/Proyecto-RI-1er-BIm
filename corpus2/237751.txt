I wonder why I rarely see any IDEs or other developers that use background colors for syntaxhighlighting. One of the first things when installing and configuring a new IDE is adjusting the colors so that for example comments have a decent light-grey background. This really helps me seeing where documentation is and where code is when scrolling down fast. The only time i saw something like that was in the Greenfoot Editor but that didn't look so well at least if you are doing some more complex work and there are more nested conditions and stuff. So why is it that background colors are rarely used; or does anyone have some good examples where they are used and how?
