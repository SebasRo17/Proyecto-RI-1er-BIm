Recently, having purchased a smart phone, I discovered podcasts. It's great, cause I spend time commuting and usually that time would be a waste. Admittedly, it's fairly light stuff, mostly news and opinions. I don't think I could concentrate probably if they tried to explain through code samples etc. But I find even just knowing the existence of some new tech or maybe even just recognizing some new jargon is of benefit, at least it gives me a start if I decide to look further into it. What's more, it's enjoyable and easy. So I'm wondering, can anyone think of any other passive ways to learn or know about new technologies that doesn't take much effort and preferably can be done in your "dead" time?
