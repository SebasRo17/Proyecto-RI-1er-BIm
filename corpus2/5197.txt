Is it possible to split a list into two lists at a specific position? The main list is for example:               data={{xa,ya},{xb,yb},{xc,yc},...,{xz,yz}}.       I want to split this list into two new lists:               data1={{xa,ya},{xb,yb},...,{xi,yi}}       and               data2={{xj,yj},{xk,yk},...,{xz,yz}}       at a specific y-value at position `i`. I was not successful in using `Part`. Maybe there is another possibility?
