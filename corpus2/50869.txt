Hello I am New in Mathematica. I have a set of points and I want to visualize in Wolfram Mathematica. I want to see big blue points and small green points in one picture. Big Blue points               {{0.35, 5.9709, -0.494276},       {0.25, 6.4709, -0.794276},      {0.3, 6.2709, -0.564276},       {0.3, 5.6709, -0.594276}}      Little Green points               {{0.3, -3.41212, -1.20591},       {0.4, -3.21543, -1.12591},       {0.4, -3.61472, -1.33312}}      I wrote the code, but it doesn't work               gg4 = ListPointPlot3D[{{0.35, 5.9709, -0.494276}, {0.25,          6.4709, -0.794276}, {0.3, 6.2709, -0.564276}, {0.3,          5.6709, -0.594276}}, PlotStyle -> {Blue, PointSize[0.04]}]     gg2 = ListPointPlot3D[{{0.3, -3.41212, -1.20591}, {0.4, -3.21543, \     -1.12591}, {0.4, -3.61472, -1.33312}},       PlotStyle -> {Green, PointSize[0.01]}]     Show[gg4, gg2]      I see 2 problems:   1. The function `Show` , shows date only from `gg4`   2. The `PointSize` function doesn't work. It is working, when I write `PlotStyle -> { PointSize[0.01], Green}` , but the colour function is not working in this case.
