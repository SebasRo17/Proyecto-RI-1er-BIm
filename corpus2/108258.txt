A computer science degree (like any undergraduate degree) does not prepare you to be productive immediately. And my sense is that employers are less and less willing to provide that initial training. (Or at least if you DO have those **core skills*** , you have a broader selection of "first jobs" to choose from). What skills should a senior focus on to make him/her self more employable? And how might you get those skills? *EDIT: I'm _not talking_ about experience/mastery of _technology_. I'm talking about **core skills** like Source Control (not mastery of a particular SC, but just being able to use _one_ an understanding the concepts) and Unit Testing (having written Unit Tests using at least some famework), etc.
