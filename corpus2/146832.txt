I've been using Python for a while now, both in the context of personal and professional projects. One thing that occured to me recently is that I had never thought about a good way to deploy Python programs. Basically, since it's mostly a bunch of scripts, I usually just copy them to the machine where I want it deployed and _voila_ ! But I believe there should be some good practices as to how you should deploy Python projects. I've heard about Python Eggs but not familiar enough with it to see if it's a good choice. Or a plain old _tarball_ with a bunch of Shell scripts to run the core module scripts? Basically I'd like to be able to do a nice, elegant and self-contained deployment, and not just copying files here and there, as it doesn't allow version tracking easily and it's quite messy.
