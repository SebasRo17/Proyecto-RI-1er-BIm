I provide a web service using a site and recently I got a proposal for franchising that service to another company. The problems come when they want all my code to run in their servers. I understand their reasons, but I want to take measures that the core of my PHP code remains hidden and unchanged. I want to take measures that they don't resell my code to another bidder, or use my IP. After some research I came up with a few solutions like PHP encryption, obfuscation or data fingerprinting. What I'm asking is manly:   * What should I be aware of when giving my code?   * What can I do to prevent them from understanding and selling my code to another person?
