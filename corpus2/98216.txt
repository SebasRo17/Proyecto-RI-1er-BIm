Many times when I get tired of development and my mind doesn't really help me any more (at home), I simply do something entertaining and my mind gets free for more hours of work with higher problem-solving capacity. However, when I recommended this technique to my manager as a technique to increase developers productivity and efficiency, he refused to accept on the ground that work is not the place for entertainment. I think this formula works for me. Is it true for other developers too:               2 hours of productive work + 30 minutes of entertainment > 3 hours of dull work      Why companies don't believe in it? **Update:** I don't know why this has been closed as off-topic. Please if you feel that this is relevant, vote to reopen it.
