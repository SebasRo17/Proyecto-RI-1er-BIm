I have two classes `Output` and `Timeline`, neither of which violate SR, but the two of them are linked together. So what I'd like to do is have a class called `Elco` (there's a reason behind the name) that has both of them as subclasses. For various reasons (this is just a simplified version) it's important that I don't violate the LoD (Law of Demeter). The issue is that technically `Elco` now has two responsibilities. It delegates those two responsibilities to two classes, which each have one responsibility. Is that not ok? Why? What's a better solution?
