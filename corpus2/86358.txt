I saw today that FireFox released a new version (5). I tried reading about what was added and ran into this link: http://arstechnica.com/open- source/news/2011/06/firefox-5-released-arrives-only-three-months-after- firefox-4.ars It states that: > Mozilla has launched Firefox 5, a new version of the popular open source Web > browser. This is the first update that Mozilla has issued since adopting a > **new release management strategy** that has drastically shortened the > Firefox development cycle. I find this very intriguing - any idea what this new strategy is?
