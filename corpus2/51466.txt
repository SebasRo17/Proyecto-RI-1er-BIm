as a newbie to Mathematica I wonder if someone can help... I'm generating a puzzle worksheet for some students and wish to add linear rational expressions, three at a time from a pool of six. e.g.   a) -1/(2x+1) b) -3/(x-1) c) 2/(3x+2) d) 2/(x-1) e) -3/(2x+1) f) -1/(3x+2) I want to be able to swiftly add (a) + (b) + (d) for example, or (b) + (d) + (f) Can I store the expressions and add them as I have done here. I've not had much success so far. I'd like to have a worksheet which I could tweak expressions a - f without then having to manually copy & paste endlessly into arithmetic expressions. I'm then combining them with ExpandNumerator@Together[%] ExpandDenominator[%] // TraditionalForm And will give the output to the student for Partial Fraction Decomposition. Thanks Rob
