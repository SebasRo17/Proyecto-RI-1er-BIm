I have a friend who is struggling with learning how to program (he wants to make games; as do I). Several books, tutorials, etc. His mentality is he has to memorize the code itself, as in the exact syntax for a program. I believe he's wrong, and that it's more about understanding what the code does and how to apply it elsewhere. Unfortunately, I'm still in the learning phase myself, so I haven't been much help to him. I'm hoping to get some advice from more experienced programmers on the matter. BTW, The language we're learning is C#, as it's compatible with Microsoft's XNA Framework.
