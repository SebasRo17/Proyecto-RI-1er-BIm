I am creating app(script) that is used similar to RSS reader for specific webpage that doesn't have RSS. So my app downloads that html page in defined intervals, checks new items and parses them into messages that are sent over network. But my app prototype is written in Bash (Linux is my primary OS), and I was asked that this app will be needed on Windows also - luckily WinXP 32bit only. So I am deciding how rewrite it easily and without testing various scripting languages and technologies. Currently my app is working with Bash, and calls for unix utilities like sed, wget and curl. I checked that these utilities are for win32 also. So my question is about Windows commandline capabilities compared to linux bash. Does wincmd have similar capabilities like bash? In e.g. manipulating strings, cycles or something that might be a problem? I also found Cygwin, but don't know if it works reliable and this is important in this case of app.
