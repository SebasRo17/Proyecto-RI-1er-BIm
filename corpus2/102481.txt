I'm designing a distro and some of the software packages included are maintained in such a way that my source repository doesn't actually include the source code, but they are included as an `svn:externals` property or a list of read-only repository URLs and are checked into the source tree before building. Sometimes, the software requires a patch or two in order to build or work properly. These patches _are_ included in the source tree and are automatically applied but not included in the end result. The repository is public and anyone can get the patches, which are maintained regularly. My question is, is any of this setup violating the GPL? I really want to distribute under the GPL or compatible license, but I'm not really well-versed in legalese. Would I have to host repository snapshots once I publish in order to be in full compliance, or could I just host the patches?
