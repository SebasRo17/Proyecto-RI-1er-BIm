I've read quite a bit about the positive effects of micro finance in developing countries. Organizations exist that solicit capital from donations and then make micro loans to people for the purpose of setting up some kind of business. The loans are usually quite small, with little to no interest and are well under ten thousand US Dollars, typically reaching only hundreds of dollars. The pay back rate is also excellent. The programs that exist seem to focus on retail and agricultural endeavours, I have yet to see an organization with a focus on technology sectors like software development. Do you know of any established / credible micro finance organizations that supply micro loans to individuals in order to set up software related businesses? Have the loans been paid back as well as other sectors, such as agriculture and retail? I'm looking globally, so organizations in any country would be appreciated.
