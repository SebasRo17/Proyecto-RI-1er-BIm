I have been presented with 3 known points and the power densities at those points. I need to use those points to find the location of the actual antenna which is generating the signals. Power Density is calculated through $PD=(power by antenna)/4*Pi*R^2$ and the inverse law also applies, $PD=\frac{1}{R^2}$, where R is the distance between a known point and the antenna. What is the best method of apporaching this problem using the Mathematica enviroment? Till now I havent been able to tackle this problem mathematically aswell, as I don't know how it would be done. I did however come across something, which said plotting circles will be the best, and their intersections will give the coordinates? how will this work? This is the module where I have to write the code:               Triangulate[measure_] := Module[(* Enter your code here*)]       `measure_` contains 3 lists, e.g you would input               Triangulate[{{2000,0,1/2},{0,1000,1},{0,0,1/2}}]      where first two elements are the x and y coordinates, and the last element is the power density at those points. Any help to get me started will be appreciated, cause at the moment i dont know how to start or tackle this.
