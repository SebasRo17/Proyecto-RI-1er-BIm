Don't get me wrong. I love typing. I'm good at it, and the harmonious clicking of my Das Keyboard brings me pure joy. But for some reason, I just fingertips all over my monitor and started swirling them around. It's all dirty now, but man, this wooshing around really got me thinking. I know this is blasphemous, but do you believe that it could be possible (or definite) that there is a more effective way of coding than our current line by line, 1/3 english, 1/3 strange symbols, 1/3 numbers keyboard inputting? Honestly, I'm not really sure what I have in mind here, but punch cards got knocked down. What's next?
