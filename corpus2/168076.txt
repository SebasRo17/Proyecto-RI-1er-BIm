C++ noob here. I have a very basic question about a construct I found in the C++ book I am reading.               // class declaration     class CStr {       char sData[256];      public:       char* get(void);     };          // implementation of the function     char* CStr::get(void) {       return sData;     }      So the `Cstr::get` function is obviously meant to return a character pointer, but the function is passing what looks like the value (`return sData`). Does C++ know to return the address of the returned object? My guess would have been that the function definition would be `return &sData`.
