So here is what I have thought: Use ToString and StringLength in order to get the number of characters in the variable name. If it is bigger than one, change variable name by putting everything but the first character as subscript. Symbolize subscipt to avoid issues. Example: Going from $ux1 - i1$ to $u_{x1}-i_1$ $x$ is a variable but I do not want any interference with u_{x...}! About the symbolization of subscripts I looked up and found this: Needs["Notation`"]; Symbolize[ParsedBoxWrapper[SubscriptBox[" _", "_ "]]]; For the rest I have not been able to do it mainly because I do not manage to make the function go through an expression and change all the elements of it. I also tried to use Replace but failed.
