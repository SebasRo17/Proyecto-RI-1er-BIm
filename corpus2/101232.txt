Similar to this question Code Review Services, are there any communities out there where I can get my code reviewed. Ideally this would be a private thing between you and the reviewer as it would be large chunks of a full, commercial project, the the whole thing would have to be under NDA or similar. I'm aware of codereview.stackexchange.com but that's not viable as I don't want to put the code in the public domain and the code would be too big for the format of the Q&A site.
