At some point in my career I would definitely like to get involved in some embedded programming. I was thinking that starting out with developing some drivers would be a good place to develop my abilities in the regard. I'm open to doing so on either windows or linux platform (eventually will want to probably attempt both). What tools would you recommend that I look into to get me started on this project? Any other resources that you have found to be helpful (i.e. books, websites, programs, etc)? Any advice/recommendations? Thanks!
