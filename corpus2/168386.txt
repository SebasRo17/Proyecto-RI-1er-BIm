I am an architect in an enterprise looking to build a SaaS solution. Our products are distributed over many different deployable containers, Web Services, Web UI's, etc. I am looking for some open-source or 3rd party software solution to manage the settings of our application. These would be similar to the settings you might find in Word or Eclipse or Visual Studio. The settings would control various behaviors and features of the product. (Probably not settings like which database to connect to but more like, should I show line numbers on the page or not by default..). Ideally, we would be able to store values for different dimensions (by tenant, by user, by application environment... ) Because we have so many different deployables, I am looking for a centralized solution that can provide a web service that each of the deployables can get their individual settings from. Does anyone know of a centralized service providing this sort of features or give me some help in searching for an alternative to rolling our own?
