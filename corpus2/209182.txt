So basically, my company is looking to create an app that can be distributed on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. We are hoping for a cross platform solution. I have experience working with Java Swing years ago and thought it was reasonable, but not great. It assuredly did however work on all platforms just fine. Is Java and Swing still the end all be all of code once run everywhere, or are there other options for desktop apps?
