I have a recurrence relation defined as following:               RSolve[      {       p[0] == p0,       p[1] == λ p[0]/μ,       p[i + 1] == λ p[i]/(2 μ)       },      p[i], i     ]      Note that the relation is differently for `i=1`, than for `i >= 1`. This yields the following error: > DSolve::bvnul: For some branches of the general solution, the given boundary > conditions lead to an empty solution. >> When I use `Piecewise`, Mathematica just echos the input:               RSolve[      {       p[i + 1] ==         Piecewise[{          {p0, i == -1},          {λ p[i]/μ, i == 0},           {λ p[i]/(2 μ), i >= 1}}]       },      p[i], i     ]      Also using `If` or `Condition` does not to work out. Appreciate your help! (Btw, this simple example can easily be solved by hand, but I would like to solve more complicated recursions involving piecewise definitions.)
