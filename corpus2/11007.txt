Most of my fellow students that I've talked to claim that aiming for good grades is useless as the companies don't care about them when hiring programmers. To them, it's enough to have simply attended courses which may be important, and that's that. Is this true? Are university grades useless when leaving campus, or do employers ask to see them for an interview?
