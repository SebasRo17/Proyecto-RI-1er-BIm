I was trying to display some value inside a `InputField`. Usually it looks like this:               DynamicModule[{a=1,b=20,fuc="1"},      Deploy[Style[Panel[      Grid[Transpose[{        {"Input Format","Value"},        {PopupMenu[Dynamic[fuc],{"1","2"}],         InputField[Dynamic[a],Number,Enabled->Dynamic[fuc=="1"]]}       }], Alignment->Right], ImageMargins->10]]]]      However I wanted to change what is displayed in `InputField` according to what `fuc` is. I was trying to put `If[]` inside `Dynamic`. But it failed:               DynamicModule[{a=1,b=20,fuc="1"},      Deploy[Style[Panel[       Grid[Transpose[{        {"Input Format","Value"},        {PopupMenu[Dynamic[fuc],{"1","2"}],          InputField[Dynamic[If[fuc=="1",a,b]],Number,Enabled->Dynamic[fuc=="1"]]}        }], Alignment->Right], ImageMargins->10]]]]      I can not change the value of a in the InputField even if fuc is chosen to be "1". The error message says: > >     Set::write: "Tag If in If[True,FE`a$$570,FE`b$$570] is Protected." >   Any idea how to solve this problem? I do need some `if` logic in `InputField`! Thanks
