I have an old notebook that uses the now obsolete `Arrow` package. For example, I have an expression containing               Arrow[{1,2}, {6,7}, HeadLength -> 0.005, HeadCenter -> 0.5]      I suppose I know how to translate this in absence of options. I should have               Arrow[{{1,2}, {6,7}}]      but how can I obtain the same arrow shape as given by the old-style options using `Arrowheads`?
