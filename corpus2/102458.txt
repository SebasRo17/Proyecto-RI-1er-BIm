I’m planning on making a Java web application using Amazon Web Services Elastic Beanstalk. AWS Elastic Beanstalk basically provides PaaS on top of AWS’s cloud computing resources. The problem I’m having is trying to learn how to make a Java web application. I’m familiar with making basic programs with Java (1st year computer science stuff) and have read the Head First java book, however I’m totally clueless when it comes to a large project like this. I’ve tried to find a suitable tutorial in the AWS docs, but as far as I can tell it assumes you know how to make Java applications. I tried the Oracle Java docs, and I’ve been searching the internet for something useful.    The problem is that all the resources I find assume familiarity with what I’m trying to learn. Ideally I would like an article or tutorial that describes the process and how to make a Java web app that assumes only basic knowledge of the Java programming language. So if anyone can offer any advice, or docs that could help me achieve that goal, I would greatly appreciate your help :-)    Thanks in advance, and I apologize if it seems that Googling could answer this question, but I have honestly looked quite hard to find some way of learning this and have come up with nothing. So I’ve come to you guys - the experts ;) - who presumably knew as little as I did at the start.       Basic details of the app:   It will have a web based interface as well as Android and iOS apps to connect to it. It will be of medium complexity and will involve user interaction. For the browser based part it will involve taking payments from users if they wish to buy a premium part of the service.
