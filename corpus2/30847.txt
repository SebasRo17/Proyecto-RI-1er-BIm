I have found that it is possible to assign variables from lists, as follows.               In[1]:= r = {1, 2, 3};     In[2]:= {a, b, c} = r;     In[3]:= b     Out[3]= 2      However, if I try to do this within a With or Module statement, it does not evaluate:               In[4]:= With[{{x, y, z} = r}, x]     Out[4]= With[{{x, y, z} = r}, x]     In[5]:= Module[{{x, y, z} = r}, x]     Out[5]= Module[{{x, y, z} = r}, x]      whereas I expected it to work as:               In[6]:= With[{x = r[[1]], y = r[[2]], z = r[[3]]}, y]     Out[6]= 2     In[7]:= Module[{x = r[[1]], y = r[[2]], z = r[[3]]}, y]     Out[7]= 2      or even:               In[8]:= Module[{x, y, z}, {x, y, z} = r; y]     Out[8]= 2      Why is this? Is there an accepted way to do this?
