If I have a piece of code that is mathematically or structurally quite complex and irreducibly so, how would I go about documenting this piece of code? In particular, how can I ensure that someone who may not have the mathematical or architectural skills that I do can understand it from the documentation? Should I document all of the math too? Link to a tutorial? Do some visual aid linkage in the case of complex structures?
