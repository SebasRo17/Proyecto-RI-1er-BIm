Since I last had to do any comms/network programming, the field has exploded with acronyms. In fact, networking almost feels like it is now described by a whole new language. The very name "Windows Communication Foundation" suggests it should be all things to all people... but I need to be sure I can program up some synchronous real-time* comms on a dedicated gigabit ethernet network. Can someone confirm that WCF is not a starter for this task... or if it is, which of the many confusing acronyms I should get familiar with? * By real-time, I mean I need to reduce latencies down to an acceptably low level. For our application, which involves transmitting results of video & audio analyses continuously every few milliseconds, I need to ensure 99% or better of those analyses are presented at the UI within (ideally) 0.5 seconds so that the user has time to respond before the originating network node deletes data out of its buffer to make way for subsequent analyses.
