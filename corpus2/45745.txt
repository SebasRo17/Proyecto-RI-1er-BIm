I have several large data sets which follow the following pattern: A position is measured, a force is applied until a new equilibrium is found.   I'd like to find a fit for the position, at least at the plateaus, and preferably of the inter lying section, which in this case approaches a line.   I tried fitting the data with `Clip`, and with `Piecewise`.               nlm = NonlinearModelFit[v40s1000h,Piecewise[{{a, x < A}, {b, x > B}}], {a, b, A, B, c, d}, x]        This creates a decent fit only if I specify the values for A and B, but then I have to estimate those values for each data set manually. It also doesn't really work to just add `NMinimize`, or add the piecewise part for the middle bit.   Is There anything else I can try? ![Setting the A to 200 and B to 250 works decently.](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Dsbuf.png) s000.tinyupload.com/?file_id=35616536027018518052 << file
