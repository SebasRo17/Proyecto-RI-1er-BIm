We are running 2 weeks sprints where the team will just barely finish development by the last day of the sprint but cards are not complete because testing is not finished. The definition of done is really "when development is complete" rather than "when the stories are complete." We have a 1 week delay between the last day of the sprint and the release date. The team does finish the sprint by the release date but that seems like that isn't quite meeting the objective of scrum. The team starts the next sprint the day after the previous sprint ends. I see the following problems:   1. team is not using whole team testing   2. team is not too interested in pair programming or piling on one card at a time.    3. Maybe the stories are too large and we should break them down more so that we finish at a more steady pace throughout the sprint? Any suggestions on how we get the team bought in to finishing the sprint by the end date? Or other ideas? Why do we think it is important to finish by the last day? Why does it matter if the team is still finishing by the release date? (I have my own answers but am curious what others think here.)
