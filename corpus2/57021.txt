Seems that `GeoRegionValuePlot` requests data from the internet multiple times to process its plot. As an example, let's graph smoking per capita worldwide.               smokers =        Import["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_cigarette_\         consumption_per_capita", "Data"];     table = Rest@smokers[[1, 1, 2]][[All, 2 ;;]];      rule = "Republic of Macedonia" -> "Macedonia";      GeoRegionValuePlot[       {CountryData[StringTrim@#[[1]] /. rule], Interpreter["Number"][#[[2]]]} & /@ table,        ImageSize -> Large,        PlotLabel -> "Cigarrete Consumption Per Capita"]      While waiting for the plot to be graphed, you can see that mathematica accesses servers for information at least twice (Message below shows up twice, then takes additional time to process). ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Qee3k.png) ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WRYwj.png) How can the GeoRegionValuePlot performance be improved? Is there a way to cache the information retrieved by the function (maps, polygons, etc) in the local drive so subsequent calls to the GeoRegionValuePlot will perform better?
