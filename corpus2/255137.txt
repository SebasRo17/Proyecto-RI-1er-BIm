I'm trying to find a language construct equivalent to higher order functions in the top 10 languages from TIOBE index. Here are my results so far:   1. **C** \- function pointers   2. **Java** \- anonymous methods, lambdas   3. **Objective-C** \- function pointers, selectors, blocks, delegates (as explained here)   4. **C++** \- function pointers, lambdas   5. **Basic** \- [ _missing_ ]   6. **C#** \- anonymous methods, delegates, lambdas   7. **Python** \- [ _I know it's possible, but don't know how it's called_ ]   8. **PHP** \- anonymous functions   9. **Perl** \- [ _missing_ ]   10. **JavaScript** \- functions Could You please help me with missing parts? And eventually correct any mistakes? I'm not looking for workarounds, but for built-in language constructs that allow to pass a function to another function.
