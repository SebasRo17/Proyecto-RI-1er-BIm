If you have a job programming with a language then it's safe to say that the number of years at a job is the number of years of experience you have. But a hobbyist doesn't always program with the same regularity as a professional. How can I measure my experience as a hobbyist, for example, on a résumé? Is it effectively equivalent to work experience, or does it need to be qualified in some way?
