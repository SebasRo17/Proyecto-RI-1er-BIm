I need to learn Python (v2.7) for my job, and looking for the best intro book for professional programmers. I found (via amazon) that "The Quick Python Book" is the best, but it's for Python 3.1 I know there's a lot of similarities in 2.7 and 3.1, and somewhere read that you can mostly use 3.1 syntax in 2.7 as a good "future practice". Can someone with experience please verify that a book for learning Python3 would still be directly applicable for 2.7? Thank you very much. edit: "The Quick Python Book" is for 3.1
