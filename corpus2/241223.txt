In the delivery of software, and within the sense of the deployment pipeline, where do the responsibilities of build tools, like Maven, end, and the responsibilities of CI start? As a rough _example_ of a problem that arises; should build tools have any responsibility to the configuration and execution of acceptance tests when they are further down the pipeline than actually building the artifact? I'd like an answer that addresses in the sense of deployment lifecycle phases rather than in specifics, like my example. Although examples would help bolster the answer.
