I calculate scaled error function defined as               f[x_] := Erfc[x]*Exp[x^2]      but it can not calculate `f[30000.]`. `f[20000.]` is not very small (`0.0000282`). I think Mathematica is supposed to switch to high precision instead of machine precision, but it does not. It says: > General::unfl: Underflow occurred in computation. >>   >  General::ovfl: Overflow occurred in computation. >> How can I calculate `f` for large values of `x`? Even with `N[f[30000], 50]`, it does not use high precision and fails.
