I am developing an UI on Visual Studio C++ and communicating with Mathematica using Mathlink. I create a function via Mathlink and in that function, I coded in such a way that it gives a message before being aborted. The output I get on Mathematica is:               Error::nnarg: The argument is not greater than or equal to zero     Out[38]= $Aborted      From Mathlink, I can actually read the $Aborted using MLGetString() I would want to actually read the error message as well. Is it possible? Thanks
