I am a developer of an open source project which is hosted in SourceForge. It started out as a little app then after some releases, it got more and more popular and it started consuming more time and responsibility from me. So I have enabled the donation option in SourceForge. I'm passionate to continue developing it for free but if (ever) any money comes in, how should I split it with my team?   1. Should I split the amount equally among the number of team members? (50-50 as it is two-member team now)   2. Number of classes, commits or any other valuable submissions by team members?   3. Any other idea? What would you do in such situation? Please give your opinions.   I hope this question will be useful for others.
