As an Android developer, the target market I create apps for is very fragmented. While I can specify certain requirements - e.g. my app only supports Android version x.x or above, sometimes errors may occur that are only evident on one specific phone model. **Are there any strategies to handle device-specific errors, without buying the phone in question?** We maintain a suite of phones for testing, but can't afford to go out and buy a new phone when 2 or 3 users report that there's a bug that only occurs for their model of phone. I'm sure other Android developers have encountered similar issues in the past, and I'm curious what cost-effective strategies are available to help squish device-specific bugs. **Update to add a few details:**   * I use Bugsense to capture bug reports, so whenever exceptions are thrown I will know the model of the phone, the stack trace, the number of times it has happened to my users, and a few other details.    * The users may be located in different countries, so I can't assume I'll ever be able to borrow their phone. **Imagine a scenario like this:** 100 users have installed the app, but three people complained that a button doesn't work properly when pressed. None of the models of phone I have for testing experience the problem. There doesn't appear to be an emulator for the problem phone model.
