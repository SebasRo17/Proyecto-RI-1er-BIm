I'm looking for the kind of a certain datatypes. The main idea of this datatype is to describe a productionline containing several steps. Each step should be represented as a "vertex" containing an object of any type. Then for every "vertex" there are possible "subproductionlines" joining the line. So it could look something like:                                 O   ->   O   ->   |                    #   subproductionline                                         |                    #   joiningpoint     O   ->   O   ->   O   ->   O   ->   O   ->   O   ->   O  # main productionline                                         |                    #   joiningpoint              O   ->   O   ->   O   ->   |                    #   subproductionline                                |                             #   joiningpoint                       O   ->   |                             #subsubproductionline      Does anyone of you know such a datatype? If I were to code such a datatype... I see there two options of doing this:   * A datatype as an Array (main productionline) containing Arrays (containing as first element the containing data of each vertex) and the rest of elements containing subproductionlines as recursive this datatype or   * A datatype as an Array containing the data stored in the vertex. Last element is either the element, where this subproductionline is joining, or a specific element representing the end of a main productionline, if it is one. What do yout think is the better solution? The programming language I think of using for is c / c++.
