Just a quick question, but why are there so many file systems still competing and in use today? (ntfs, fat32, ext3(ffs), etc) It seems that file system designers could agree upon the best aspects of each type of system and implement a "best" filesystem, no? Just a thought, since these filesystems have been around for a while now, and it should be at least somewhat apparent which ones have good qualities over others, and we could just combine the good in each and create an ultimate system that is much better
