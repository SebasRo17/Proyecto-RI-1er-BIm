I'm unsuccessfully trying to compile this function               check[argA_, argB_] := argA[[1]] == argB[[1]];      assuming that both arguments argA and argB are of the form               {Real, String, ....}      Neither               cf = Compile[     {     {x, {_Real, _String}, 1},     {y, {_Real, _String}, 1}     },     x[[1]] == y[[1]]     ];      nor               cf = Compile[     {     {x, {_Real, _String}, {1}},     {y, {_Real, _String}, {1}}     },     x[[1]] == y[[1]]     ];      work as expected, and I can't see the underlying rule. I'm grateful for any explaination.
