Why would I want to write a web app with lots of processing server-side? To me, writing the program client-side is a huge advantage because it takes away as much server load as possible because it only has to send data to the client with minimal processing. I see very little on writing web-apps besides writing it server-side and treating client-side as _only a view_. Why would I ever want to do this? The only advantage I see is that I can write in whatever language I want (http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html).
