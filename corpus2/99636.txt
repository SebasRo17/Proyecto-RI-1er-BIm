I like to keep my code testable and have decided to go with the Dependency- Injection strategy for my current MVC framework, which definitely has proven to be a great way to ensure loosely coupled code, testability and modularity. But as being far from a master at Design patterns, I have a hard time of figuring out a good way of keeping my Models as loosely coupled from the Database connector classes, as possible. **How can this done?**   As I haven't provided any physical code along with this question, I would really appreciate some logic/code examples or info that could point me into a direction to understand the above described issue.
