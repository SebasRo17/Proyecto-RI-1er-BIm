It seems like most of the jobs I'm receiving, and most of the Internet, is still using standard HTML (HTML 4, let's say) + CSS + JS. Does anyone have any vision on where HTML5 is as a standard, **particularly regarding acceptance and diffusion?** It's easy to find information about inconsistencies between implementations of HTML5 and so forth. What I want to know about is relevance of HTML5.
