I lose a ton of productivity by getting distracted while waiting for my tests to run. Usually, I'll start to look at something while they're loading --- and 15-20 minutes later I realize my tests are long done, and I've spent 10 minutes reading online. Make a small change... rerun tests ... another 10-15 minutes wasted! How can I make my computer make some kind of alert (Sound or growl notification) when my tests finish, so I can snap back to what I was doing??
