If you know of an open source project whose organizer   * has gotten really busy that he doesn't maintain it that much    * and he's the type of guy that doesn't accept contributions until a few months later (busy I guess) if at all   * and the project is starting to flounder  would you fork this project, give it a new name, and continue working hard on it and build a new community around it that's more encouraging to code contributions? Basically a better managed project since the concern now is bad management.
