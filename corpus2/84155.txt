I am thinking about a career in software engineering, but before I look for work I wanted to get an idea of what to expect particularly with pressure. This will be my first programming job (so I am looking for entry level), so I am not yet mature as a programmer yet. My question is what is the pressure like in these jobs? How high can the pressure get? If your boss gives you an assignment and it's due in two weeks but it takes you 3 will you get fired, because your unable to perform? Are you given time to learn more about the technology, develop your coding skills and grow, or are you expected to know it already and blaze through the project? If you have trouble with code are you expected to handle it yourself and work independently, or are you able to ask others for help if you are stuck? Are you expected to put in a lot of late nights to meet the deadlines? I know that this can depend on the company as well, but I just wanted some professional insight to the possible pressures of being a software developer/programmer etc. I also know that other jobs have pressure too! I just would like to know the pressure unique to software engineering. The reason I ask this question is because I had a bad experience programming once and I wanted to know if most of these jobs are the same. If software engineering/developing/programming is tough pressure that I don't want to handle are there other types of development like web development, system admin, etc that are less pressure that I can get into and still code? Thanks for reading and I look forward to hearing everyone's thoughts.
