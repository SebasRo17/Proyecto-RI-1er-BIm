For some reasons, I should use two language versions _Mathematica_. The most reason is I want to see the comparison of Help page(English version and Chinese version) to improve my English, both are useful.   * [update]However, When I just concentrate on the language of Help page, that problem is nothing, just put english help page in the english version, and chinese help page in the chinese version, open Mathematica by two shortcut, it's OK now, ignore the language of the UI(both Chinese). ## question 1: How to make `FrontEnd` do not show this popup dialogue? ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/kmgok.png) ## question2: I've installed two _Mathematica_ 9 with different language versions. One in Disk D `English` Version One in Disk E `ChineseSimplified` Version How to configure two different settings? # _(Hard point:)_ Because they share the configures, some configure files are stored here in my computer.               "E:\\Users\\Quaternions\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mathematica"     "E:\\Users\\Quaternions\\AppData\\Roaming\\Mathematica\\FrontEnd\\init.m"      How to make the different configures, such as `Language`, `Background` and others. For background color, the value of `Background` is easy to setting. As I've tried, one can add               SetOptions[FrontEndSession,Background->LightBlue]      in some init.m here               "D:\\Program Files\\Wolfram\\Research\\Mathematica\\9.0\\SystemFiles\\Autoload\\PacletManager\\Kernel\\init.m"      or here               "D:\\Program Files\\Wolfram Research\\Mathematica\\9.0\\AddOns\\AutoLoad\\English\\init.m"      And then when open _Mathematica_ in Disk D, the background is LightBlue. When open _Mathematica_ in Disk E, the background will be White ($FrontEnd background value). What's the tough thing? The value of `$Language` So the keypoint of the problem isï¼š How to open _Mathematica_ in Disk D whose `$Language` is English [Help page language is English, and also UI is English], and Open _Mathematica_ in Disk E whose `$Language` is ChineseSimplifed [Help page language is ChineseSimplified and also UI is ChineseSimplified]
