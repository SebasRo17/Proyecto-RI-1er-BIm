I need to write a map of string data to an XML document. The XML document has a specific format. An entry key determines where in the XML document the value will be written to. See below for an example (pseudo-code where appropriate);               map = {"document_id": "123"; "document_type": "type_A"}      Produces an XML file like this;               <document>         <document_id>123</document_id>         <document_type>type_A</document_type>     </document>      I need the format of the target XML document (and where the map data is written to in it) to be user-configurable. For example;               <node name="document">         <node name="document_id">${document_id}</node>         <node name="document_type">${document_type}</node>     </node>      I feel like my proposed solution would be complex and a re-invention of the wheel. I figure there must be some established way to do this but after searching the internet I can't seem to find it. Can anyone offer suggestions on how I may achieve what I want to do?
