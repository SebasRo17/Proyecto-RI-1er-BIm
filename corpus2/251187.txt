One of the things I seem to struggle with frequently is the need to deploy a software application to test the database interaction. More often than I'd like, I have a syntax error or typo in my sql statement that triggers a runtime error when the statement is invoked. In some of these projects, there is a very large number of sql queries (>100), which makes it very time consuming if I need check each one. Also, deployment and runtime steps can be so time consuming that it slows me down when checking sql I modified. Most of the time after checking out an unfamiliar codebase or one I haven't touched in some time, it is taken on faith that all of the sql works correctly. What are standard practices around verifying database interaction in applications in a non-manual\more automatic fashion?
