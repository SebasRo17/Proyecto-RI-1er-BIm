I am trying to figure out if _Mathematica_ allows a variable location for a known initial value for `ParametricNDSolve`. I haven't been able to find an example where this is done. In the following I set `w[5.7] == 0` as an initial condition, but I would rather set `w[p] == 0`, or in some other way find the largest `p` for which the solution of interest exists. The solution of interest requires `w[y] >= 0` in the range `{ y, 1, p}`, so I plot `Sqrt[w]` there. Sorry about all the initial variables etc. The adjustable parameter `c` is to be anything in the range `{ 0, 1}` but here `0.2` is used.               {la, ra, ta, sa} = {0.06, 0.00002, 298., 5.6705*10^-8};      {roa, rex} = {5.6*10^(-8), 1.209} ; ro[y_] = roa*y^rex;      {ka, kc, kex} = {179., 0.9624, -0.2792}; k[y_] = ka*kc*y^kex;     {ga, g0, g1, g2, g3, g4} = {   0.0237,    1.09104, -0.751912,                                   0.792915, -0.0862438,  0.0029868};          g[y_] = ga*(g0 + g1*y + g2*y^2 + g3*y^3 + g4*y^4);     {fa, f1, f2} = {1.001, -0.001076, -0.0000635};      f[y_] = fa + f1*y + f2*y^2;     r[y_] = ra/f[y];     a[y_] = kex/y - 2.*(f1 + 2.*f2*y)/f[y];     b[y_, c_] = ((c^2)*ro[y]/Pi^2/r[y]^3 - 2.*sa*(ta^4)*g[y]*(y^4 - 1.))* la^2/ta/r[y]/k[y];          wsol = ParametricNDSolveValue[{ w'[y] + 2*a[y]*w[y]^2 + 2*b[y, c] == 0,                                     w[5.7] == 0}, w, {y, 1, 12}, {c}];     Plot[ Sqrt[wsol[0.2][y]], {y, 1, 12}, PlotRange -> {{1, 12}, {-1, 10}},           AxesOrigin -> {0, 0}, Frame -> True]      I get a nice graph with a $2$-branch solution, and it varies with parameter `c`, but I'd like to include the parameter `p` to be used in the initial condition `w[p] == 0`. At the largest `p = pmax`, the solution approaches a double root, somewhere between $5$ and $6$ in this example. That number is needed for further work - basically, what is `pmax[c]`?
