I am new to this whole website design and API bit. My husband has bought a license for the program InkSoft. Their site does not offer very much customization, so we decided to buy a Wordpress.org site that is hosted through godaddy. With all of that said, I am trying to figure out a way to take the products that are on InkSoft's website, which get their information from the suppliers' warehouses (for things like inventory), and put them on the Wordpress site. There is an area on InkSoft where I can access "Store API...API feeds." I guess I am just confused on where to put this type of stuff in the WordPress site or how to put it in there? If I go to the "Products" area on this Store API, I am given a URL that deals with the product stuff and I am also given a HUGE list of stuff that contains stuff such as:               <ProductCategoryList>     <vw_product_categories product_category_id="1000076" name="Most Popular" path="Most Popular" thumburl_front="REPLACE_DOMAIN_WITH/images/publishers/2433/ProductCategories/Most_Popular/80.gif" />      How to use all this stuff?
