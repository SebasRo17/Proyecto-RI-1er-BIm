> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  I don't know C. And why should I learn it? I was kind of awkward in coding with C, though I am somewhat familiar with it. I like Java and C#. The reason I like to code with them is for better GUI application development. With C, it's hard to code for a better appearance of any application. I understand the fact that C is the basis of all. But now we have tons of libraries which can help us to do anything in no time. But why do many people still code in the C programming language?
