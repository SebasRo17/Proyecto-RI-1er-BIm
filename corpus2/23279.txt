I noticed that in `HTTPClient.m` which is included with _Mathematica_ 9 and is located in               FileNameJoin[{$InstallationDirectory, "SystemFiles", "Links", "HTTPClient"}]      there was a dependency on `HTTPClient`OAuth``, so I poked around and found it. `OAuth.m` seems to contain all of the necessary functions to perform OAuth authentication, which is interesting to me since I'd like to build an API manager for sites like fitbit, withings, etc. I managed to figure out that `SocialMediaData` uses OAuth (which makes sense, since that is the authentication method that I gather Facebook and Twitter require), but the code for that is hidden and trying to read `SocialMediaData.mx` only confirms that OAuth is used without showing me how it's called. Can anyone figure out how to actually use `HTTPClient`OAuth`` in _Mathematica_? Or perhaps can anyone figure out how to read the `SocialMediaData.mx` file to get the code for `SocialMediaData` so I can see how Wolfram made use of the package?
