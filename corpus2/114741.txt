Questions like this have been asked before (like here), but a lot can change in a year. My company is very interested in migrating core systems to the "cloud". Non- technical upper-management doesn't quite know what that means, but they are excited at the idea and have already started adopting cloud-based systems. Having gone through an ERP migration, and experiencing first-hand what a pain it is to deal with legacy systems, I'm really concerned that by going to the cloud, losing control of our data, we are going to begin a cycle of never- ending migration as cloud services come online and then blink out of existence. To say nothing of the technical demands of learning, programming, and keeping up with multiple non-stable APIs in order to get disparate cloud- based systems to talk with one another. I have other concerns such as privacy, uptime, data ownership, maintenance, etc. Is the cloud really ready for the prime time? If you were a business owner, would you choose to place your key, business-critical, systems on the cloud? As a programmer, do you trust the cloud and the companies providing those services to be reliable and have the longevity of a traditional software solution? If it is not ready now, when will it be, if ever?
