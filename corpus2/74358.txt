I'm currently working on a small library as a hobby project. I am the only one who actively codes for it, but a few of my friends have expressed interest in participating in the future. When using the library for my own purposes, I usually just add the appropriate source files to my project using an IDE. (E.g., dragging a `.h` and `.cpp` file into Xcode.) As the library grows in size and complexity, however, I've been trying to move towards a more professional approach to organization. I've considered setting up some sort of makefile that future participants can use to compile the library into a "monolithic" library file. This might be beneficial to me as well, since I code on multiple computers. Would such a venture be worth the effort? Note: I tried looking at the Boost library to see how they do things, but it's pretty difficult to navigate without any previous experience and I had trouble making sense of the structure.
