I am trying to develop a single-page web application. I was wondering how big the disadvantages of using jQuery are. I have been told that it makes the application slower, but, as I have seen here, there are only 150ms at every 500 consecutive selections, which seems to me impossible to notice by a user. Others say, that with every jQuery selection, the browser will save jQuery objects in its cache, instead of DOM elements, making the cache bigger, resulting a bigger memory consumption and therefore making the application run slower. Is this true? (I have no idea how the browser's cache is working.) Is jQuery really slowing down such an application? (By this, I mean if the user will ever notice the use of this framework or not.)
