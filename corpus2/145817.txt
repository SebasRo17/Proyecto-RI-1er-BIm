As an aspiring android developer, reading this today gave me a distinct feeling of a rug being pulled under my feet. While the research discussed, is about the Apple apps store, I believe it safe to say that everything is also true for the multitude of Android apps markets (or Plays as they are called these days). If it's true, then what does it mean for developers considering up to mobile development as their chosen career? Do any of you makes a living out of apps development? Can it be done as a full-time job able to pay the bills and put food on the table?
