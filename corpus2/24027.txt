**Note:** this problem is no longer present in version 10. * * * Exporting the following as a PDF file               Graphics[{       {Red, Rectangle[{0, 0}, {1, 1}]},       {Green, Rectangle[{1, 0}, {2, 1}]}     }]      does not produce perfectly tiled rectangles, and some of the corners are cut too, as shown here: ![rectangle with dog-ear, first example](http://i.stack.imgur.com/a0JWz.png) and here: ![rectangle with dog-ear, second example](http://i.stack.imgur.com/1W37n.png) Is this a bug? I solve the problem by giving them some tiny edges:               Graphics[{       EdgeForm[{Red, Thickness[Tiny]}],       {Red, Rectangle[{0, 0}, {1, 1}]},       EdgeForm[{Green, Thickness[Tiny]}],       {Green, Rectangle[{1, 0}, {2, 1}]}     }]      The rectangles are slightly larger, and their sizes are slightly different; practically this isn't a problem. But is there a more elegant solution?
