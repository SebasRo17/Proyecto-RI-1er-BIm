Syntax Highlighting for Mathematica on a Blog There is the above, but I'm not terribly excited to install rogue packages. For example on github, I share lots of _Mathematica_ code. I see no way to highlight syntax. This may keep _Wolfram_ down in the way of becoming a more often used and more robust programming language. If the answer is, as I suspect, _"no"_ , perhaps a better question is _"why not?"_
