According to Wikipepdia, > _A software bug is the common term used to describe an error, flaw, mistake, > failure, or fault in a computer program or system that produces an incorrect > or unexpected result, or causes it to behave in unintended ways._ Recently I've found a "bug" in StarCraft 2 which produces an unexpected result: http://eu.battle.net/sc2/en/forum/topic/2868627470 The problem is that if I keep StarCraft 2 minimized for a long time, the game does not disconnect or generate any form of timeout. It does disconnects however _after_ first battle and sometimes also loses game data (match statistics). Unfortunatly, according to Blizzard: > _The game is not designed to be kept minimized for such a long period of > time. (Blizzard) cannot consider such behaviour as erroneous as StarCraft II > is not meant to be minimized for hours._ So, is my "bug" really a bug?
