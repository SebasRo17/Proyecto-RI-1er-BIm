During 1990s when there were no advanced frameworks/paradigms available for S/W development , knowledge on data structures was critical... which I can comprehend. But nowadays, for most of the problems (at least from Java/Android development) we can rely on an existing class to provide solution. As such I believe, an in depth knowledge of data structures is not needed for someone who is stepping into programming now. Is my belief right ?.
