What is the preferred convention for structuring view model properties? It is better to use generic or more specific property names? Let's have a user, the page where this user will be displayed should be altered by user's permission. The view model could be written in two different ways:               {         userName,         userEmail,         isAdmin // show/hide controls according the value of this property     }      or               {         userName,         userEmail,         enableDeleteBtn,          showLogData,         // many more show/enable properties which are set according user's permissions     }      The first approach seems to smaller and easier to write, but it's less generic and the logic of displaying/hiding controls have to be changed if for example new type of user role will be introduced.
