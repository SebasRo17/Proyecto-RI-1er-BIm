As a result of a retrospective we were uncovering worse ways of developing software. We had a idea we though was great and tried it. We stayed with it during the development of a major update which took 3 months. After a retrospective with the maintenance engineers it turn out our idea does not work for them (we had discussions with them before we tried the idea and the also thought it was a great idea). We came to the agreement we better get back to the old situation. The team for the update is dismantled and the maintenance engineers don't have time to do so (although their project manager has agreed to invest the time). We're now in the situation the maintenance engineers pay the interest each time a minor release has to be made. This is very much like technical debt but has nothing to do with the product itself. Is this called process debt or is this put under the term technical debt? And what would be a good way of dealing with it? (Any other or concrete ideas to make it visible to product managers?) PS The idea was migrating a 4 product VSS database to SVN. The database heavily leans on shared files and is a mess to untangle and pour in a usable SVN structure. It's very counter intuitive but is seems some things are better kept in VSS.
