Suppose that I have project backlog item with effort of 40 hours. My sprint is 40 hours (1 week) and I have one developer in team. So developer creates child task to pending backlog and estimates work to 40 hours. At the end of the sprint developer didn't succeed in resolving his task. Suppose that developer works only and only 40 hours per week. On the next week there would be new backlog items and new sprint. What should I do with backlog item and velocity graph? Obviously backlog item is not resolved on that sprint. Should I estimate the remaining work and subtract it from effort , so that now I see that our velocity is, say, 38hr per 40hr sprint?
