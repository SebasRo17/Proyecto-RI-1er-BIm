I have a project A (a webapp), depending on project B (B.jar) and this one depending on project C (C.jar). I would like to create a maven goal named "Rebuild War", that clean all compiled code for these 3 projects and rebuild the whole in order to obtain a fresh War file. I tried mvn clean package on project A, but I noticed that B and C are not recompiled. Indeed, B.jar and C.jar that are contained in local repository don't have a changing creation date. Is there an adapted maven command for this requirement ?
