I've been learning SQL recently and practicing with MySQL/Postgres and soon Oracle DB. I've also search the web for a 'road map' study of databases but couldn't find one, unfortunately. I want to understand where and why particular database concepts fall on the scale from beginner to intermediate and advanced. I'm thinking about relational databases for the most part. Please explain how to lay out skills listed below in a progression of Beginner -> Intermediate -> Advanced for what level of developer should know them:   * Where clauses   * Update syntax   * Joins   * Alter and Create statements   * Temp tables   * Cursors   * Indexes   * Foreign keys   * Constraints   * Transactions   * Subqueries   * Pivots   * Aggregate functions   * Profiling   * OLAP and OLTP   * Triggers   * Execution plans   * Execution hints   * Performance counters   * Normalization
