Since the emphasis of this question is on finding a workaround, I decided to post this question with an emphasis on the _explanation_ of the behavior of Mathematica. The Bessel function satisfies the following identity: $$J_{-n}(z)=(-1)^n J_n(z),\qquad n\in\mathbb Z$$ Accordingly:               In[2]:= FullSimplify[(-1)^n*BesselJ[n, z] == BesselJ[-n, z], n ∈ Integers]     Out[2]= True      However:               In[3]:= FullSimplify[(-1)^n*BesselJ[n, z] - BesselJ[-n, z], n ∈ Integers]     Out[3]= -BesselJ[-n, z] + (-1)^n BesselJ[n, z]    (*result expected : 0*)      doesn't work as expected. Some workarounds were suggested in the previous question, such as using `ToString` as the `ComplexityFunction` (in this answer):               FullSimplify[(-1)^n*BesselJ[n, z] - BesselJ[-n, z],  n ∈ Integers,                   ComplexityFunction -> (StringLength @ ToString @ # &)]      My question is: Why `FullSimplify` with no specified option value for `ComplexityFunction` (thus using the default `LeafCount`) doesn't simplify $J_{-n}(z) - (-1)^n J_n(z)$ to zero (with $n\in\mathbb Z$)?
