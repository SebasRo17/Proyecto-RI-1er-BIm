Myself and a fellow PHP dev are starting to research a new web app that we think (hope) will have a global reach. The trouble is that, whilst we both consider ourselves capable, we are concerned with the sheer size of the potential traffic (neither of us has done anything with a reach beyond a few thousand. This site will hopefully serve millions) and wonder what we can do along the way to ensure we have tested things for scale. The site will be dependant on mass simultaneous log ins, uploads of relatively large files (3-10mb audio, >4mb images) and also streaming of audio.
