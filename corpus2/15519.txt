This is I think a trivial question but I did check against those already asked. I am downloading Mathematica (home use). Very slow connection. So my Mac displayed the progress bar but this morning the bar is replaced in the downloads window with "mounting failed." When I double-click this icon it informs me the program can't be accessed because it is still downloading. When I right-clicked "get info" on the dmg file it went from 2.07G to 4 KB over the course of a few minutes. a. Has the download stopped? Been reversed? b. Is it possible to get the progress bar back to see what's happening? Thanks for any advice.
