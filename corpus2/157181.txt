Recently I was talking with a colleague who mentioned that his company was working on adding the MVC design pattern as a PHP extension. He explained that they wrote C code for adding `Controllers, Models and Views` to the language constructs to increase performance. Now I know that MVC is an architectural design pattern that is used widely in web applications, but I still have to come across languages that have a language construct for Controllers for example. IMHO integrating design patterns into a language can emphasize the importance of good OO design. So, **Why aren't the most used design patterns (MVC, Factory, Strategy,...etc.) added to the language constructs?** If the question sounds too broad then you may limit the question to PHP only. **Edit:** I'm not implying that one **must** use a design pattern when developing a project. Actually I promote the methodology of keep it simple as long as it works.
