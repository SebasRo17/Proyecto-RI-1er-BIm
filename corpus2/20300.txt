What does               Integrate[f[z], {z, a, b, c, d}]      exactly calculate? Is it $$\int_a^b f(z)\, \mathrm{d}z +\int_b^c f(z)\, \mathrm{d}z +\int_{c}^d f(z)\, \mathrm{d}z ?$$ That was my first idea but               Integrate[f[z], {z, a, b, a}]      isn't simplified to 0 (even with a `FullSimplify`). For example                  Integrate[1/z, {z, 1, I, -1, -I, 1}]      gives as result $2\cdot \pi \cdot i$, which is the value of any closed path around zero. Which path does it take in the complex plane? Because there has been an Integral, where I thought it would converge, but I got an error with this one.
