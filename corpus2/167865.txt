I know about client server programming through _sockets_ in C/C++. **What topics do I need to study for _website_ related client server programming?** The database which we'll be using will be either _MySQL_ or _PostgreSQL_.   The platform will be _Linux_.   I don't know which language should be preferred here? Besides language, what are the **_topics_** that I need to know to get this done?
