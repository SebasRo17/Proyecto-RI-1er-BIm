Due to circumstances outside of my control, I might have to take a gap year from my computer science course at university. The trouble is that due to other circumstances, for example, living in the middle of nowhere, and even entry-level programming jobs requiring a completed degree, there's a realistically zero prospect of getting a job in this period. What else can I do to significantly progress my career or education in this time frame?
