I have this multidimensional matrix:               {{{{a1, a2}, {a3, a4}}, {{b1, b2}, {b3, b4}}}, {{{c1, c2}, {c3, c4}}, {{d1, d2}, {d3, d4}}}}      I would like to convert it into this regular matrix:               {{a1, a2, b1, b2}, {a3, a4, b3, b4}, {c1, c2, d1, d2}, {c3, c4, d3, d4}}      I have tried to use Flatten and Partition, but then I get this result:               {{a1, a2, a3, a4}, {b1, b2, b3, b4}, {c1, c2, c3, c4}, {d1, d2, d3, d4}}      Thanks in advance :-)
