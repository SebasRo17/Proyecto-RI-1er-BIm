NDsolve gives me a solution to a certain NL PDE. I want to evaluate the rate of exponential decay of the maxima of the solutions in time. So, I plot               Max1[t_?NumericQ] := First[Maximize[sol1[[1]][x, t], 0 <= x <= L, x]]     data1 = Table[{y, LMax1[y]}, {y, T0, Tfit}];     efit1 = FindFit[data1, Exp[a*t], {a}, t];     Plot[{Max1[y], Exp[efit1[1]*y]}, {y, T0, Tfit}, PlotRange -> All, Frame -> True]       and it looks like this: ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/u3y75.jpg) Now, since I would like to fit this exponentially, or take the logarithm to evaluate the slope, how can I smooth that little jump which creates me a lot of trouble? Here is what I get if I take the Log:               LMax1[t_?NumericQ] := Log[Abs[First[Maximize[sol1[[1]][x, t], 0 <= x <= L, x]]] - 1]     data1 = Table[{y, LMax1[y]}, {y, T0, Tfit}];     fit1 = Fit[data1, {1, y}, y];     Plot[{LMax1[y], fit1}, {y, T0, Tfit}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UciNA.jpg)
