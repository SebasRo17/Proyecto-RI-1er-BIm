Question: In java application, How to change error message or simple alert text without redeploying / restarting application Closest answers I could think up **(1)** is to have a new error messages in specific file in specific location say `"\root\resources\messages.txt"`and to create a file object for it like.               File msgFile = new File("\root\resources\messages.txt");      `msgFile.exist()` will return true or false based on the result we can display pre-define message defined else where in application or use this message **(2)** having _a property file_ can sound the same but it'll be loaded only once when application is started so we have to restart Is there anyother way to achieve this? what better place to ask than here..
