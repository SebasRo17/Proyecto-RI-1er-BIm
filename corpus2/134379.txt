A manager recently announced that were were spending far too much time fixing bugs. I guess he thinks we should write perfect code all the time (whilst still hitting those impossible deadlines of course!) and it made me wonder what the industry average of time spent bug fixing v writing new code was. So does anyone have any metrics on time spent bug fixing against new code development? Or is there any empirical analysis of bug fixing time for the industry as a whole? Is 50% spent bug fixing too much, or about right? How about 20% or 33%? I'm happy to accept anecdotal evidence from personal experience as that would form part of some statistics here that I could compare our performance against.
