I have a problem that can be modeled as: there are 8 boxes in total, and 60 different items. I want to put all items into boxes (all of them can be put into a single box). Now I want to find: 1) the number of total posssible situations 2) the number of posssible situations when certain number of items are put into certain box (such are 6 different items are put into box #2). **Edit:** I found a somehow similar problem, but I think my data would be too large to enumerate. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20721161/combinations-between- two-lists
