We're having a few discussions at work around the naming of our database tables. We're working on a large application with approx 100 database tables (ok, so it isn't that large), most of which can be categorized in to different functional area, and we're trying to work out the best way of naming/organizing these within an Oracle database. The three current options are:   * Create the different functional areas in separate schemas.   * Create everything in the same schema but prefix the tables with the functional area   * Create everything in the same schema with no prefixes We have various pro's and con's around each one but I'd be interested to hear everyone's opinions on what the best solution is. Edit: Thanks for all the answers. It's hard to pick a right answer seems it is very subjective so I'll go for the one with the most votes (it helps that it matches what I was thinking! ;-)
