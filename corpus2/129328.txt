I'm currently working on a project where there is a requirement to dynamically composite multiple synchronised video sources onto a single canvas. The initial prototype I put together loaded the video into HTMLVideoElements and then used requestAnimFrame (via Paul Irish's shim) to draw these onto a single canvas and maintain sync between the different elements. Although this is functional and the system can hold sync fairly well (+/- 80ms tolerance) it is somewhat inefficient to say the least. I've been thinking about optimisations and one approach that seems pretty straight forward is to combine all the media into a single larger 'video sprite' and serve this. This would allow it to be load into a single video element which could then be used extract and render the areas of interest client side using `drawImage()` and remove the need to manage sync between sources. Has anyone else implemented something similar in the past? If so what approach worked well for you?
