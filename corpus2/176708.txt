Are there patterns or libraries or any official Microsoft SDK for using Visual Studio as a specifically Task-Focused UI? For example, both Revolution R (IDE for the R language) and SQL 2012 (and I think SQL 2008 and possibly 2005) use Visual Studio as the underlying IDE framework. Is there an officially supported SDK and/or examples/samples for doing this type of thing? I am building a language Parser for an existing language - whose only available IDE is INSANELY expensive - using Irony (and eventually will generate a Language Service as well). Any direct or indirect suggestions/answers are appreciated.
