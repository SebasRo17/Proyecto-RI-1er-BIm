I need to define a function using the output of series, i.e.                f[x_,M_]:= Normal[Series[Sin[x],{x,0,M}]];      Now, for reasons explained in Normal[Series[ ]] does not give a normal expression that I can't fully understand (due inexperience and lack of time), the above code does not work as is. I've managed to use `f` within other functions, like                InverseLaplaceTransform[#,s,t] & @ f[s,M]      where `M` is given, but failing when trying to evaluate, i.e.               In[1]:= f[x_,m_]:= Normal[Series[Sin[x],{x,0,m}]];          In[2]:= f[x,3]          Out[2]= x - x^3/6          In[3]:= f[2,3]          General::ivar: 2 is not a valid variable. >>     General::ivar: 2 is not a valid variable. >>          Out[3]= Sin[2]      In a nutshell, is there a way to use `f` like a "normal" function?
