everyone! I am sorry, but I am an abcolute novice of Mathematica (to be more precise this is my first day of using it) and even after surfing the web and all documents I am not able to solve the following system:               Solve[{y*(((y*x)/(beta*b))^(1/(beta - 1)) - v) - c*alpha ==         0, ((x/alpha))*(((y*x)/(alpha*beta*b))^(1/(beta - 1)) -             v) + (((y*x)/alpha) -             2*alpha*((yx)/(2*beta*b))^(1/(beta - 1)))*(1/(beta -               1))*(x/(alpha*beta*              b))*((y*x)/(alpha*beta*b))^((2 - beta)/(1 - beta)) == 0}, {x,        y}]      What I need is to solve following systems, getting x and y expressed through all these symbols. Is it even possible? Thank you in advance.
