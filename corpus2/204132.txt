I am building an MVC application in PHP, using Zend Framework. My model includes Domain Model and Mapper layers. I am trying to keep the domain model in pristine condition and have managed to keep it free from persistence-related code. Now I am trying to find a solution for ACL. I have 'general' ACL rules that can be easily enforced in a service layer, but I also have some very fine grained rules. The fine grained rules apply at the property level and affect whether the current user can alter a field, and if so, what the range of allowable values is. Currently I am thinking of using the proxy pattern, and that the proxy should extend the real object (to save me having to redirect 100% of calls). Does this sound reasonable? Is there a better option?
