I had a user ask me this question. We know that cars break down, but **that's because of something physical** (unless software is involved!). I tried to answer that software is a much younger industry, but the user countered with "didn't the automobile industry become much more stable than and reliable with less people?". I also tried to answer that software is more complex, but the user countered that there are many thousands of parts that make up a car. People that design and build cars generally just know their component(s) very well, but they still all end up working together as an end result. So, **why isn't software as reliable as a car?**
