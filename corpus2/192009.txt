A typical MVP application might have a View method such as:               void setDisplayItems(List<DisplayItem> items);      Should the Presenter sort the list of items or is that a task for the view? I feel this might be a task for the View, for two reasons:   1. If it were a task for the Presenter, then methods such as:              void addDisplayItem(DisplayItem item);      won't work, as the Presenter can't insert the item at the correct place.   2. The View can offer different sorting options, based on user selections. However, I also can't shake the feeling that this is too much "thinking" for the View to be doing. Can anyone comment on the correct choice for MVP? I should note that I typically produce Swing-based Java applications (in case that allows for more specific answers).
