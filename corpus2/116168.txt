**I confess** : I have a problem to "Keep It Simple and Short" most of the time because trying to make it according to the books I have read, design- patterns I have heard etc. gives me such an enthusiasm -an enthusiasm coming from the sense of that I am on the right path to a probable perfection. On the other hand, yes, it puts an extra stress on me in terms of delivering the deadlines sometimes... But whenever I say to myself, "Next time keep it simple, you stupid!" I find it quiet hard to make it "simple" when that next-time comes, because it starts to feel weird... and uncomfortable after a point. Then I start to judge my understanding of 'simple'... > Does SIMPLE mean too short that it works but hard to maintain and extend? > > Does SIMPLE mean breaking many of the OOP principles? > > Does SIMPLE mean cheating? > > Does SIMPLE mean just keeping the deadlines without no dealy? etc. Actually, what is it? **Question is** : Can you write the EXACT definition of SIMPLE in terms of KISS principle? -if there is. Thanks!
