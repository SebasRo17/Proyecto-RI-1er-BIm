I have encountered a number of odd issues using the Wolfram Workbench 3.0 Debugger. Whenever I try to step into a Switch[] statement, I get the following error message: "Problem Occurred - Debug source lookup has encountered a problem. - An internal error occurred during "Debug Source Lookup." Details: An internal error occurred during: :Debug Source Lookup". Path must include project and resource name: /TypeSystemLoader.m The code producing this error is:               dv:= Switch[majorAxis,                 "x",                     xElectrodeVoltage[testPtx, testPty, testPtz, ex1, ex2, ey1, ez1, chargeDist],                 "y",                       yElectrodeVoltage[testPtx, testPty, testPtz, ey1, ey2, ex1, ez1, chargeDist],                 "z",                     zElectrodeVoltage[testPtx, testPty, testPtz, ez1, ez2, ex1, ey1, chargeDist],0];                      voltage += dv      Is this a Mathematica system package that I need to locate and load in init.m?
