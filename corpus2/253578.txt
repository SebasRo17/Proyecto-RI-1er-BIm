I have this question which I need answered: > What is the asymptotic running time for the following piece of code? >   >   >     if (N < 1000) >       for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) >         for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) >           A[i] = j; >     else >       for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) >         A[i] = i; >   > >   1. logarithmic in N >   2. linear in N () >   3. linearithmic in N >   4. quadratic in N > And the correct result is “ _2. linear in N_ ” which I can't figure out why, since that as far as I've understood, we want to accept the worst case>best case. The worst case here is that the if statement is run and the time would then be quadratic in N. I am aware that we're trying to find some kind of average of more attempts, but how can I know what the value of N is? If N is really high (10000), it's obviously the else statement that is run most of the times. But can we assume this or have I misunderstood something?
