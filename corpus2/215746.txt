English is not my first language, but since the keywords in programming languages are English words, I usually find it easy to read source code as English sentences:   * `if (x > 10) f();` => "If variable `x` is greater than `10`, then call function `f`."   * `while (i < 10) ++i;` => "While variable `i` is less than `10`, increase `i` by `1`." But how a `for` loop is supposed to be read?   * `for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i) f(i);` => ??? I mean, I know what a `for` loop is and how it works. My problem is only that I don't know what the English word "for" exactly means in `for` loops.
