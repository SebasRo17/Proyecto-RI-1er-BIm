Teams in our company deal with Product Owners who are in such a position that they cannot spend as much time with us, as we would like, to do proper Backlog Grooming. Thus in order to alleviate some of the time constraints we have begun implementing the art of getting stories "Ready for Sprint" or in other words getting them into a state where we know/understand enough to take them into a sprint. Unfortunately we are still new to what would be a proper definition of 'Ready For Sprint' and so the question of what would be good to keep in mind when getting a story in the backlog Ready for Sprint? [EDIT] In response to answers and comments by Ryathal and Donal Fellows i would like to try explain that we do not intend to actually build the stories. We would like to apply the practice of getting existing stories "Ready for Sprint" as explained by this Blog Post. Product owners should probably be adding to this but as mentioned we are not in a prime position with our product owners (as yet). We have read that you can make definitions such as a story is in Ready state if its effort points are 5 or less, or the story must have Minimum Acceptance Criteria defined, or it must have a Balsamiq Mockup etc. My question is geared towards finding what others have used in their definitions and what has worked for them. :)
