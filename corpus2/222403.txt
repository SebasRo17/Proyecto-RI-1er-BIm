We concatenate CSS and JavaScript files to reduce the number of HTTP requests, which improves performance. The result is HTML like this:               <link rel="stylesheet" href="all-my-css-0fn392nf.min.css">     <!-- later... -->     <script src="all-my-js-0fn392nf.min.js"></script>      If we've got server-side/build logic to do all this for us, why not take it one step further and embed those concatenated styles and scripts in the HTML?               <style>.all{width:100%;}.my{display:none;}.css{color:white;}</style>     <!-- later... -->     <script>var all, my, js;</script>      That's two fewer HTTP requests, yet I've not seen this technique in practice. Why not?
