I am using GATE/Geant4 for simulating photon beams interacting with matter. For 3D dose distributions, GATE outputs the data into an Analyze 7.5 format [1]. I was wondering whether there exists a function in _Mathematica_ that could read files in this format and display the data. For what is worth, Matlab has `analyze75read` [2] for this purpose.
