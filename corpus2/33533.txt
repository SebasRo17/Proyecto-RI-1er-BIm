I am starting a new iOS project and initially plan release a simple free version to gather feedback. I don't intend to monetize or market this initial version. However, I believe "Version 2" of this app will be good enough to pay for. I would prefer to release Version 2 as an upgrade from Version 1 rather than release it as a separate app. This way I can reserve a name for the app. It will also be easier to keep everything in a single repository. Are there any downsides of this approach? It's my understanding that I can change the price of an app at any point in time, so it shouldn't be an issue transitioning to a paid app, should it?
