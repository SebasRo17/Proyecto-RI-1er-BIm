I have a team that works on multiple technologies. I want to know how can I automate the process of code review for .Net, .Net MVC, Python, PHP, Drupal and HTML5/CSS with JavaScript. I have read about and have used some tools like StyleCop/FxCop for .Net and PHP Code Sniffer and likes for PHP and pyLint for Python. I understand that automated code reviews do not fully replace the manual ones, but I want to setup a process to support manual code reviews. Any suggestions? Thanks
