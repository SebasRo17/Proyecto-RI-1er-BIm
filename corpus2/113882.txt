If you work with SharePoint, you'll see classes like `SPList`, `SPSite` etc. I've seen variations of this on other projects, in other technologies, e.g. for a CRM project, classes named `CRMLoggingFactory`, `CRMEntity` etc. This stands out when you look at the code and you know what the prefix corresponds to, but when do you draw the line? What are the conditions for a class to be prefixed by the project name, company name, etc. (i.e. the "domain name" of the project)?
