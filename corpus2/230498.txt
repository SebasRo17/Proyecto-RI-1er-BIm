My GIT repo is stored on a remote Linux server that I'm accessing from my Windows PC through Netbeans. Once my changes are done I would like to review them quickly before committing. The server has no graphical components so I can't launch "gitk" from there. I'm not very comfortable with a text diff on the server with "git diff" command. It is not readable enough for me. msysgit is installed on my Windows PC. I would like to launch a kind of remote "gitk" command from my PC but couldn't find a way to do it. Didn't find anything on the web related to this. Any other "graphical" way to do this would be convenient. Any idea how to do this? Thanks in advance **EDIT** To clarify my workflow (since my question seems to lack clarity):   1. I work on my code with Netbeans IDE on a local copy of my remote working repository. This copy has no versioning. The synchronization is done through SFTP. Meaning, at project creation Netbeans makes a SFTP GET of the entire repo localy. Then, when I save my changes (on local copy) Netbeans automatically makes a SFTP PUT to the remote repo through SFTP to keep in sync.   2. The working repository on the web server (Linux based) has git versioning. Hence keeping track of the same changes that I made on the Windows copy.   3. For simplicity reasons (I'm working alone on this project so far) I don't want to clone the working repo or create a different branch than master. Hence I'm working on this unique repository and directly with the master branch.   4. Once a development is done and tested ( **my changes are not yet staged for commit** ) I want to have a last look at them **before committing**. To achieve this I would like to use a graphical tool. I have msysgit installed on the windows PC but I didn't find a way to load a remote repository to my local gitk through SSH (I don't think it is possible). Finaly: I'm looking for a way to do this with gitk or any other tool. I didn't find one so far. git-cola for instance doesn't propose anything but loading local repos. I found a solution proposed here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6810820/git-gui-when-on-a-remote-server But I'm wondering if a simpler solution exists. **EDIT2** The idea of this question was not to start a debate on which tool is better for my concern. It was: how to do it the best way WHATEVER the tool is. Anyway, here is the workflow I'm finally using for those interested:   1. The working repo is on the Linux server.   2. Netbeans (or whatever the tool is) is editing a local copy of this remote working repo on windows. The "download from" and "upload to" the remote repo are made through a ssh connection. So remote repo and local repo are always synchronized. The simplest way to look at what was done since last commit on the repo is to make the windows local repo a git working repo and launch gitk from there. Only inconvenience is not to forget to commit the local repo when I commit the remote one to get same diffs between last commit and current. Hopefully it will help other persons with same concern.
