As you can see in the drawing, I'm making a little Manipulate program. I'd now like to decrease the size of the controls at the leftâ€”to have more space for the `Graphics[]`. How is this possible? I've searched in the Documentation, but haven't found anything helpful. Perhaps is it possible to use the grey space in the left part of the screen for displaying purposes (`Print` or `Text`)? For example, print the Cosine of the angle `alpha` somewhere in the left `Pane`? Thanks for all help! ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/yqQro.png)
