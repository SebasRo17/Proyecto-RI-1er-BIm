I currently reading a lot about Design Patterns and I have been watching various Pluralsight videos from their library. Now so far I have learnt the following:   1. Repository Pattern   2. Unit of Work Pattern   3. Abstract Factory Pattern   4. Reading the awesome "DI in .NET" book Now I read lot about **Services** and **Service Layers** and wanted some advice about the best place to read up and learn about these. I presume this fits into Domain Driven Design and I should start there? The term "Service" just seem to be used widely within IT and it can be confusing the exact meaning. So my questions is:   1. What is the **Service Layer**   2. Where is the best place to learn about them. I know there are probably tonnes of interweb/books/blogs on the subject, but some good areas to start from would be nice. If I'm being too vague, let me know.
