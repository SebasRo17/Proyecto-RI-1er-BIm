I am solving following differential equation using Mathematica,               s = NDSolve[{u''[x] == (42/10)*Sin[x]*Sin[x]*u[x], u[-3] == 0,         u'[3] == 1}, u, {x, -3, 3}, WorkingPrecision -> 22,        InterpolationOrder -> All]     Plot[Evaluate[{u[x] /. s}, {x, -3, 3}], AxesLabel -> {"x", "v(x)"},       PlotStyle -> {Thickness[0.005]}, PlotRange -> All]      I would like to plot this output with gnuplot (as all of the other figure in my report are generated using gnuplot) to be consistent. How can I generate file with $x$ and $u(x)$ values written in 2 columns? I tried to write output in a file,                 sW = OpenWrite["out.dat", FormatType -> TraditionalForm];         $Output = {sW};         Write[sW, x, Evaluate[u[x] /. s], {x, -3, 3, 1}]         Close[sW];      But this does not print values of $u(x)$
