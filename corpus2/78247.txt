I am a Junior Programmer(4 months career experience so far) working on a Cross Platform Mobile Application (1 person team - so its just myself). I have a bug in this program/app which is pretty large (30 different header files, each with their own cpp file too). I have been trying to track down exactly what is going on with the bug & also to fix it (even tried to use some hacks to just get it working) but of about a dozen or more solutions(ideas I have of whats causing the problem) I have come up with nothing has led me to track exactly what the bug is or fixed the bug. **Do you have any advice for a junior programmer of some broad techniques(go for a run, print all my code onto paper & go through it with a pen, etc.) I could use to assist me with this bug?** To give a little more context for my bug; it involves the cross platform API Mosync, when I perform a specific sequence of actions, the current screen does not redraw (& it appears) that the previously displayed screen is still receiving the pointer/key press events & not the current screen. Specific sequence:   \- Menu Screen Displayed - click "Show prev orders button"   \- Prev Orders Screen Displayed - click "Load file" then click menu button & open Delivery Screen   \- Delivery Screen Displayed - click menu button & open Purchase Screen   \- Purchase Screen Displayed - Error here, input to this screen is not displayed/reacted to, ListViews dont scroll, buttons dont react to clicks, ListView cells dont respond to clicks * * * I will take the advice on board, the bug is reproducable 100% following the same steps each time, although it still very difficult to figure out how pointer events are being transmitted & to what screen due to fact thats a part of the API I cant reach(or dont know how to). Also I would love to have a different pair of eyes go over my work & point out the bug, but as I said I am a team of 1, my boss directs me, he owns the company & has the ideas for an app but does not know c++ or any recent languages either (cobal? I think is all). Any advice on how to get a second pair of eyes without breaching/showing off the company's intellectual code/property? ...and no leaving this paid internship is not an option, the contract says if I leave before 6mnths of a 12mnth contract I maybe liable to pay 30% of my yearly salary
