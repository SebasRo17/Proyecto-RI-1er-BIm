I have               Export["file.png",codeThatMakesAGraphicsObject[],"PNG"];      and want to embed some specific metadata information. Is there a simple way to do that? * * * Note that this code already (automatically, apparently) includes metadata information for "Horizontal resolution", "Vertical resolution", "Software used", and "Date and time of digitizing", and I don't want to disturb that with any fields I add.
