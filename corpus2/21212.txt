Is it possible to use a mixture of several distributions in _Mathematica_ 7.0? Consider for example the following code :               arms = Table[              NestWhileList[                 {#[[1]] + RandomInteger[{-2, 1}], # + RandomReal[{-1, 1}] & /@ #[[2]]} &,                  {RandomInteger[{25, 30}], {0, 0, 0}}, #[[1]] > 15 &],                 {10}            ];          points = Table[# + RandomReal[                         MixtureDistribution[                            {1, 1},                             {NormalDistribution[-0.1, 0.3], NormalDistribution[0.1,0.3]}                         ]] & /@ #[[2]], {#[[1]]}] &/@Flatten[arms, 1];          ListPointPlot3D[points, BoxRatios -> {1, 1, 1}, ImageSize -> 800,                      PlotStyle -> {Blue, PointSize[Small]}]      The command "MixtureDistribution" isn't recognized in Mathematica 7.0. The question is : **Is there a way to mix distributions in Mathematica 7 ?** I never found any documentation on this, so I suspect that the answer is simply "No. Upgrade to v8". Sometimes, in the software world, there are options and commands that aren't well documented. So this is why I'm asking the question anyway.
