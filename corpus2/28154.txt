This question is along the same lines as this one, but instead of talking about quality of code, I'm talking about the final product from the users' perspective. If you had limited time / budget, and could only guarantee one attribute of the software (other than the basic requirements) that take it from decent software to good quality software, what would you consider most important? Is it having as few bugs as possible? An intuitive interface? Helpful error messages? Good technical support and documentation? If we don't want our software looking like cheap crap to our users, what should we always remember to include?
