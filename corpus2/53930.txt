Imagine you have implemented the creation of a nice path-based star shape in Lisp. Then you discover Processing and you re-implement the whole code, because Processing/Java/Java2D is different. Then you want to tinker with libcinder, so you port your code to C++/Cairo. You are (re)writing a lot of boiler plate code, while the actual requirement "create a star shape" (or "create a path, moveto x y, lineto x y") has not changed. What are the options to encapsulate those implementation details? Some sort of pragmatic meta-programming? Maybe an expert system? How would you define your core business logic as language-independent as possible? **EDIT:** This has been a real business problem for some people, if you look at Schlep or Stella. The idea is that you've written your core library e.g. in Java and now need to write an iOS app. On what language do you bet you future? How can you save your investment in your current code base?
