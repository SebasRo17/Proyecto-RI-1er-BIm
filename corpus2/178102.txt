We all know that the `goto`statement should only be used on very rare occasions if at all. It has been discouraged to use the `goto` statement countless places countless times. But why it there never anything like that about the `switch` statement? I can understand the position that the `switch` statement should always be avoided since anything with `switch` can always be expressed by `if...else...` which is also more readable and the syntax of the switch statement if difficult to remember. Do you agree? What are the arguments in favor of keeping the 'switch` statement? It can also be difficult to use if what you're testing changes from say an integer to an object, then C++ or Java won't be able to perform the switch and neither C can perform switch on something like a struct or a union. And the technique of fall- through is so very rarely used that I wonder why it was never presented any regret of having switch at all? The only place I know where it is best practice is GUI code and even that switch is probably better coded in a more object-oriented way.
