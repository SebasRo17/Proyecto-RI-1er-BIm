In an ideal world, dev/ops are working together as one team to release something onto production. However, there are organizations with limitations so that release engineers/teams are kept completely away from development/project teams. This not only added the communication pain for releases but also making the production environment almost "invisible" to project team. To some extent, there is "trust crisis" between project and deployment team. Even we have good and reliable Acceptance/Functional tests in UAT environment but we just not sure if the deployment process has been done properly and if everything works on production exactly as UAT. So the only way we can verify this is through some tests on production environment. Some simple smoke tests could be helpful to identify connectivity problems. So my question is : What's your opinion on applying all tests we had on UAT to production (with configuration to disable the bits that we don't want to happen on production such as removing data etc.) If you have done something similar, how do you play data on production environment without having audit trails tainted (one obvious thing would be account based, but let's assume there isn't segregation by account). EDIT: I didn't mean to test prod environment all the time, but only right after deployment. Also we will not stop trying solving the problem from the root - dev/op relationship. But at the same time would like to explore other possibilities.
