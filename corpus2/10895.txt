Here is a pie chart with a labels placed with a "VerticalCallout"               PieChart[Range[10],      PerformanceGoal -> "Speed",      ChartLabels ->        Placed[Range[10], "VerticalCallout", Style[#, Red, Bold, 14] &],      SectorOrigin -> {Automatic, 1}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/3ycE2.png) I was trying to figure out what, if any, options control the colour and thickness of the "call out" lines and disk. So Q1. Are there built in options to change this styling? I was able to alter the styling via a rule replacement:               PieChart[Range[10],       PerformanceGoal -> "Speed",       ChartLabels ->         Placed[Range[10], "VerticalCallout", Style[#, Red, Bold, 14] &],       SectorOrigin -> {Automatic, 1}] /. {{x_Thickness, _GrayLevel,          y_Opacity, z__} :> {AbsoluteThickness[1], Red, y,          z}, {_GrayLevel, _Opacity, Disk[x_List, _]} :> {Red,          Disk[x, 0.05]}}      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BE2FE.png) But... Q2. Is there a way to specify the vertical positioning of the labels (for "VerticalCallout"? That is, to specify how far left and right from pie chart that they are positioned? By default they appear to align at the "image boundary" but if I set image padding or alter the plot range the label positions don't alter. **Edit** ok I have figured out Q2 via rule replacements as well but would still like to know if this can be controlled via built in options.               PieChart[Range[10],        PerformanceGoal -> "Speed",        PlotRangePadding -> 0,        ImagePadding -> 0,        ImageSize -> 600,        PlotRange -> {{-4.5, 4.5}, {-4.5, 4.5}},        ChartLabels ->          Placed[Range[10], "VerticalCallout", Style[#, Red, Bold, 14] &],        SectorOrigin -> {Automatic, 1}] /. {Text[x_, {a_, b_}, z_] :>          Text[x, {a*1.8, b}, z], {x_Thickness, _GrayLevel, y_Opacity,           z__} :> {AbsoluteThickness[1], Red, y, z}, {_GrayLevel, _Opacity,           Disk[x_List, _]} :> {Red, Disk[x, 0.05]}} /.       Line[{{x_, y_}, {z_, y_}}] :> Line[{{x, y}, {z*1.8, y}}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/SfE17.png)
