I have a question regarding multiple sums. And my second index depends on the first index. Here it is: $$ \sum_{d=1}^{P}e^{-d}\sum_{\substack{1\leq k_{1}\leq Q \\\ 1\leq k_{2}\leq Q \\\\... \\\\...\\\1\leq k_{d}\leq Q}}e^{-(k_{1}+...+k_{d})} $$ I could not write this sum in mathematica. The problem is that my second sum is a multiple sum and I do not know how to sum $d$ times. How can I do it?
