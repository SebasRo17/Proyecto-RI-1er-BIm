I would like to donate a lot of my time over the next few years to helping open source hold its own against closed systems like the iPhone and iPad in the mobile and appliance computing space. If that's my goal, what's the better strategy -- to do development work for Android or for Ubuntu? I know Ubuntu is behind on the mobile front, but they work great on netbooks and are gradually moving into the tablet space. And there are questions over whether Android is really faithful to the spirit of open source. http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/10/is-android-open/ Any suggestions? I'm primarily a Ruby programmer who has done a lot of iOS programming.
