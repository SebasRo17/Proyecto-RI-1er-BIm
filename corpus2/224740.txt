The situation is this. I'm a junior developer for a small government IT project. We don't have anything of continuous integration or a automated testing framework. But the idea is to be developing this kind of thing/improving our developing environment. The product is a data processing algorithm that then displays information to the end user via a webapp. So coming up is a bunch of work modifying the webapp javascript. As such we want to implement a unit testing for the javascript. I've looked at this stack overflow question which outlines several different unit testing frameworks for javascript. The question is - how do I decide between which framework to start using?   * What is a list of criteria for choosing a testing framework?   * Is it practical to try them all out?   * Spend a lot of time reading forums/etc about how they're used?
