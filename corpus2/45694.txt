I have a question about drawing tree graph. I use my iterative code to build a tree graph. Here it is.               ClearAll["Global`*"];     (*der={1,3,4,2};*)     der = Input["Add a lot of points in each level, enclosed in curly braces.     (contoh = {1,3,4,2}) : "]     awal = 1;     agab = {};     tekan = 1;     For[k = 1, k <= Count[der, _Integer] - 1, k++,       If[k == 1, mbiyen = 0, tekan = der[[k - 1]]];       For[l = 1, l <= tekan, l++,        For[j = 1, j <= der[[k]], j++,          a[j + mbiyen] =            Table[j + mbiyen \[UndirectedEdge] i, {i, awal + 1,              awal + der[[k + 1]]}];          agab = agab \[Union] a[j + mbiyen];          awal = awal + der[[k + 1]];          If[j == der[[k]], mbiyen = j + mbiyen];          ];        ];       ];     agab     Graph[agab, VertexLabels -> "Name", ImagePadding -> 10]      Now, I use`{1,3,4,2}` into input form. Then the graph looks like this ![1,3,4,2 tree graph](http://i.stack.imgur.com/hHLpX.png) But I have a problem when the levels are more than 4. It still left the vertex. Can anyone fix this code? Or maybe change into recursive mode? Thanks in advance.
