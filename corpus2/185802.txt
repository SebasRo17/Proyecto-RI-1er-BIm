until now I was using dropbox as my main vcs (it is not, but for a single dev does the job pretty decent). However I decided to give git a go and see if it fits my needs. Today I was reading this tutorial and at some point it says: > One of the things you should get used to is doing development in a separate > area, not where you're serving your files from, for obvious reasons I am doing development in django, and I can't find these "obvious reasons". Why can't I just use my project's folder to serve files to github? I would be happy if someone clarified this for me now that I am new to git.
