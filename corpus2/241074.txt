We have a project that is reaching a deadline for the final production release. It's a fixed price project and up till now we've managed to work in 2 week iterations, doing regular releases to our "inner test environment" where BAs and people acting as POs from the client's side had a chance to have a look, give feedback etc. We're now at the point where we have only 4 weeks to end this project and as we go to deploy the separate modules of this application to the client's environment, we've been struggling with a lot of bugs appearing. We have some functionality to be done still but my question is - what is the best way to handle those bugs as they appear? Since there's really a lot of them (due to project specifics, we didn't have the ability to test it on client's environment earlier) and it's impossible to estimate them up front + we have only 4 weeks till the end, does it make sense to keep Scrum or switch to Tech Lead dispatching work daily to the devs directly?
