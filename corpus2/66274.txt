I've searched, but found nothing directly applicable. I have 15 years or so development experience, in Unix, C, C++ mainly, (along with assorted script / minor languages) the last 5 years of this was contracting. My various testimonials and references over the years eventually convinced me I was pretty good at it too. Now, for the last 8 years I've been entirely non-technical and now know that to have been the wrong choice. The problem I face now apart from the skill set on the resume would put off some potential employers, is I've almost completely forgotten C++ and the little Java I had. I don't much fancy starting from scratch again! But that's how it feels when I sit and look at any non trivial C++ code. All that OO and class stuff and I'll pretty much give you a blank look. Surprisingly my C is still ok, well syntactically, though I imagine my design capabilities have taken quite a hit too. Anyone had experience of something similar? Am I realistically looking at years to get back to being half decent again? Apart from much practice and reading anything I can usefully do to get up to speed again faster? Ideally I don't want to face being stuck with the career change I **mistakenly** made 8 years ago. Help!
