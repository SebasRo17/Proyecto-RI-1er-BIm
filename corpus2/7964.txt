Based on an example from here I try to parse dates from a table including the time, but it fails. This is the modified example:               Export["test.dat", {{"2010-05-19 22:23:43", 17}, {"2010-05-20 22:23:43", 20}, {"2010-05-21 22:23:43", 19}}, "FieldSeparators" -> " "];          Import["test.dat", "Table", "DateStringFormat" -> {"Year", "-", "Month", "-", "Day", " ", "Hour", ":", "Minute", ":", "Second"}]      Does anyone understand why it doesn't work in analogy to the other case? thanks
