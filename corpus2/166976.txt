Both Mercurial and BitBucket make one fundamental assumption: 1 repo = 1 project. If I have a project that has a dependency (a library) which is shared by many projects, this assumption gets in the way. Now it is no longer possible to have a separate BitBucket page for each project while still being able to commit atomic revisions to multiple projects. If I put all the projects into one repo, they all become one “project” on BitBucket. If I put them in separate repos, it is no longer possible to know which version of the library project was in use at revision X of a dependent project. How is this situation normally solved on BitBucket, or is there explicitly no support for this common scenario?
