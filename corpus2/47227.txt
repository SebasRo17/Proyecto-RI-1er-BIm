I have a couple of best fit curves. All I want to do is superimpose them, to see if they are shaped differently. (I can eyeball them but I want to be sure, as it were). On to what I am asking: I have a couple of data sets. I graphed them both with the following and all was well:               IntData = {{0.05`, 2.835`}, {0.1`, 2.84`}, {0.2`, 2.845`}, {0.3`, 2.85`},                {0.4`, 2.865`}, {0.5`, 2.88`}, {0.6`, 2.9`}};     Fit[IntData, {1, amp, amp^2}, amp]     Plot[2.84 - 0.00005*amp + 0.176*amp^2, {amp, 0, 0.6},       AxesLabel -> {"Amplitude", "Period"}, AxesOrigin -> {0, 2.84}]      I did it again with a second data set. Everything looks the same except the numbers are different: Ëš IntData = Table[{amplitude[n], period[n]}, {n, 0, 6}]; Fit[IntData, {1, amp, amp^2}, amp] Plot[4.02 - 0.00698*amp + 0.271*amp^2, {amp, 0, 0.6}, AxesLabel -> {"Amplitude", "Period"}, AxesOrigin -> {0, 4.02}] Both sets generated nice curves. I wanted to have the curves superimposed so I tried setting up both data sets again with variables named differently:               amplitude1[0] = 0.05; period1[0] = 2.835;     amplitude1[1] = 0.10; period1[1] = 2.840;     amplitude1[2] = 0.20; period1[2] = 2.845;     amplitude1[3] = 0.30; period1[3] = 2.850;     amplitude1[4] = 0.40; period1[4] = 2.865;     amplitude1[5] = 0.50; period1[5] = 2.880;     amplitude1[6] = 0.60; period1[6] = 2.900;     IntData = Table[{amplitude1[n], period1[n]}, {n, 0, 6}];     Fit[IntData, {1, amp1, amp1^2}, amp1]       and               amplitude2[0] = 0.05; period2[0] = 4.010;     amplitude2[1] = 0.10; period2[1] = 4.015;     amplitude2[2] = 0.20; period2[2] = 4.02;     amplitude2[3] = 0.30; period2[3] = 4.035;     amplitude2[4] = 0.40; period2[4] = 4.05;     amplitude2[5] = 0.50; period2[5] = 4.075;     amplitude2[6] = 0.60; period2[6] = 4.105;     IntData = Table[{amplitude2[n], period2[n]}, {n, 0, 6}];     Fit[IntData, {1, amp2, amp2^2}, amp2]      and then tried this:               Plot[4.02 - 0.00698*amp2 + 0.271*amp2^2, {amp2, 0, 0.6},       AxesOrigin -> {0, 0},       2.84 - 0.00005*amp1 + 0.176*amp1^2, {amp1, 0, 0.6},       AxesLabel -> {"Amplitude", "Period"}, AxesOrigin -> {0, 0}]      thinking that would pu them both on the same graph, but I got an error message:               Plot::nonopt: Options expected (instead of {amp1,0,0.6}) beyond position 3 in Plot[4.02 -0.00698 amp2+0.271 amp2^2,{amp2,0,0.6},AxesOrigin->{0,0},2.84 -0.00005 amp1+0.176 amp1^2,{amp1,0,0.6},AxesLabel->{Amplitude,Period},AxesOrigin->{0,0}]. An option must be a rule or a list of rules. >>      Which I can sort-of-decipher but not really. So I am asking here what I did wrong. It's probably something obvious to many people here, but I am a rank beginner with Mathematica and am hoping that someone here can give me the kind of explanation they'd give to their grandmother. :-) No, I am not smarter than a 5th grader in this context. I hope this isn't too long a post. I'm just trying to get this done and offer my sincere thanks to those that answer. (And maybe this will help other newbies too, I can't be the only one)
