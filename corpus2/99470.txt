Currently I'm trying to select the best DB paradigm to implement a web site with _full-text search_ and _faceted search_ capabilities. I have an important functional requirement: **The database paradigm should support strong conceptual schema modifications during every part of software lifetime.** As a example, our business can pose an extra data item over a registry that should be taken into account in any search. If we use a relational paradigm, this modification requires to alter the database schema (by adding or deleting rows and modifying foreign keys etc.). Obviously, this can lead to maintainability unwanted issues.   1. Should we use a document based DB? (i.e. an XML database)   2. This problem can be treated as a purely relational conceptual schema design challenge? (i.e. we could design the relational DB having in mind the stated constraint)   3. Do you think that this problem should be treated using a specific paradigm?
