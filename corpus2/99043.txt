Consider two UI designers who want to design "user attractive" designs. "User attraction" is a concept that is not objective and only resides in the mind of designers. Thus designer A could for example pick up red color, while designer B picks blue. Designer A create a layout which is entirely different from designer B, and so on. I read about SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) and what I understood was kind of a subjective analysis or break down of responsibilities that can vary from an OO designer to another OO designer. Am I right? In other words, is it possible to have two excellent object oriented analyzer and designer who come up with two different designs for one system based on SRP principal?
