I'm looking to version control everything, including sql server components, a client launcher, and server-side software. I want to use an online resource where people can make updates, and make it easier to roll out any changes to players. Most of the files are just text files, or gtx image files. I don't think this qualifies as open source, so I don't know what to do. I tried github, and have a free account there, but it was really clunky, mass adding every file to be comitted. I really don't like subversion but if that's the best option, I'll use it. The other people who will need access to the files will have no familiarity with any kind of source control, so I need an easy system for them to download files, make changes, and comit to the repository. Any suggestions?
