I am trying to plot this ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/8I0EM.png) which is a numerical simulation of the Montgomery-Odlyzko law for the nontrivial 1st $10^5$ zeros of the Riemann zeta function $ζ(s)$. The solid line is given by `1-(Sin[π x]/(πx))^2`. The following is what I can't seem to interpret: > The blue symbols indicate the pair correlation function of normalized > spacings $δn=(γ_{n+1}-γ_n)\log(γ_n/2π)/2π$ between two consecutive > nontrivial zeros $1/2+iγ_n$ and $1/2+iγ_{n+1},\ n=1\dots10^5)$ of the > Riemann zeta function $ζ(s)$. from this page. I have looked at various ways of calculating the density, using `Histogram`, `NearestFunction`, `FindClusters`, etc. but am getting nothing like the image above. I realise that this is largely due to a conceptual misunderstanding, but I was hoping someone could point me in the right direction. # Update ![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BNIbu.gif) plotted with               DeleteCases[Flatten[Table[Abs[z1 - z2] Log[z2/(2 π)]/(2 π),      {z1, Take[zz,1000]}, {z2, Take[zz,1000]}]], 0];     Show[ListPlot[HistogramList[%, {0, 3, 0.1}][[2]]/200,      DataRange -> 3], Plot[1 - (Sin[π u]/(π u))^2, {u, 0, 3}]]      using First $10^5$ zeros as `zz`, thanks to Rahul Narain's comments below. Unfortunately, my computer won't calculate for $10^5$ zeros, but link left for those that will. ... I am now beginning to appreciate the computational power that would have to be used to generate an image like this or this!
