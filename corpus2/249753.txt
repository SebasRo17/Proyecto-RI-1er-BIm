When compiling with Visual Studio C++, I noticed that you need a specific MSV C++ Redist, depending on the version of Visual Studio you compile with. The required redistributable is necessary on machines without it. Otherwise without the redists missing MSVCPxxx.dll errors are prompt. Is there a way to by-pass needing the necessity of the redistributable? Or is there a way to package that inside of the program you're creating, be it DLL, executable, etc.?
