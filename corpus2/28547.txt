At the moment we have:   * Iphone   * Android   * J2me touch   * J2me non-touch   * J2me touch for Blackberry   * J2me non-touch for Blackberry We were thinking of making another   * J2me non-touch for crappy devices (because the regular non-touch is just to heavy) The question is, can you think of any other versions of our application that we should provide to target 'ALL' mobile phones
