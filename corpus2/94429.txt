So, I watched as my colleague complained a bit about a project he has inherited from someone who is, shall we say, not very experienced as a programmer (intern left to his own devices on a project). At one point there was duplicate code, about 7-8 lines of code duplicated (so 14-16 lines total) in a method of say 70-80 lines of code. We were discussing the code, and he spotted a way to refactor this to remove the duplication by simply altering the structure a bit. I said great, and then we should also move the code out to a separate method so the large method gets a little more readable. He said 'no, I would never create a method for just 7-8 lines of code'. Performance issues aside, what are **your** input on this? Do you lean against using more methods (which in c# pads code with about 3 lines) or larger methods, when that particular code will probably not be used anywhere else? So it is purely a readability issue, not a code-reuse one. Cheers :)
