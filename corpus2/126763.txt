Following is the Url for my website, http://www.price-tag.org . If you visit any category link, you will see it performing very slow. For example, if you visit http://www.price-tag.org/Store/Section/Computers , you will see a lag before the sub categories are loaded. This is just the very first phase and i have just added few categories to the database and nothing much. If it's working like this in the very beginning, what will happen when I start adding products. I am using Entity Framework Code-first approach. Following is the code for one of the action that retrieves the list of categories.               PriceCompareEntity pe = new PriceCompareEntity();         //         // GET: /Store/     public ActionResult Section(string id)     {         if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(id))         {             var catsAndSub = pe.Categories.Where(cat => cat.Name == id).FirstOrDefault();             if (catsAndSub == null || catsAndSub.ParentCategoryId != null)             {                 return View("NoSuchRootCat");             }             else             {                 ViewBag.Title = catsAndSub.MetaTitle;                 ViewBag.Description = catsAndSub.MetaDescription;                 ViewBag.Keywords = catsAndSub.MetaKeywords;                 return View(catsAndSub);             }         }         else         {             return View("NoSuchRootCat");         }     }      I am really worried and bit disappointed. After so much of hard work for last month or two, the results aren't any good. If things are going to be this slow, my whole project will sink. Can't imagine how slow will it be if i add a few hundreds of products to the site. Nobody's gonna bother visiting a dodo website. Have I done something wrong in the development ? And What can i do to get things right and straight. While surfing net, i came across web cache and other stuff, but they are very advanced and need quite bit learning. Besides, my website isn't any facebook or SO with millions of user so going that advanced into the subject seems a far cry and will take a lot of time to get things done. **Update** I have taken down the website, so links might not show the original content.
