Just a random observation, it seems that on StackOverflow.com, there are questions about if "++i == i++". That question gets asked all the time though, I think I saw it asked about 6 or 7 times in the past 2 months. I just wonder why C developers are so interested in it? The same concept/question exists for C# and Java devs as well, but I think I saw only one C# related question. Is it because so many examples use ++i? Is it because there is some popular book or tutorial? Is it because C developers just love to cram as much as possible into a single line for 'efficiency'/'performance' and therefore encounter 'weird' constructs using the ++ operator more often?
