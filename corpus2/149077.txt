I've been trying to implement a text classification system. It needs to read a text file, and extract the words and the word frequency. So far, I've been planning to parse the words, put them in a dictionary and save it to an XML file. I am using C++/CLI. Is this a good implementation or is there a simpler or better implementation? May be related question (some code implementation): http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10631309/save-dictionary-to-xml-file
