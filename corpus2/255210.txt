This days I'm reading some tutorials/advices about Kanban process and Agile methodologies, but I have two big questions about this Kanban methodology. What I understood is user stories are about adding bussiness value, like a feature which our customers can use. The main problem is we have a lot of features that looks trivial (simple form that manages synonyms for solr, for example) but are hard to implement and may take several days/weeks to complete, due to scaling/coordination details on our cluster (refreshing the synonyms using zk and reloading from database, for exmaple). How do you break down this user story into smaller ones since Kanban specificies every user story has to be independent? Can I break it down into user stories about implementation details? (implement coordination algorithm, implement X storage service, etc) And my last question is about architectural changes/refactoring. Since it doesn't add any bussiness value (invisible to our customers) how do you reflect this tasks in this methodology?
