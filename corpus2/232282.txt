As part of my workflow, I need to do all these steps in one transaction - I need to ftp files to 2 different FTP servers. - There is also a spreadsheet that gets generated which needs to be FTP'ed. Can this be streamed, instead of downloading and then pushed to FTP server. I am using Ruby Net::SFTP and Net::FTP libraries to send the files. I would like it to be robust. I am not sure if I need to do anything else or of this is good enough. Just to be clear, this is already working in production, I am not stuck, just looking to exchange design/architecture ideas on how to improve this.
