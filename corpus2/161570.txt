I work better when I have some firm foundations. This helps me to solve everyday problems better, because I can generalize them. The thing I find in programming is so many things are black boxes. Logic is scientific, but commands are not. A command in a language is just "something that does something". It is very hard to work out what its logic is, without understanding the underlying hardware. I learned brainfuck for a little bit, and enjoyed it very much, but it still has commands. These commands are packages of functionality that cannot really be understood without understanding all the lower levels of logic, unfortunately. What I would like to know is if there are any mathematical or logic principles that help with being able to generalise programming problems?
