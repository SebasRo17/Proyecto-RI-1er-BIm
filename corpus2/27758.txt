While developing, I would sometimes like to stop evaluation of selected cells at a certain point. The following example nearly seems to work, but repeated runs of `Ctrl+A, Enter` reveal something sticking in memory. Is there a good way break out of the evaluation queue?               Print["1"]          Print["2"]          FrontEndExecute@FrontEndToken["EvaluatorAbort"]          Print["3"]          Print["4"]      _Example of the problem:_ On the fourth repetition (on this occasion) of `Ctrl+A, Enter` the first cell does not evaluate. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/S5mdH.png)
