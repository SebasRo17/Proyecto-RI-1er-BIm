I'm busy working for my thesis about Web Development Frameworks. I want to write about frameworks that have been used in the past and frameworks that have a good chance of lasting in the future, such as JQuery and PrimeFaces for example. I also want to do a survey and I am looking for good questions to ask on this survey. My questions is what web developers themselves are most interested in answering and what you think would be good questions in this survey to ask? For example, I was thinking about giving a list of current technologies and giving the possibility to give a score from 1 tot 10 to indicate which they prefer the most.
