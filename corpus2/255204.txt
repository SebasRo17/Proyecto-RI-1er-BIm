I've been with my software team for about three years now, and just recently I brought up the concept of variable naming conventions (across all languages, but C#/VB.Net specifically). We really don't have any solid naming conventions. I was met with serious resistance - so what?, does it really matter?, blank stares, etc. I was able to get the others to agree to at least be consistent on a given code file (not ideal, but with this group, any standards that is based around anything other than SQL is a step forward). My question is this - I've always received resistance to developing standards.   * Should I just stop pushing standards and accept the fact that everyone seems to be doing their own thing when they code?
