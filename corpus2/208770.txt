I'm working on reviving a C++ codebase that hasn't been touched since '97. It's academic software for text analysis, and originally it was non- functional, it wouldn't even compile. I fixed the code so that it works, and added some new functionality of my own. I'm doing this privately for someone else, and they will pay me over a student contract. I signed nothing with them, so ultimately, my work belongs to me. Given that they agree (I don't want to be rude), would I be able to relicense this code under GPL, and post it on a site like GitHub? The current license is as follows: > Copyright (C) 1997, Carnegie Mellon University. All rights reserved. This > software is made available for research purposes only. It may be > redistributed freely for this purpose, in full or in part, provided that > this entire copyright notice is included on any copies of this software and > applications and derivations thereof. > > This software is provided on an "as is" basis, without warranty of any kind, > either expressed or implied, as to any matter including, but not limited to > warranty of fitness of purpose, or merchantability, or results obtained from > use of this software. Seems like I would have to include that notice as well.
