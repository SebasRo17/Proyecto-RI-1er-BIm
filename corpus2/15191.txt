What is the best way to call `NDSolve` for solving a system of differential equations of the form               Am.y'[x] + Bm.y[x]/x + Cm.y[x] == Dv       with `y[0] == Ev` in the interval x from 0 to 1. where y is an n-vector, Am, Bm, and Cm are n x n coefficient matrices, and Dv and Ev are n vectors. Say with               n=100;     Am = RandomReal[1,{n,n}];     Bm = RandomReal[1,{n,n}];     Cm = RandomReal[1,{n,n}];     Dv = RandomReal[1,{n}];     Ev = RandomReal[1,{n}];
