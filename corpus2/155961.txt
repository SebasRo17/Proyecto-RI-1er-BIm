I realise that this might not be the right place to ask questions about employment and that the question my raise debate etc. The company I work for recently decided that rather than having one web developer working on sites from a branch it would be better to make that person come into head office and work in the middle of a busy call centre. Also they're expecting the developer to answer the phone if it rings and take messages. Does anyone find that strange? Is it really the right place for a programmer to work? Thanks for the advice
