I have the following data:               data = {{493, 416}, {1330, 1586, 1579, 1424, 1667, 1023, 665}, {1963,          428, 1797, 1832, 1697, 549, 526}, {1742, 2040, 1767, 1876, 1680,          668, 531}, {1751, 1565, 1577, 1693, 1691, 584, 523}, {1356}};          days = {{Saturday, Sunday}, {Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,          Friday, Saturday, Sunday}, {Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,          Friday, Saturday, Sunday}, {Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,          Friday, Saturday, Sunday}, {Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,          Friday, Saturday, Sunday}, {Monday}};          daysnum = {{1, 2}, {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, {10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,          16}, {17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23}, {24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29,          30}, {31}};      I want to plot a BarChart and to use more than one ChartLabel. I have created a handmade picture so that you can know what I mean. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/gFOXC.jpg) How can I create a ChartLabel at the x-axis and at the center and the top of the BarChart?   Is it possible to color a ChartLabel according to the Bars colors?
