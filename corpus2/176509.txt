I often hear the term that language A is written in language B. For example, **PHP** has been written **C** , **C#** is written in **C++**. Can someone please explain what does that mean and if it is even correct? Does that have anything to do with the compiler of interpreter used by the language? In addition what are the factors on which the choice of the implementing language is built upon?
