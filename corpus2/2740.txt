I integrate               Integrate[Exp[I Cos[b - c]] Cos[b], {b, 0, 2 Pi}]      Mathematica gives:               2 I Pi BesselJ[1, 1]      Which is indepedent on $c$. However, the result is NOT independent on $c$. The numerical value of what Mathematica gives is `0. + 2.76492 I` while               NIntegrate[Exp[I Cos[b - 0.5]] Cos[b], {b, 0, 2 Pi}]      Gives               1.16655*10^-10 + 2.42645 I      Certainly not the same. If we multiply the value Mathematica gives with $\cos(0.5)$ the result is the same. What is wrong?
