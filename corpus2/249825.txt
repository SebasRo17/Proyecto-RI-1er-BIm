This seems like a basic question, but I have not found a definitive source. I need to modify the source for an LGPL application for my employer to plug a security hole. Longer term we will upgrade to a later version of this application, but for now, this is the quickest solution. (specifically: I will change a 2005-era version fork of Apache Tomcat'--jboss- web 2.0.1--to add allow "httpOnly" and 'secure' JSESSIONID cookie). **The question** What exactly must I/my company do to "make available" or "publish" the source code? Must it be accessible from the company's own website or github repository? Or can I have it on my own private github account and simply have the company link to it? thanks
