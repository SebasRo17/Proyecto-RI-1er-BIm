I have an idea for a web application and have some good people keen to get involved. I will be doing most of the code at the start and have a few years experience with some quite large projects. I have nearly 0 budget. What view should I take with regard to data storage / database? Get the project running quickly and inexpensively, then re-evaluate if it is a success? Does anyone have experience with this and advice?
