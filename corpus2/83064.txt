I'm reading about application layers, and want to use this design in my next project (c#, .Net). Some questions:   1. Is the separation of layers done through namespaces? Project.BLL.Whatever, Project.DAL.Whatever   2. Is it more appropriate to separate by layers, then components (Project.BLL.Component1), or by components, then layers (Project.Component1.BLL)   3. For my DAL, is this layer further organized using different classes? If all database calls are put into a single class, there is no organization. Would it be better to split these up with different classes or namespaces?   4. Are DAL classes typically static? It seems cumbersome to instantiate a DAL object before calling one of its methods each time.  Any other tips for doing things the correct way with these layers would be appreciated.
