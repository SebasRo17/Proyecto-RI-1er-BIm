> **Possible Duplicate:**   >  When do you not give help to less experienced programmers? Currently, I am finding a lot of my day is taken up by people asking domain knowledge/system questions. This impacts personal productivity. Should developers learn to say "no" more to ensure they get asked less questions and be more productive, or should the developers help each other out? Stuff does get documented, but it is often easier to ask a "quick question". How do you handle this sort of scenario?
