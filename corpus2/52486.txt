If this is the wrong place to ask this question, please let me know. I'm a Python programmer by occupation. I would love to learn C. Indeed, I have tried many times, but I always get discouraged. In Python, you write a few lines and the program does wonders. In C, I can't seem to be able to do anything useful. It seems to be very complicated to even connect to the Internet. Do you have any suggestions on what I can do to learn C? Are there are any good websites? Any cool projects? Thanks
