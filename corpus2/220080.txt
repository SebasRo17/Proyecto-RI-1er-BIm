Assume there is a web service which is visible publicly but it must be just responsive to a specific client application. Is there any mechanism to check client side application identity to prevent disallowed application to access the service? For instance, I have a web service which is called by my iOS application. I want to prevent others from calling my web service. Regarding the fact that others can decompile my client application and create another one which is working the same as mine, I think the only way to avoid unwanted access to the service is to check application identity on server to ensure the request comes from my own application. Is there any robust and secure way to do that?
