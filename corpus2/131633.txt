I'm an IT student and have been working on team based projects for several years. I've read some papers about CMMI and Scrum; this is really interesting to me and I would like to know what kind of jobs involve improving processes inside an organization. What kind of studies can lead someone towards these jobs? Management? I doubt it's only that, as CMMI/Scrum affect management as well, I think it's something above it all, that will hold together the organization.
