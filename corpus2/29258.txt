In _Mathematica_ the default behavior of output cells is to pop up after the kernel has processed the input cells and got a result. I know I could add `;` in the end of input cells to disable output cells, which are often too messy in the middle of my calculations and usually I don't really care what they are, from appearing. However sometimes I need to go back and check some stuff, so it is still necessary to keep those intermediate results there. Then my questions is that **is it possible to "fold" output cells?** By "folding" I mean it would look as if I manually double click the cell, so the output cell will be hidden and an arrow appears next to the input cell. I tried to find some related settings described in this post, but nothing useful there. Thanks!
