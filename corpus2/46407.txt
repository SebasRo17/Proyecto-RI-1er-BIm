I have a problem with a must-be simple streamplot. The potential function governing the motion is U, and I have the following code in Mathematica:               U = -((1000.` x (1.25` - 1.` Sqrt[1 + 625.` x^2]))/Sqrt[1 + 625.` x^2])     StreamPlot[{Φ, -U}, {x, -0.05, 0.05}, {Φ, -1.5, 1.5}, StreamPoints -> Fine]      The problem is that I get the following plot: ![Wanna-be beautiful streamplot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pOxIy.png) What did I do wrong, or how should I overcome this horror? EDIT The result should look like the following phase plane plot created by MatLab: ![MatLab version](http://i.stack.imgur.com/nvpE8.png) The MatLab code snippet:               f=@(Y) [Y(2); -1/2*Y(1)*(1000-1250/sqrt(1+625*Y(1)^2))];     y1=linspace(-0.06,0.06,20);     y2=linspace(-0.5,0.5,20);     [x,y]=meshgrid(y1,y2);          u=zeros(size(x));     v=zeros(size(y));          for i=1:numel(x)         Yprime=f([x(i); y(i)]);         u(i)=Yprime(1);         v(i)=Yprime(2);     end          quiver(x,y,u,v,'r');     figure(gcf)     xlabel('x')     ylabel('xdot')     axis([-0.08 0.08 -0.6 0.6])      I used the same equation here, unfortunately due to the aspect ratio the arrows are a bit distorted. I would like the Mathematica plot to have arrows 'all over the place' as in MatLab, so somehow the seeding should be altered. I would prefer the streamplot of mathematica rather than the MatLab version, as the StreamPlot shows the arrows along trajectories, whereas MatLab generates only a vectorfield.
