I have many of the following expressions created by `CForm` of _Mathematica_ :                24612842763116842319872/(5042560366642267*x - 256*(2446745837411900 + 4901398098088043*y - 144207654645973248*z));      Another example for testing:                (-524288*(29427736469514379027531261659072347 + 58899562724319710108573382000184640*y - 1732944474195510410991057714955859184*z))/ Power(5042560366642267*x - 256*(2446745837411900 + 4901398098088043*y - 144207654645973248*z),2)       What is the regular expression rule to use in _Mathematica_ in order to convert all the long integers into the product of their prime factors in _Mathematica_ by function below?               RegularExpression["regex"]      My thoughts are, first extract every long integer, and `FactorInteger` them to obtain all prime factors; then replace the original long integers with product of their prime factors. The target final expression should be usable immediately in C/C++. But I have no idea how to use the regular expression rule.
