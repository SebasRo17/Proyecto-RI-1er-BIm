I have a system of ODEs that I solve. During the integration process, there's an event that I want to catch, but I want to (a) continue the integration after the event and (b) catch only the first one. For example, let's say I want to calculate $\pi/2$ by this method:               flag = False;     NDSolve[{y''[t] == -y[t], y[0] == 0, y'[0] == 1}, y, {t, 0, 20},       Method -> {"EventLocator", "Event" -> ((! flag) && y'[t] == 0),         "EventAction" :> (flag = True; piHalf = t;)}]      For some reason this does not work - the events keep being triggered even though the value of `flag` does change. ![screenshot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/yeXnJ.png) In the end of the process I get $\pi/2=17.28$ (this might be disastrous if I'll use this value to build airplanes!) How can I solve this?
