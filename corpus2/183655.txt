I have some experience in Java programming and enterprise application development. I have done OOP, data structures in C++ for my undergraduate studies. But I couldn't touch C++ for years. Now I am interested in C++ again and I would like to polish my C++ knowledge and become an expert in C++ . How do I start my journey in C++ again? In this journey would like to learn some advanced concepts in C++ like network programming, distributed computing,.. etc.
