I occasionally work with large 3D arrays and found that with calculations that take a long time, Mathematica completely fills my available RAM (6056 MB minus other active operations [mostly svchost]), and so completely bogs down my pc that it takes minutes to even [alt][dot] abort evaluation, or do anything at all in a different program. At one point I was working with an active 4 GB 2.0 USB plugged in with readyboost, and it prevented my computer from freezing. So my question, can I prevent Mathematica from freezing without the readyboost, and might upgrading to 8 GB RAM also solve the issue? To be clear, it doesn't run out of memory, it just takes up all working memory for the duration of the computations. I'm not sure if readyboost also increases performance, I know people usually disregard it for any but the lowest performing computers, but it's a lifesaver here.
