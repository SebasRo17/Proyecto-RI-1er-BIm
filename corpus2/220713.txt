After adopting Agile for a while now, we started to think that we can improve how we do Agile. But for starter, we need to know how well are we doing now and to identify the problems in our current processes before we can improve it. One thing we notice is that every team do Agile a little different from another. A ritual might works well for one team but not for another team. So we want to identify these incompatibilities in our team. What are the common tools/methods that your organization uses to identify these problems?
