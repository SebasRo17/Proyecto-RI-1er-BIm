Whether for nested `If`s or within scoping constructs like `Module` and `Block`, I never know whether to end the final expression with a semicolon. I know the semicolon suppresses output, but, for example, in a series of nested `If`s, one needs only to semicolon the outermost `If` to suppress output. So, is it better practice to semicolon _everything_ unless output is needed? Or is it better to semicolon _nothing_ until the last point where output is unwanted?
