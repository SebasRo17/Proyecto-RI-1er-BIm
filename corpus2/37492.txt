I have a huge square matrix, with a lot of zero columns and zero rows: $m=\left( \begin{array}{ccccccccc} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 3 & 7 & 9 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 & 8 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 2 & 6 & 3 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \end{array} \right)$ In general, I don't know where the zero columns (and rows), but when $i$-th row is empty, then $i$-th column is is also zero. My question is: Is there any internal command to delete all zero columns and zero rows? My motivation for this question is: I want to evaluate the eigenvalues of this huge matrix, which is slow. If I can reduce the matrix efficiently, Eigenvalues[] can be sped up.
