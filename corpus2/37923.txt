I'm trying to analyze a certain infinite sequence $S$, indexed by positive integers starting from $1$. It can be split into two subsequences:   * $S^{odd}$ by removing all even-indexed elements and keeping all odd-indexed ones, and   * $S^{even}$ by removing all odd-indexed elements and keeping all even-indexed ones. Each of these two sequences has its own indexing by positive integers starting from $1$, so indexes of their elements do not match indexes of corresponding elements in $S$, e.g. $S^{odd}_3=S_5$, $S^{even}_2=S_4$. I got two different `DifferenceRoot` expressions representing $S^{odd}$ and $S^{even}$. I would like to merge them into a single `DifferenceRoot` expression representing $S$. I suppose I need to somehow align their indexing and then use `DifferenceRootReduce`. > What is the simplest way to do that?
