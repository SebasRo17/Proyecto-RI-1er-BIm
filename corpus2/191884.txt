My organization does web projects and employs a handful of disciplines like backend dev, frontend, BA, UX, graphic design, QA. We've been pushing to have tasks for every discipline in our sprints with explicit dependencies (Can't build a page without comps, can't do comps without wires, etc). I've heard some other organizations say that scrum is only for dev tasks. Are we barking up the wrong tree? And, if not, are there any good tools for doing capacity planning when only certain resources can do certain tasks?
