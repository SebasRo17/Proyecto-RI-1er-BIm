I am reading Mathematica Cookbook, chapter 1. Author gives two examples, with the following explanation > You can control precision within a complex calculation (without using `N[]` > on every intermediate result) by changing these values; however, you should > only do so within a `Block` (a local context). For example, compare the > difference between a calculation with automatic precision for intermediate > results to the same calculation with fixed precision (obtained by making > `$MinPrecision == $MaxPrecision` ).               In[1]:= SetPrecision[(1 + Exp[Sqrt[2] + Sqrt[3]])/2^25, 32]          Out[1]= 7.226780742612584668840452114476*10^-7          In[2]:=         Block[{$MinPrecision = 32, $MaxPrecision = 32},           SetPrecision[(1 + Exp[Sqrt[2] + Sqrt[3]])/2^25, 32]]          Out[2]= 7.2267807426125846688404521144759*10^-7      Why two results are different, despite the fact that precision was set to 32 digits in both expression ? And what is "automatic precision" ?   Edit: user "rcollyer" points out that > running `Precision` on the two results gives 31.5935 and 32..
