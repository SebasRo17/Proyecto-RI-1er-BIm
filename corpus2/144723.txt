I'm a junior web developer in the first steps of my professional career. I'm starting off by maintaining projects written in PHP. Wherever I looked, I see people saying that PHP is a bad language and it's broken in so many ways but it's so widely used now and we can't just make everyone switch to something else. So, why people doesn't seem to try fixing it? Is it because of PHP? The dev core team? People just fed-up and went trying using something else? Please don't get me wrong. I'm not trying to be rude here, I just want to find some answers. :-)
