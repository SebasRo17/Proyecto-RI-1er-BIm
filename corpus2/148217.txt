In this blog posting by Uncle Bob http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/04/20/Why-Is-Estimating-So-Hard.html Author states a possible solution to the problem at hand. He writes "Try this. Break some long string of text up into columns that are 10 characters long. Each time you break a line, record the position of the break, and why you decided to use that position." The problem is about breaking the Address into 13 character columns, so where does 10 come into play? Or is he using that as another example unrelated to the Gettysburg one? I'd like to present this to my team in a presentation I have to do soon. I plan to describe the posting, describe the problem and ask my team members for their estimates. After I would go on to explain the rest of the postings premise about why estimations are often blown. Feel free to offer suggestion on how I can make this a good presentation. I can visualize most of it but towards the end it feels light. After the quick survey, I focus on the problem of estimating the wrong thing and then offer the solution.
