I noticed in this question, Behavior of Graphics`Mesh`InPolygonQ with self- intersecting polygons, that _Mathematica_ has some "psuedo-hidden" functionality for allowing one to quickly perform a winding number calculation to tell if a point is inside of a polygon mesh. As a shot in the dark, is there built-in functionality to detect if a point sits in a 3D graphics primitive like `Cylinder`?
