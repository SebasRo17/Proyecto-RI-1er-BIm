Let's say 3-5 years ago (more or less) n-tier application on the server side - and some javascript/html/CSS for the UI was a basic approach for web development. Nowadays we can see that traditional web development paradigm changes a lot. Each day I saw more and more application who do not have server side in traditional way. They just consume some services (data-service, auth-service, etc.) but the business logic placed on client side. Also already a lot of javascript frameworks creates for simplify development according such model (Angular, Backbone, etc.) What are the main benefits and disadvantages of new model versus traditional approach?
