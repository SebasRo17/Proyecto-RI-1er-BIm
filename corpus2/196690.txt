By email I just answered my brother who is learning computer programming that C++ and Java are more similar than C and C++ even though C++ is nearly a superset of C. Do you agree? AFAIK Stanley Lippman wrote the "canonical work" (C++ Primer) on C++ and Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan wrote the "canonical work" (The C Programming Language) on C but I'm no C++ expert so I ask you the question.
