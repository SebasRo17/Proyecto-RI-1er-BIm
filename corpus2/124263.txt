I'm looking for a good book on algorithms and data structures for a beginner. I was reading some reviews of these two books: Introduction to Algoritms and The Algorithm Design Manual. Introduction to Algorithms is widely recognized but at the same time many people consider a great book but only as a bible/reference/encyclopedia. The Algorithm Design Manual seems to be considered too basic, "a shopping catalog of algorithms" and some people recommend against it. The thing is those kind of opinions seems to be based on the 1st edition. According to author of the book: > "This newly expanded and updated second edition continues to take the > "mystery" out of designing algorithms, and analyzing their efficacy and > efficiency. Expanding on the first edition, the book now serves as the > primary textbook of choice for algorithm design courses while maintaining > its status as the premier practical reference guide to algorithms for > programmers, researchers, and students." > > "The second edition contains enough material to serve as the textbook for a > standard Introduction to Algorithms course. I assume the reader has > completed the equivalent of a second programming course, typically titled > Data Structures or Computer Science II." So my question is, what do you think about The Algorithm Design Manual 2nd edition for a beginner that wants to learn about algorithms and data structures? Is it actually better than the 1st edition for the task? Or do you think CLRS is a better option?
