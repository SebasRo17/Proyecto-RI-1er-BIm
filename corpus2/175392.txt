So the problem is that I have a 3D projection of a rectangle that I want to turn into 2D. That is I have a photo of a sheet of paper laying on a table which I want to transform into a 2D view of that sheet. Thus, what I need is to get an un-distorted 2D image by reverting all the 3D/projection transformations and getting a plain view of the sheet from the top. I happened to find some directions on the subject but they don't suggest an immediate instruction on how this can be achieved. It would be really helpful to get a step-by-step instruction of what needs to be done. Or, alternatively, a link on a resource that breaks it down to little details.
