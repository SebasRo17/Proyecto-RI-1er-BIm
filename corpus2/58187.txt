I have a second order ordinary differential equation and want to solve it numerically. Although I have specified values at the boundary, Mathematica solution does not match with boundary conditions.               h = 10.6     F = 0.001     d = 1.0     L = 100*d     phi[x_] :=       Piecewise[{{0.5*(1 - Tanh[x]),          x < L*0.5/d}, {0.5*(1 + Tanh[x - L/d]), x > L*0.5/d}}]     s = NDSolve[{u''[x] == (h)*phi[x]*phi[x]*u[x] - F*d*d*(1 - phi[x]),         u[-2.5] == 0.0, u[L + 2.5] == 0.0}, u, {x, -2.5, L + 2.5}]     vL[x_] := u[x]/(1 - phi[x])          Plot[Evaluate[{vL[x]} /. s], {x, L/d + 1.5, L/d + 2.5},       PlotRange -> All]          {u[-2.5], u[L + 2.5]} /. s      ![Mathematica graphics](http://i.stack.imgur.com/sPymr.png) > >     {{9.02944, -1.11442*10^-25}} >   What is the correct way to set the boundary conditions?
