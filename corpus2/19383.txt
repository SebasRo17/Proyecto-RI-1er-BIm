I'm trying to display the text $y+\tau\theta$ using the following graphics directive inside a Show[] with several other graphics objects:               Graphics3D[{FontSize -> 28, Text[y + \[Tau]\[Theta], {1, 0.1, .5}]}]      However, the displayed text is shown as $\tau\theta+y$ instead of $y+\tau\theta$. This isn't a huge deal, but I'm trying to keep my notation consistent. If I enclose the text in quotes, it displays it in the correct order but in "text" font instead of "math" font. Any suggestions? I'm using version 8, if it makes a difference.
