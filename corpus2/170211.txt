I am currently reviewing a code base and noticed that a majority of the calls (along with DB connections) are just buried inside the PHP scripts. I would have assumed that like other languages they would have developed some sort of data access layer (Like I would do in .Net or Java) for all of the communication to the DB (or implemented MVC, etc). Is this still a common pattern in PHP or is there alternative methodologies/patterns for this technology? I am just trying to understand why the subs would have developed it this way. Any insight/info on how experienced developers design an approach data access in PHP would be very much appreciated.
