I'm wondering how should testing take place in small teams (or start-up teams). I'm talking 5-10 developers that are assigned to multiple development tasks. From my experience there is little to none testing in the development process, but I also hear small teams **can** get through the initial level of software process maturity. How does QA and testing take place during development in a mature-but-small team? (please, if you can, describe the whole software process including who should be doing what) EDIT (more detail): I'm especially interested in a team developing a distributed processing- intensive back-end with a website as it's API. The two parts (back-end, front- end) are developed by two different groups of 3. I want to understand **who tests what, and when**. If I write a module and it's unit tests, do I write integration tests when completing the code? Should you assign a developer on such a small group to focus on testing?
