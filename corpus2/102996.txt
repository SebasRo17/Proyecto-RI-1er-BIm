Here's the scenario: a client of mine (lets call them Company A) had a website built by someone else (let's call them Company B). They then asked me (Company C) to configure a third party framework to look and feel exactly the same as what Company B built for them. Would it be legitimate for me to use content (including images, CSS, and even HTML) from the site Company B built for Company A? It's worth mentioning Company A's name is in the copyright notice in the footer of the site Company B made for Company A.
