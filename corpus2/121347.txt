I don't like issue tracking systems because:   * It takes too much time to describe issues in it. This discourage its usage.   * You create a place to keep your bugs. And if there is a place for them, people usually don't care too much about fixing a bug cause they can put it there so that someday someone can fix it (or not).   * With time, the bug lists gets so long that nobody can deal with it anymore, taking up a lot of our time. I prefer handling issues using post-its on a white board, face-to-face conversations and killing important bugs as soon as they appear. I don't care too much to keep track of bug history because I don't think that it is worth the overhead. Am I alone here? Are there studies (book/article/whatever) about the disadvantages (or great advantages) of using issue tracking systems?
