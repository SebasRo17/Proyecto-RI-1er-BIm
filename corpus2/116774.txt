I use quite some "non-commercial" applications when working on software projects. For clarification, I mean developing **applications** here, for example smartgit, **not libraries** or anything that gets shipped. Is it legal to provide a donation button for projects made using the non- commercial of certain applications? I know, I know, "consult a lawyer". Here's the real world: I'm a 16 year old hobbyist programmer that doesn't have the time nor money to consult one - a quick question on the internet would probably be a better idea.
