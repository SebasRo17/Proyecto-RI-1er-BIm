Which _dependently typed_ programming languages could be used for real world _application development_? I will mostly be writing toy applications at first, after that maybe web development or a simple DBMS. These are some points, that I think are important:   * documentation   * example programs   * a good/big standard library   * an easy to use foreign function interface   * a community of people using the language for real world tasks   * tool support I am aware that there is currently no language that meets all these requirements. I'd like to know which one comes closest.
