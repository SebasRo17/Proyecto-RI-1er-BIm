I have a list of elements:               {{1, 2}, {1, 5}, {2, 6}, {3, 7}, {4, 8}, {5, 6},       {5, 9}, {9, 13}, {10,11}, {11, 12}, {11, 15}, {15, 16}}      I have to divide it into sublists, so that:               #1[[1]] == #2[[1]] || #1[[1]] == #2[[2]] || #1[[2]] == #2[[1]] || #1[[2]] == #2[[2]] &      i.e. at the end I need to obtain:               {{{1, 2}, {1, 5}, {2, 6}, {5, 6}, {5, 9}, {9, 13}},      {3, 7}, {4, 8}, {{10,11}, {11, 12}, {11, 15}, {15, 16}}}      However, I cannot find a solution to do it with `Gather`. How can I accomplish this task?
