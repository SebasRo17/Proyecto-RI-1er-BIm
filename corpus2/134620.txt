Unfortunately, there are not currently any books on the subject of 'Learn Android Development with Scala', which would be the ideal solution. I'm guessing that I'll need to pick up at least 3 books here, one for each topic. However, I have no idea what order to read them in, whether to read them simultaneously, what parts of the Java book I can safely skip, etc. What is the best path for me to get started building Android apps using Scala?
