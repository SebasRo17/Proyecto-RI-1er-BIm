I'm trying to plot the output of the following function `t2[x_]` in                   n1[x_] := 4 \[Pi]*x + Sin[2 \[Pi] 0.6 x];              t2[x_] := Solve[4 \[Pi] t + Sin[2 \[Pi] 0.6 t ] - n1[x] == 2 \[Pi] && x < t, t];      Now, if I type in a particular value it gives the expected answer:                   t2[1]      > {{t -> 1.5}} But I can't figure out how to input `x` as a continuous variable, or even a discrete list. I've also tried plotting `Evaluate[t2[x]]` and `Plot[x /. t2, {x, 0, 2}]` in all combinations I can think of but I just can't get it to work. Any help would be greatly appreciated, Rick
