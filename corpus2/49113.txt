I'm trying to launch some kernels in a cluster engine running _Sun Grid Engine_ using _Cluster integration_. But I'm getting the error "Cannot find components required for SGE".               Needs["ClusterIntegration`"]     kernels = LaunchKernels[SGE["server", 16]]      > SGE::load: Cannot find components required for SGE. >> I doubt this is an error in the cluster side, as I get the same error regardless if I point to the correct server host name or not, so I think it fails locally (Mathematica 9.0.1.0) Also the documented option "Timeout" doesn't seems to exist, and the option "NetworkInterface" does not explain how to specify the interface..               Options[SGE]      > {"EnginePath" -> "/usr/local/sge/sge_root", "KernelOptions" -> "-subkernel > -mathlink -LinkMode Connect -LinkProtocol TCPIP \ -LinkName `linkname`", > "KernelProgram" -> "/usr/local/Wolfram/Mathematica/7.0/Executables/math", > "NativeSpecification" -> "", "NetworkInterface" -> "", "ToQueue" -> False} Any help would be appreciated.
