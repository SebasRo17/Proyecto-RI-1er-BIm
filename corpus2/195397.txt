For performance issue I want the logging send to a new thread. While the main program can work, the new thread can write the error or other messages to a file without effect to the main program. How could I send all stdout to the new thread? Work to be done:   * create a new thread, ok   * open a file, ok   * create a pipe inside the thread, ok   * send stdout to the new thread, with freopen or dup? Every time the buffer gets full, or every 5 seconds the log file gets new data. Because it is an MPI program, I can't fork the whole program. It has to be a Posix thread.
