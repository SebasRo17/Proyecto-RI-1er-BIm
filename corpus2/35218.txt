I'm trying to solve a simple PDE in _Mathematica_. I just can't get _Mathematica_ to give me an explicit analytical solution. This is the code that I made and it basically repeats in the output what I have given in the input. Below are my input and output. What am I doing wrong?               pde = D[u[z, t], {t, 1}] + const* D[u[z, t], {z, 2}] == 0     DSolve[pde, u[z, t], {z, t}]      > >     (u^(0,1))[z,t]+const (u^(2,0))[z,t]==0 >     DSolve[(u^(0,1))[z,t]+const (u^(2,0))[z,t]==0,u[z,t],{z,t}] >
