`Compress[]` was introduced in version 6 of Mathematica. It gives a compressed version of expressions represented as a string of ASCII characters. It preserves more information than the `InputForm` of expressions (for example it keeps packed arrays packed). Are the strings returned by `Compress` compatible between versions? Can a compressed expression created using version 6 be uncompressed in version 8? What about the reverse (reading a version-8-compressed expression in 6 or 7)? What happens if a version 8 specific object such as `Graph` is uncompressed in version 6 or 7?
