I wrote a code which plots a Maclaurin expansion of cos(x) in various degrees.               f[x_] := Cos[x]     Animate[       Plot[Evaluate @ Normal[Series[f[x], {x, 0, s}]],{x, -10 Pi, 10 Pi},         PlotRange -> {-1, 1}],        {s, 0, 80, 2}]      This code works well. Next, I just added the original function to Plot, but it does not work.               f[x_] := Cos[x]     Animate[       Plot[{Evaluate @ Normal[Series[f[x], {x, 0, s}]], f[x]}, {x, -10 Pi, 10 Pi},         PlotRange -> {-1, 1}],        {s, 0, 80, 2}]      I found that just one function in the List style is also not work correctly.               Plot[{Evaluate @ Normal[Series[f[x], {x, 0, 20}]]}, {x, -10 Pi, 10 Pi},       PlotRange -> {-1, 1}]      What's wrong with what I am doing?
