Considering the PCWorld review that came out in March: > ### Free Android Apps Packed with Ads are Major Battery Drains > > ...Researchers from Purdue University in collaboration with Microsoft claim > that third-party advertising in free smartphone apps can be responsible for > as much as 65 percent to 75 percent of an app's energy consumption... Is there a best practice for integrating advert support into mobile applications, so as to not drain user battery too much? > ...When you fire up Angry Birds on your Android phone, the researchers found > that the core gaming component only consumes about 18 percent of total app > energy. The biggest battery suck comes from the software powering third- > party ads and analytics accounting for 45 percent of total app energy, > according to the study... Has anyone invoked better ways of keeping away from the "3G Tail", as the report puts it? Is it better/possible to download a large set of adverts that are cached for a few hours, and using them to populate your ad space, to avoid constant use of the Wi-Fi/3G radios? Are there any best practices for the inclusion of adverts in mobile apps?
