I want to make a program where I have a collection of labeled vertices and edges between the vertices such that they join up with edges $a_{1} a_{2}, \; a_{2} a_{3}, \ldots ,\; a_{n} a_{1}$, so the edges form a "circle". Then I want to be able to input whether edges cross each other, and if they do, which edge crosses over and which edge crosses under. Is it possible to do this with _Mathematica_?
