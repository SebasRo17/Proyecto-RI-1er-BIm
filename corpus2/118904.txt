So, I like dabbling in intelligent agent design (mainly video-game 'bots' but also some general task automation), but as a budding psychologist, I'd be really interested in a platform for developing such agents in a cognitively plausible setting. Such a platform would probably take the form of a cognitive architecture, but since these are meant to be implementations of psychological theories above all else, I'm worried that none of them are up for actually acting as an intelligent agent in a complex software environment like a video-game. Has anyone tried using such an architecture to produce an agent of the kind I've been describing? Failing that, do any cognitive architectures look particularly suitable for this sort of job? My current hunch is that a hybrid architecture like CLARION might work, but not having any experience with it, I'm still hesitant. I know that SOAR has famously been used to simulate a fighter pilot, but that took years of hand-coding production rules, and thus seems like an impractical platform from my standpoint.
