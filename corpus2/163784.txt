I'm getting ready for my first "bigger" .NET project (ASP.NET MVC 3/4) on which I'm going to lead another 2 programmers and right now I'm choosing the right version control system for the job (plus I'm gonna use it for my future development too). My problem is that I did't use any version control system before, so I would like it to have as fast learning curve and intuitive merging as possible. So far I quickly looked at VisualSVN (I like the Visual Studio integration in it), but I'm reading everywhere how Git is awesome and dunno which one to choose (not limited to these two).. Maybe I'm ovethinking this but I like when everything goes smoothly:) I'd like to hear some opinions from people who used multiple version control systems (preferably on VS projects) **what do you think is the less complicated and effective version control system for such a use (one to 5 man projects)?**
