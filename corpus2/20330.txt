I am very poor at visualization. I want to make a transparent "building" filled with gas. I wrote the following code for the building and it's fine.                w = 100;      l = 200;      h = 30;      m = 70;      backwall = {{0, l, 0}, {w, l, 0}, {w, l, h}, {0, l, h}};      side1 = {{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, h}, {0, l, h}, {0, l, 0}};      side2 = {{w, 0, 0}, {w, 0, h}, {w, l, h}, {w, l, 0}};      floor = {{0, 0, 0}, {w, 0, 0}, {w, l, 0}, {0, l, 0}};      top = {{0, 0, h}, {w, 0, h}, {w, l, h}, {0, l, h}};      front = {{0, 0, 0}, {w, 0, 0}, {w, 0, h}, {0, 0, h}};      leftRoof = {{0, 0, h}, {w/2, 0, m}, {w/2, l, m}, {0, l, h}};      rightRoof = {{w, 0, h}, {w/2, 0, m}, {w/2, l, m}, {w, l, h}};      fig = Graphics3D[{        Transparent, Style[Polygon[{backwall, side1, side2, floor, front, leftRoof,rightRoof}],        Lighting -> {{"Ambient", Green}}]},        Boxed -> False,        RotationAction -> "Clip"]      But in a second step, I want to fill the building with gas, which is also transparent. Why? Because after filling it with the gas, I will put points inside the building. For this purpose, I wrote the following code.               data = RandomReal[60, {10, 3}];     data1 = RandomReal[60, {10, 3}];     redPoints = Graphics3D[{PointSize -> Large, Style[Point[#], Blue]} & /@ data,        Boxed -> False];     bluePoints = Graphics3D[{PointSize -> Large, Style[Point[#], Red]} & /@ data1,        Boxed -> False];     Show[{fig, redPoints, bluePoints}]      After evaluation of the above code, I am getting an image like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/YQY7G.png) Transparent-building-wise and point-placement-wise this is fine; my problem is filling the building with gas. How can get the gas (light gray color) to fill the inside of the entire building. Can anyone help me?
