This query is related to application design the technology that I should consider during migration. The Scenario: I have a C#.net Winform application which communicates with a device. One of the main feature of this application is monitoring cyclic data(rate 200ms) sent from the device to the application. The request to start the cyclic data is sent only once in the beginning and then the application starts receiving data from the device until it sends a stop request. Now this same application needs to be deployed over the web in a intranet. The application is composed of a business logic layer and a communication layer which communicates with the device through UDP ports. I am trying to look at a solution which will allow me to have a single instance of the application on the server so that the device thinks that it is connected as usual and then from the business logic layer I can manage the clients. I want to reuse the code of the business layer and the communication layer as much as possible. Please let me know if webserives/WCF/ etc what i should consider to design the migration. Thanks in advance.
