I own a web application that make use of Twitter Bootstrap 3.   This eases the design of the mobile version since it brings some responsive features.   However, I would like a really native-mobile aspect for the mobile version, but not a native for the Desktop one.   I searched..and I found **this really promising framework** : Ionic It seems that this framework is really **only focused on Mobile application** and doesn't fit with any other kind of framework like Bootstrap (not mentioned in the documentation). Therefore, my questions are:   What should be the strategy to keep a desktop version (not using Ionic but bootstrap 3) and a mobile version using Ionic? Making two distinct UI applications? One that would use Bootstrap and the other Ionic? What about duplications??
