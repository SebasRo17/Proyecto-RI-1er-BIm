I am very new to continuous integration, but I decided to give it a shot. Unfortunately I found there to be huge quantities of different tools, and each one is sizable and seems to be difficult (I am new so of course it intimidates me). What I am looking for however is a tool that can   * run my junit tests   * execute my builds   * create the jars   * deploy specific jars to specific remote servers What are the key steps and approaches to filling these requirements?
