This construction is considered wrong               unless       #..     else       #..     end      This is for the general reason of double-negative confusions. It translates to:               if not        #..     if not not       #..     end      _We all agree this is confusing._ * * * Is there any situation (include semantic) that the `unless..else` construction would be more appropriate?
