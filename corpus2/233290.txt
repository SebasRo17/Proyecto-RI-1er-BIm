I'm looking at developing a simple application in Java for a game which allows a user to keep track of which items they own and how much experience they have obtained while using the item. All of this data is input by the user. What is the idiomatic/standard way to persist the data that is being manipulated (the model)? The immediate possibilities seem to be saving it to a file, serialization, databases, etc, but many of these seem to be overkill for simple text fields that don't seem to necessitate objects. What is the idiomatic/traditional way to handle something like this?
