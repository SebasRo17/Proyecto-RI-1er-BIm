Sometimes in projects we need to spend time on tasks such as:   1. exploring alternate frameworks and tools    2. learning the framework and tools selected for the project   3. setting up the servers and project infrastructure (version control, build environments, databases, etc) If we are using User Stories, where should all this work go? One option is to make them all part of first user story (e.g. make the homepage for application). Another option is to do a spike for these tasks. A third option is to make task part of an Issue/Impediment (e.g. development environment not selected yet) rather than a user Story.
