I am trying to write some exercises in Greek using `CreateWindow`. My problem is with using Greek characters in the option `WindowTitle`. For example, with               CreateWindow[DocumentNotebook[{a}, WindowTitle -> "Ενα"]]       I get a new window with the title, `Ε\\[Nu]\\[Alpha]`, and no one can understand this title. How cam I get the proper glyphs instead of their full names?
