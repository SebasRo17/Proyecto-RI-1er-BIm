Note: this has been fixed in version 9. * * * I want to compute the CDF and inverse CDF of the hyperbolic distribution:               α = 2; β = 3/2;     x = -3;     u = N[CDF[HyperbolicDistribution[α, β, 1, 0], x], 30]      The output of the above code is               5.36058384200167863956651004148*10^-6      A small, but not too small number. Now, since the CDF and inverse CDF are compositional inverses, I expect the output from the following line to be approximately $-3$:               xA = N[InverseCDF[HyperbolicDistribution[α, β, 1, 0], u], 30]      But _Mathematica_ instead returns               -23.0838707895835608942828900958      which is just way off. So, am I doing something wrong here? Or are _Mathematica_ 's `CDF[]` and `InverseCDF[]` functions not to be trusted for this distribution? When the above experiment is repeated with the normal distribution, there are no problems:               x = -12;     u = N[CDF[NormalDistribution[0, 1], x], 30]     xA = N[InverseCDF[NormalDistribution[0, 1], u], 30]      The output is $-12$ as expected.
