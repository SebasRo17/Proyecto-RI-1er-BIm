Recently we had an issue on our site where someone attempted SQL injection via a cookie (we'll call it `lastID`). NOC was in a frenzy and angry about how the cookie as an attack vector could be ignored. They had a developer create a class for managing cookies that will sanitize `lastID` (and eventually other cookies) to check that it is numeric. However, I think that this is wrong. The problem wasn't that `lastID` wasn't numeric, it was that the query that uses it was vulnerable to injection. I'm in charge of the review of the code changes, and I want to bring up the fact that forcing `lastID` to be numeric is not particularly useful and perhaps even undesirable. Is there a term or concept that describes sanitizing at the right time (i.e. sanitizing at query time rather than at cookie retrieval time), or "over- sanitizing" (e.g. forcing `lastID` to be numeric) that I can use to describe what's happening/should happen in my review? The second part of Postel's Law seems to apply here in my mind: > Be ... liberal in what you accept
