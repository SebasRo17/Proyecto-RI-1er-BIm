I have a set of data and several function operating on the same data, that I wish to plot together in a `ListPlot`. I need different `PlotMarkers` for each function to visualise the data. Because the data is quite closely spaced, I specified the number of markers using `Mesh` in the way I found here: Custom Intervals of Markers So I have the following:               a = Table[ii, {ii, 0, 2 \[Pi], 0.01}];     b = Sin[a];     c = Sin[a + \[Pi]/4 ];          ListPlot[       {Transpose[{a, b}],        Transpose[{a, c}]       },      PlotMarkers -> Automatic,      Joined -> True,      Mesh -> 20]      However, the `Mesh` command suddenly makes all markers the same shape and colour, so this is what I get out: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/sa7Yf.png) How can I make sure that the `PlotMarkers`' colour and shape remain unchanged while being able to specify the number of markers in the plot? I'm using Mathematica 9.
