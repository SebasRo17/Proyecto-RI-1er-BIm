I have 9 nonlinear equations and 10 unknowns. It is not possible to obtain a numeric solution but I do get a parametric solution. It is useful in my case because I want to observe how parameters (p1, p2, Y1, Y2, alpha, beta, gamma) effects the unknowns. I will now present you the code and explain the problems below it.               PG = 100;          p1 = 0.8;          p2 = 0.2;          (Y1 = 10 & Y2 = 15 & alpha = 0.5 & gamma = 0.4 & beta = 0.3)          Solve[C1 - 10 + PG/2 + GC1 + GL1 == 0 &&        C2 - 15 + PG/2 + GC2 + GL2 == 0 &&        GL1 - fd (a1) t 10 == 0 &&        GL2 - fd (a2) t 15 == 0 &&        GC1 - (t (1 - fd) 25 - PG) ((p1)/((p1) + (p2))) == 0 &&        GC2 - (t (1 - fd) 25 - PG) ((p2)/((p1) + (p2))) ==  0 &&        (0.3/GL1) - (0.5/C1) - (0.3/GC1) - (0.4/PG) == 0 &&        (0.3/GL2) - (0.5/C2) - (0.3/GC2) - (0.4/PG) == 0 &&        GC1 - 4 GC2 == 0,        {C1, C2, GC1, GC2, GL1, GL2, fd, a1, a2, t}]      I want to perform a simulation on the unknown variables by changing the values of parameters. In the above code parameters take only 1 value (i.e. p1 = 0.8) but keeping other values constant I want to change the values of p1 between 0 and 1 to observe the changes in the unknowns and I want to plot it on the graph. We can call it a sensitivity analysis. If I can learn to change it for p1, I will try myself to change it for the other parameters. I tried to use "RandomReals" (i.e. p1 = RandomReals[1,5] - which creates 5 random variables between 0 and 1) but I think there was a problem of mapping each numbers to p1. So, I need help to do the simulation and plotting the change. I hope everything is clear in my question. Since I am new here and it is my 2nd question please tell me if I need more clarification. Thanks in advance.
