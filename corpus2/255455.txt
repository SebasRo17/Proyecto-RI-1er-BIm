What algorithm can be use for task scheduling based on location? For example there are 100 students and 5 lecturers available. Each lecturer must get same amount of student using location allocation which is allocation of students depends on the nearest place to lecturer. The system must assign automatically students to lecturer depends on shortest distance between student and lecturer.               Student A      Lecturer A      Student B      lecturer B     Student c      Lecturer C      EXAMPLE : Lecturer A can get student c because when compare 3 students address student C is near to lecturer A. I have done some research on algorithms such as ant colony, bee colony, location allocation but what I can learn from that is it doesn't meet my requirement. So looking for some new algo. What type of algorithm can be use to solve this problem?
