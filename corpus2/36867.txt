I have two sorted lists, one list will be called the "fences" and the other the "values" Fences could be: $\\{1, 5, 9, 14\\}$ Values could be $\\{-1, 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15\\}$ I want to partition the values list using the equivalence relation that they are between the same fence values. ($f_i \leq v < f_{i+1})$ With the example above, I would get the partition: $$\\{\\{-1\\}, \\{1,3,4\\}, \\{6\\}, \\{9, 10, 13\\}, \\{14,15\\}\\}$$ This partitioning is quite easy using to implement using a for loop but I can't help but feel there is a better way to do it using some of the inbuilt Mathematica functions. I am not asking anyone to write the algorithm for me but to suggest which functions I should be aware of in order to do this elegantly.
