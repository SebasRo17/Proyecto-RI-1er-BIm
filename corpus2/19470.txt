Consider the following:               fakedata = RandomReal[{4, 9}, {5, 10}];     BarChart[fakedata, BarSpacing -> {0, 0.4},       ChartBaseStyle -> EdgeForm[],       ChartStyle -> {{Magenta, Blue, Red, Orange, Green}, Opacity[#] & /@ Range[0.1, 1, 0.1]}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/lhaDD.png) This is all well and good, but what I really want is the following, but grouped, so that the bars are opaque, the ticks come out how I want them, and the little space in between the groups (from the `BarSpacing` option) shows up:               BarChart[Flatten@fakedata, BarSpacing -> {0, 0.4},       ChartBaseStyle -> EdgeForm[],       ChartStyle ->        Flatten@Outer[Blend[{{0, White}, {0.7, #1}, {1.1, Black}}, #2] &, {Magenta,           Blue, Red, Orange, Green}, Range[0.1, 1, 0.1]]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/dpcx6.png) Unfortunately if I create a "matrix" of colours as the value of the `ChartStyle` option, only the second list is picked up, and I get this:               BarChart[fakedata, BarSpacing -> {0, 0.4},       ChartBaseStyle -> EdgeForm[],       ChartStyle -> Outer[Blend[{{0, White}, {0.7, #1}, {1.1, Black}}, #2] &, {Magenta,          Blue, Red, Orange, Green}, Range[0.1, 1, 0.1]]]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/0bB92.png) How can I style my bars individually like in the second example, when the data are grouped?
