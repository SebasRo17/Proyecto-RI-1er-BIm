I have a matrix where each element represents a pixel. I want to plot the matrix (possibly with `ArrayPlot`). To suppress aliasing in the final graphic (which I will then export as a png), I am currently disabling any axis, caption and so on, and I'm forcing the size of the image to match the dimension of the matrix with `ImageSize`. I get the desired result, but I need to show the axes. Is there a way to do it?
