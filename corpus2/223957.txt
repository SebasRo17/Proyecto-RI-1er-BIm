Just to make sure if I understand this correctly. Is this right that little endian processors read the memory addresses from highest to the lowest address and where as a big endian processors suppose to read them from lowest to the highest address? The confusion came when I thought that is it true that little endian processors read the data itself in the reserve order and not just the memory or anyway both? I have read enough about how the data is laid out in the memory and I just want to know how does the data is interpreted by both kinds of processors?
