Consider the following:               lists = Import["G:/Notebooks/Lists.csv"];          col7 = lists [[All, 7]];          For[i=0,i<101,i++,Print[Count[col7,i]]]      This will get a 100 cells printed out but what I really want to do is capture this output to another variable _as a list_. So far the best way I have figured out is to copy the output, edit the text, and manually paste it back in to a variable. There surely has to be a better way?
