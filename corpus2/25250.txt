I am investigating this answer here about detecting crosses and circles with TextRecognize. I tried to solve this problem here by directly using the builtin command TextRecognize but it does not work as expected: this example should print `xoo x xx x x` in ASCII and not `xoo x 'xx`. Elements are so that empty should return space, x should return `x` or circle should return `o`. ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/O30gf.png) Is TextRecognize bad choice for this task having ASCII gameplay characters such as x, o, # and possibly others? What can explain TextRecognize's malfunctioning? You can see that there is no `'` but it still prints it and it misses some characters.
