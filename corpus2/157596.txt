You can indicate that `XXX` is method name by writing `XXX()`. But in Objective-C, you can not write `XXX()` for `XXX` method. If you write `XXX`, you can't tell if `XXX` is method name or other type of identifier. How can you indicate that `XXX` is method name of Objective-C class? _**EDIT_** Method call of Objective-C is different from other language. in Objective-C, method call is:               [self XXX];      in other language, method call is:               self->XXX();      In other language, for example, we can write in stackoverflow:               XXX() doesn't work      And we can know `XXX` is method thanks to `()`. But in Objective-C, we can't say:               XXX doesn't work      Instead, to make it clear that XXX is method, we have to say:               XXX method doesn't work
