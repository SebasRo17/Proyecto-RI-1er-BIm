I was discussing with a senior developper coding conventions to apply to our projects (mainly Java/JEE projects). I disagreed with one convention he proposed: > Instance variable names should start with "_", local variables with "loc", > and method parameters with "par", so it would be easy to identify a variable > origin and scope. While he put forward arguments for short-term memory and readability, I disagreed on the fact that it rather decreases readability, IDEs like Eclipse format variables differently depending on their type, and this problem would be avoided with a good class and method design. Do you have any opinion, arguments or studies that supports my point (or opposes it)?
