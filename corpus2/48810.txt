I'm trying to evaluate the machine epsilon of my computer (see below). I wrote this:               eps = 1.0;     p = 0;     While[(1.0 + eps) > 1.0, eps = eps/2.0; p += 1];     eps     p     eps*2      and got:               1.42109*10^-14     46     2.84217*10^-14      which is not what I expected (IEEE754). So I did this               EngineeringForm[1.0 + 2 * eps, 20]     EngineeringForm[1.0 + eps, 20]     EngineeringForm[1.0 + (eps/2.0), 20]     EngineeringForm[1.0 + (eps/4.0), 20]     EngineeringForm[1.0 + (eps/16.0), 20]     EngineeringForm[1.0 + (eps/32.0), 20]      and got that:               1.000000000000028     1.000000000000014     1.000000000000007     1.000000000000004     1.000000000000001     1.      which seems to contradict the termination condition of the 'while' loop. So I would like to understand what's going on under Mathematica's hood. I tried to look for some information on Mathematica's internal float representation without success. Any help to explain these results is welcome. I'm sorry if my question is a bit vague.
