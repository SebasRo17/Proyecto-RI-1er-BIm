Suppose I have a Javascript based application written in iUI or Kendo UI. Can it be packaged in such a way they can run locally without a webserver? I have a few web applications, that with some rework and HTML5 LocalStorage, can possibly work offline (in an airplane or subway). My mobile development experience is limited to Blackberry Playbook, which I only did so I can get a free one a few years ago. That platform supports "mobile applications" based on HTML, and an additional out-of-band packaging set of tasks. **Question**   * Are other platforms (iPhone, Android, etc) similar in that I can simply package an iUI based application so that it can run offline or on a webserver?
