I have this Mollweide projection of the Earth circa 600 million years ago (http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~rcb7/370moll.jpg).(1) ![Mollweide projection of the earth](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XkyQI.jpg) I want to map this onto a sphere. My results have big black splotches in the Pacific Ocean and the continents are distorted, because the code I used also mapped the black corners of the image to the sphere. I need to map just the central ellipse. What sort of code should I use? Perhaps I need to first convert the image to an equirectangular projection. (1) Image credit: Ron Blakey, NAU Geology
