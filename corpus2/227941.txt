I just wonder if there exists _better_ (i.e. faster?) way to get the next power of 2 for a given number than the following one (maybe some _better_ sort of "bit-twiddling" hack is possible?) ...               static size_t     npow2(size_t n)     {             n--;             n |= n >> 1;             n |= n >> 2;             n |= n >> 4;             n |= n >> 8;             n |= n >> 16;             return n + 1;     }      Thanks for your ideas.
