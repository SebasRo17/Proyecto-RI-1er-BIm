Let's create an example and do the test:               CreateDocument[{},  InputAliases -> {"[" ->      RowBox[{"\[LeftDoubleBracket]", "\[SelectionPlaceholder]", "\[RightDoubleBracket]"}]}]      ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/WOSBg.png) As you can see this is not what I expected. `SelectionPlacholder` has changed to `Placeholder`. OS: Win7 Can you reproduce the problem? It is not only the case of custom aliases but each built-in behaves the same...
