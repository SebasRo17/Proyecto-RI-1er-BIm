I've been working since I graduated for the past year at a bank as a developer, first starting out maintaining a legacy application, then transitioning into developing new workflows. The work's okay, but my employer doesn't really understand how development works. I am considering taking an opportunity to teach English in a foreign country for a year. By the time I leave I will have been working for two years as a developer. Could taking a year off negatively effect my career in the long run when I come back to try and find employment?
