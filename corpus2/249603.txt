I've uploaded a STL file as an additional file for a product. And it gets downloaded in frontend as shown in screen shot. ![associated files](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pgDsQ.png) When I click on that link for STL Downloader, then that STL file will be downloaded successfully. Tried and tested too many times and it worked like a charm. But I don't want that STL file to be downloaded. I want it to be rendered to a STL viewer which I built. That STL viewer is in another web page. So clicking `Click here to download associated STL file` link should render the STL file to the STL viewer which is in another web page. How can I do it? I don't want users to download STL files because it is the intellectual property of my company. Whole thing should be done in PHP only.
