I am dealing around with C# .Net for almost around a year now. I got lots of experience (I owe most of it to guys at stackoverflow). Now I am thinking to start working with C++ as well. Mainly because I would like to be able write codes resulting in applications that are not .Net dependent so they can be executed in most of environments also having cross- platform in mind. Although I have to confess, writing code in .Net with C# and Visual Studio can not be easier nowadays. Of my other reasons I can name, since I am studying electrical engineering, who knows maybe I later need to write drivers for hardwares! My questions are: 1- Am I right with the idea of learning C++ I mean is it add to my value if say I am going to work as a developer later? 2- What tools will I need to start programming in native C++ that is perhaps compilers and IDE
