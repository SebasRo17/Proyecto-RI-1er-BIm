This question was part of a course on Mathematica written in 1998. > Each of the functions f1, f2, and f3 defined below has a root near x=2. Map > an anonymous function involving FindRoot[] onto the list {f1,f2,f3} to find > all three roots.                f1[x_]= 2x-17Cos[x]         f2[x_]= x^2-3Sin[x]         f3[x_]= 2Sin[x]^2-x         Plot[{f1[x],f2[x],f3[x]},{x,0,5}]      Which produced the output: > Out[242]= 2 x - 17 Cos[x] > > Out[243]= x^2 - 3 Sin[x] > > Out[244]= -x + 2 Sin[x]^2 ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/9GhD2.png) And then proceeds to draw a nice graph, showing that all of these functions have a root between @1.5 and 1.8. I then individually evaluated the roots (near two) for each function so that I would know if the answers to the "mapped" functions were correct. FindRoot[f1, {2}] > Out[287]= {1.40477}               FindRoot[f2, {2}]      > Out[284]= {1.72213}                FindRoot[f3, {2}]      > Out[285]= {1.84908} Here are some of my attempts to answer the question using `Map` and `FindRoot` along with the error messages and output that each produced. (* Note that I attempted about half a dozen other solutions, but did not want to make this post too long*)                Map[FindRoot, {f1, f2, f3}, {1}]      > During evaluation of In[296]:= FindRoot::argmu: FindRoot called with 1 > argument; 2 or more arguments are expected. >> > > During evaluation of In[296]:= FindRoot::argmu: FindRoot called with 1 > argument; 2 or more arguments are expected. >> > > During evaluation of In[296]:= FindRoot::argmu: FindRoot called with 1 > argument; 2 or more arguments are expected. >> > > During evaluation of In[296]:= General::stop: Further output of > FindRoot::argmu will be suppressed during this calculation. >> > > Out[296]= {FindRoot[f1], FindRoot[f2], FindRoot[f3]}                    Map[FindRoot, {[f1, {2}], [f2, {2}], [f3, {2}]}]      > During evaluation of In[303]:= Syntax::sntxf: "{" cannot be followed by > "[f1,{2}],[f2,{2}],[f3,{2}]}". > > During evaluation of In[303]:= Syntax::tsntxi: "[f1,{2}]" is incomplete; > more input is needed. > > During evaluation of In[303]:= Syntax::sntxi: Incomplete expression; more > input is needed .

None of these gave me an idea of how to answer this question. In addition I ran a search of this site(and also looked at each of the threads that were linked when I filled in the subject), the "comp.soft- sys.math.mathematica" site, as well as a general Internet search for "Mapping multiple functions in Mathematica", and didn't find anything that gave me an idea of how to answer the question. I would appreciate someone pointing me in the right direction.
