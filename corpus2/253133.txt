In our organization, we are using various data access/persistence technologies in different projects. The ones used till now are Hibernate, JPA, Spring Data JPA, JDBC, Spring JDBC, MyBatis, and QueryDSL. How do I find out what is the industry usage of these technologies? i.e. which is used more widely than others - or even a pie chart showing the distribution of such technologies. Also curious to know which technologies are being used by major players - like big silicon valley companies, or prominent investment firms. Do you know a way to find this data? Can the firms like Forrester or Gartner would have such a data? Thanks in advance.
