I have a list of pairs of numbers, representing connections between objects in the real world. Each number is the identifier of an object, there are gaps in the range from the smallest number to the largest number.               43,292     22,11     932,11     292,22     etc...      I need to visualise how all of the objects are related. I intended to create a graph representation of that network.
