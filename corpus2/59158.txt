I start with this equation and solve it numerically for $z(x,y)$ in the range $1 < x < 5$ and $1 < y < 5$: $$ \frac{3}{xyz} - 2x - 3y - 5z = 0 $$ Then using the data points of $z$ above, I want to solve for this special condition: $$ x + y + z = 0 $$ Then I want to plot a graph of $y(x)$. Everything must be done numerically.               eqn1 = 3/(x y z) - 2 x - 3 y - 5 z   == 3     ContourPlot3D[Evaluate[eqn1], {x, 1, 5}, {y, 1, 5}, {z, 0, -5}]          fulldomain =        Table[z /. Solve[eqn1, z, Method -> Reduce], {x, 1, 5, 1}, {y, 1, 5,          1}] ;          eqn2 = x + y + z  == 0                special =       Table[y /. Solve[eqn2 /. fulldomain, y, Method -> Reduce], {x, 1, 5,         1}]          ifun = Interpolation[special]     Plot[ifun[x], {x, 1, 5}, Epilog -> Map[Point, special]]
