Seems like an odd question, but I've been questioning this myself for some time now.   I've been told that, if you're working on a open source library/project, you should avoid adding dependencies for other external, open sourced, libraries because that'll make the software, that uses your libraries, become heavier with all the dependencies, inside dependencies, etc... But sometimes I'm a little on the fence about that. Do I really need to reinvent the wheel just to keep my library away from external dependencies?   For example, I'm currently building an `Objective-C` project that will be open sourced on Github and I need to use a `XML` parser to get data from — you guessed it — XML files. Apple's OS X already has a built-in API for `XML` parsing, but I'm not very fond of the way it works, it needs a lot of background processing and workarounds to get the data I really need, so I was thinking about using another `XML` parser to do a much cleaner job in terms of making my life easier, as the developer, but also by making the code a lot more legible for other developers.      What are your thoughts on this? Thank you.
