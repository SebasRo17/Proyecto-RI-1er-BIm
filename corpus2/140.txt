Mathematica produces fantastic-looking graphics, but it can be slow on large data sets. Here is an example for a (random) time series:               rv = RandomVariate[ExponentialDistribution[2], 10^5];      Plotting this takes quite some time:               t = AbsoluteTime[]; ListLinePlot[rv, PlotRange -> All]     AbsoluteTime[] - t (* Put this line into the NEXT cell, and evaluate both cells together*)      The option `PerformanceGoal->"Speed"` has no effect. Turning off antialiasing makes it much faster (but if you increase the data size to 10^6 instead of 10^5, it is still VERY slow. A time series of 10^6 points is quite reasonable in my applications):               t = AbsoluteTime[];      Style[ListLinePlot[rv, PlotRange -> All], Antialiasing -> False]     AbsoluteTime[] - t (* This line in separate cell! *)      Reducing the number of `MaxPlotPoints` makes it much faster, but completely distorts the shape of the data:               t = AbsoluteTime[]; ListLinePlot[rv, PlotRange -> All, MaxPlotPoints -> 1000]     AbsoluteTime[] - t (* This line in separate cell! *)      **Question** : I am interested in tricks to show the data quickly without distorting the shape. I am showing here my own solution, which is quite a bit of a hack, but it works. Are there more elegant solutions? ## Edit: My own answer, previously posted as part of the question, is now an independent answer (see below)
