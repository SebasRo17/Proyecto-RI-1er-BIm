I have problem to obtain three roots of cubic equation                N[Solve[a x^3 + b*x^2 + c*x + d == 0, x], 15]      using analytical procedure http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casus_irreducibilis Discriminant of the system is positive and solutions which I obtained with the formula x1, x2 and x3 and Mathematica Solve are not the same?                a = 1;      b = 0.00100025;      c = 0.100000250125;      d = 0.0000500125;                p = (3 a c - b^2)/(3 a^2);      q = (2 b^3 - 9 a b c + 27 a^2 d)/(27 a^3);           N[q^2/4 + p^3/27]           t1 = \[Psi]1 Power[-(q/2) + Sqrt[q^2/4 + p^3/27], (     3)^-1] + \[Psi]1^2 Power[-(q/2) - Sqrt[q^2/4 + p^3/27], (3)^-1];     t2 = \[Psi]2 Power[-(q/2) + Sqrt[q^2/4 + p^3/27], (     3)^-1] + \[Psi]2^2 Power[-(q/2) - Sqrt[q^2/4 + p^3/27], (3)^-1];     t3 = \[Psi]3 Power[-(q/2) + Sqrt[q^2/4 + p^3/27], (     3)^-1] + \[Psi]3^2 Power[-(q/2) - Sqrt[q^2/4 + p^3/27], (3)^-1];          \[Psi]1 = 1;     \[Psi]2 = -(1/2) + Sqrt[3]/2 I;     \[Psi]3 = -(1/2) - Sqrt[3]/2 I;           x1 = t1 - b/(3 a);      x2 = t2 - b/(3 a);      x3 = t3 - b/(3 a);           N[x1]      N[x2]      N[x3]      N[Solve[a x^3 + b*x^2 + c*x + d == 0, x], 15]      And which formula to use in the case if the discriminant is negative? For example if the equations is in the following form                NSolve[0.5 + 25.1 x + 10. x^2 + x^3==0,x]
