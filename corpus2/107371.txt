I have been reading about different software methodologies. Every method has a design phase to some extent, more or less. I am not clear on what we mean by designing. Does this mean writing your thought process on how you will code the feature? Or it is a way of saying what you have coded or will code. The point where I am most confused is the real world, which is different than putting your thoughts in documents and saying it will work. Since coding details can change, I don't know what's the point of having a design before coding.
