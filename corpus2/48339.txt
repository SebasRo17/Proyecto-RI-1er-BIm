The _Mathematica_ kernel can generally open a notebook and evaluate the functions present in the notebook using `UsingFrontEnd Command`. Example:               UsingFrontEnd[SelectionEvaluateCreateCell[nb];]      However, when I try from Java the following command, no action happens:               m1.evaluate("UsingFrontEnd[SelectionEvaluateCreateCell[nb];]");       Can anyone please explain how I can evaluate expressions in some notebook file through Java. Note: I have tried all options like `NotebookEvaluate`, `SelectionEvaluate`, etc. I have also tried different combinations of `SelectionMove`.
