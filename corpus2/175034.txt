I'm working on a git workflow to implement in a small team. The core ideas in the workflow:   * there is a shared project master that all team members can write to   * all development is done exclusively on feature branches   * feature branches are code reviewed by a team member other than the branch author   * the feature branch is eventually merged into the shared master and the cycle starts again The article explains the steps in this cycle in detail: https://github.com/janosgyerik/git-workflows-book/blob/small-team- workflow/chapter05.md Does this make sense or am I missing something?
