I am trying to change the Head of b (a NeighborhoodGraph) from Graph into List but Apply seems to fail. I start with a list of connected vertices:               a={1\[UndirectedEdge]1,2\[UndirectedEdge]2,1\[UndirectedEdge]3,3\[UndirectedEdge]3,     4\[UndirectedEdge]4,3\[UndirectedEdge]4,5\[UndirectedEdge]5,6\[UndirectedEdge]6,     6\[UndirectedEdge]2,7\[UndirectedEdge]7,8\[UndirectedEdge]5,8\[UndirectedEdge]8,     9\[UndirectedEdge]9,10\[UndirectedEdge]10,10\[UndirectedEdge]4};      I calculate the neighborhood graph of node 3. Its Head is Graph:               b=NeighborhoodGraph[a//Graph,3]     b//Head     (* ==> Graph *)      I use Apply to change the Head to List:               c=Apply[List,b];      However, the Head of c is still Graph:               c//Head     (* ==> Graph *)      My real question is how to access the list of edges in a NeighborhoodGraph.
