Is there a tool that allows to query files based on the following criteria, and change them?   * creation date   * filenames (e.g. filetypeA_YYYYMMDD_data2.blah)   * file content For the example, the workflow could be the following one:   * Get all files created between date x and date y, where the filename contains z and the file itself contains value x under column zzz.   * Update it to be a different value/another column.
