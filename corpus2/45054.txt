The Mathematica function `ImagePartition` can create overlapping sub-images with the pixel offset options `{dw, dh}`:               ImagePartition[image, {w, h}, {dw, dh}]      Meanwhile, the `ImageAssemble` function has no such option documented. Hence my question is: how would one reconstruct an image made up of overlapping patches?   * Is there an "easy" way?    * Or do I need to work through the list of patches one-by-one? **Update:** If I want each overlapping patch to contribute equally to the value of a single pixel in the final image, what would I do? (Sorry, should have been clearer - have changed the title)
