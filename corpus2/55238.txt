One of the major regrets in life is that I didn't do something with my introversion. I didn't manage to get past the first year of college because of that. I have chosen the path where there are no video games and other time sinks, all I have is the internet to quench my thirst of learning the ins and outs of the field of Web Developing/Designing. Though currently, I'm taking a Web Design Associate course at one of the best Computer Arts and this is the last month of the class. Even though I'm still a sapling, I love this field so much. So basically, At school I'm learning web design while at home I'm teaching myself web- developing. First thing first, returning to college seems impossible at the moment because of some financial problems. I'm pretty comfortable with CSS and HTML and I'm into PHP/MySQL at the moment. **Could you please provide me a web-development Curriculum to follow.** And do I need to learn about the theories behind? And I think I'm still young(I'm 18 at the time of writing). **Is it a good thing or bad thing for choosing this path?** I'm glad with my decision but in all honesty, **I'm worrying about my future and employment because I'm an undergrad** , coming from a country where companies are degree b!tches, it saddens me so. Thank you. (My questions are the bold parts. )
