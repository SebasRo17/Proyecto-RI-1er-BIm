I know that there are a number of discussions about the GPL on this site but I just ran in to an interesting case of apparent misuse that I (surprisingly) haven’t seen discussed anywhere. The CFEngine configuration management program is apparently distributed under the GPL (it even appears to be an FSF project) but the original author also distributes an “Enterprise edition” which is blatantly non-free. This appears to be an obvious violation of the GPL. The official response to this question (from the CFEngine FAQ) is: > As copyright holders we are free to license CFEngine under any terms we > choose. The files that belong to both the community edition and enterprise > editions are consequently licensed under both sets of terms. The licensee of > the Enterprise edition is therefore free to choose the terms that are deemed > most desirable. Which, as I understand the issue, is just not true. As copyright holders they are of course free to **change** the license (for future releases), but distributing code with **both** licenses is contradictory at best and illegal at worst. Am I missing something here or does this seem wildly hypocritical?
