It's just nonsense for me personally. I can't see any performance boost by using NoSQL instead of SQL. Maybe SQL over NoSQL, yes but not in that way. I think that if I answer "I have no idea" or something like that it will be bad answer because this doesn't really look like a fake-question, it's a serious question on interview but how should be looking correct answer on this question? Or am I missing something about NoSQL?
