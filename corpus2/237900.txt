Using Python and sqlite3. This simple print loop takes a few seconds to execute. I don't know much about databases, so I'm guessing I'm not using these queries correctly. Surely sqlite should be faster? The entire db has 5k or so rows and just a few columns if that matters.               con = lite.connect('gamelist.db')     with con:         cur = con.cursor()         cur.execute("SELECT * FROM GameList WHERE processed IS NULL LIMIT 4")         for i in range(0, 4):             print cur.fetchone()
