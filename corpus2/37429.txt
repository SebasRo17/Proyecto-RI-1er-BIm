Is it possible to create an interactive plot that has drag-down / across horizontal & vertical guides a la Illustrator / InDesign? I would like to generate something like this: ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/pt5pG.gif) I would ideally like to drag multiple (unlimited?) horizontal and vertical guide lines, which would then stay in the positions that they are left in. In addition (if it is not asking too much!) I would really like the guidelines to 'snap' to integers as well. I have looked at various locator manipulations, with no success. Apologies for not including my _Mathematica_ coding effort, but I don't really know where to start with this one :/
