I'm building an Android app and associated set of web services for uploading/downloading data. I need a basic (no frills) solution for account management (register, login, logout, verify credentials/token). What open source / third party solutions exist for this scenario? I need:   * create a new account db based on a salt   * simple web service to create a new account   * simple web service to authenticate supplied credentials and return some sort of token That's it, I can get by without 'fancy' email activation or password reset for the time being. And then moving beyond simple account management, I will need some sort of 'token' based authentication for a web service. Are there off-the-shelf components for this? Should I just use a 'blank' django or rails app to get this done? Seems crazy for everyone to be doing CREATE TABLE user_accounts ... Thoughts? Thank you.
