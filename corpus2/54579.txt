I'm trying to solve the energy equation and NDSolve is able to solve the problem. Even though the result is acceptable, I have always the warning "boundary and initial conditions are inconsistent". I've been trying a lot of function in order to solve this inconsistence, but I couldn't. The energy equation in cylindrical coordinate is:                (df*cf*(D[tf[x, r, t], t] + mom[r]*D[tf[x, r, t], x])) == ((1/r)*         D[(r*kf*D[tf[x, r, t], r]), r])       The initial condition is: 1) tf[x,r,0]==298 The boundary conditions are:   * 1) tf[0,r,t]==373   * 2) (D[tf[x, r, t], r] /. r -> 0.0000001) == 0 (for r=0 there is a discontinuity due to mom[r], the velocity profile)   * 3) kf*(D[tf[x, r, t], r] /. r -> (r0/1000)) == hi*(335 - 298) (this bc is not respected by Mathematica). Could some one help me? Thank you!
