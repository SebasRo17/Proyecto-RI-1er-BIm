I've been interviewing software engineers lately and I tend to ask harder and hardeer questions until they get something wrong, then switch to another technology track and do the same. When the candidates do get something wrong, I always tell them the right answer...mainly because that's what I would want if I were being interviewed. It sucks to just hear "no that's not right" and nothing else... Yesterday a candidate made a snarky comment when I gave him the correct answer after he answered incorrectly, saying "well I'm not sure I'll ever use that information...". I never speak condescendingly or critically. I just say in a matter of fact tone: "actually, in xyz language, abc is implemented in such a way, not in that way". Is my practice of providing correct answers inappropriate? Should I reconsider this practice?
