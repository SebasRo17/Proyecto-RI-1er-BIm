I have an array that looks like the following:               exampleArray = {{t1,r1},{t2,r2},{t3,r3},{t4,r4},{t5,r5},...};      Where each pair of real numbers $(t_k,r_k)$ represents some "event" (independent of all other events) starting at time $t_k$ and ending at time $r_k$. Provided some time $t_i$ and `exampleArray`, I'd like to quickly return the number of "events" at this time. I'd also like to quickly plot the number of events versus time over some interval. The catch is that `exampleArray` might have a very large number of elements, so we wouldn't want to scan through it multiple times. Is there an elegant way to do this in Mathematica?
