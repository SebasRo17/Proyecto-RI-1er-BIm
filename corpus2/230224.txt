I am an ASP.NET developer. I want to learn ASP.NET MVC. In fact I am learning it. But Now I am confused at a point. How can I connect my database to my application. Using entity framework or linq or ado.net. I have good knowledge about ado.net. But about entity framework I cant say anything. Now my problem is this whichever ebook or website I see every entity framework is used. So is it essential for me to learn first entity framework before ASP.NET MVC or not?
