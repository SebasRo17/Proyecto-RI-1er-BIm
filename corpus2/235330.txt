I wrote code, but I myself many times don't even understand the code i wrote. I heard people using "refactoring method" to help them to understand others' code. I just knew a very little about refactoring. That is using the combined key **Alt Shift R** in eClipse, but it will automatically change all the related code & thus does not make any benefit for understand code. So, what is "the refactoring method" (for understanding code wrote by someone else) that people talk about?
