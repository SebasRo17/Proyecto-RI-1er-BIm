I currently live in Thailand now. I have done phone interviews with few companies in San Francisco and passed all of them. Now the problem is I have onsite interviews with 3 companies, and they are willing to pay for the flights and the hotels. I have no idea what to do right now. I don't want to fly back and forth between Thailand and San Francisco 3 times. I believe I have 2 choices:   1. Lie to the first company that I want to do sight-seeing for some days, and ask them to move the flight back a little bit further.   2. Tell the HR directly that I will have an interview with other companies as well, and ask the first company to pay for the flight to SF and the second company to pay for the flight back to Thailand. (The third company gets a free pass) The flight between Thailand and San Francisco should cost like 1,500 dollars. (round-trip) What should I do?
