Given a directed acyclic graph, I want to remove all the edges $v_i \rightarrow v_j$ if $v_j$ is reachable from $v_i$ by some other path. Given the rich set of graph algorithms in _Mathematica_ , what is the best way to achive this? The background of the problem is this. I have a list of jobs and their dependencies, e.g., $a \rightarrow b$ means job $b$ can start only when job $a$ finishes. A list $\\{a \rightarrow b, b \rightarrow c, a \rightarrow c\\}$ is redundant because $a \rightarrow c$ is implied. I want to reduce the dependencies to a bare minimum.
