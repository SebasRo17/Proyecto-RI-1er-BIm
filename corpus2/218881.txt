A module is a collection of files that together build a feature. A feature could be a login, viewing a User profile etc. A theme would contain template files and assets (img, css etc). The problem is how these will work together, say a module has been created and it does exists different themes, I am not interested in having to make template files specifically for a module, how can this be accomplished in a flexible way of still having a decent look. One way could be to use template inheritance, this way the User would only need to make one template file to have the module customized by the look. Anyother ideas on how this can be done?
