I have coded like this many times, and I've never encountered an issue, but the compiler always warns when it expects a return and there is none. For instance, look at this:               -(NSString *)outputStringForInteger:(NSInteger)int     {         if (int == 0)         {             return @"Number is Zero";         }         else         {             return @"Number is not Zero";         }         //no "failsafe" or other explicit return     }      If the function will never get to the last line, ever, is it important to still have a failsafe option, or do you guys just deal with compiler warnings?
