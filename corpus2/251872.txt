We recently tried to correlate the hours spent on a sprint against the stories assigned to the project (to try and get an idea of velocity and hours per point). However our recording system only allowed us to put time against a project and so included time such as:   * Customer meetings / phone calls   * Scrums   * Development / testing Should all of the time for these be taken into account when trying to determine velocity. Or should only the development / testing time be taken into account that occurred against specific stories. If everything, what should scrums and meetings be against. Should there be a separate story for these, or just recorded against a different metric i.e. project-elaboration vs project-development. If only development do we need a finer grained recording system for recording time spent on a project? **EDIT** : As well as velocity we are also trying to get a better idea of hours per point **EDIT** : I've had a few comments saying this isn't the way to do it (that's great). However no-one in those comments has suggested how we can give a priced quote for the next lot of work if we won't know how long the points took on an hour basis. The customer wants to know how much cost the next lot of work will be. Some additional points to note are: 1\. The team isn't solely dedicated to this project. Some time is spent on other work for some people and this may vary. 2\. The team may vary in size as the project goes with a member coming and going (I guess this effects estimations, but how?)
