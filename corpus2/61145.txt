Say I have 2 controllers, `OrderController` and `StatusController`. `OrderController` has several CRUD actions for Orders and `StatusController` has several actions pertinent to changing the satus of Orders (from created to sent, cancelled, etc). `StatusController` really only has one view where several actions can be performed, but for the sake of usability I've decided to merge the functionality of this one view with the Index action of `OrdersController`. (This is just an adapted example for the question, so bear with me if it sounds silly). Only by copy/pasting the Html in the views from here to there everything works, of course, but... What should I do with the actions on `StatusController`? Should I move them to `OrderController` or Should I let `StatusController` exist even though it has no views? I think it might be better than having `OrderController` have 15 actions, but is this desirable? Is there a recommended good practice/approach in such case?
