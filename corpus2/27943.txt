I'm interested in taking on more contract projects for programming and, although it'd be nice to find clients just in my area, I want to expand my search a bit to other areas where a company may allow me to telecommute. I'm wondering if anyone who has experience with this has noticed that whether a company would be more likely to be open to this based on if they are in a bigger city vs a smaller town. I would think that companies in smaller areas may have trouble finding programmers for some things and therefore would be more willing to outsource but maybe I am wrong. Any info is appreciated, I'm just trying to get an idea as to how to concentrate my efforts with networking with people form different areas, etc.
