I'd like to make a conditioning plot just like coplot in R. Is there a pre- made solution or do I have to make a bunch of plots individually? Edit: This is an example from r screenshots. It is a way of looking at multivariate data. Each individual graph represents the respective bar in the conditioning variable or factor. In this case you see ozone vs solar for different levels of wind and temp. ![Image](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QeehJ.png) Edit2: The R-integration looks interesting. I just found a StackExchange question about returning the plot to an output cell in Mathematica, so that works. I just thought there would be a built in function as these plots seem pretty popular in statistics. In r-code I would just type coplot(a~b|c) to see a vs b for levels of c.
