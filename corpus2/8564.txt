Obviously the size of the project you're working on will be a huge factor in how long you spend writing the design document/specification. But do you go through everything, picking out every tiny detail? Or do you take a more agile approach and start writing the software quite early on and solve the problems as they come to you? I've always found that there's only so far you can go with designing. There will inevitably be some things that are missed, and at that point how well you can adapt to the situation means more than the specification itself. Am I taking the right viewpoint on this? Is it actually an opinion, or is a perfect design spec always the best route to go?
