I am trying to evaluate the following:               Simplify[Meter Nano Re[(a + I b)/(Meter Nano)], Assumptions -> Element[{a, b}, Reals]]      However, Mathematica returns:               Meter*Nano*Re[(a + I*b)/(Meter*Nano)]      And if I try:               Convert[Meter Nano Re[(a + I b)/(Meter Nano)], 1]      I get the error:               Convert::incomp: "Incompatible units in Meter Nano Re[(a+I b)/(Meter Nano)] and 1."      How can I factor out the "Meter Nano" from within Re[] and simplify the above to: `a` One solution: As suggested by rcollyer, use ComplexExpand: ` ComplexExpand[Meter Nano Re[(a + I b)/(Meter Nano)]] ` which gives ` a ` Note: ComplexExpand, as written above, assumes `a` and `b` are `Reals`.
