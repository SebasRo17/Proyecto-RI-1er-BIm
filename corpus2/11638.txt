My issue is how to mix strings with variables, specifically in the context of `PlotLabel`: I can put a string as my plot title, and I can also put a variable as a plot title, but I can't put a string _and_ a variable in my plot title. Example:               testplot[a_] := Plot[a x^2, {x, 0, 3}, PlotLabel -> Style[a,20]]     testplot[1]      ![Test plot](http://i.stack.imgur.com/C5GZY.jpg) But what I really want is the plot label to be "a=1". I've tried:               testplot2[a_] := Plot[a x^2, {x, 0, 3}, PlotLabel -> Text["a="a]     testplot2[1]      ![Test plot 2](http://i.stack.imgur.com/duuey.jpg) Which obviously doesn't work as intended. How to do it? Thanks in advance!
