I interviewed for a Software Engineering role, but unfortuantely wasnt offered the position. The company said there were impressed with me and Inwas close behind the other cadidate and that they wanted me to go in and talk to about another role, Software Engineer in Test. So my question is as per the title really, What is the role of a Software Engineer in Test? What do you envisage the type of work would be involved in a role like this? Would taking a role like this limit me to moving into regular software engineering?
