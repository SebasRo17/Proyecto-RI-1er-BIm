Can someone please explain to me how to detect collision with another image? The tutorial I was watching explained how to detect if a collision occurs between two rectangles but I would like to use two images instead. Please see the code below.               public void paintComponent(Graphics g){      //g.drawImage(yellowBall, xCoor, yCoor, this);     Rectangle r1 = new Rectangle((boardXSize/2), (boardYSize/2),50, 50);     Rectangle r2 = new Rectangle(200, (250),50, 50);     g.setColor(Color.red);     g.fillRect(r1.x, r1.y, r1.width, r1.height);     g.setColor(Color.blue);     g.fillRect(r2.x, r2.y, r2.width, r2.height);          if(r1.intersects(r2)){             System.out.println("Collision Detected");          }     repaint();          }      How can I detect if r1 intersects yellowBall instead of r2? Please keep responses at the beginner level but of course, any assistance is greatly appreciated. Thanks!!
