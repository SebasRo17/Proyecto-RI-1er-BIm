Recently I came upon a community event called GiveCamp. > GiveCamp is a weekend-long event where technology professionals from > designers, developers and database administrators to marketers and web > strategists donate their time to provide solutions for non-profit > organizations. Since its inception in 2007, the GiveCamp program has > provided benefits to over 150 charities, with a value of developer and > designer time exceeding $1,000,000 in services! Coming from a very rural part of the country where there is a huge opportunity for charity events like this, it got me wondering. Are there other large movements like GiveCamp that are out there? GiveCamp is sponsored by Microsoft, so of course most are run through .NET user groups. Are there other flavors of it? Different types? Java/Python/other open source charity movements? If not, how do you give back?
