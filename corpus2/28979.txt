I am a PHP developer with ~3 years experience. I want to get deeper into PHP and really understand more low level constructs/functionality. I have mainly done frontend web dev and a little php cron jobs. I want to learn more about stream contexts, closures, process forking, etc. The book I've found that seems closest to this is Expert PHP and MySQL (Wrox). I also found Pro PHP. I know there has to be more out there but I can't seem to find anything. Suggestions?
