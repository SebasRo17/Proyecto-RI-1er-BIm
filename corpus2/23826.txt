I'm following a guide from The Mathematica Journal that describes how to use Mathematica with the Lego Mindstorms NXT but have some trouble getting started and got stuck with the SerialIO package. I use Mac OSX and I have installed the package to:               /Applications/Mathematica.app/AddOns/ExtraPackages/SerialIO/      The command `Needs["SerialIO`"]` gives me the following error message:               LinkOpen::linke: Could not find MathLink executable.      And trying               SetDirectory[FileNameJoin[{$InstallationDirectory, "AddOns", "ExtraPackages", "SerialIO", $SystemID}]];      Does not help either, it gives:               SetDirectory::cdir: Cannot set current directory to /Applications/Mathematica.app/AddOns/ExtraPackages/SerialIO/MacOSX-x86-64.      There seem to be some problem with the alias/symbolic link in the SerialIO folder. By default they pointed to an absolute directory on the machine that this library was built on:               MacOSX-x86-64 -> /Files/schofield/Packages/SerialIO/Build/Mac/build/Deployment/Package/SerialIO/MacOSX      I tried deleting the alias and creating a symbolic link in the terminal:               # ln -s MacOSX MacOSX-x86-64      Running the `SetDirectory` command again result in... no result, so I guess thats good. The commands seem to have been loaded as when typing _Serial_ it want to autocomplete to `SerialOpen` etc. However, using the command `mybrick = SerialOpen["NXT"]` does not put the NXT in connected mode (<> on NXT display). Does anyone else got it to work?
