I'd like to fill a curve in a `ParametricPlot3D` in the same way as I might with `ListPointPlot3D`; i.e.,               ListPointPlot3D[data, ColorFunction -> "Rainbow", Filling -> Bottom]      I obtained the data numerically, point-by-point, with MATLAB. I have found a parametric expression for $y$ ($y = f(x)$) and I have a function $F(x, y, z)$, but I want to plot $F$ only for the curve $y = f(x)$, i.e., the 3D surface is defined as               Plot3D[x^2 Sin[x] + y^2 Cos[y] - x y, {x, 0, 1}, {y, 0, 1}]      and I want to plot only the specific line of surface which satisfy $y = f(x) = x^2$ using               ParametricPlot3D[{x, x^2, x^2 Sin[x] + y^2 Cos[y] - x y /. y -> x^2}, {x, 0, 1}]      I'd like to add a filling, but I don't know how. When I type `Filling ->`, the _Mathematica_ code editor complains (the text becomes red).
