I have a schema that allows for multiple post types in my Django project (kinda like Tumblr). Users can make Posts of different types. One of those types is a photo, which I'll want the EXIF data for. If I have a super generalized table, does it make sense to create additional columns for the exif data? This would result in a ton of empty columns for every post type that isn't Photo. Alternatively, would it make sense to create a separate model for photos completely and create a foreign key to the Posts model instead?
