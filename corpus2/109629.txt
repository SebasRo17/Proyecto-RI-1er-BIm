What are the typical challenges that arise when converting a single-tenant app into a multitenant app? Security and data isolation strike me as the most significant. What are some others? I'm one of the architects for a fairly significant automation effort, and historically it's just been our company using it. We want to make it possible for others to use it as well. Every time we talk about "making it multitenant", the conversation revolves around keeping users with one tenant away from the data that another tenant owns, and making sure that users with one tenant can't (either intentionally or inadvertently) create impacts in another tenant's environments. What I'm wondering is whether security/data isolation are really the only major concerns here, or whether there are some other major concerns that we're just not thinking about.
