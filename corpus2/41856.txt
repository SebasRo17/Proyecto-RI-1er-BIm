I am trying to plot the magnitude complex function (f) with respect to w. For some reason, Plot is just displaying a set of axes, with no points. Any Idea what's going on here?               z02 = 50*2^.5     z01 = 50     z1 = 100     zin = z02*(zl + \[ImaginaryJ]*z02*tan (w))/(z02 + \[ImaginaryJ]*zl*tan (w))     gamma = (zin - z01)/(zin + z01)     f = abs[gamma]          Plot[abs[gamma], {w, 0, 6.28}]      Thanks!
