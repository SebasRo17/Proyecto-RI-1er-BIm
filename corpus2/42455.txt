I have a huge list with huge sublists of the form               list={{a,b,c,d},{e,f,g,h},{i,j,k,l}}      I am looking for a way to manipulate these sublists based on the positions of the elements. Something like               list/.{j_,k_,l_,m_}->{j-1,k,l,m}      but without having to write the whole pattern. Is there any way to specify such manipulation based on the position of the element? Something like               list/.#[[1]] & -> #[[1]] - 1 &      that would work?
