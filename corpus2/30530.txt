I'd like to be able to process a number of graphics that have edge contours and output a list of $x$, $y$ coordinates to be used for generating a spline in another program, or in Mathematica, to make a SOR, prism, etc. Essentially, given a photo of a turned spindle, output the radius as a function of length. > ![enter image description here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/UhLrU.png) I was working with code from Get x and z coordinate from an image and make a parametric surface. I've got to the point where I can output a graph of the "height" vs length, but I need to get a list of coordinates. I suppose being able to draw a line to measure from in the case of tricky graphics or slanted [eventual] centers of rotation would be a helpful feature.
