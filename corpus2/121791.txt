I have a Compaq nw8440 with a smart card reader that is: > Compatible with ISO 7816 compliant Smart Cards. PC/SC interface support I have been interested in smart cards and wanted to start playing around with them. If I wanted to get in to programming smart cards where can I find resources on how to do it, and would I need any additional hardware other than what my laptop provides (besides the cards to program)?
