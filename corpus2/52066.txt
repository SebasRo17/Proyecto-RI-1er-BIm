Using Mathematica I want to solve an integral over a function that contains both determined and undetermined parts which looks like this:               r[\[Theta], z] = Sqrt[(h/2)^2 - z^2] + g[\[Theta]] - h/2      As you can see the `h/2` and root terms are determined, but `g` remains an undetermined function of $\theta$. Now I take an integral over this function to both z and theta:               V = Integrate[[Integrate[1/2 r[\[Theta], z]^2, {z, -h/2, h/2}], {\[Theta], 0, 2 \[Pi]}]      which results in: $$V= \int_0^{2 \pi } \left(\frac{1}{8} (\pi -4) h^2 g(\theta )+\frac{1}{2} h g(\theta )^2+\frac{1}{48} (10-3 \pi ) h^3\right) \, d\theta$$ As you can see, the last term contains no dependence on $\theta$ and therefore I would like that part of the integral solved. In particular I would like my result to look like this $$V=\frac{1}{24} (10-3 \pi )\pi h^3 + \frac{1}{8} (\pi -4) h^2 \int_0^{2 \pi }g(\theta )\, d\theta+\frac{1}{2} h \int_0^{2 \pi }g(\theta )^2 \, d\theta$$ **Is there some way to force mathematica to solve the parts of the function that are not dependent (or with known dependence) on the variable towards which I integrate?**
