So, before I came to my current place of employment, the windows OutputDebugString function was completely unheard of, everyone was adding debug messages to string lists and saving them to file or doing showmessage popups (not very useful for debugging drawing issues). Now everybody (all 6 of us) is like "What can I say about this OutputDebugString?" and I'm like, "with much power comes much responsibility." I kind of feel as though I've passed a silent but deadly code smell to my colleagues. Ideally we wouldn't have bugs to debug right? Ideally we'd have over 0% code coverage, eh? So as far as petty debugging is concerned (not complete rewriting of a 3 million line Delphi behemoth) what's a better way to use debug running code than just adding OutputDebugString all over?
