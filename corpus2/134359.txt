I've been looking at a few lexers in various higher level langauges (Python, PHP, Javascript among others) and they all seem to use regular expressions in one form or another. While I'm sure regex's are probably the best way to do this, I was wondering if there was any way to achieve basic lexing without regular expressions, maybe some sort of direct string parsing or something. So yeah, is it possible to implement some sort of basic lexing in a higher level language* without using regular expressions in any form? *Higher level languages being things like Perl/PHP/Python/Javascript etc. I'm sure there is a way to do it in C
