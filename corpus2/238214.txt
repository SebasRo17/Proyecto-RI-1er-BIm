I wrote some code about two years ago, which was deployed to the production environment. The code deletes information that is six years old from a system. When it was first deployed there were only 300 records deleted (because only 300 were six years old). Now there are now 10,000 - 10,000 records become six years old tomorrow. I want to retest the code but the project manager is against this (because it takes time - one day). The deletion routine is very complex (the six year rule is only one of the rules but is the main rule). The system has evolved over the last two years. Is it reasonable to set some time for retesting or should I assume that is it worked at the time then it will work now (as the project manager assumes)? Is there an Agile process that describes this sort of testing?
