When `DSolve` tries to solve differential equations, it is sometimes not smart enough to generate conditions according to different possible value of parameters. Consider the following minimal example, $x'=x^2-a$:               DSolve[x'[t] == x[t]^2 - a, x[t], t]      The result is               {{x[t] -> -Sqrt[a] Tanh[Sqrt[a] t - Sqrt[a] C[1]]}}      This would be wrong if $a \leq 0$. (When $a<0$ one may argue that the above result is correct in the sense of complex $\tanh$ function; I did not bother to think about this, but this is definitely not we normally want.) If the problem at hand is `Integrate`, we can use `Assumptions` to explicitly state the range of parameter; but `DSolve` does not provide such an option. So, is there any way to achieve a similar effect? I tried to use `Boole` etc. but failed.
